The National  Commission for Competition (CNC) on Thursday said it had opened a probe into whether Spain's five biggest electricity companies - Endesa, Iberdrola, Hidrocantábrico, Unión Fenosa and E.On - had acted to stifle  competition in the supply of power to end clients by denying rivals access to information on consumers wanting to switch suppliers. The CNC said such practices could hold up the liberalization in the sector. The CNC in April  finedEndesa, Iberdrola, Unión Fenosa, Viesgo and Hidrocantábrico for abuse of dominant position by denying UK power company Centrica information on their clients as required by law.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--A European Commission competition probe into German energy group E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) is nearing its end and could result in a fine, according to a preview of Spiegel magazine over the weekend.

According to the allegations,  E.ON agreed the sales area with French gas provider Gaz de France SA during the construction of a pipeline, the magazine says, adding that the size of a potential fine is still open, but theoretically the E.U.'s  competition watchdog could impose a  fine of up to 10% of E.ON's sales.

TD
"We will take legal action, if needed [going] to the European Court of Justice," Spiegel quotes  E.ON as saying.

E.ON was't immediately available to comment.

(ADPnews) - Jul 1, 2009 - The European  Commission (EC) is expected to impose a drastic  fine on German multi-utility  E.on (FRA:EOAN) on July 8, Handelsblatt reported on Wednesday citing sources in the know.

The fine is expected as a consequence of an antitrust suit against  E.on's subsidiary Ruhrgas. The verdict is to be announced next Wednesday.

TD
There are no doubts among company circles that there will be a  fine, it became clear after the end of the talks with the watchdog. Now, the question is how much its amount will be. According to some estimations, it will stand in the triple-digit million euro range -- up to half a billion of euro (USD 701.1m).

The proceedings trace back to raids at several European utilities ordered by  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in 2006. Then, Kroes came upon documents raising doubts of illegal agreements between  E.on Ruhrgas and French sector giant Gaz de France.

* Kroes cites "serious" misbehaviour
* Final anti-trust decision seen in days

TD
* Lawyers say fine could be substantial, not huge
By Love Liman and Foo Yun Chee

STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, July 1 (Reuters) - EU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes on Wednesday accused German utility  E.ON and Gaz de France of serious misconduct in allegedly carving up gas markets, days before she is expected to rule on the case.
The two companies face possible  fines if found by Kroes to have violated EU anti-cartel rules. The comments were among her clearest public statements on the case since the European
Commission announced charges against the two firms last year.

"It was a misbehaviour. A serious one," Kroes, the EU  Competition Commissioner, said at an EU event in Stockholm, when asked by Reuters about the matter.

The Commission's case against  E.ON and GDF was launched after raids on the two and centres on their jointly-owned MEGAL pipeline from southern Germany to the French-German border.

E.ON said the alleged anti-competitive practices were linked to agreements that expired in 2004 and that the business had been competitive for years. Gas supplier Gaz de France merged with Suez last July to become the GDF Suez group.

Michael Reynolds at law firm Allen & Overy estimated any  fine could amount to around 500 million euros ($703.5 million).

"This is not a Microsoft or Intel case, resulting from many years' investigation, but the  fine could still be substantial," he said of earlier anti-trust cases by the  Commission against U.S. technology companies that resulted in larger  fines.

Other experts said it was not certain the companies would face a substantial  fine as the violation pre-dated Commission efforts to unbundle the energy market.
"There will be a  fine but it remains to be seen whether it will really be huge," said Luc Gyselen at Arnold
& Porter, noting recent  Commission settlements with  E.ON and German energy company RWE .

E.ON last year settled separate EU antitrust charges by agreeing to sell its power grid and some generation plants. RWE agreed to dispose of its gas transmission network to settle another antitrust case. (Writing by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Mark John and David Cowell)

EEX to start intra-day auction on 15 July

German European Energy Exchange (EEX) will launch an intra-day-auction on 15 July, the company said on Wednesday. EEX will hold a five-minute auction on the natural gas spot market for the NCG (EGT) and the GUD (BEB) market areas from 14:30 to 14:35 German time on every exchange trading day. During
this time, the bourse will reduce the minimum lot size to 1MW. According to the exchange, this measure gives trading participants the chance to improve and optimise their procurement and sales portfolio, depending on the market situation.

TD
Earlier this year, the bourse announced that it would introduce an intra-day pricing window in the trading form of an intra-day auction by 1 October 2009 in order to offer a platform on which smaller volumes can be traded.
PGNiG eyes new Gazprom contract

Polish gas incumbent PGNiG expects to sign a delivery contract with Gazprom Export in August to increase flows by 2-3 billion cubic metres (Gm3)/year, the company confirmed to ICIS Heren on Wednesday. PGNiG already has an existing contract with Gazprom to deliver 7Gm3/year.

In May, PGNiG signed a short-term supply deal with the Russian major in order to cover a shortfall caused by RosUkrEnergo failing to fulfil its contract terms. This was for 1.024Gm3 over a five-month period,
ending in September.
PGNiG would not comment on Wednesday as to whether the new deal was a result of the same shortfall. National Grid receives loan to improve network
National Grid received a £360m (€420m) loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Tuesday for the upgrade and extension of its four gas distribution networks.

National Grid will use the funds to replace cast iron pipes with polyethylene ones in order to reduce shrinkage, that is gas consumed within or lost from the system, and for reinforcement works across the network. “This project... not only helps to promote the all-important EU objectives of rational use of energy and environmental protection but is also in line with the strict regulations imposed by the UK regulator,”
the EIB said.
National Grid appeal dismissed

The UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) has refused National Grid permission to appeal against its earlier anti-competition ruling from 29 April.
The CAT said: “There is no other compelling reason for the matter being considered by a higher court.” National Grid was  fined £41.60m (€48.5m) by British regulator Ofgem in February 2009 for breaching
competition law in the domestic gas market, as it had struck a deal with five big energy suppliers to
supply and maintain gas meters. The company then appealed the decision on 29 April and the CAT
lowered the fine to £30m, but dismissed the appeal.

E.ON Ruhrgas could face EU  fines

Germany’s E.ON Ruhrgas could be fined by the European  Commission (EC) for breaking antitrust rules following an investigation over an alleged agreement with France’s GDF SUEZ to keep away from each
Page 10 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
other’s domestic markets, according to reports from German newspapers Der Spiegel and Handelsblatt. The decision could be made public next week, Handelsblatt stated.

In July 2007, the EC launched a formal anti-trust proceeding, suspecting the French and German incumbents of breaching European anti-trust law by splitting markets between each other for Russian gas. E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF have denied the charges. The EU  commission said it could not comment on ongoing anti-trust cases. GDF SUEZ was not available for comment, while  E.ON said it “assumed the EU Commission will soon announce its decision.”
Spain’s Iberdrola to sell regas assets
Spanish power producer Iberdrola will sell stakes in two of the country’s regasification plants to Deutsche
Bank’s RREEF Infrastructure for €200m as part of its divestiture plan to raise €2.5bn this year.

The company will sell a 30% stake in its Saggas plant in Sagunto in southeastern Spain and a 25% stake in the BBG regas facility in the northern port of Bilbao. Iberdrola is set to make a capital gain of €27m from the divestment.

Iberdrola announced its divestment strategy at the beginning of this year, which aims to ensure enough capital to continue with its short-term investment plans.

The European Comission is set to slap German power giant  E.ON with a heavy fine for alleged illegal collaboration with French rival Gaz de France, the business daily Handelsblatt said on Wednesday.

The fine could amount to several hundred million euros, perhaps as much as a half billion (700 million dollars), sources close to the matter were quoted as saying.

TD
That would make it one of the biggest ever levied by the European Union's executive body.

The commission launched an investigation against the two companies in mid 2007 concerning gas delivered via their joint pipeline Megal, which crosses southern Germany from the border with the Czech Republic to the one with France.

E.ON's Ruhrgas subsidiary and Gaz de France (GDF) allegedly agreed on quantities of gas to be transported to their domestic markets, which the  commission says would constitute an illegal marketing arrangement, the report said.

E.ON asserts that it never adhered to such a clause in its deal with GDF, and that it formally abrogated it in 2004.

The commision's decision is to be made public next week, sources told Handelsblatt, and a spokesman for E.ON Ruhrgas said the company expected a decision shortly.
If E.ON is fined, its boss Wulf Bernotat plans to file a complaint, the report said. laf-wai/hd

Germany has one of the world’s most active antitrust programmes. Its legal basis is the Law against Restraint of  Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen—GWB; revised version of 2005, BGBl. I 2005, S. 1954). The GWB prohibits horizontal agreements and controls vertical agreements that restrict competition and abuse a dominant market position. It forbids concerted practices, establishes preventive and retroactive controls for mergers, and bans resale-price maintenance.

TD
In principle, mergers and acquisitions are subject to control by the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) when combined worldwide turnover exceeds €500m and when at least one of the companies involved has German sales of €25m or more. Such deals have to be reported before and registered after the fact (for exceptions, see below). Since March 2009 the Small Companies Relief Act (Drittes Mittelstandsentlastungsgesetz) stipulates that one of the firms involved in the merger must have domestic turnover of at least €5m in order to initiate an investigation. This will significantly reduce the number of investigated cases. Approval is necessary before an investor may acquire more than 50% of a firm’s equity or 25% of the votes. The office evaluates financial resources as well as the market share. However, permission granted by the minister of economics may overrule the decision of the Federal Cartel Office.

Under an amendment that came into force in July 2005, companies no longer have to register permitted cartels (see below) with the Federal Cartel Office. The amendment also gave the office more investigative powers if it suspects a company is abusing its competitive position. Violations of the law can lead to higher fines.

The other important law in this area is the Law against Unfair  Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb, BGBl. I 2004 S. 1414), which was completely revised in 2004. It lifted most limitations on the ability of companies to offer rebates, and they no longer need to confine special sales to certain periods at the end of the winter and summer seasons. The law prohibits misleading advertisements and the exploitation of children’s lack of experience. It also prohibits telephone marketing and unsolicited online advertisements (spam) unless customers agree to receive them (through an opt-in clause). In December
2008 an amendment to the Law against Unfair  Competition came into force that introduced a so-called blacklist of unlawful business practices. These include the following: using false claims of being a
signatory to a certain code of conduct; using price reductions because of closure as bait when no business cessation is intended; or describing a product as “free”, even though other costs are involved.

The law bans agreements between two or more companies if they limit competition. However, small and medium-sized retailers may form purchasing co-operatives that do not hinder competition. Illegal practices under the law include price-fixing; restriction of production, purchasing or sales; allocation of markets, customers or supply sources; boycotts of suppliers or purchasers; and unusual restrictions on licensees. Retailers may take claims of unfair  competition to the civil courts.

The Federal Cartel Office exempts some cartels from these rules. For example, it registers and approves cartels formed for the purpose of rationalisation (either through uniform standards and types or through specialisation agreements) or market or industry restructuring. The exemption agreement must include a planned and gradual downsizing of capacity. Exceptions also apply to small and medium-sized firms as long as they are unlikely to gain market dominance in a particular region or industry and the co-operation improves their competitiveness against larger companies. Since 1999 exemption is no longer given to import or export cartels.

Together with state officials, the Federal Cartel Office is responsible for implementing Germany’s antitrust rules. However, the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court or, since 1973, the economy minister can overrule its decisions. By July 2009, the economy minister had overturned eight decisions in the name of public interest. In the most recent decision, in April 2008, the minister permitted the merger of two hospitals (Universitatsklinik Greifswald and Kreiskrankenhaus Wolgast) after the cartel office had rejected it. The revision of the Law against Unfair  Competition curtails the rights of competitors to sue against a decision of the economy minister.

The Federal Cartel Office introduced a “bonus rule” in 2000 that eliminates  fines for the company (or an individual company manager) that is first to inform the office of participation in an illegal intercompany agreement on price-fixing or market shares and that agrees to provide essential help in the investigation.

The office has handed out stiff penalties for offenders. Present regulations provide for  fines of up to €1m or one-tenth of annual revenues resulting from infringement of the law. In December 2007 the office  fined seven makers of liquid gas and their managing directors a total of €208m for dividing up their clients among themselves; in February 2008 it handed down  fines of €37m to four makers of cosmetic and cleaning agents for exchanging information about their negotiations with retailers and price-fixing. In December 2008 it imposed a  fine of €165m on six roof-tile producers because of price agreements. Between March and November 2008, it also forced several natural-gas suppliers to lower their prices.

The Monopolies Commission (Monopolkommission) publishes semi-annual reports on trends in business concentration. It also enforces rules on merger control and firms in a dominant market position.

German companies are also subject to the jurisdiction of the European  Commission, which has the right to ban crossborder mergers and acquisitions it believes might exploit dominant market positions. The Commission automatically takes responsibility under either of the following circumstances: (1) when the companies involved have a joint turnover exceeding €5bn worldwide and at least two of the companies involved each have a turnover of more than €250m in the EU; or (2) when all the following four conditions are met: a worldwide combined aggregate turnover of all companies involved exceeding €2.5m; an aggregate EU-wide turnover of at least two of the companies involved exceeding €100m; in each of at least three EU member states an aggregate turnover of all companies involved exceeding €100m; and also in each of at least three EU member states an aggregate turnover of at least two of the companies involved exceeding €25m. (Different rules apply to banks and insurance companies.)
Planned mergers of this magnitude must be submitted to the European  Commission’s
Directorate-General for  Competition, regardless of whether the companies in question are headquartered
in the European Union. There is an exception when each of the companies involved achieves more than
two-thirds of its EU-wide turnover in only one member state; the national cartel office is then the
responsible entity. Hence, in February 2008 it cleared the takeover of Reuters (a British financial
information-services provider) by Thomson (its Canadian counterpart), and a month later it allowed Google
(a US search-engine company) to take over DoubleClick (a US advertising firm). Under the terms of the
European Coal and Steel Union, the  Commission also reviews competition issues in the coal and steel
industries.

The European  Commission also prosecutes breaches of the ban on monopolies and cartels, whether by firms headquartered inside or outside the EU. The biggest  fines imposed so far by the EU were against Microsoft (a US software giant) in 2004 (€497m) and again in July 2006 (€280m). It acted again in February 2008 for non-compliance with the 2004 cartel ruling (€899m). In March 2008 the  Commission opened proceedings against Visa Europe (a credit-card firm based in the US) to examine whether the
so-called multilateral interchange fees for crossborder transactions constitute an infringement of the prohibition of restrictive business practices such as price-fixing. It had already found in December 2008 that multilateral interchange fees set by MasterCard violate EU rules on restrictive business practices.

In June 2006 it published new guidelines providing for stiffer  fines. Multiple offenders can now be  fined double the normal  fine. Entering into a cartel could cost a company 15–25% of its turnover with the product in question.

The German electricity market was liberalised in 1999, allowing both corporate and private customers to choose their provider. Gas providers had to open their pipes for competing companies as from May 2003. Large corporate customers have been able to choose their gas provider since January 2004 and private households since April 2006.

The cartel office has been pressing for lower prices and more competition in the gas and electricity markets. It won an important legal victory in June 2006 against E.ON Ruhrgas, a gas provider, annulling long-term contracts that tied regional and local gas companies to Ruhrgas. The European  Commission in December 2006 started investigating the three largest German utilities (RWE,  E.ON and EnBW) for their alleged manipulation of prices. In January 2007 the  Commission concluded a sector inquiry of the

European gas and electricity markets, finding massive distortions in the energy markets; it vowed
follow-up action to improve competition, including the possible unbundling of utilities that operate both
power plants and grids. Both E.ON (in February 2008) and Vattenfall (in July 2008) proposed selling their
electricity grids. Vattenfall is expected to sell its grid by the end of 2009. The two other electricity
providers, RWE and EnBW, announced that they would keep their electricity grid.

PARIS, July 2 (Reuters) - GDF Suez would appeal against any fine imposed by the European Commission on the French power group and German utility E.ON following an competition investigation, GDF Suez's head said on Thursday. "If it was the case we would appeal but let's wait and see calmly," Gerard Mestrallet told reporters on the sidelines of the Europlace business forum in Paris.

On WednesdayEU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes accused GDF Suez and  E.ON of "serious" misconduct in allegedly carving up gas markets linked to their jointly-owned MEGAL pipeline.

TD
Kroes is expected to rule on the case in the next few days.

"For the moment she (Kroes) is making comments a priori on a decision she has not made public yet," Mestrallet said.

The Commission's case against  E.ON and GDF Suez was launched after raids on  E.ON and the then Gaz de France group -- which merged with Suez in 2008 -- concerning their jointly-owned MEGAL pipeline from southern Germany to the French border.

HD         Antitrust begins formal proceedings against 5 power firms

The Spanish National  Competition Commission CNC has opened formal proceedings against five electricity companies for possible anti-competitive behavior in the supplying of power to customers, the authority said on June 25.
The five companies involved are Endesa, Iberdrola, Hidrocantabrico, Union Fenosa and  E.ON, the
CNC said in a statement. All five were  fined by the CNC in April for previous behavior deemed
anti-competitive.

TD
The companies are thought to have temporarily halted third party access to a data source providing information on supplier switching, the CNC said.

The CNC is considering precautionary measures that would force the companies to reestablish access to the database, it added.
The supposed anti-competitive practises could be interfering with the liberalization process of the
Spanish electricity market at a time when  competition issues are "critical," the CNC said.

On July 1, a "landmark" liberalization measure, the tariff of last resort, will come into effect in Spain, said the CNC. This will mean that low consumption clients can choose to be supplied either by one of five designated "last resort" companies chosen by the government, or by an independent seller on the free market.
The five last resort companies are precisely those that are now under investigation.

This latest action comes just two months after the CNC sanctioned the same five companies for abusing their dominant position by denying UK-based Centrica consumer information which they are legally obliged to give.
They were fined a total of around €37 million.

The CNC said that the companies had denied Centrica access to a database with information on electricity consumers, contravening legislation passed during the last decade to facilitate access to information about consumers for independent sellers, the CNC said at the time.

Brussels, 03/07/2009 (Agence Europe) - According to German media reports, the European  Commission is preparing to fine French energy giant GDF Suez and Germany's  E.ON AG for reaching an illegal agreement. The Commission may decide to fine the two gas suppliers up to 10% of their turnover on Wednesday 8 July 2009, according to reports in Germany's business paper Handelsblatt. The European Commission opened an investigation into the two companies in 2007, suspecting them of illegally agreeing on the supplies of gas through the Megal gas pipeline that the two companies run together. The European Commission accuses the two companies of pledging not to sell gas on the other company's national market. (C.D./transl.fl)

The National  Commission for Competition (CNC) on Friday said it had imposed interim measures on Spain's five biggest electricity companies while it investigates whether they had acted to stifle competition.

The CNC opened a fresh probe last month into Endesa, Iberdrola, Hidrocantábrico, Unión Fenosa and E.On to determine whether they had continued to breach anti-trust rules in denying rivals access to information on clients looking to switch suppliers.

TD
The CNC said the companies in question are now obliged to supply that information to rivals and desist from any practices which constitute obstacles to clients shifting their supplier while it continues with its investigation.
Earlier fines

The anti-trust body has a maximum of 18 months to hand down a ruling on its investigation. At the time it opened its probe, it expressed concern that possible anti-trust activities were taking place at a time when Spain was moving toward full liberalization in the sector.
The CNC in April  finedEndesa, Iberdrola, Unión Fenosa, Viesgo and HidroCantábrico by up to

€15 million each for abuse of dominant position into denying UK power company Centrica information on their clients as required by law in order for them to switch suppliers.

(ADPnews) - Jul 7, 2009 - The European  Commission (EC) will impose a cartel  fine on German multi-utility  E.on AG (FRA:EOAN) and its French peer GDF Suez (EPA:GSZ) tomorrow, informed sources reported.

The supervisory authority is investigating an illicit agreement between  E.on's gas subsidiary E.on Ruhrgas and GDF Suez during the construction of the MEGAL pipeline in 1975. According to the EC, the two agreed not to interfere in each other's domestic markets, which violates the European free competition regulations. The investigation began in July 2007.

TD
The size of the  fine is still unknown but is expected to be considerable. The penalties imposed by the Commission can total up to 10% of a company's annual global revenue. As a rule, however, the  fines are not that large.

(ADPnews) - Jul 7, 2009 - The blue-chip DAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed at 4,598.19 on Tuesday, down 1.15% or 53.63 points from the previous close.

In spite of the clearly positive economic data that grabbed the headlines today, investors still acted cautiously in view of the US season of financial reporting that will begin tomorrow. Many investors are insecure because of the deterioration of the US labour market and hope for encouraging signals from the upcoming financial reports, a dealer commented.

TD
Today's trading was temporarily supported by the announcement that German industrial orders in May jumped by 4.4% on a monthly basis, adjusted for seasonal and price fluctuations. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of only 0.5% on the average.

German carmakers Daimler AG (FRA:DAI) and BMW AG (FRA:BMW) also surprised investors nicely, reporting a good development of sales in June.
DAX futures dropped 1.97% to 4,588.5.
In the course of the session, the index hit a high of 4,703.3 and a low of 4,590.69 points.
The winning stock at number one was Deutsche Bank AG (FRA:DBK), which went up 1.97% to EUR
42.13. Today banking stocks profited from the planned reorganisation of capital calculation which could
help the financial institutions overcome their problems, as wholesale lender LBBW said. Deutsche Bank,
Deutsche Postbank AG (FRA:DPB) and especially Commerzbank AG (FRA:CBK) will benefit strongly,
according to the LBBW analysts.

The second gainer was steel and engineering group ThyssenKrupp AG (FRA:TKA), adding 1.64% to EUR 16.78. Today the company confirmed its intentions to sell its industrial services division. Investors assessed this positively and were further attracted to steel stocks after it became known that the output of the German steel industry increased for the second consecutive time in June.
The number-three gainer was another steel maker, Salzgitter AG (FRA:SZG), rising 1.23% to EUR
59.10.

In the deepest red closed reinsurer Hannover Rueckversicherung AG (Hannover Re) (FRA:HNR1), dropping 3.61% to EUR 25.10.
Loser number two was carmaker Volkswagen AG (VW) (FRA:VOW), declining 3.1% to EUR 218.61. Multi-utility E.on AG (FRA:EOAN) followed, losing 3% to EUR 22.95. According to informed sources, the
European Commission (EC) will impose a cartel  fine on E.on and its French peer GDF Suez
(EPA:GSZ) tomorrow. The supervisors believe that the two agreed not to interfere in each other's
domestic markets in the past, which violates the European free  competition regulations. The penalty is
expected to be considerable.

Chemicals group BASF SE (FRA:BAS) closed the session at EUR 27.55, down 0.18%. Cheuvreux reiterated its "outperform" assessment and share price target of EUR 35 on BASF after the company announced details on the integration of the Swiss sector company it recently acquired, Ciba (SWX:CIBN). The data confirmed the analysts' expectations of synergies. BASF has already reached the bottom of the crisis, Cheuvreux said.
Page 24 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Wholesale and retail group Metro AG (FRA:MEO) closed at EUR 34.25, down 2.25%. Commerzbank confirmed Metro's "add" recommendation and EUR 38.50 share price target after the company's subsidiary Fegro applied for short-time work funds. Metro relies on the same customer base as Fegro,
so the German revenue and earnings of the parent might continue falling like those of the subsidiary, the analysts said.

Chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Bayer AG (FRA:BAY) fell 1.4% to close at EUR 36.54. UniCredit kept its "buy" advice as well as the share price target of EUR 46. The speculated acquisition in the field of veterinary medicine would be a very good opportunity for Bayer, as long as the price is acceptable, the experts commented.

Shares worth EUR 2.046 billion (USD 2.862bn) were traded on Tuesday. The most sought-after stock was Deutsche Bank, making EUR 227.27 million of the trading volume.

(Adds background, comment.)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Energy giants GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) and  E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) will be fined by the European  Commission Wednesday for having agreed not to compete with each other in their national gas markets, according to people familiar with the case.

TD
Although the amount of the  fine is not known, people familiar with the case expect it to be "significant" given both companies' market power.

The commission is entitled to  fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover. In reality it seldom sets the  fines that high, but aspects such as the size of the market affected and severity of the offense influence the final amount.

The commission sent preliminary charges to the companies in June 2008 accusing them of having agreed not to sell natural gas in each other's home markets, in particular when the gas was supplied over the Megal pipeline.

The pipeline, which transports gas from southern Germany to the French-German border, is jointly owned by both companies.

The companies have argued that the  commission's investigation mainly concerns gas-transport agreements signed in 1975 in connection with the construction of the Megal pipeline during the early days of the European natural gas industry, and that those agreements were terminated in 2004.

E.ON, through its subsidiary  E.ON Ruhrgas AG, and Gaz de France, which is now part of GDF Suez, are the leading suppliers of natural gas in Germany and France, and two of the largest players in the European gas industry, according to the  commission.

The commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to comment on a possible deadline in its "ongoing investigation" into the matter.

An E.ON Ruhrgas spokesman said the company was expecting a decision on the case in the "near future".

The commission sent a list of charges to the companies in June 2008 accusing them of having agreed not to sell natural gas in each other's home markets, particularly in relation to gas supplied through the Megal pipeline.

fine imposed by European Union antitrust authorities relating to its cooperation with  E.ON.

HD     European Union finesE.On AG and GDF Suez (EUR)553 million each for natural gas cartel

BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday finedE.On AG and GDF Suez €553 million each for refusing to compete against each other for 30 years.
The fines are the second largest for an illegal cartel and the first time the EU has  fined an energy cartel.

TD
The European  Commission said that Germany's  E.On and France's GDF Suez agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building the MEGAL pipeline from Russia to western Europe.
GDF immediately said it "strongly disputes the European  Commission decision" and would appeal the
fine to the EU courts.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the practice was one of the worst antitrust problems because it deprived German and French customers of choice and price  competition in two of the EU's largest gas markets.
"The Commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines," she said. The market sharing deal only ended in 2005, the EU said.

E.On, with its subsidiary  E.On Ruhrgas, is the largest supplier of natural gas in Germany, while GDF Suez is the biggest seller of gas to French customers.
They jointly own and operate the MEGAL pipeline which transports Russian gas across southern
Germany.

Regulators said the two companies in 1975 "explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the MEGAL in Germany and neither would Ruhrgas in France."
Both companies already dominated the gas market in their home nations, the EU said.

GDF then had a legal monopoly to import natural gas into France which ended in August 2000. Ruhrgas was "de facto protected from  competition" with agreements with other German suppliers that became illegal in April 1998.
The EU executive said the companies were aware that they were breaking antitrust rules ahead of an
August 2000 EU deadline to open up energy markets to new rivals.
It said their contacts after 1999 confirmed that they had an illegal market-sharing agreement and GDF
kept clear of selling the pipeline's gas in Germany until the end of September 2005.

GDF rejected the charges, saying the legal and regulatory climate in past decades "was very different from that of the energy market today."


Page 30 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"GDF Suez reiterates that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany. Currently the group is  E.On's main foreign competitor in the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the Germany energy market," it said in a statement.

Regulators said they were separately testing GDF Suez' offer to settle EU antitrust concerns on gas imports by immediately giving rivals access to gas import storage, pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals in France.
GDF is also promising to reduce grip on long-term gas import capacity to below 50 percent.

The EU said this "could have a major structural impact" in allowing rivals to import more gas and compete in France. This would benefit household and industrial gas customers, it claims.

The EU executive said it would make the deal legally binding if other market players responded in the next two months to say they believed GDF's offer would boost  competition.

The Commission, the European Union’s antitrust watchdog, has imposed the  fine due to a gas transport agreement dating back to 1975.

E.on and GDF said they would take the issue to court, adding that the agreement was of no relevance to market development.

E.on said the firms had never put the accord into practice and had even formally cancelled it in 2004.

"This agreement deprived customers of more price  competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the EU. The  Commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

(ADPnews) - Jul 8, 2009 -  E.on Ruhrgas, subsidiary of German utility  E.on (FRA:EOAN), said
Wednesday it plans to file a complaint against the penalty imposed by the European  Commission (EC).
"The decision and particularly the high  fine are incomprehensible,"  E.on Ruhrgas's CEO Bernhard
Reutersberg said.

TD
The regulator  fined today E.on Ruhrgas and its French counterpart GDF Suez SA (EPA:GSZ) EUR 553 million (USD 769.8m) each for agreeing to steer clear of each other's domestic market.

"The Commission is imagining market arrangements that have never taken place between the companies, also not in the period between 2003 and 2005. Besides, it ignores the economic conditions. The competition on the European gas market has been real for a long time," the CEO said.

The agreement for transportation of natural gas, signed in 1975 during the early days of the European natural gas industry, made in connection with the construction of the MEGAL pipeline, were needed to secure the pipeline investment. They were not relevant to market developments, were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004,  E.on Ruhrgas wrote. Therefore, the companies did not violate the EU-law at any time with these agreements.

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators imposed a combined  fine of more than 1.1 billion euros ($1.54 billion) on German utility  E.ON and GDF Suez on Wednesday for secretly carving up gas markets.

The European  Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog,  fined each company 553 million euros for agreeing in 1975 not to compete with one another on their national gas markets when they jointly built a pipeline to import Russian gas.

"They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalised, and only abandoned it definitely in 2005," the  Commission said in a statement.

"This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  Commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behaviour," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

She said the agreement had deprived customers of price  competition and choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the 27-nation EU.
"The Commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines," she said.

The biggest  Commission fine on a single company was the 1.06-billion-euro penalty imposed on chipmaker Intel Corp in May. Glass maker Saint-Gobain was  fined 896 million euros last year for price fixing.

The biggest cartel  fine was the more than 1.3 bln euros on a group of companies in the European car glass market last November.

The Commission's case against  E.ON and GDF Suez was launched after raids were carried out on the two companies. It focuses on their jointly-owned MEGAL pipeline from southern Germany to the
French-German border.

The MEGAL pipeline is jointly owned and operated by  E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez. It transports gas across southern Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the east and the French-German border to the west.

E.On, the world's biggest utility by sales, had said the alleged anti-competitive practices were linked to agreements that expired in 2004 and that the business had been competitive for many years.

Gas supplier Gaz de France merged with Suez last year to form GDF Suez, Europe's biggest utility by market capitalisation ahead of EDF and  E.ON .

Page 37 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Gerard Mestrallet, the head of GDF Suez, said last week the French power group would appeal against any fine imposed by the Commission.

"If it was the case, we would appeal but let's wait and see calmly," Mestrallet told reporters at a business forum in Paris.
GDF Suez has said the investigation is based on "putative" facts that took place before the opening of
Europe's energy market.

E.ON settled separate EU antitrust charges last year by agreeing to sell its power grid and some generation plants. RWE agreed to dispose of its gas transmission network to settle another antitrust case.

E.ON posted first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 3.1 billion euros. GDF Suez had 5.3 billion euros in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the same period.

By Bate Felix

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - France's GDF Suez has offered to cut its share of French gas import capacity to below 50 percent by 2014 due to EU concerns that it abused its market dominance, the European Commission said on Wednesday.

The Commission, competition watchdog of the 27-nation European Union, said it would test the remedies offered by GDF and had invited interested parties to comment within two months from July 9. It may then make the commitments legally binding.

GDF's share of natural gas entry capacity in France is currently close to two thirds, the French utility said.

A preliminary investigation found GDF Suez had long-term reservations for most of France's gas import capacity, closing off competitors, the EU regulator said.

"Whilst not acknowledging any infringement, GDF Suez proposed to address the  Commission's concerns through a major structural reduction in its long-term reservations of gas import capacity," the Commission said.

"These commitments could have a major structural impact on the possibility for other companies to compete on the French market, to the benefit of domestic and industrial gas consumers," it said.

GDF Suez said in a statement that it would immediately start the handover of significant market capacities at the Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Cavaou tanker terminals and at the Taisnieres and Obergailbach gas entry points in France.

"The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the EU statement.
Kroes said the improved access to infrastructure for GDF's competitors was essential for effective
competition.
"I am talking in particular about access to LNG terminals and pipelines," she told a news conference in
Brussels.

In a separate antitrust case, the  Commission finedGDF Suez and German utility  E.ON 553 million euros ($770 million) each on Wednesday for secretly carving up gas markets. [ID:nL8515198]

By Bate Felix and Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Reuters) - The antitrust watchdog of the European Union cracked down on the dominance of E.ON and GDF-Suez in the gas markets in their home countries as it tries to open former monopolies to competition.

The EU Commission imposed a fine of 553 million euros ($769.7 million) each on Germany's  E.ON and France's GDF Suez, Europe's largest utilities, for agreeing to not compete on respective gas markets in the first antitrust  fine ever slapped on utilities in the EU.

In a separate case GDF Suez agreed to limit the gas it imports into France to less than half by 2014 from two-thirds after the  Commission found the group had reserved most of the country's import capacity for the long term.

"The ruling is a clear signal to utilities that the  Commission is making sure that they give up past monopoly positions," said Alexandros Chatzinerantzis, a lawyer at Linklaters.

"It shows it will crack down with tangible  fines on large players if it finds them to have blocked access to customers."

Since the beginning of the century, the  Commission has been seeking to get more utilities active in regions which used to have only one supplier for decades.

While millions of customers are able to choose between several suppliers, former monopoly providers were able to best exploit their new freedom and become even larger, while prices for households have been rising for years.

The gas agreement between GDF Suez and  E.ON refers to the 600 kilometre MEGAL pipeline which crosses Germany from the Czech Republic to France.

When the companies built the pipeline they -- legally -- agreed to not sell gas in each others markets, but maintained that agreement after 2000 when an EU directive opened markets to  competition, the Commission said.

"This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  Commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behaviour," EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.


Page 45 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The firms denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal at the European Union's Court of First
Instance.

"That's a high  fine considering the fact that it's referring to actions in the past," said Clifford Chance lawyer Peter Rosin.

The Commission would have been able to  fine the companies a maximum of 10 percent of their annual sales, which amounted to more than 80 billion euros for each of them.

FINES PRICED IN

Shares of both companies have already priced in the  fines since news reports starting last week alerted investors, analysts said.

E.ON shares advanced 3.8 percent to 23.69 euros at 1423 GMT while GDF Suez shares were up 0.2 percent to 25.12 euros, compared to an 1.7 percent rise of the DJ Stoxx European utility index.

The fine represents 8.4 percent of GDF Suez' 2008 net income of 6.5 billion euros. The utility has not given a forecast for 2009 net income.
It is also about 10 percent of  E.ON's 2008 adjusted net income and about half of its 2008 net income. The company's forecasts for 2009 -- unchanged adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and 10
percent lower adjusted net income -- may not be affected as the company could adjust its earnings for
the effects from the  fine.

E.ON settled separate EU antitrust charges last year by agreeing to sell its power grid and some generation plants. RWE agreed to dispose of its gas transmission network to settle another antitrust case.

France's energy regulator CRE welcomed GDF Suez' offer to cut its share of long-term gas import capacity to 50 percent, down from two-thirds.

The import capacity GDF Suez is proposing to free up is equivalent to around 60 terawatt hours of gas consumption.

The French utility said it would immediately start the handover of significant market capacities at the Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Cavaou tanker terminals and at the Taisnieres and Obergailbach gas entry points in France.

It is not acknowledging any wrongdoing with its proposal, the  Commission said.

July 8 (Reuters) - The European  Commission on Wednesday imposed a total  fine of 1.1 billion euros on
German utility  E.ON and GDF Suez for secretly carving up gas markets.[ID:nL8710239]

The companies were fined 553 million euros each, signalling the EU's determination to crack down on suspected market manipulation by big utility companies in the energy markets.

TD
The fines were the first for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector.

The biggest  Commission fine on a single company was the 1.06-billion-euro penalty imposed on chipmaker Intel Corp in May. The biggest cartel  fine was the more than 1.3 billion euros imposed on a group of car glass makers last November.

The following is a list of some of the big  fines the Commission has imposed for various antitrust infringements.

EUROPEAN Union regulators have  fined energy transnationals  E.On AG and GDF Suez 553 million euros (£478.23m) each for running a cartel that fleeced consumers for 30 years.

The fines are the second largest for market fixing and the first time that the EU has  fined an energy cartel.

TD
E.On and its subsidiary E.On Ruhrgas is the largest supplier of natural gas in Germany, while GDF Suez is the biggest seller of gas to French customers.

The European  Commission said that the firms agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building the MEGAL pipeline from Russia to western Europe.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes pointed out that the deal "deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the EU."

Ms Kroes went on to say that the  commission had "no alternative but to impose high  fines," noting that the cartel was only wound up in 2005.

GDF bosses immediately said that they "strongly dispute the European  Commission decision" and would appeal against the  fine to the EU courts.

HD       UPDATE: EC to fineGDF Suez, E.ON Eur553 mil each over Megal case

London (Platts)--8Jul2009/634 am EDT/1034 GMT (Adds confirmation from EC)

The European  Commission is to fine French GDF Suez and German  E.ON some Eur553 million ($772 million) each for cooperating to limit competition in each other's gas markets, the EC confirmed in a statement Wednesday.

TD
A decision in the Megal pipeline antitrust case had been widely expected Wednesday morning, and there had been rumors of multi-million euro  fines. Eur553 million is at the top end of expectations.
The EC said that  E.ON predecessor Ruhrgas and GDF Suez predecessor Gaz de France "agreed in
1975, when they decided jointly to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into
Germany and France, not to sell gas transported over this pipeline in each other's home markets."

"They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized and only abandoned it definitely in 2005."
This is the first  fine imposed for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector, and one of the largest
fines ever issued by the EC.

In 2008 the EC  fined glass makers a total Eur1.384 billion over abuse of  competition in the car window market, including a Eur896 million  fine for French glass maker Saint Gobain.

The total Eur1.106 billion  fine to E.ON and GDF Suez is the second biggest sector  fine ever, behind the glass sector fine. And the individual Eur553 million  fines for E.ON and GDF Suez are the joint second largest single company  fines behind that issued last year to Saint Gobain.

The EC started its investigation following surprise inspections carried out in  E.ON and GDF premises in Germany and France in 2006. Formal proceedings were opened in July 2007 and a formal objection issued in June 2008.
COMPANIES KEPT OLD AGREEMENT DESPITE 2000 LIBERALIZATION
The Megal pipeline transports gas across southern Germany from the German-Czech and
German-Austrian borders to the French-German border.

When the companies decided to build it in 1975 they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any Megal gas in Germany and Ruhrgas would not sell any in France.

GDF enjoyed a legal monopoly to import gas into France until August 2000, while German suppliers had non-compete agreements of their own in place until they were made illegal in April 1998.

But the German and French companies maintained the market-sharing agreement even after European gas markets were opened to  competition by EC law in August 2000.

"The companies met on a regular basis at various levels, discussed the implementation of the agreement in the newly liberalized market and monitored each other's actions," the EC said. "The parties' contacts after 1999 confirmed that there was a single and continuous anticompetitive market-sharing agreement
in breach of antitrust law." The agreement remained in effect until September 2005.
Page 50 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The size of the  fines is guided by the level of gas sales made from gas transported through the Megal pipeline, the EC said.
GDF SUEZ TO CONTEST DECISION
GDF Suez said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would contest the decision.

"The group expresses its complete disagreement with the  Commission's conclusion that GDF Suez and E.ON had colluded until 2005 (the supposed violation having now come to an end) to limit  competition on their respective markets," it said.

"The group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today."

"GDF Suez reiterates that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany. Currently, the group is  E.ON's main foreign competitor in the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market."

"Therefore, the group cannot accept the charges that have been made against it and will be filing an appeal of the  Commission's decision with the European Union's Court of First Instance."

London (Platts)--8Jul2009/408 am EDT/808 GMT

The European  Commission is widely expected to issue a decision Wednesday on a  competition case involving possible gas market collaboration between German energy giant  E.ON and French energy giant GDF Suez.

TD
Media reports and analysts expect a result Wednesday.

The case involves a possible deal to limit  competition in each other's markets, dating back decades, and use of their jointly owned Megal gas transport pipeline system.

Megal transports gas across southern Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders on the one side and the French-German border on the other side.

Competition cases can lead to fines of up to 10% of a company's turnover, which could be a very large sum for companies the size of GDF Suez or  E.ON. Group turnover for these companies is of the order of Eur70 billion or more ($98 billion) each.

But according to one London-based analyst Wednesday morning, few expect the total  fine for the two companies will be above Eur1 billion in total. Therefore anything below Eur250 million each could be a good result, but anything over Eur500 million each would be above market expectations.

European Union regulators have imposed a €1.1 billion ($1.54 billion)  fine on German utility company E.ON and France's GDF Suez over a 1975 deal which saw the two divide gas markets up between them.

The EU Commission, which serves as Europe's anti-trust watchdog, said the energy giants had reached an agreement not to compete in one another's gas markets around the time they cooperated to construct the MEGAL gas pipeline.

As a result, the  Commission said in a statement on Wednesday, they would have to pay penalties of
€553 million euros each.

European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who delivered the statement, said  E.ON and GDF Suez had "maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized."

"The decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  Commission will not tolerate any form of anti-competitive behaviour," she said.

But GDF Suez is expected to appeal the  fine. Ahead of the announcement, the head of the French company, Gerard Mestrallet, said the investigation was based upon "putative" facts about things that happened before the liberalization of energy markets.

Both GDF Suez and  E.ON, joint owners of the MEGAL pipeline which imports Russian gas to France and Germany, have claimed that their business practises have been competitive for many years.

HD            WSJ UPDATE: EU FinesE.ON, GDF Suez 1.1 Billion Euros

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union  fined energy giants E.ON AG (EONGY) of Germany and GDF Suez SA of France 1.1 billion euros ($1.53 billion) for agreeing not to compete on sales of natural gas in each other's home markets.

The fine, the second-highest ever assessed in an EU cartel case, reflects the desire of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, to force EU-wide  competition in the energy sector, despite reluctance from some member countries to back vigorous reform.

TD
Each company was fined 553 million euros. Both said they would appeal to an EU court in
Luxembourg.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

The case stems from an agreement in 1975 by GDF and  E.ON to build a pipeline, called Megal, that moves Russian natural gas from the Czech Republic and Austria across Germany and into France. They agreed, in two "secret" letters, not to sell natural gas in each others' market, the  commission said. The  commission said the two companies continued to divvy up the national markets until 2005.
For decades, the provision of natural gas was the domain of national monopolies, but an EU law in
2000 sought to open up Europe's natural gas markets to  competition. The commission has since
been trying to persuade governments to agree to rules forcing the separation of gas transit and sales
businesses, arguing that EU-wide  competition would drive down prices and enhance energy
security. Germany and France have so far blocked these efforts to "unbundle" the gas trade; both
countries have big, incumbent energy companies that retain much influence.

In the past year, Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes forced  E.ON to give up part of its electricity grid and German utility RWE AG (RWEOY) to divest part of its natural gas network to settle antitrust
cases.

Wednesday's  fine "sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behavior," Kroes said. "By agreeing not to compete, these companies effectively eliminated price competition in that sector." She added that the  commission "has no alternative but to impose high fines."

GDF and E.ON responded to the decision harshly. Collusion "never took place between the companies," said Bernhard Reutersberg, chief executive of E.ON's Ruhrgas subsidiary, in a statement. The 1975 agreement was "never implemented," E.ON said. It added that last year it sold
8.7 billion kilowatt-hours worth of natural gas in France.

GDF Suez "expresses its complete disagreement" with the finding that there was collusion, the company said. The period of time covered by the  fine is from when the EU's directive liberalizing the gas trade took effect until 2005, when the EU says the collusion stopped, said Antoine Lenoir, a GDF Suez spokesman.

Page 57 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"There was  competition with E.ON after 2001. We have been supplying German clients since then," said Lenoir. He had no data immediately available to show the extent of GDF Suez's business in Germany.

In recent years, the  commission has sharply raised its fines for cartel behavior; new guidelines base the fine on the revenue in the affected sector and the number of years any collusion persisted, which can lead to huge fines in lucrative industries or for long-running cartels. Last year, it hit participants in an auto-glass cartel with 1.4 billion euros in  fines, the largest to date.

The size of Wednesday's  fine is likely be at issue in the appeal. A key question is how the court will treat the fact that the agreement was made a quarter century before the gas markets were opened to competition.

"The arrangement does go back to a time when GDF was part of the French state," said Suzanne Rab, an antitrust lawyer specializing in energy issues at Hogan & Hartson in London. The case raises a "fundamental question about the legacy of state control."

Also Wednesday, the  commission said GDF Suez had offered to settle a separate antitrust investigation, this one focusing on whether the company was preventing competitors from importing natural gas into France. Under that proposed settlement, GDF Suez would scale back the long-term contracts it has for access to infrastructure, such as pipelines and liquefied natural-gas terminals, needed for imports.
The commission hasn't decided whether to accept the settlement offer.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French utility GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) Wednesday disputed the European Union antitrust regulators' conclusion that it colluded with German peer  E.On AG (EOAN.XE) to limit competition until 2005 and said it will appeal.

The European Commission, the E.U.'s regulatory arm, separately announced it plans to  fineGDF Suez and E.On EUR553 million each.

TD
The case relates to the Megal pipeline, which supplies gas to the French market across Germany from
Russia.

GDF Suez said it "cannot accept the charges that have been made against it," and will be filing an appeal of the  Commission's decision with the European Union's Court of First Instance.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission has fined French and German energy giants GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) and  E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) EUR553 million each for agreeing not to compete with each other in their national gas markets, it said Wednesday.

"Market sharing is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement. "This agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the European Union," she added.

This is the first time the  commission has imposed fines for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector, it said. The overall amount of EUR1.1 billion is the second highest  fine imposed by the commission for a cartel case.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French utility GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) Wednesday disputed the European Union antitrust regulators' conclusion that it colluded with German peer  E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) to limit competition until 2005 and said it will appeal.

TD
The European  Commission, the E.U.'s regulatory arm, said separately it plans to  fineGDF Suez and
E.ON EUR553 million each for agreeing not to compete with each other in their national gas markets.

The commission said E.ON's Ruhrgas unit and Gaz de France, which merged with Suez in 2008, struck a deal in 1975, when they decided to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into Germany and France.

The companies agreed not to sell gas transported over the pipeline in each other's home markets, maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized, and only abandoned it for good in 2005, the  commission said in a statement.

GDF Suez said it "cannot accept the charges that have been made against it," and will be filing an appeal of the  commission's decision with the European Union's Court of First Instance.

GDF Suez expressed its "complete disagreement" with the  commission's conclusion that it colluded with E.ON until 2005.

"The group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time [when Megal was built] was very different from that of the energy market today," GDF Suez added.

"GDF Suez reiterates that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany," the company said, adding that it is "E.ON's main foreign competitor in the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market."

-Both the E.U. decision and the amount of the fineE.ON Ruhrgas must pay is unreasonable.
-The European court is construing market pacts which never took place.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French utility GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) Wednesday said it has proposed a number of commitments to European Union regulators designed to boost  competition in its home natural gas market.

TD
"With these commitments, the group sets ambitious objectives that will make it possible to offer the various operators greater firm, long-term French market natural gas entry capacities," GDF Suez said in a statement.

To this end, GDF Suez units Elengy and GRTgaz will accelerate investments in natural gas transmission and terminal infrastructure, the company said.

GDF Suez's proposed measures are intended to "remedy concerns" that GDF Suez might have infringed E.U. rules on abuse of a dominant market position, the  commission said Wednesday. The commission said it is seeking comments from interested parties on the proposals.

A commission preliminary investigation found that GDF Suez's long-term grip on France's import capacity was limiting access to the country's market by potential competitors.

In a statement Wednesday, GDF Suez announced a schedule for carrying out the commitments it has proposed.

Firstly, the company plans an "immediate handover of significant market capacities" at the liquefied natural gas tanker terminals at Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Cavaou, and also at natural gas entry points into France at Taisnieres and Obergailbach.
Then, from 2014, GDF Suez would fix its share of natural gas entry capacities into France at below
50%, compared with around two-thirds today.

The European  Commission "has received favorably the commitments," GDF Suez said. "Starting today, and over the long term [10 years starting in 2014], these commitments will improve natural gas market competition in France for the benefit of all players, especially French consumers," the company added.
Separately, GDF Suez disputed Wednesday an E.U. conclusion that it colluded with German peer
E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) to limit  competition until 2005, and said it will appeal.

The European  Commission said it plans to  fineGDF Suez and  E.ON EUR553 million each for agreeing not to compete with each other in their national gas markets.
The case involving the  fine for collusion is separate from the dialogue between the  commission and
GDF Suez over its dominant market position.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--French and German energy giants GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) and  E.ON AG (EOAN.XE) face a EUR553 million fine each for agreeing not to compete on each other's national gas markets, the European Commission said Wednesday.

TD
"Market sharing is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. "This agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the European Union," she added.

This is the first time the commission has imposed fines for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector, the commission said. The overall amount of EUR1.1 billion is the second highest  fine imposed by the commission for a cartel case.

Both E.ON and GDF Suez said they would appeal the decision to the European Union's Court of First Instance. E.ON said the fine was "unreasonable" while GDF Suez disputed the facts behind the reasoning.

Germany's Ruhrgas AG, which is now owned by  E.ON, and Gaz de France SA, now part of the GDF Suez group, agreed in 1975 not to sell natural gas transported over their jointly owned Megal pipeline in each other's home markets.

The Megal pipeline transports gas from Russia through southern Germany to the French-German border, and was built in the aftermath of the first oil crisis to bring additional energy to Europe.

Initially, both companies had legal state-granted monopolies in their home markets, but the commission charges them with having continued with the artificial market split after the European gas market was liberalized in 2000, and only abandoned it in 2005.

The companies met on a regular basis to discuss the implementation of the market sharing agreement in the newly liberalized market and monitored each other's actions, the  commission said.

GDF Suez says that the legal context of the time when Megal was built was very different from that of the energy market today, and should be taken into account.

E.ON and GDF Suez are the leading suppliers of natural gas in Germany and France, and two of the largest players in the European gas industry, according to the  commission.

HD           EU is likely to fine GDF, E.ON in competition case

BRUSSELS -- GDF Suez SA of France and Germany's  E.ON AG will likely be  fined by the European Commission Wednesday for agreeing not to compete with each other in their national gas markets, according to people familiar with the case.

Although the amount of the  fine isn't known, people familiar with the case expect it to be "significant" given both companies' market power. The  commission, the European Union's executive branch, is entitled to  fine the companies as much as 10% of their annual global turnover. While it seldom sets the fines that high, aspects such as the size of the market affected and severity of the offense influence the final amount.

TD
The commission sent a list of charges to the companies in June 2008, accusing them of having agreed not to sell natural gas in each other's home markets, particularly gas supplied through the Megal pipeline. The pipeline, which transports gas from southern Germany to the French-German border, is jointly owned by both companies.

The companies have argued that the  commission's investigation mainly concerns gas-transport agreements signed in 1975 in connection with the construction of the Megal pipeline during the early days of the European natural-gas industry, and that those agreements were terminated in 2004.

E.ON, through its subsidiary  E.ON Ruhrgas AG, and Gaz de France, which is now part of GDF Suez, are the leading suppliers of natural gas in Germany and France and two of the largest players in the European gas industry.

An E.ON Ruhrgas spokesman said the company was expecting a decision on the case in the "near future." GDF Suez Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet said last week the company will appeal any  fine imposed by EU antitrust authorities relating to its cooperation with  E.ON.
The commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to comment on the case.

BRUSSELS, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) imposed  fines of 1.106 billion euros (1.537 billion U.S. dollars) on energy giants E.ON of Germany and GDF Suez of France for their
market-sharing deal, the European commission announced Wednesday.

E.ON and its subsidiary E.ON Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez were  fined 553 million euros (769 million dollars) each.

TD
Ruhrgas AG, now  E.ON Ruhrgas, and Gaz de France, now part of GDF Suez, agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets, after they decided to jointly build the MEGAL pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into Germany and France, the  commission said.

The market-sharing agreement was kept after EU gas markets were liberalized, and was not definitely abandoned until 2005, said the  commission.
This is the first time the  commission imposed fines for antitrust infringement in the energy sector. "This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any
form of anti-competitive behavior," said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Market sharing is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement. This agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the EU. The commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines," she said.

E.ON and GDF Suez are the leading suppliers of natural gas in Germany and France respectively and two of the largest players in the EU gas industry.  E.ON had 87 billion euros (120 billion dollars) of worldwide turnover in 2008 while GDF Suez has 68 billion (94 billion dollars).

E.ON acquired control of Ruhrgas in 2003, while Gaz de France merged with Suez in 2008 to become
GDF Suez, after the end of the market-sharing agreement with  E.ON.

The commission started an investigation following surprise inspections carried out in 2006 on the two energy giants in Germany and France. It opened formal proceedings in July 2007.

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behavior as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages. The  commission's decision is seen as binding proof of illegal behavior of the companies concerned.

BRUSSELS -- Energy giants GDF Suez SA and  E.ON AG will likely be  fined by the European Commission Wednesday for agreeing not to compete with each other in their national gas markets, according to people familiar with the case.

Although the amount of the  fine isn't known, people familiar with the case expect it to be "significant" given both companies' market power. The  commission, the European Union's executive branch, is entitled to  fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover. While it seldom sets the  fines that high, aspects such as the size of the market affected and severity of the offense influence the final amount.

TD
The commission sent a list of charges to the companies in June 2008, accusing them of having agreed not to sell natural gas in each other's home markets, particularly gas supplied through the Megal pipeline. The pipeline, which transports gas from southern Germany to the French-German border, is jointly owned by both companies.

The companies have argued that the  commission's investigation mainly concerns gas-transport agreements signed in 1975 in connection with the construction of the Megal pipeline during the early days of the European natural-gas industry, and that those agreements were terminated in 2004.

E.ON, through its subsidiary  E.ON Ruhrgas AG, and Gaz de France, which is now part of GDF Suez, are the leading suppliers of natural gas in Germany and France and two of the largest players in the European gas industry.

An E.ON Ruhrgas spokesman said the company was expecting a decision on the case in the "near future." GDF Suez Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet said last week the company will appeal any  fine imposed by EU antitrust authorities relating to its cooperation with  E.ON.
The commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd declined to comment on the case. Adam Mitchell in Paris contributed to this article.

Brussels, 08/07/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 8 July, the European  Commission imposed fines totalling €1 106 000 000 on  E.ON AG and its subsidiary  E.ON Ruhrgas AG (of Germany) and on GDF Suez SA (of France) for market sharing in breach of EC Treaty rules on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81).  E.ON/E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez are  fined €553 000 000 each. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the Commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behaviour”. GDF immediately explained that it would appeal to the Court of First Instance and affirmed in a press release that it “completely disagreed with the conclusions of the  Commission”.

TD
When Ruhrgas AG (now  E.ON Ruhrgas and part of the  E.ON group) and Gaz de France (GDF Suez SA) decided in 1975 to build the MEGAL pipeline together, they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the MEGAL in Germany and neither would Ruhrgas in France. They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalised, and only abandoned it definitely in 2005.  E.ON (€87 billion worldwide turnover in 2008), through its subsidiary  E.ON Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez (€68 billion worldwide turnover in 2008) are the leading suppliers of natural gas
in Germany and France respectively. The  Commission's decision constitutes the ends the enquiry
(launched with surprise inspections in 2006) and the formal examination procedure began in July 2007.

In a press release, GDF stated, “the legal and regulatory context at the time was very different to that of the energy market today”. Monopolies were tolerated in 1975 but agreements between suppliers became illegal in April 1998. According to the  Commission, the two parties actively maintained their understanding in the full knowledge of its illegality, through meetings and communications at different levels, well after the opening up of the European gas markets in 2000 and up to 2005.

The fines are based on the 2006 Guidelines on  Fines, in force at the time the Statement of Objections was notified in June 2008. Within this limit, the 2006 Guidelines provide that  fines may be based on up to
30% of the company's annual sales on markets affected by the infringement, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement. This still remains subject, however, to Council Regulation
1/2003, which provides that companies may be  fined up to 10% of their total annual turnover. (C.D./trans/rh)

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Consultation about measures proposed by GDF Suez to boost competition in French gas market

Brussels, 08/07/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 8 July, the  Commission invited comments from interested parties on commitments offered by the French energy company GDF Suez to make gas imports to France more competitive. Comments should be presented to the Commission within two months of the publication in the EU Official Journal (as from 9 July). The Commission suspected that GDF Suez might be closing off competitors from access to gas import capacity into France. Whilst not acknowledging any infringement, GDF Suez proposed to address the Commission's concerns and resolve the problem. Should the market test indicate that the proposals remedy the Commission's concerns, the  Commission will accept the proposals and make them legally binding.

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes explained to the press that the problem particularly involved, “access to LNG terminals (liquid natural gas) and pipelines”. The  Commission's investigation demonstrated that GDF has long term reserves throughout most of the gas import capacity in France. The authorities see this as an obstacle to fair  competition because these GDF Suez capacity reserves largely close off access to the French gas market to other potential gas suppliers, even if they are competitive. Under the proposed commitments, GDF Suez would immediately release a large share of its long-term reservations of gas import capacity into France, and would then continue to reduce its share of these reservations to below 50%.

This case is totally separate from the  fines imposed this Wednesday on GDF Suez and its German counterpart  E.ON for an illegal agreement (see other article). (C.D./transl.rh)

E.ON and Gaz de France Suez (GDF), two of Europe's biggest energy suppliers, have been  fined
almost pounds 1bn for acting as a cartel.

The European  Commission handed out penalties of euro553m ( pounds 478m) each after ruling that they had agreed not to compete with each other in their national gas markets.

TD
It is the first anti-trust  fine dealt to players in the energy industry.

The EU's  Competition Commission said that the deal was struck in 1975 after the energy giants had finished building the Megal gas pipeline from Russia.
The companies agreed not to sell gas transported by the pipeline in their respective German and
French markets, which was initially legal under the old energy monopoly regime.

However, E.ON and GDF maintained the secret pact after European gas markets were liberalised in August 2000 and only abandoned it in 2005. It helped them to maintain strong positions when the gas markets were opened to  competition.

The cartel was discovered during an anti-trust investigation, following raids on the offices of the two groups.

"This agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the EU,'' said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. "This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the commission will not tolerate
anti-competitive behaviour.''

Both companies pledged to appeal the decision. "The group calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today,'' GDF said.

Both E.ON and GDF Suez will appeal against their €553 million fines for alleged market-sharing in France and Germany. The  fines, imposed by the European Commission on 8 July, relate to alleged breaches of EC Treaty rules on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81). The case goes back to an agreement signed in 1975 for the construction of the MEGAL pipeline across Germany.

The Commission notes that when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France (GDF) decided, in 1975, to build the MEGAL pipeline, they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the MEGAL in Germany. Likewise, Ruhrgas would not sell gas in France. The MEGAL pipeline, jointly owned and operated by E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez, transports Russian gas across the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the French-German border in the West.

TD
The Commission originally sent a statement of objections to  E.ON, E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF back in June 2008. The case against  E.ON and GDF originates in "surprise" inspections at the companies' sites in France and Germany carried out in May 2006. Formal proceedings against the two companies were then opened, in July 2007. The  Commission even had to impose a  fine of €38 million on  E.ON for breach of the  Commission seal during the inspection.

The Commission maintains that the market-sharing agreement continued after European gas markets were liberalised. The two companies only halted the practice definitely in 2005. This is despite GDF's legal monopoly to import natural gas into France ending in August 2000. Likewise, Ruhrgas was protected from  competition in Germany by a system of demarcation agreements' with other German suppliers. Such agreements became illegal in April 1998.
COMPLETE DISAGREEMENT

In a statement, GDF Suez expressed its "complete" disagreement with the  Commission's conclusion that GDF Suez and  E.ON had colluded until 2005 in order to limit  competition on their respective markets. "The group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today," noted the company in its defence. GDF Suez claims that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany.

GDF Suez further notes that it is  E.ON's main foreign competitor on the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market. The company will be filing an appeal against the Commission's decision at the EU's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

E.ON Ruhrgas will also appeal to the ECJ's Court of First Instance. "The  Commission assumes the occurrence of market collusion, which never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005. It also ignores economic parameters.  Competition has long become reality on the European gas market," said  E.ON Ruhrgas CEO Bernhard Reutersberg.

The decision, but "especially" the high  fine, were incomprehensible, according to  E.ON Ruhrgas. The German company claims the agreements concluded during construction of the MEGAL pipeline were needed to secure the pipeline investment.  E.ON adds that they were not relevant to market developments, were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004.  E.ON Ruhrgas further notes that it sold 8.7 billion kWh of gas in France in 2008. "No other major European gas supplier has managed to secure a larger share of the French gas market. There was certainly no market sharing, as claimed by the  Commission," said the company.

Announcing the Commission's decision to the press, on 8 July,  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes hoped these first Commission fines imposed for an anti-trust infringement in the energy sector would send a strong signal to energy incumbents. "Despite the legally binding decision by Europe's governments to open up the gas market to  competition, these companies continued to apply their
market-sharing agreement until September 2005, even after publicly declaring the original agreement null and void' in August 2004," said Kroes.

Brussels has slapped fines totalling more than euros 1.1bn (pounds 1bn) on the German and French energy companies E.ON and Gaz de France Suez over a secret pact to carve up national gas markets between them.

The fines, announced yesterday by Neelie Kroes, European  competition commissioner, are the first to be levied on the energy sector and the second-biggest  fines imposed by the commission. The firms have each been ordered to pay euros 553m. The clandestine deal agreeing not to compete against
each other in their home markets stemmed from 1975 when GDF and Ruhrgas, now a subsidiary of
E.ON, jointly built a pipeline to pump imported Russian gas from Germany to France.

TD
The commission said secret letters exchanged at the time committed the French company not to market gas in Germany and vice versa. "Consumers in two of Europe's largest gas markets paid more, while the companies profited at their expense," said Kroes.

Both companies said they would take the case to court. GDF Suez argued that the business rules when the pipeline was built were "very different from that of the energy market today".
But Kroes made it clear that the  fines related to malpractices only from 1999 to 2005 and not to the
30-year period when both companies allegedly created a gas cartel in Germany and France.

The European energy market was liberalised in 2000 but the illegal practices by the two companies did not end until 2005, the  commission said.

Through Ruhrgas,  E.ON dominates Germany's gas market, while GDF Suez is by far the leading player in France and the world's second-biggest utility company.

PARIS-- The European  Commission said Wednesday that it had  fined the German utility  E.ON and its
French rival, GDF Suez, €553 million each for refusing to compete.

The commission, the European Union's  competition regulator, said an  E.ON unit, Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez had agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building a pipeline from Russia to Western Europe.

TD
''They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized, and only abandoned it definitely in 2005,'' the  commission said. The  fines, totaling the equivalent of more than
$1.53 billion, are the first by the E.U. in the energy sector.
Both GDF Suez and  E.ON said they would file an appeal with the European Union's Court of First
Instance.

E.ON acquired control of Ruhrgas, which then became E.ON Ruhrgas, in 2003. Gaz de France merged with Suez in 2008 to become GDF Suez. The commission authorized that transaction in 2006. The commission started an investigation after inspections carried out in 2006 on  E.ON and Gaz de France in Germany and France. It opened formal proceedings in July 2007 and expressed its objections to the companies in June 2008.
The Megal pipeline, jointly owned and operated by the two companies, transports gas across southern
Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the east and the
French-German border to the west.

The commission said that when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France decided in 1975 to build the pipeline together, they explicitly agreed in letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the pipeline in Germany and neither would Ruhrgas in France. At that time, Gaz de France enjoyed a legal monopoly

PARIS-- The European  Commission said Wednesday that it had  fined the German utility  E.On and its
French rival, GDF Suez, €553 million each for refusing to compete against each other.

The commission, the European Union's  competition regulator, said an  E.On unit, Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez had agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building a pipeline from Russia to Western Europe.

TD
''They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized, and only abandoned it definitely in 2005,'' the  commission said in a statement.

GDF Suez expressed its ''complete disagreement'' with the  commission's conclusions and said in a statement that it would contest the decision. An  E.On spokeswoman said the company would comment later Wednesday.
The fines, totaling more than $1.53 billion, are the first by the E.U. against an energy cartel.

E.On acquired control of Ruhrgas, which then became E.On Ruhrgas, in 2003. Gaz de France merged with Suez in 2008 to become GDF Suez. The commission authorized that transaction in 2006.

The commission started an investigation after inspections carried out in 2006 on  E.On and Gaz de France in Germany and France. It opened formal proceedings in July 2007 and expressed its objections to the companies last June.
The Megal pipeline, jointly owned and operated by the two companies, transports gas across southern
Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the east and the
French-German border to the west.

The commission said that when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France decided in 1975 to build the pipeline together, they explicitly agreed in letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the pipeline in Germany and neither would Ruhrgas in France.

At that time, Gaz de France enjoyed a legal monopoly to import natural gas into France, which was removed only in August 2000.
Ruhrgas's supply area in Germany was protected from  competition by a system of so-called
''demarcation agreements'' with other German suppliers until such agreements became illegal in April
1998, the  commission added.
''Both parties maintained their market-sharing agreement even after European gas markets were
opened to competition as from August 2000,'' the  commission said, even though the companies were
aware that the 1975 letters violated  competition law.
Page 83 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
''The parties' contacts after 1999 confirmed that there was a single and continuous anti-competitive market-sharing agreement in breach of antitrust law,'' it added.
In its statement, GDF said it would file an appeal of the decision with the European Union's Court of
First Instance.

''The Group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today,'' it said.
The French company said that it had always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany. The regulator can  fine companies as much as 30 percent of their annual sales in markets affected by an
infringement, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement. In setting the  fines,
the commission said that it had taken into account the sales in France and Germany by the companies
involved of gas transported through the Megal pipeline.

Separately, the  commission said that it would test remedies offered by GDF Suez to address concerns that it might have abused its dominant position in the French gas market.

The commission is concerned in particular that GDF Suez might be closing off competitors from access to gas import capacity into France. It has invited comments from interested parties to be submitted within two months from Thursday.

''The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market,'' Neelie Kroes, the  competition commissioner for the E.U., said in a statement.

HD          World News: EU Slaps $1.53 Billion Fine on Alleged Gas Cartel --- Case Against  French, German
Energy Giants Underlines Effort to Force Open Competition; Trying to 'Unbundle' Trade

BRUSSELS -- The European Union  fined energy giants E.On AG of Germany and GDF Suez SA of France 1.1 billion euros ($1.53 billion) for agreeing not to compete on sales of natural gas in each other's home markets.
The fine -- the second highest ever assessed in an EU cartel case -- reflects the desire of the
European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, to force EU-wide  competition in the energy sector
-- despite reluctance from some member countries.

TD
Each company was fined 553 million euros. Both said they will appeal to an EU court in Luxembourg.

The case stems from an accord in 1975 by GDF and  E.On to build a pipeline, called Megal, that moves Russian natural gas from the Czech Republic and Austria across Germany and into France. They agreed, in two "secret" letters, not to sell natural gas in each others' market, the  commission said. The commission said the companies continued to divvy up the national markets until 2005.
For decades, the provision of natural gas was the domain of national monopolies, but an EU law in
2000 sought to open up Europe's natural-gas markets to  competition. The commission has since
been trying to persuade governments to agree to rules forcing the separation of gas transit and sales
businesses, arguing that EU-wide  competition would drive down prices and enhance energy security.
Germany and France have blocked these efforts to "unbundle" the gas trade; both countries have big,
incumbent energy companies that retain much influence.

In the past year, antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes has forced  E.On to give up part of its electricity grid and German utility RWE AG to divest itself of part of its natural-gas network to settle antitrust cases.

Wednesday's  fine "sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behavior," Mrs. Kroes said. "By agreeing not to compete, these companies effectively eliminated price competition in that sector." She added that the  commission "has no alternative but to impose high fines."

GDF and E.On said the decision was unjust. Collusion "never took place between the companies," said Bernhard Reutersberg, chief executive of  E.On's Ruhrgas subsidiary. The 1975 agreement was "never implemented,"  E.On said. It added that last year it sold 8.7 billion kilowatt-hours of natural gas in
France.

GDF Suez "expresses its complete disagreement" with the finding that there was collusion, the company said. The period of time the  fine covers is from when the EU's directive liberalizing the gas trade took effect until 2005, when the EU says the collusion stopped, said Antoine Lenoir, a GDF Suez spokesman. "There was  competition with E.On after 2001. We have been supplying German clients since then," said Mr. Lenoir.

In recent years, the  commission has sharply raised its fines for cartel behavior; new guidelines base the fine on the revenue in the sector and the number of years any collusion persisted, which can lead

Page 85 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
to huge fines in lucrative industries or for long-running cartels. Last year, the EU hit participants in an auto-glass cartel with 1.4 billion euros in  fines, the largest to date.

The size of Wednesday's  fine is likely to be at issue in the appeal. A key question is how the court will treat the fact that the agreement was made a quarter century before the gas markets were opened to competition.

"The arrangement does go back to a time when GDF was part of the French state," says Suzanne Rab, an antitrust lawyer specializing in energy issues at Hogan &Hartson in London. The case raises a "fundamental question about the legacy of state control."

The commission also said GDF Suez had offered to settle a separate antitrust investigation, this one focusing on whether the company was preventing competitors from importing natural gas into France.

Under that proposed settlement, GDF Suez would scale back the long-term contracts it has for access to infrastructure, such as pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas terminals, needed for imports.
The commission hasn't decided whether to accept the settlement offer.

PARIS -- The European  Commission said Wednesday that it had  fined the German utility  E.On and its French rival, GDF Suez, 553 million euros ($772 million) each for refusing to compete.

The commission, the European Union's  competition regulator, said an  E.On unit, Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez had agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building a pipeline from Russia to Western Europe.

TD
E.On and GDF Suez have long been powerful companies in their home markets, and the heavy  fines were meant to ''send a strong signal to energy incumbents that the commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behavior,'' said Neelie Kroes, the European Union's competition commissioner.

''Consumers in two of Europe's largest gas markets paid more, while the companies profited at their expense,'' said Ms. Kroes, who added that the companies' offense, market sharing, ''is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement.''

The companies operated their market-sharing agreement even after European gas markets were liberalized and abandoned the practice in 2005, according to the  commission.

The fines were the first to be imposed by the union's antitrust officials in the energy sector. They are the second-largest imposed against single companies by the European  Commission in a cartel case. The largest  fine for a single company in a cartel case was 896 million euros, levied on the French manufacturer Saint-Gobain for fixing prices in the auto glass market in 2008.

GDF Suez and  E.On said they would file an appeal with the Court of First Instance, the union's second-highest tribunal after the Court of Justice.

E.On acquired control of Ruhrgas, which then became E.On Ruhrgas, in 2003. Gaz de France merged with Suez in 2008 to become GDF Suez. The commission authorized that transaction in
2006.

The commission began its investigation after inspections carried out in 2006 on  E.On and Gaz de France in Germany and France. It opened formal proceedings in July 2007 and issued charges against the companies in June 2008.

The Megal pipeline, jointly owned and operated by the two companies, transports gas across southern Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the east and the French-German border to the west.

The commission said that when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France decided in 1975 to build the pipeline together, they agreed in letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the pipeline in Germany, nor would Ruhrgas in France. At that time, Gaz de France enjoyed a legal monopoly to import natural gas into France, which expired only in August 2000.

Ruhrgas's supply area in Germany was protected from  competition by a system of so-called demarcation agreements with other German suppliers until such agreements became illegal in April
1998, the  commission said.
Ms. Kroes chastised the companies for continuing ''to apply their market-sharing agreement until
September 2005, even after publicly declaring the original agreement 'null and void' in August 2004.''

GDF expressed its ''complete disagreement'' with the  commission's findings, saying ''the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today.'' The French company added that it had always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany.

E.On Ruhrgas echoed GDF's complaints about the decision.

''The  commission assumes the occurrence of market collusion, which never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005,'' Bernhard Reutersberg, chief executive of E.On Ruhrgas, said in a statement. ''It also ignores economic parameters.  Competition has long become reality on the European gas market.''

The company said its agreements with GDF in connection with the pipeline ''were needed to secure the pipeline investment, were not relevant to market developments, were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004.''
The regulator can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their annual sales.

Separately, the  commission said it would test remedies offered by GDF Suez to address concerns that it might have abused its dominant position in the French gas market.

The commission is concerned in particular that GDF Suez might be closing off competitors from access to gas import capacity into France. It has invited comments to be submitted within two months from Thursday.

''The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market,'' Ms. Kroes said.

France's GDF Suez and Germany's  E.ON have each been fined EUR553mn for breaking EU antitrust rules. In its case against the companies, the European Commission (EC) found that Gaz de France (GdF) and E.ON had in 1975 agreed not to sell natural gas in each others' respective markets when
they approved the construction of the MEGAL gas pipeline. GDF Suez and  E.ON jointly own the MEGAL gas pipeline system, which transports some 22bn cubic metres (bcm) of Russian gas from the Czech Republic via Germany to France. Both companies deny the charges and have said that they will appeal to an EU court in Luxembourg.

TD
The MEGAL pipeline system consists of two pipelines - MEGAL Nord and MEGAL Süd. The MEGAL Nord pipeline comprises two parallel pipelines, which are 459km and 449km long. MEGAL Nord transports gas from east to west and currently requires three compressor stations for its operations. The
167km long MEGAL Süd pipeline has two compressor stations and its gas flow is bi-directional. A 40km connecting pipeline links MEGAL Nord to MEGAL Süd.

The EC started its investigation in 2006 and in July 2007 launched a formal antitrust investigation against the two companies. Under EU law, EC Commissioner Neelie Kroes has the power to  fine groups up to 10% of their global annual turnover if there are formal rulings against them on grounds of antitrust. The EC has been using this authority to crack down on companies' anticompetitive behaviour, but rather than fining companies has been trying to break up energy groups instead, pursuing its preferred policy of ownership unbundling. Its ambitions seem to have worked in two recent cases.
Germany's RWE agreed in October 2008 that it would divest its domestic gas distribution network within two years in order to settle an antitrust case after  E.ON had agreed in February 2008 to settle a
separate antitrust investigation by selling its power grid. The EC has been trying to persuade vertically integrated energy companies to separate their energy transmission networks from supply and generation activities in order to increase  competition, which it believes would encourage more investment in infrastructure and would decrease prices for consumers.

The case against GDF Suez and  E.ON, which Kroes has described as 'one of the worst types of antitrust infringement', is slightly different, however. The agreement between the companies not to sell to each others' markets was made in 1975, long before the opening up of gas markets to  competition. The EC claims, however, that even after the introduction of  competition laws, the companies maintained their agreement until 2005. While E.ON claims that the 1975 agreement was 'never implemented', GDF Suez has said that 'there was competition with E.ON after 2001', according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). While the  fine against the companies is the second highest ever to have been issued in an EU cartel case, it represents less than 1% of  E.ON and GDF Suez's 2008 sales, which amounted to EUR86.8bn and EUR83.1bn respectively.

Ouch. Europe's biggest gas utilities have just been  fined a total of ¤1.1 billion and even for E.ON and GDF Suez, that's a lot of euros. They will appeal and there may be grounds to lower the fine, given that the offence — carving up gas markets with demarcation agreements — began before the EU gas liberalisation directive. But it vindicates the lengthy campaign by Centrica to open up markets in mainland Europe.

And it demonstrates that the Commission's Competition Directorate has not lost its mettle. Over the past year, Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, has been forced to bite her lip while governments propped up failing banks. This  fine sends a message that the  Commission is still in business.

TD
Consumers ought to enjoy the spectacle of these giants being handbagged by Brussels. Their behaviour in response to the  Commission's inquiries became ridiculous. Last year, E.ON was fined
¤38 million for breaching a security seal on an office door during a dawn raid by the Commission.
E.ON first blamed the cleaning lady, then suggested the seal was past its use-by date.
GDF Suez has settled a separate dispute by agreeing to reduce the amount of gas it imports into
France, which the  Commission argued shut out its competitors.

This retreat and  E.ON's earlier agreement to sell off its power grid to appease the  Commission are telling. Add in the current financial weakness of Gazprom and there is now hope that Europe's energy markets might become truly competitive.

IHS Global Insight Perspective
Significance
E.ON and GDF Suez have been fined 553 million euro each by the EC for agreeing not to sell gas in each other's markets via the MEGAL pipeline. Implications                   The first antitrust fine to hit European utilities, the EC could have fined the companies up to 10% of turnover, which
would have run to billions of euro for each of them.
Outlook                        The fine concludes a two-year investigation by the EC. E.ON and GDF Suez have announced they intend to appeal.

Finally, a  Fine

TD
There has been speculation since the start of the year that the EC was on the verge of fining  E.ON and GDF Suez for anti-competitive practices concerning the sale of gas through the MEGAL pipeline. Yesterday the EC announced  fines of 553 million euro per company. When the companies built the pipeline in 1977 they (then legally) agreed not to sell gas in each others markets, but maintained that agreement after 2000 when a European Union (EU) directive opened markets to  competition, the EC said. The firms denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal at the European Union's Court of First Instance.
In a separate case GDF Suez agreed to limit the amount of gas it imports into France to less than half by
2014 from two-thirds currently, after the EC found the group had reserved most of the country's import
capacity for the long term. The EC had been separately investigating GDF Suez since 2005.
History

In 2007 the EC launched a probe into then-GdF (prior to its merger with Suez) and  E.ON's alleged collusion over the marketing of gas transported through the MEGAL pipeline. In May 2008 the EC announced that it was to open formal antitrust proceedings against GdF "for a suspected breach of the EC Treaty's rules on abuse of dominant position [and] restrictive business practices". In June 2008 the EC took the next and most important step in confirming that it had sent a statement of objection to GdF and E.ON concerning alleged collusion. A statement of objection is a formal step in EC antitrust investigations in which the  Commission informs, in writing, the parties concerned of the objections raised against them.

Separately, but running alongside this probe, in 2006 the EC carried out a dawn raid on GdF's headquarters. The probe was focused on unfair market dominance and was part of an ongoing inquiry into violation of  competition rules within the European gas sector, which was in fact launched in 2005. Last year, the EC deepened its two-year probe into anti-competitive practices on the part of GdF by announcing a formal investigation. The import capacity GDF Suez is proposing to free up is equivalent to around 60TWh of gas consumption. The company said it would immediately start the handover of significant market capacities at the Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Cavaou LNG terminals and at the Taisnieres and Obergailbach gas entry points in France.

MEGAL is part of a natural gas transmission system that runs from Russia to France. It connects Waidhaus on the German/Czech border with Medelsheim on the German/French border. The 14.7-bcm/y Germany-France section of the pipeline is currently being expanded by 6 bcm/y.
The EC

Having failed to get its plans for forced unbundling through the European Council, the EC has shown that is prepared to get tough over anti-competitive practices. The fact that this has reached the stage of a  fine either shows how tough the EC can be, or that the companies do not consider themselves to be in the wrong. Other antitrust probes by the EC into utilities have brought about compromise deals—such as E.ON and RWE divesting their respective gas grids—but the intransigence of the companies here is telling.
Outlook and implications

Both companies intend to appeal.  E.ON Ruhrgas CEO Bernhard Reutersberg said: "The decision and particularly the high  fine are incomprehensible. [The]  Commission is imagining market arrangements that have never taken place between the companies, also not in the period between 2003 and 2005. Besides, it ignores the economic conditions. The  competition on the European gas market has been real for a long time."

There may be some argument about exactly how real that  competition is, given the heavy integration of companies such as E.ON that the EC has been seeking to eradicate. This aside, it looks as though if the EC can't get the laws in place to prevent antitrust practices occurring, then it will use the existing laws to impose heavy penalties.

HD             ENERGY GIANT FINED £1/2BN FOR GAS SUPPLY 'FIX' BY             BY SEAN POULTER CONSUMER AFFAIRS EDITOR

ONE of Britain's biggest energy suppliers has been  fined £478million for stitching up gas supplies.

Millions of British families faced higher bills after  E.ON, which is based in Germany, and GDF Suez of France effectively agreed not to compete against each other.

TD
E.ON apparently agreed not to sell gas in France in return for a promise that GDF Suez would not to try to take any of its business in Germany.

The resultant higher prices in Europe translated to bigger bills in Britain because the UK is increasingly reliant on gas imports.

The deal between GDF Suez and  E.ON revolved around the sale of gas through the 500-mile Megal pipeline which crosses Germany from the Czech Republic to France.

When the firms built the pipeline they legally agreed to not sell gas in each other's markets. This was maintained after 2000 when the EU outlawed such arrangements. Now the European  Commission has fined E.ON and GDF Suez £478million each.

There has been mounting concerns that utility giants on the Continent - which have control over gas pipelines and electricity transmission - have exploited their dominance to push up prices and profits.
One result is that it has been impossible for firms such as British Gas to import cheap gas from
Russia.

Alexandros Chatzinerantzis, an expert in  competition law, said: 'The ruling is a clear signal to utilities that Europe is making sure they give up past monopoly positions.'

E.ON, which sponsors the FA Cup, and GDF Suez denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal.

HD          EU Gas Giants to Appeal $1.5 Billion Fine

E.On and GDF Suez both say they will appeal swingeing  fines imposed by the European  Commission after the two European energy giants were found guilty of collusion in the French and German gas markets. They were  fined a total of over €1.1 billion ($1.5 billion), or €553 million each.

The massive fines are the first imposed by the  commission for infringing antitrust laws in the energy sector.

TD
According to Brussels, Germany's  E.On Ruhrgas and the former Gaz de France agreed in 1975, when they jointly decided to build the Megal pipeline -- to import Russian gas into Germany and France -- not to sell the gas in each other's home markets.
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the  fines send a "strong signal to energy
incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any form of anti-competitive behavior. Market sharing
is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement. This agreement deprived customers of more price
competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the European Union. The
commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines." Its statement cited  E.On's worldwide 2008
turnover of €87 billion and GDF Suez's €68 billion global turnover.

Kroes said the  fines were calculated on malpractices between 1999 and 2005, rather than the full 30 years since 1975.

E.On and GDF Suez both said they will appeal to the EU’s Court of First Instance.

"The commission assumes the occurrence of market collusion, which never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005,"  E.On Ruhrgas chief Bernhard Reutersberg said. GDF Suez meanwhile said the "supposed violation" occurred amid a "legal and regulatory context of
the time [that] was very different from that of the energy market today."

The EU's Brussels-based executive launched surprise raids on both companies in 2006, opened formal proceedings in July 2007 and sent a formal statement of objection to them in June 2008 (IOD Jun.13'08,p4). It said  fines might be based on up to 30% of any firm’s annual sales in markets affected by the infringement, multiplied by the number of years over which it occurred.

GDF Suez, which is 35.9% state-owned, says it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany, and is now  E.On’s main foreign-owned competitor in the German gas market. French state-owned giant EDF meanwhile wants to become the largest shareholder, through
part-owned German EnBW, in Germany's third-largest marketer, VNG. German antitrust authorities said this week they will decide by mid-September on the VNG bid (IOD May15,p9).

In contrast to its tough line on GDF Suez's collusion with  E.On, the commission Wednesday welcomed concessions offered by the French firm in another antitrust case.

GDF Suez's LNG terminals and gas network subsidiaries, respectively Elengy and GRTgaz, will accelerate investment and propose an immediate transfer of capacities at the Montoir and Fos Cavaou LNG import terminals in France, as well as at pipeline entry points into eastern France at Taisnieres (from Belgium) and Obergailbach (from Germany).

Page 95 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Starting in 2014, GDF Suez has also committed to cutting its share of gas entry capacities in France to less than 50% from around two-thirds today.

Kroes said: “The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market and so contribute to delivering the benefits of the Single Market." Brussels has invited "market-test" feedback from interested parties, including gas consumers and rival suppliers.

Ouch. Europe's biggest gas utilities have just been  fined a total of ¤1.1 billion and even for E.ON and GDF-Suez, that's a lot of euros. They will appeal and there may be grounds to lower the fine, given that the offence — carving up gas markets with demarcation agreements — began before the EU gas liberalisation directive. But it vindicates the lengthy campaign by Centrica to open up markets in mainland Europe.

And it demonstrates that the Commission's Competition Directorate has not lost its mettle. Over the past year, Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, has been forced to bite her lip while governments propped up failing banks. This  fine sends a message that the  Commission is still in business.

TD
Consumers ought to enjoy the spectacle of these giants being handbagged by Brussels. Their behaviour in response to the  Commission's inquiries became ridiculous. Last year, E.ON was fined
¤38 million for breaching a security seal on an office door during a dawn raid by the Commission.
E.ON first blamed the cleaning lady, then suggested the seal was past its use-by date.
GDF-Suez has settled a separate dispute by agreeing to reduce the amount of gas it imports into
France, which the  Commission argued shut out its competitors.

This retreat and  E.ON's earlier agreement to sell off its power grid to appease the  Commission are telling. Add in the current financial weakness of Gazprom and there is now hope that Europe's energy markets might become truly competitive.

The European  Commission had fined German utility  E.ON AG and its French peer GDF Suez SA EUR
553 million each for a market-sharing deal, which represents a breach of EU  competition rules.

Brussels'  fine was imposed due to a gas supply agreement dating back to 1975. GDF Suez expressed its profound disagreement with the European antitrust watchdog's decision.

HD         Big pharma 'delaying' cheaper drugs:  euros 200m spent on deals to block generics,  says report
Gas firms also under fire, with euros 1.1bn fine for cartel

European patients, taxpayers and national treasuries are being fleeced of billions of euros because of the big pharmaceutical companies' elaborate campaigns to delay the marketing of cheaper generic drugs, the European  commission said yesterday.

"There is something rotten in the state [of the pharmaceutical industry]," said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, unveiling the findings of an 18-month inquiry into the pharmaceuticals sector. "Makers of original medicines are actively trying to delay the entry of generic medicines on to their markets."

TD
Kroes announced a formal investigation of the French company Les Laboratoires Servier for allegedly stifling  competition for the heart disease drug Perindopril and is believed to be on the brink of ordering another three investigations, including one into practices at GlaxoSmithKline.

Action against the pharmaceuticals sector came as Brussels yesterday slapped fines totalling more than euros 1.1bn (pounds 1bn) on the German and French energy companies E.ON and Gaz de France Suez over a secret pact to carve up national gas markets between them.
The fines are the first to be levied on the energy sector and the second-biggest  fines imposed by the
commission. The firms have each been ordered to pay euros 553m.
The clandestine deal agreeing not to compete against each other in their home markets stemmed from
1975 when GDF and Ruhrgas, now a subsidiary of  E.ON, jointly built a pipeline to pump imported
Russian gas from Germany to France.

The commission said secret letters exchanged at the time committed the French company not to market gas in Germany and vice versa. "Consumers in two of Europe's largest gas markets paid more, while the companies profited at their expense," said Kroes.

The investigation of the pharma sector, which included raids last year on several of its biggest players, showed major firms had struck at least 200 settlements with generics manufacturers, costing euros
200m (pounds 173m) and mainly aimed at restricting the marketing of generic drugs. A common practice was for the major companies to file a large number of patent applications across EU states for a single drug, in what are known as "patent clusters". Another tactic saw them sue generics firms and then stall the cases in court for years.

"Vicious tactics are used to delay or prevent the entry of more affordable and innovative medicines into the market," said Monique Goyens, director general of the European Consumers' Organisation. "Millions of euros are spent in promotional activities, in legal disputes and settlement agreements, instead of in the development of new medicines."

The commission estimates that generic drugs are 40% cheaper than their branded equivalents within two years of coming on the market, and that the drugs retail market in the EU is worth euros 214bn a year.

Page 99 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
EFPIA, the trade body representing the major pharma companies in Europe, said it had feared the commission verdict would be worse. "It demonstrated a welcome shift away from the emotive language of the [previous interim] report, with a better balanced, more holistic view of the issues facing the sector. The report failed to substantiate the initial allegation that patenting strategies dampened innovation or delayed generic entry illegitimately."

HD        E.U. fines 2 natural gas giants The levies are the first by competition regulator to hit the energy sector

PARIS-- The European  Commission said Wednesday that it had  fined the German utility  E.ON and its
French rival, GDF Suez, €553 million each for refusing to compete.

The commission, the European Union's  competition regulator, said an  E.ON unit, Ruhrgas, and GDF Suez had agreed in 1975 not to sell imported Russian natural gas to each other's home markets after jointly building a pipeline from Russia to Western Europe.

TD
Both E.ON and GDF Suez have long been powerful companies in their home markets, and the heavy fines were designed to ''send a strong signal to energy incumbents that the commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behavior,'' said Neelie Kroes, the E.U. competition commissioner.

''Consumers in two of Europe's largest gas markets paid more, while the companies profited at their expense,'' said Ms. Kroes, who added that the companies' offense, market sharing, ''is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement.''

The companies operated their market-sharing agreement even after European gas markets were liberalized and only abandoned the practice definitely in 2005, according to the  commission.

The fines, which together add up to more than $1.53 billion, were the first to be imposed by the E.U. antitrust officials in the energy sector. They are the second largest imposed against single companies by the European  Commission in a cartel case. The largest  fine for a single company in a cartel case was
€896 million, levied on the French manufacturer Saint-Gobain for fixing prices in the auto glass market in
2008.

Both GDF Suez and  E.ON said they would file an appeal with the Court of First Instance, the E.U.'s second-highest tribunal after the Court of Justice.

E.ON acquired control of Ruhrgas, which then became E.ON Ruhrgas, in 2003. Gaz de France merged with Suez in 2008 to become GDF Suez. The commission authorized that transaction in 2006.

The commission began its investigation after inspections carried out in 2006 on  E.ON and Gaz de France in Germany and France. It opened formal proceedings in July 2007 and issued charges against the companies in June 2008.
The Megal pipeline, jointly owned and operated by the two companies, transports gas across southern
Germany between the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the east and the
French-German border to the west.

The commission said when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France decided in 1975 to build the pipeline together, they agreed in letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the pipeline in Germany; neither

Page 101 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would Ruhrgas in France. At that time, Gaz de France enjoyed a legal monopoly to import natural gas into France, which only expired in August 2000.

Ruhrgas's supply area in Germany was protected from  competition by a system of so-called demarcation agreements with other German suppliers until such agreements became illegal in April
1998, the  commission said.
Ms. Kroes chastised the companies for continuing ''to apply their market-sharing agreement until
September 2005, even after publicly declaring the original agreement 'null and void' in August 2004.''

GDF expressed its ''complete disagreement'' with the  commission's findings, saying ''the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today.''
The French company added that it had always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in
Germany.

E.ON Ruhrgas echoed GDF's complaints about the decision.

''The  commission assumes the occurrence of market collusion, which never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005,'' Bernhard Reutersberg, chief executive of  E.ON Ruhrgas, said in a statement. ''It also ignores economic parameters.  Competition has long become reality on the European gas market.''

The company said its agreements with GDF in connection with the pipeline ''were needed to secure the pipeline investment, were not relevant to market developments, were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004.''
The regulator can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their annual sales.

Separately, the  commission said it would test remedies offered by GDF Suez to address concerns that it might have abused its dominant position in the French gas market.

The commission is concerned in particular that GDF Suez might be closing off competitors from access to gas import capacity into France. It has invited comments to be submitted within two months from Thursday.

''The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market,'' Ms. Kroes said.

The European  Commission said July 8 it will fine France's GDF Suez and German  E.ON a total of Eur1.106 billion ($1.544 billion) for cooperating to limit  competition in each other's gas markets, though both companies subsequently said they would appeal the decision.
Both companies are being  fined Eur553 million after the EC found them guilty of antitrust violations.

TD
The EC said that  E.ON predecessor Ruhrgas and GDF Suez forerunner Gaz de France agreed in
1975, when deciding to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into Germany
and France, not to sell the gas in each other's home markets.

"They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized and only abandoned it definitely in 2005," the EC said.

This is the first  fine imposed for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector, and one of the largest fines ever issued by the EC. In 2008 the EC  fined glassmakers a total Eur1.384 billion over abuse of competition in the car window market, including a Eur896 million  fine for French glassmaker Saint Gobain.

The total Eur1.106 billion  fine to E.ON and GDF Suez is the second biggest sector  fine ever, behind the glass sector  fine. And the individual Eur553 million  fines for E.ON and GDF Suez are the
second-largest behind that issued last year to Saint Gobain.

The EC started its investigation following surprise inspections carried out in  E.ON and GDF premises in Germany and France in 2006. Formal proceedings were opened in July 2007 and a formal objection issued in June 2008.
The Megal pipeline transports gas across southern Germany from the German-Czech and
German-Austrian borders to the French-German border.

When the companies decided to build it in 1975 they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any Megal gas in Germany and Ruhrgas would not sell any in France.

GDF enjoyed a legal monopoly to import gas into France until August 2000, while German suppliers had non-compete agreements of their own in place until they were made illegal in April 1998.
But the German and French companies maintained the market-sharing agreement even after
European gas markets were opened to  competition by EC law in August 2000.

"The companies met on a regular basis at various levels, discussed the implementation of the agreement in the newly liberalized market and monitored each other's actions," the EC said. "The parties' contacts after 1999 confirmed that there was a single and continuous anticompetitive

market-sharing agreement in breach of antitrust law." The agreement remained in effect until
September 2005.

The size of the  fines is guided by the level of gas sales made from gas transported through the Megal pipeline, the EC said.
Both GDF Suez and  E.ON said they would appeal to the European Court of First Instance against the
fines.

"The group expresses its complete disagreement with the  Commission's conclusion that GDF Suez and E.ON had colluded until 2005 to limit  competition on their respective markets," GDF Suez said. "The group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today."

"GDF Suez reiterates that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany. Currently, the group is  E.ON's main foreign competitor in the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market."

E.ON Ruhrgas said that market collusion "never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005." It said the EC was ignoring the fact that "competition has long become reality on the European gas market."

E.ON said that the agreements put in place back in 1975 had been needed to secure investment in the Megal pipeline, but were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004. "The companies did not contravene EU law at any time,"  E.ON said.

In a separate development, GDF has offered to release reserved import capacity to France in a bid to settle a different antitrust case brought by the EC, EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said July 8.

"The proposed commitments involve GDF Suez immediately releasing a large share of its long-term reservations of gas import capacity into France, and that release would continue until GDF's share is below 50%," Kroes told reporters in Brussels.
"This improved access to infrastructure for GDF's competitors is essential for effective
competition...particularly for LNG terminals and pipelines," she said.

GDF Suez said July 8 it has offered to immediately hand over "significant market capacities at the [LNG terminals] of Montoir-de-Bretagne and Fos Cavaou, as well as gas entries in France at Taisnieres and Obergailbach."

It has also offered to speed up investments to expand France's gas grid infrastructure and LNG terminals through its subsidiaries GRTgaz and Groupe Elengy respectively, in order to be able to offer more long-term entry capacity to competitors.

"We will let more players into existing infrastructure," GDF Suez spokesman Jerome Chembin told Platts. "We are offering to invest in more infrastructure so that by 2014 our reserved share will only be about half of the available capacity—down from two-thirds today."

Making the commitments binding would close the antitrust case without concluding if EU law had been broken or not, thus avoiding potential  fines. But the EC could still  fineGDF Suez up to 10% of its total global turnover if it does not comply with its commitments.

HD         EU Slaps $1.53 Billion Fine on Natural-Gas Cartel; Case of French, German Energy Giants

BRUSSELS -- The European Union  fined energy giants E.On AG of Germany and GDF Suez SA of France €1.1 billion ($1.53 billion) for agreeing not to compete on sales of natural gas in each other's home markets.
The fine -- the second highest ever assessed in an EU cartel case -- reflects the desire of the
European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, to force EU-wide  competition in the energy sector --
despite reluctance from some member countries.

TD
Each company was fined €553 million. Both said they will appeal to an EU court in Luxembourg.

The case stems from an accord in 1975 by GDF and  E.On to build a pipeline, called Megal, that moves Russian natural gas from the Czech Republic and Austria across Germany and into France. They agreed, in two "secret" letters, not to sell natural gas in each others' market, the  commission said. The commission said the companies continued to divvy up the national markets until 2005.
For decades, the provision of natural gas was the domain of national monopolies, but an EU law in
2000 sought to open up Europe's natural-gas markets to  competition. The commission has since
been trying to persuade governments to agree to rules forcing the separation of gas transit and sales
businesses, arguing that EU-wide  competition would drive down prices and enhance energy security.
Germany and France have blocked these efforts to "unbundle" the gas trade; both countries have big,
incumbent energy companies that retain much influence.

In the past year, antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes has forced  E.On to give up part of its electricity grid and German utility RWE AG to divest itself of part of its natural-gas network to settle antitrust cases.

Wednesday's  fine "sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behavior," Mrs. Kroes said. "By agreeing not to compete, these companies effectively eliminated price competition in that sector." She added that the  commission "has no alternative but to impose high fines."

GDF and E.On said the decision was unjust. Collusion "never took place between the companies," said Bernhard Reutersberg, chief executive of  E.On's Ruhrgas subsidiary. The 1975 agreement was "never implemented,"  E.On said. It added that last year it sold 8.7 billion kilowatt-hours of natural gas in
France.

GDF Suez "expresses its complete disagreement" with the finding that there was collusion, the company said. The period of time the  fine covers is from when the EU's directive liberalizing the gas trade took effect until 2005, when the EU says the collusion stopped, said Antoine Lenoir, a GDF Suez spokesman. "There was  competition with E.On after 2001. We have been supplying German clients since then," said Mr. Lenoir.

In recent years, the  commission has sharply raised its fines for cartel behavior; new guidelines base the fine on the revenue in the sector and the number of years any collusion persisted, which can lead to huge fines in lucrative industries or for long-running cartels. Last year, the EU hit participants in an auto-glass cartel with €1.4 billion in  fines, the largest to date.

The size of Wednesday's  fine is likely to be at issue in the appeal. A key question is how the court will treat the fact that the agreement was made a quarter century before the gas markets were opened to competition.

"The arrangement does go back to a time when GDF was part of the French state," says Suzanne Rab, an antitrust lawyer specializing in energy issues at Hogan & Hartson in London. The case raises a "fundamental question about the legacy of state control."

The commission also said GDF Suez had offered to settle a separate antitrust investigation, this one focusing on whether the company was preventing competitors from importing natural gas into France.

Under that proposed settlement, GDF Suez would scale back the long-term contracts it has for access to infrastructure, such as pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas terminals, needed for imports.
The commission hasn't decided whether to accept the settlement offer. Sebastian Moffett in Paris contributed to this article.

HD      Energy Providers GDF and E.ON Ruhrgas to Challenge European Commission's Hefty Fine

IHS Global Insight Perspective
Significance                   On 8 July, the European
Commission issued fairly hefty fines against E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez over their collusion well after the liberalisation of the European gas market. Implications                   The penalties are intended to be a warning shot for other major operators in the single market.
Outlook                        The reaction of E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez, however, raises questions about the Commission's powers.

On Wednesday (8 July), the European  Commission issued hefty  fines of 553 million euro (US$769 million) each against French gas giant GDF Suez and the major force in the German gas industry,  E.ON Ruhrgas. According to European  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, the two companies colluded in the French and German gas markets for almost 30 years between 1977 and 2005, with the last five years of this collusion considered illegal by Kroes' department.

TD
Warning Shot

These are the first anti-trust  fines issued against European utilities and they are the second-highest for individual companies in a cartel case. The  Commission was all the more determined to show its authority in this case given that Kroes has been unable to push her directive on compulsory unbundling through the European Council, the European Union's (EU) highest institution, comprising the 27
member-state heads. This renders the task of the Directorate-General (D-G) on  Competition significantly more difficult. Kroes has therefore turned her attention to anti-competitive practices, targeting the EU's
gas and electricity markets.

What riled the commissioner in particular was that GDF and  E.ON announced in August 2004 that their deal was "null and void", as quoted by the EUObserver, but continued to maintain it until 2005. Kroes argued that the  Commission had no choice but to impose such high  fines as market collusion is one of the worst types of infringement of EU anti-trust regulations. Kroes stated that consumers in Germany and France were at the receiving end of the deal between the two gas suppliers, being forced to pay higher prices than necessary. According to the EUObserver, she stressed that the  fines were intended to send a "strong signal" to other energy companies of the  Commission's zero-tolerance attitude towards
anti-competitive behaviour.
Market Collusion or Not?

E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez are two of the most important players in the EU gas market. In 2008,  E.ON
Ruhrgas had a turnover of 87 billion euro, while GDF Suez's turnover was 68 billion euro. Both
companies have taken advantage of mergers to increase their influence in the EU:  E.ON acquired capital
control of Ruhrgas in 2003, while GDF merged with Suez with the strong support of the French
government in 2008. They jointly built the MEGAL pipeline in 1975, which is part of a larger pipeline that
transports natural gas from Russia to France via Germany; they also own and operate the MEGAL
together. MEGAL transports gas from Waidhaus on the German-Czech border to Medelsheim on the
German-French border. The  Commission believes that the boards of  E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez
colluded to ensure that GDF would not sell any gas transported through MEGAL in neighbouring
Germany, and that Ruhrgas would not sell any gas transported by MEGAL in France. The deal would

Page 109 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
have worked well since GDF had a legal monopoly for importing gas to France until August 2000. Meanwhile, Ruhrgas enjoyed the lion's share of the German gas market thanks to a demarcation agreement with other German gas suppliers, which shielded it from  competition. The Commission ruled the demarcation agreement illegal in 1998.
Outlook and Implications

This decision will certainly have sent a strong signal throughout the EU gas industry. Yet, the  fines could have been larger—the  Commission can issue fines of up to 10% of a company's turnover but settled for a much smaller sum. It could have forced GDF Suez and EDF to pay several billion euro in  fines each. It seems likely that the  Commission wanted to show that it will name and shame transgressors but did not want to scare the market into a standstill. Indeed, the  Commission is keen to stress to market operators that if they stick to the rules all will be well, and the decision is unlikely to alter operations in the EU's gas markets to any significant extent.

However, the two companies  fined can have a significant say in the extent to which the  Commission's message gets across. As things stand now, the boards of GDF Suez and  E.ON Ruhrgas are not
accepting Kroes' arguments. Indeed, their reaction to the  Commission's penalties speaks volumes about the problems facing the institution as it attempts to make itself heard in the utilities industry. Unlike  E.ON and RWE, which struck a deal with the  Commission in June following a damning probe into their activities, GDF Suez and  E.ON Ruhrgas have decided to fight the Commission head-on. In a statement issued on 8 July, GDF Suez stated that it did not accept the charges the Commission had made against it; the deal had been made when the "legal and regulatory context" was "very different from that of the energy market today", it was quoted as saying by the International Herald Tribune (IHT). It plans to file an appeal with the EU Court of First Instance (CFI). The chief executive officer (CEO) of  E.ON Ruhrgas, Bernhard Reutersberg, stressed that no market collusion took place at any time; rather, the deal with
GDF in the 1970s had been necessary to ensure sufficient funds for investment in the MEGAL pipeline but was in fact never applied and formally repealed in 2004.

Such comments show how little the two companies believe they have done wrong. However, they may just be playing for time and trying to limit any damage to their reputations at home. The French and German authorities will need to ensure that the two companies adhere to the decision by the Commission; the only way for them to avoid ruffling feathers at their cherished national champions' headquarters is to seek a postponement of the payment date. For this to happen, the heads of GDF Suez and E.ON Ruhrgas need to act rapidly. One way or another, the stand-off between the  Commission, reluctant EU governments, and major gas companies is far from over.

European Commission imposes billion Euro  fine for the third time in one year

TD
On 8 July 2009 the European  Commission (the "Commission") imposed a fine totalling just over €1 billion on E.ON AG (and its subsidiary Ruhrgas AG) ("Ruhrgas"), and GDF Suez SA ("GDF Suez") for market-sharing in the French and German gas markets. The  Commission's decision relates to an agreement between Ruhrgas and Gaz de France ("GDF") (which merged with Suez in 2008) dating back to 1975 when the parties jointly built the MEGAL pipeline to transports gas across southern Germany. At that time the parties explicitly stated in a series of letters that they agreed not to sell gas transported through the pipeline in each other's home territories, such that GDF would not sell gas in Germany, and Ruhrgas would refrain from selling gas in France.

At the time of the agreement both parties operated effective monopolies in their respective home countries, GDF through a legal monopoly and Ruhrgas through a system of 'demarcation agreements' which protected it from  competition. Despite the European gas market being liberalised in 2000, and demarcation agreements being deemed illegal in 1998, the parties continued to honour their
market-sharing agreement until 2005.

The size of the  fine, which is to be shared evenly between the parties, is intended to reflect the seriousness of the offence. The Commission stated that the fact that the parties were aware that their
1975 agreement fell foul of competition law and yet maintained their market-sharing agreement demonstrated a clear infringement of Article 81. This agreement also allowed the parties to retain extremely strong positions in their respective gas markets during the liberalisation of the markets and thus deprived consumers of the very price  competition that liberalisation was designed to encourage. Further, continuous contact between the parties confirmed the existence of a single continuous anti-competitive market sharing infringement since 1999.

This is the first Commission decision imposing fines in the energy sector for a breach of Article 81 or 82, although the Commission has recently demonstrated a strong interest in the sector. For example, on the same day as the GDF Suez and Ruhrgas  fines were announced, the  Commission published a set of commitments from GDF Suez on its website for market testing in separate proceedings. These commitments are designed to address concerns that GDF Suez, as the dominant gas supplier in France, may have prevented competitors for entering the market through its long term reservation of most of France's gas import infrastructure. Although GDF Suez has made no admissions of wrong-doing, the commitments will lead to the immediate release of a large proportion of its long-term reservations, with an eventual reduction of its share of these reservations to below 50%. Public consultation on these commitments is open for the next two months.

These two cases demonstrate the Commission's current determination to ensure effective  competition in the European energy sector and as such the fines levied this week may not be the last significant penalties in this area.

European Commission begins Phase II investigation into Lufthansa's proposed acquisition of Austrian Airlines The Commission has launched a Phase II investigation (under Article 6(1)(c) of the EC Merger Regulation) into the potential effects of Lufthansa's acquisition of Austrian Airlines. This is only the fourth
Page 114 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Phase II investigation launched since the beginning of 2009. The  Commission made the announcement on 1 July 2009, following a finding in its Phase I investigation that the proposed merger could have a negative impact on consumer choice and lead to an increase in fares on routes from Vienna to Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, Cologne, Zurich, Geneva and Brussels. Lufthansa had proposed remedies in order to prevent further investigation, however the  Commission considered that these measures would not address all of the  competition concerns identified by the Phase I investigation. The  Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that there were 'serious concerns' over the implications that the merger could have for passengers. Lufthansa is Germany's largest airline and controls Swiss Air, based at Zurich airport, Air Dolomiti, Eurowings and Germanwings, in addition to being a leading member of the Star Alliance. Austrian Airlines is itself the largest airline in Austria. The  Commission recently approved Lufthansa's proposed acquisition of British Midland, on 14 May 2009, and conditionally approved an acquisition of Brussels Airlines on 22 June 2009. The  Commission has a deadline of 6 November 2009 to make its final decision, although Lufthansa has stated that it may walk away from the takeover deal if the decision has not been reached by the end of July. The  Commission has already stated it hopes the decision would be reached swiftly 'in a spirit of mutual cooperation' with Lufthansa. The  Commission must also decide, as part of a separate investigation, whether to approve state aid for Austrian Airlines set at
500 million euros, which forms one of the conditions of the acquisition by Lufthansa. Pharmaceutical sector inquiry indicates  competition concerns in the market In January 2008 the European  Commission (the "Commission") initiated a sector inquiry into the European pharmaceutical industry in an effort to identify and address key  competition concerns in the market by launching a series of dawn raids ) see Community Week issue 356). The inquiry focused on prescription medicines for human use and, in particular, the competitive relationships between originator companies and generic pharmaceutical companies, and that between originator companies themselves. A preliminary report was published in November 2008 ) see Community Week issue 401) and the final report, published on 8 July 2009, built upon the 70 or so submissions received from interested stakeholders in response to the report. Regarding the relationship between originator and generic companies, the  Commission identified a number of restrictive practices instituted by originator companies which delay or prevent the timely entry of generic products into the market. These practices include strategies to extend the life of patent protection, for example by the filing of patent clusters for a single product, using patent litigation in an effort to create obstacles and delays for generic companies, entering into settlement agreements with generic companies and the introduction of follow-on products. The  Commission expressed particular concern about settlements involving direct payment from originators to the generic companies and restricting generic companies' ability to market the relevant product. The  Commission also identified  competition concerns in relation to the relationships between competing originator companies, such as obstructive patent litigation and patent strategies that result in the prevention of new products from entering the market. The Commission also put forward various proposals for changes to the regulatory system, which it recognised can be a cause of delay for generic entry. In particular the  Commission called for the establishment of a Community Patent and a unified European patent litigation system. The  Commission also noted that although Intellectual Property Rights are essential to the pharmaceutical market, they are subject to competition law and must not have as their object or effect the restriction of  competition. This is particularly relevant to settlement agreements. The publication of this sector inquiry has been awaited with anticipation by regulators and industry alike. The report makes it clear that the  Commission has
significant concerns about the operation of the pharmaceutical market and will hasten to intervene in any anti-competitive practices. If any further proof of the  Commission's intentions to step up enforcement action in this area were needed, on the same day as the publication of the report, the  Commission announced that it has initiated Article 81 and 82 proceedings against Les Laboratoires Servier and a number of generic companies for alleged anti-competitive practices. UK DEVELOPMENTS OFT to review supply of high cost consumer credit The Office of Fair Trading (the "OFT") has announced that it is launching a review into the supply of high cost credit as part of its Financial Services Strategy (the "Review"). This sector is estimated to be worth £35 billion annually and is characterised by short-term, often small, loans with high annual percentage rates ("APRs"). Many customers of products in the sector are on low incomes with limited access to credit and a limited choice of product. They thus represent a vulnerable consumer group, whose position may be weakened further due to the current recession, which the OFT thinks is likely to increase the number of consumers seeking high cost credit. The Review will focus on the level and nature of competition among product suppliers in the sector, taking account of the impact of the economic downturn on competition and whether suppliers compete in a way which is beneficial to customers. The Review will also look at the business models of lenders within the sector and their implications for  competition, as well as comparing lending practices in the UK with those of other
countries. Furthermore, the Review will investigate the behaviour and decisions made by consumers when purchasing credit, whether information required to make well-judged decisions is available, and whether consumers have been afforded an appropriate level of protection. The Review also aims to quantify any consumer detriment found in relation to high cost credit. If this is significant, the OFT may consider suggesting appropriate remedies to the Government. The credit industry, consumer organisations, parts of Government and independent experts will all be asked to input into the Review. The OFT says that it expects to publish interim findings by the end of 2009, with the final report available in Spring 2010. GERMAN DEVELOPMENTS German Federal Cartel Office  fines pharmacists' associations for collective
Page 115 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
boycott The German Federal Cartel Office ("BKartA") has imposed  fines totalling approximately €1.2 million on four German pharmacists' associations (the Bundesvereinigung Deutscher Apothekerverbände ("ABDA"), the Landesapothekerverband Baden-Württemberg e.V., the Berliner Apotheker Verein e.V. and the Thüringer Apothekerverband e.V.) as well as on several individuals. The BKartA found that the pharmacists' associations had repeatedly called on their members not to purchase products from Gehe, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, after Gehe's parent company Celesio had taken over DocMorris in April 2007. DocMorris offers its pharmaceutical services through a mail-order pharmacy and it offers a franchise-like brand partnership to pharmacists. A collective boycott violates German  competition law if it is made with the purpose of hindering a company unfairly, i.e. without an objective justification. As the boycott in this case was meant to harm Celesio/Gehe and ultimately protect the incumbent pharmacists from emerging competition, the BKartA saw no objective justification for the conduct. At the time of the boycott, DocMorris was also operating a pharmacy outlet in Saarbrücken. The permit for the pharmacy outlet has since been withdrawn, following an ECJ ruling upholding the ban on third-party ownership of pharmacies under German law. In the event that the ECJ ruling had gone the other way, that would have opened the door to DocMorris owning strings of (DocMorris branded) pharmacies and it was mainly this prospect that inspired the collective boycott. The orders imposing the  fines are not yet final. The individuals and undertakings concerned can appeal against the decision. FRENCH DEVELOPMENTS French Competition Authority issues opinion on exclusive access to TV content granted to Internet Service Providers On 7 July 2009 the French  Competition Authority (the "Authority") gave its opinion on the exclusive rights granted to internet service providers in relation to television content. The Authority's opinion was given in response to a request from the French Minister of the Economy on 8 January 2009. The Authority made some interesting suggestions in relation to the pay-TV sector and particularly the model implemented by the telecom operator Orange, which benefits from a "double exclusivity", involving
exclusive rights to television content and exclusive rights in relation to the transport and access services to this content via the internet. The Authority considered that, although such exclusive rights provide an incentive to operators to invest in television, they are restrictive for the consumer and should only be permitted in exceptional situations. Thus, the Authority proposed limiting the exclusive access for a short period of one or two years, and only in cases of real technical and commercial innovation. The Authority also proposed to allow the first exclusive internet service provider to sell its television content to other operators itself after expiry of the short period of exclusive rights. Otherwise, the Authority noted, the incentive for the first exclusive internet provider to invest in television content could disappear. Finally, the Authority noted that clear rules should be defined to regulate the pay-TV sector in order to improve competition on this market, and specifically in the sport and movie television sub-sectors. The Authority thus called for such legislation to be considered. The Authority's opinion is not binding but it can be influential. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

EUROPEAN UNION -- E.On and GDF Suez both say they will appeal eye-watering  fines imposed by the European Commission after the two European energy giants were found guilty of collusion in the French and German gas markets. They were  fined a total of over €1.1 billion ($1.5 billion), or €553 million each. The massive fines are the first imposed by the Commission for infringing antitrust laws in the energy sector. According to Brussels, Germany's E.On Ruhrgas and the former Gaz de France agreed in 1975, when they jointly decided to build the Megal pipeline to import Russian gas into Germany and France, not to sell the gas in each other's home markets. The arrangement between the two companies "deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the European Union," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. The  fines were calculated on malpractices between 1999 and 2005, rather than the full 30 years since 1975, Kroes noted.

SIMON RIGBY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SPICE PLC: Right, well, good morning everybody, thank you very much for joining us again and welcome to those of you who've not actually been along to one of these before with us.

I'm joined by Oliver, who -- you'll all know Oliver. I think most of you will know Andy as well, who runs our Distribution division. Perhaps somewhat less well known by the whole audience here is Chris, who runs our Supply division for us.

TD
We're actually all going to share the platform this morning and work our way through the presentation, but I'm going to kick things off and then hand over accordingly. And at the end, you're all most welcome to ask any questions at all which you want of the panel on any topic at all which you want. But somebody will scurry towards you with a microphone when you show the slightest signs of welling up a question inside yourselves. So, if you could just wait for the mic to land with you before you ask us if that's okay, all part of us being disembodied later.

Okay, well, into the -- for want of a less formal term, the presentation, and, well, one of the things which has struck me about this year is the remarkably good performance which we've delivered. We knew we had it in us. It's always very good though to get these things inked in.

We also knew that we were not hugely exposed to the economic cycle, but bearing in mind the huge recession which the country is in at present then it's very good, if you like, to prove to the market and to the shareholders that we run a very resilient business as well.

And I think to be delivering a 24% increase in turnover in the last year; 58% increase in profit; 12% underlying organic growth in profits; maintaining and just edging up our margins at 10.3% for the year; third year running which we've delivered 100% cash conversion; very good growth in our free cash flow; and our dividend moved along nicely as well by 25%. Well, I do think it's a fairly comprehensive set of results to be perfectly honest and certainly against the backdrop of a very, very bad world recession which the entire country, of course, is trading through at present.

And at the risk of sounding even more complacent than I normally do on these things, the regulatory outlook is very, very strong for us. And Andy's got a couple of slides for us specifically on the regulatory drivers on our Distribution division, which we'll come to and hopefully you will all see that the outlook for the business, the markets we operate in, are very positive indeed.

A little bit of a sort of summary of the business today, I know a number of you have followed us for a long time, so I don't intend to spend very much time in this forum on this. But in the audience, clearly, there's the Operational Directors. We've also got our Divisional Financial Directors in the audience, so if anybody
wants to get into the detail of the business, we're all here. We're all very happy to do that.

But, basically, we're operating in the utility marketplace, where we've got rising regulatory driven spend, so we're not exposed to Government coffers on this so far as our market is concerned.

Interestingly as well, the regulated market is actually growing at present, particularly on our Supply side of our business as environment issues and green energy generally becomes much more mandated. And for those of you who've heard them before on this my apologies, but we are the first country in the world to have a statutory carbon reduction target imposed on our top 5,000 companies. That's going to create a tremendous driver on our Supply business going forward and, well, fantastic opportunities for us.


Page 118 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Funnily enough as well, the recession and the uncertainty which the recession drives and the credit crunch particularly is reinforcing a lot of our clients' choices to have a few strong partners rather than lots of small fragmented supplier bases. And, if anything, that's been thrown into sharper focus. It was motivated originally by the massive increases in spend which were taking place. They wanted well funded
businesses, but it's certainly been reinforced by the market which we currently find ourselves in at present. So a very good outlook for you, but anyway on to the numbers, which is Ollie's bag.

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS, GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR, SPICE PLC: Yes, looking at the highlights of the performance for 2009, we have had a very strong financial performance over the course of the year.
Revenue grew by 24% to GBP386 million, more importantly, profits before tax and amortization grew by
58% to just over GBP32 million. That growth in profits before tax and amortization ahead of the rate of
growth in sales is driven by growth in our Supply division, where we earn better margins, as you'll all be
aware, and also we benefited over the course of the year from a lower cost of debt as the rate of LIBOR
has reduced over the course of that year.

Operating margins have improved in the second half of the year. We're now up to 10.3%. At this time last year, we spoke about targeting the achievement of double-digit margins over the course of 2009 and it's pleasing that we have been able to achieve that objective.

Most pleasing for me within these results, however, is the ongoing level of conversion of EBITA into operating cash flow. We have converted 96% of EBITA into operating cash flow over the course of the year and that's reflected in the year end net debt number of GBP95.8 million, something we'll go on to talk about later on in the presentation.

Over the page, we're now in a position where -- well, something of a milestone for us. We've got a five year track record as a quoted business. Some of you may never have thought we'd have got to this stage of having five years on the clock, but anyway we have.
On the bottom left, you can see that revenue over the course of this five year period has grown by 46%
compound. Profits before tax and amortization have grown by 55% compound. Acquisitions over the
course of this five year period have clearly played a part in this growth, but just as importantly we have had
over the course of the past five years underlying double-digit organic growth in profits as well.
I'm now going to pass you on to Chris to talk about the Supply division.

CHRIS LEE, SUPPLY DIRECTOR, SPICE PLC: Okay, probably the most -- the question most asked of me is about how the economic downturn is affecting the Supply division. And if I was to look back over 30
years now in the energy business and look at past -- similar circumstances in the past, my answer's always the same. And I feel a bit embarrassed to say this, but recessions tend to be very good for our business.

Most people associate cost savings or profit improvement with -- as an output from the services that we provide. And I'm sure that's one of the reasons why last year our new customer acquisitions were about double what we expected when we set the budget at the beginning of the year. I'm sure that's a significant driver.

One thing that's been a little bit different this year, I'm a little bit more tuned into how the economic downturn is affecting the energy suppliers. And I keep hearing about their exposure to the credit risk associated with their customers and it putting some stress into their businesses. So I'm sure that's probably one of the reasons why Revenue Assurance this year has had such a good year as well.

We were successful in taking Revenue Assurance into further gas companies that had previously eluded them through the relationships that already existed in the supply business and grew their market share significantly.

It's a fact that if you have as your customers the top six gas suppliers, you also by default have the top six electricity suppliers as well. So this is why in the year just gone, we made some effort to try to extend gas services into electricity. And through a number of pilots, we've proven that there is an imbalance opportunity in electricity with those customers. So this year we have an objective of trying to make electricity a bigger part of the overall mix in Revenue Assurance.

It's too early to get excited about it, but we're also looking at imbalances within the telecoms market. And within the Distribution division we have sitting a small business that's looking at an equivalent imbalance in water. It's sat in Distribution because that's where the water relationships exist and that's where the resources are on the ground to develop that, but that's looking quite good as well.

Looking further forward on energy prices, energy prices are going to be volatile, we see, for the medium to the longer term on a generally rising trend. It's true to say that on a daily basis there's a lot of up and down

Page 119 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in energy prices and the negotiations that we're conducting for October '09 contracts will be significantly cheaper energy prices than October '08.

Having said that, the key to good energy prices is your market timing and it's very difficult to predict that, because there are a lot of factors affecting it. So our services are still very specialist.

The products that are being offered by suppliers are also more and more complex. We now have the opportunity to lock in at a price and then unlock if the price falls further, so we can given customers the benefit of price certainty and then without them fearing missing out on some further benefits if the price was to fall. And that's proving to be a good product for us as well.

In June last year we sold the fuel cards business, which we considered not to be core to our business with no crossover to our procurement customers.
And then through the acquisitions previously of Saturn Energy and Energy 2000 we're able to offer from
blue chip right down to SME a procurement service across the entire spread in the UK. We did feel that that
left us a little bit weak and out of balance in respect of energy and environmental management, because
although we'd previously offered those services through Inenco, they were becoming a smaller part of our
business as the procurement side grew, yet the demand was there in the marketplace and still is today for
those sort of services.

So we made the acquisition of Nifes in 2008 -- December 2008 and that puts a lot more balance into the energy side of our business, because we're not a one-stop shop for anything to do with energy. So our services are more in balance. Our customers are now more in balance, because 80% of their business has been in the public sector, which we consider to be a more resilient sector, and their remuneration model is entirely fee based from their customers.

So six months in, we're very pleased with the results of Nifes and there are good cross-selling opportunities existing between Nifes and Inenco to and from the two companies, but also across into Freedom Electric particularly.

In terms of regulatory drivers, there's a whole plethora of bills and acts and statements by the Government about the energy situation in this country and the environment. The carbon reduction commitment is on plan to come into place from April 1, 2010. It was always a precursor to that that the current year would be
a year of submission to the Government on data and we are seeing carbon reduction -- services associated with carbon reduction commitment being one of the areas that's performing very strongly at the moment.

One disappointing aspect in last year was that our attempts to put in place a climate change agreement for the plastic sector were very well frustrated by the politicians at the EU. But not to be outdone by that, we
did have enough time to lobby the UK Government and make the case for that to be a domestic national issue. And the budget statement made by the Chancellor last year did make provision for a carbon -- a climate change agreement for the plastic sector; and that is likely to start generating income for us from October 2009 this year.

In addition to that, the Government has talked about smart metering and mandating smart metering now right down to the domestic level. We're seeing smart meters being talked about by energy suppliers at the same point that they're negotiating contracts with their customers for the supply of energy. So I think the relationships that we have in the Supply side of the business will bode well for further conversations across into Distribution, when we're getting our act together and starting to consider the installation of the
metering. There's about 50 million electricity and gas meters that need to go in place over the next 10 or 11 years.

We've identified that the US markets are open and look like they could conducive to the energy services and the billing services. So with the presence that the Distribution division has over in the US, we intend to use those relationships to try and develop a pilot project for revenue assurance in balanced services in the US serviced from the UK. In addition, our UK energy customers continue to ask us about our ability to service their businesses that they own and the sites that they own overseas in other international countries.

So in addition to that, we're seeing companies competing with us in the UK that have an international presence, so there are offensive and defensive reasons why we need to be offering a more international service than we are currently doing. So it's likely that we'll be less cautious about international servicing. And through the right acquisition at the right price, hopefully move into new markets there.

So good organic growth across billing, Revenue Assurance and Inenco, and strong contributes from the billing services and the procurement side of energy particularly, give an EBITA of GBP17 million for the year, which is a very satisfying performance from our perspective.
And I'll take questions at the end. Thank you, Andy?

ANDY CATCHPOLE, DISTRIBUTION DIRECTOR, SPICE PLC: Good morning everybody, Andy
Catchpole, Distribution Director. I think I know most of you in the room; not everybody, but most.

Distribution is a big division as you know. It covers the Gas, Water, Telecoms Facilities and Electricity divisions within Spice. We've had a very good year. It was a very good last year. We had a very strong year particularly in the Electricity area.

The regulated markets continue to grow for us. Expansion, if you remember, if you've seen my graph before, was always very strong in the south. We're now moving much more towards the north. Recently we've just won a Scottish Power contract to do all the overhead line power in Scottish Power 's footprint, which is including the Manchester and North Wales area, which is in Scottish Power and -- a bit odd that. But that's -- it happens to be there. That's very pleasing because the previous contract was over 16 years, so to displace them at this time is very pleasing for us.

In United Utilities patch, which is in the northwest, the old Norweb region, we have just pre-qualified for all their new work streams, which is six work streams, so there's going to be some strength of business covered on that area. So during -- which is a pretty sharp downturn in the economy, we've found some good strength within the -- particularly in the utility marketplace.

Also within the contract wins, we've been very diverse in America. We've managed to extend the AT&T contract that we mentioned before. There's several contracts coming forward in America in the next few months. We presently manage AT&T 's data for nine states in the US. We are looking to spread that to 22 states, which is their complete footprint.

British Power International, you'll remember one of the businesses we bought last year, is going from strength to strength. We're working in Oman. We're working in Pakistan or just to the south of that. We're working India. We're working in -- well, I think most probably nearly all of the Emirates. We're in Dubai. We're in most of the Emirate states there.

That is advisory, working with various people like the World Bank, the Asian Bank, United Nations and, of course, we do work with Ernst & Young quite a bit in that footprint advising on new installations, new network government investment in those countries. So we're very pleased with the development of that. It's gone really, really well and I see that we will -- in just one year we'll be able to double the business from where we started.

Clearly, within the Water business there's real strength there. The water markets are still growing. Water metering has become a big issue and I'll come on to that a bit later on in another slide.

So we're very pleased with that. We have issues within Gas and Facilities, which I'll mention. Clearly, the new electricity and water regulated periods which will start in 2010, 2015 will see an upsurge in the activity. That activity is required because of the state of the network, but also because the regulators and Government are keen to see some improvement on those assets.

And one of the purchases that we done last year was Morrel, which is a water imbalances service, which looked at the connections to collection, which is looking at recovering lost profit for the water companies, where A) the property is not registered or there's a debt. That's been very, very successful. And that will go from strength to strength, because it's becoming a big issue within the water companies, not knowing who their customers are, not knowing where their debt is. So Morrel have a great future in identifying that debt.

All the businesses need to move clearly up the value chain. The Electricity business, which is I where I started, we move that -- always move to up the higher values, up to more professional consultancy work, therefore, getting more margin.

We need to see innovation in all our marketplaces, which is happening. When you see the acquisition of the ComGroup this morning, well Telecommunications is really a communications division and we'll make sure it is a communications division.

When you look at the future installation of network, it's just like the modern car. It will all have communication embodied in that infrastructure whether it be water, gas or electricity. We need to be able to innovate that product to sell to our customers. When you think the gear that we're putting in today will last until 2070/2080 then it has to be modern. It has to be automated. It needs to communicate data. It needs to be remotely controlled. It needs to be a self-healing network. All these things require communication. 15 million smart meters will need to communicate with somebody at both ends.

So it's very important for us to make sure within our selling that we can do the communications across all utility activity. And that's a huge growth area. And innovation is where customers want. They want you to give a cradle to grave service and innovate products which will enable it to happen.

It was a challenging year for the Gas business. The Gas business has -- we've changed the management team within Gas. It's now branded as one Gas business. We'll be focused much more on commercial and industrial gas business and moving up the value chain in gas as well.

Facilities, well, Facilities tend to follow the economy, of course, and the high street. We've had a challenging year in Facilities. We've taken GBP3 million worth of costs out of Facilities. We are now seeing a very much -- an improved position, an improved market as well. There is signs of some stability on the high street and we are seeing some growth. Where we had some contracts previous we'd lost, we've
re-won them which we're pleased, of course, because that shows that our product was still one of the best products that we offer.
So a management change in Gas and Facilities has seen the results coming back. All that led to an EBITA
of GBP30.9 million, which is a good performance for the team.

On the regulatory update, well, the latest forecast for the distribution network upgrade, this is the electricity operators, is there will be a 65%/66% increase in CapEx. That's around about 13% from where they are today, because they're all running fairly hard today. So it's going to be an increase over all the five year period of 60% odd, but they are meeting those numbers. So we need the resource to make those numbers.

There's 9,000 engineers, we think, shortage in the UK. We have just opened a new training center at Corby. Corby will train as many as we possibly can. At the moment we've got some Iraqi engineers in and we're training those via the United Nations. But Corby will be the center within the UK for training engineers for the future.

There is absolutely a major skill shortage throughout the UK for engineers and we need more youngsters to be educated in that way. We are working closely with institutions, universities and colleges, to try to get the message out about engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering because most young guys want to be bankers; I wonder why. So we're working hard on that.

Ofgem want to see, and particularly what we all want to see, more resilient networks. If you live in the country, like I do, you're off supply every other week and that's not good enough nowadays. We need to see -- they need to see efficiency on the way you do things. They need to see less people supplying the goods, maybe a freedom type response where we do the design and the delivery. Innovation is very important as I've said.

The low carbon economy is going to be one of the big drivers as well. We're going to see a much more -- a huge increase in number of bio-digesting generation, wind farms, solar panels; all that is going to cause major issues for the network.

That's another one of the really important areas why you want a communications business, because who will be connected to the network where, where the energy will be flowing to whom from where will be a major issue. The data for that will be an absolute major seller. Knowing who actually is connected to the grid at any one point of time is going to be a real issue for them.

The cost of capital is an issue obviously with the companies themselves. And as we've mentioned earlier, smart metering where we're going to see 22 million gas meters and 28 million electricity meters going in, which all need to communicate with the end user and the owner. And they haven't really decided who's going to own the -- who's actually going to own the meters yet, but that will happen over the next year.

We will hear Ofgem's initial proposals this month and then December, depending on whether the electricity companies want to go to the  Competition Commission or not, the thing will kick in. So January 1, the new spend profiles are there.

On Water, well, water is -- when you think electricity is an GBP8.8 billion market and then you see water as a GBP22 billion market we've got plenty to go for in water. There's 15% increase in spend. There's been more independent verification of the plans that water companies have to make sure that they're not doing silly things like some of them are.

And debt and late payments is going to be a major issue. The regulators have noticed that at the moment most water companies are allowed to pass debt straight through their books. That's changing. Debt will have to be recovered. So the moral of this world, our little business will come into its own because it can do that.

And the focus really is still from Water, service to customers, quality of supply, innovation, low carbon economy; some of these are repeating. These innovation things are repetitive across all the utilities. They've got to see a change in where they are. They can't replace asset like-for-like any more. And obviously the timeline for that will be November. So in November we will hear the final determination on that.

Over to you.

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Back to numbers; slide 10 sets out a summary of the Group's result. You can see that we've carved out the impact of disposals and one-offs from the current and prior year numbers. Principally that line is comprised of the Western Power Distribution contract within our Distribution division from last year and also the fuel card business which, as Chris has mentioned, was disposed of in June
2008.

We also separately identify the impact of acquisitions, both acquisitions made over the course of 2009 and the part year effect of last year's acquisitions made in 2008. We do that so we can get back to like-for-like growth from our existing business, which you can see grew by 12% to GBP32.6 million.

EBITA, 2010 is likely to mirror what we've seen in 2009, mainly a weighting of organic growth into the second half of the financial year when compared to the first half. The main reasons behind that are we've got no insignificant start up costs on contracts like Scottish Power , overhead lines which Andy has mentioned, but also taking account of the current trading of our Gas and Facilities businesses relative to comparative periods in 2009.

Over the page to slide 11 we have a summary of margins over the course of the past seven years. Over that time period we have had significant margin improvement, most recently the mix benefit of the acquisition of RAS has pushed the Group into double-digit margin territory.

The margin growth up to 2008 reflected our success prior to RAS in taking the existing Spice business up stream. I see 2010 about maintaining margins at around current levels, so around the 10% mark. The progress from 10% will hopefully come in future years when we see full recovery in our Gas and Facilities marketplaces.

Slide 12 sets out an analysis of the Group results between Supply and Distribution and the level of revenue in EBITA. At the half year I highlighted that Supply was growing as a proportion of Group profits. At half
year Supply accounted for 28% of Group profits. At full year Supply now accounts for 35% of Group profits. We're very pleased with the performance of Supply over the course of the financial year.

Distribution has had a somewhat harder 12 months. We've had very strong performance in our regulated businesses, being Electricity and Water, offset by more challenging trading in our Gas and Facilities businesses. Gas and Facilities are going to remain challenges for the next 12 months for us.

I am conscious within this slide that we're not providing the sort of depth of detail that you might have been or that you have become accustomed to in terms of the analysis of the Supply and Distribution results. The driver behind that is quite simply commercial sensitivity.

If we look at 2009 versus 2008 purely in revenue terms obviously you have the split of 2008 in terms of revenue. The proportions of revenue in 2009 versus 2008 are not dissimilar to what was presented in 2008, other than we have had a significant growth in Electricity as a proportion of Distribution revenues. And
we've also seen a reduction in Facilities revenues as a proportion of Distribution sales as well. No surprise there; that's been well flagged over the course of this financial year.

Slide 13 sets out the Group's cash flow, pleased that we do continue to convert profits into cash; 96% EBITDA conversion into operating cash flow. Debtors have again been very closely controlled over the course of the year. You'll remember from half year that debtors was an area I was concerned about, particularly in our Facilities business.

We have controlled debtors very closely. We've been able to pass on some of the benefits of collecting and controlling our debts into our supply chain, very important for us given the dependence within blue collar activities on the franchisee network.

We do expect ongoing conversion -- cash conversion to reduce a little bit from the levels that we've achieved over the course of the past couple of years. Historically, as Simon said, we've been around 100% EBITA to operating cash flow conversion. Going forward I expect that ratio to be around the 90% mark and that reflects the growth of white collar services as a proportion of Group profits.

We have seen a good increase in free cash flow over the course of the year; free cash up by 23% before investment of -- in Corby. It is pleasing that free cash generated has been in excess of the value of the GBP16 million that we've paid out to fund earn-outs over the course of 2009. In 2010 I expect us to pay around GBP14 million of earn out payments, that's relative to a provision in the books of just less than GBP18 million. The balance on that provision, GBP4 million, I expect to be paid out over the course of
2011.


Page 123 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Slide 14 is something we've talked about in the past but serves us as I think as a useful reminder. Net debt is significantly down from where it was at 2008. That's principally down to the placing that we undertook in September 2008. We still do have very significant covenants and absolute facility headroom available on our bank facility. Excluding acquisitions, I do expect covenant headroom to further strengthen over the course of 2010 as it has done over the course of 2009.

We continue to pay a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR for our debt and we've recently taken the opportunity to fix around GBP80 million of our debt at fixed LIBOR for three years, broadly coterminous with the remaining time frame of our bank facility up to March 2012. The facilities do remain in place 'till March 2012. So again just to reinforce the point that we've talked about in the past, there aren't any tricky renewals coming up any time soon on the bank facilities.
Back to Simon.

SIMON RIGBY: Okay, turning to Group strategy, really the -- well, all the reorganization, which has taken place and Andy's very much greater remit within the Group, is about replicating the critical mass which we've achieved in our Electricity business across all four of our utility marketplaces.

Where we find ourselves well up the value chain, where we find ourselves very well integrated with the customers, that's where the real growth is coming for us. The challenge for the Group over the next 10 years is to replicate that in all four utility areas. Over the next five years Water is our next big target in this area because we already have got reasonable mass in that market.

When -- for those of you who have been following us for the last five years, when we first came and presented to you we probably were 80% civils at that time. We're now down something like 50% civils. Not because our civils business has shrunk, it's probably trebled over that period, but we've moved very much more now into technical engineering and business process outsourcing with our clients and we see that as being a very major driver and growth for us over the coming years.

Certainly we're going to remain focused on delivering double-digit organic growth for our shareholders, helped a lot through cross-selling. There will be bolt on acquisitions made from time-to-time. But please God, hopefully all the people in this room understand that this is an organic led business not an acquisitions led business. And where we do make acquisitions we do grow those businesses.

Ollie's going to see to it that we maintain sensible headroom on our bank facilities and where we hope very much to move up our -- the value chain with all our customers over the coming years.

Turning formally to the outlook statement for the year, hopefully the wider knowledge of the market and also what's Andy said, but it's a matter of public record on Ofgem's site that the environmental and regulatory drivers remain very, very strong on the business and on the UK generally. We are -- our exposure to those spends are actually increasing and, therefore, we do see ourselves quite well insulated from the wider economic outlook.

We are very well positioned to exploit the opportunities, which are going to come from increasing size of the markets, which we operate in and where we believe we're going to continue to deliver very good shareholder value. And at the risk of sounding complacent in what, of course, are very troubled times the Board is certainly very confident that we'll go on and deliver the numbers which are in the market for us. A rather trite statement used by lots of companies, but bearing in mind the market has got us down for double-digit growth each year for the next two years during what's probably going to be one of the worst recessions probably for 100 years anyway, we do believe it's somewhat more meaningful in our case than in some of our other fellow quoted companies cases.

So far as the presentation is concerned that's the presentation completed and really now it's an opportunity for you to ask us any questions at all which you want about this presentation or about, well, anything at all. There you are.
SIMON RIGBY: Got our first one here; to wait for the mic to be inserted. [And you are?] OPERATOR: Mark Fleetwood of Brewin Dolphin.
MARK FLEETWOOD, ANALYST, BREWIN DOLPHIN: Hi, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the end market exposure in the Gas business and perhaps a little bit more around what you've seen in the second half of the year; how the market dynamics are playing out? Where the issues have been as well?

ANDY CATCHPOLE: The Gas business, when we looked at the Gas business we've been mostly focused in social housing, decent homes, in looking after the boiler maintenance, those type of areas. Those contracts remains but we're now moving the Gas business much more towards commercial and industrial

Page 124 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
gas business. It blends in nicely with our private network electricity business as well where we maintain -- as you know, a fair proportion of the private networks are in the UK, including the Royal household and the cucumber thing down the road and all those areas, where if we can now work with our Gas business as well we can maintain the gas network for those areas going forward.

The other issue is to make sure we move more into gas metering and into the replacement of gas meters and also moving up -- slightly up the value chain on gas. That's a target for this coming year and we should see particularly a turn round in the first half of that type of market. We've had some fair success already on commercial gas, particularly in universities and other areas, hospitals, where we can maintain that gas infrastructure. And I think that we need to make sure that the Gas business going forward has a good mix
of customers rather than just concentrating on one perhaps end.

SIMON RIGBY: But a lot of pressure on the social housing gas market, tenacious competitors, which is fine, but also influx of people coming into that market and people are interested in the certainty of payment and the contracted revenues in that area. We're not immune to the margins, which are happening there.

That remains a good business, good exposure, lots of companies who come before you would be leading on their exposure to that marketplace. Andy is having very considerable success in cross-selling our Gas business into our traditional utility client base. We've just won a very good gas maintenance contract with E.ON who are significant customers of ours, of course, in our Utility business.

So we are looking -- we're certainly going to remain very strong competitors in the social housing gas maintenance market. But as you all know, we're absolute junkies on cross-selling and when we can sell these services into our existing client base we're very keen to do that as well. So, well, it's a tough market. We're content with our position in the market and we're going to come out the other side of this. But -- well, we're in a good position and it's a good business and we are taking the steps which are needed to make sure it becomes a very fine business.
OPERATOR: David Brockton, Arbuthnot.

DAVID BROCKTON, ANALYST, ARBUTHNOT SECURITIES: Two if I may; firstly just one in terms of the cash flow. The intangible CapEx line seems to have shot up a bit this year. Is that down to Corby, all the accounting software that you're putting in or is it --?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: It's actually down to neither of those things of all reasons. It's attributable to the fact that we've -- in previous years we've flagged we've been developing the next generation of our work management system and that's gone live into our Water business over the course of this year. But it's also gone live into certain of our customers, including United Utilities over the course of the year. So the circa GBP1.5 million that we've invested over the course of 2009 we think is going to serve -- or it's going to pay dividends in future years really.
DAVID BROCKTON: Right, okay. And then just secondly, whilst still on that the Corby investment was
GBP4 million.
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: It was.
DAVID BROCKTON: I think you flagged it would be GBP6 million. Is it a true estimator?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Yes, our best current estimate is actually it's going to be GBP5 million, so between where we were at full year and what we originally talked about. So that means there's GBP1 million still to spend over the course of 2010 and, indeed, a significant proportion of that has already been spent in the financial year to date.

DAVID BROCKTON: Okay, thanks. And then you covered the third consideration. But moving aside, different subject then, I just wondered if you could talk through the acquisition you made today; why you needed to do it and what it will add to the Group?

SIMON RIGBY: Okay, well, needed to do it is a bit too strong a term really. These two businesses operated as one business for the last 50 years. They were separated about seven years ago. We've operated a joint venture on intellectual property for the last seven years. We had the opportunity to bring the two halves of the Telecoms business back together; not -- I'd say not a slam-dunk for us; a very attractive price, three times historic operating profit, net assets plus GBP800,000. But it doesn't matter really what the price of anything is if it's not of value to us.

And Andy runs our Distribution division for us now. Andy's got a very accomplished track record of making acquisitions for the Group. And I would have to say that Andy's due diligence and the work Andy's done, it weighed very heavily on the Board's decision to make this investment at this time. And given that Andy's been out there, Andy's running it for us, perhaps you'd like to top and tail that, Andy?

Page 125 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ANDY CATCHPOLE: Yes, one of the things that ComGroup has and which we need for the future, is this innovation within the utility networks. They have tremendous intellect as well, which is always difficult to value intellect. But we need to make sure that our Communications Group, I'm moving away a bit from the word telecoms you'll note, is because we need to make sure that going forward that all the products that we can actually install and sell do an end to end cradle to grave solution. That's what people want.

So when we're installing electricity network infrastructure, water infrastructure, gas infrastructure then the communications of that will be a key part going forward. Just as your car now has thousands of microchips in a car, when I had a car first it only had a gear lever. So technology's moving ahead and we need to
make sure that we can service that technology as it moves ahead.

Don't forget, I mentioned earlier, we're installing kit for 2070. I shall be long gone but the kit will be there, but we need to think about what sort of information flow will come from that kit.

Now the great thing about ComGroup when I was over in Melbourne having a look at the business, they have across -- and they've got some people in the UK as well you shouldn't forget, locally here, and their intellect and their experience and their ability to develop solutions for the market that we're in is first class. So we'll be moving closely with them and our own team to actually be able to install the data voice PMR systems that you need to manage networks.
DAVID BROCKTON: Does that sit within the old Telecoms division or is it --? ANDY CATCHPOLE: It will sit within Distribution. Correct.
DAVID BROCKTON: But within that --?

ANDY CATCHPOLE: Within Telecoms, but in Distribution; but communications will be most probably the way forward.

ANDREW NUSSEY, ANALYST, KBC PEEL HUNT: It's Andrew Nussey from KBC. Just following on, on the systems question, I wonder where we were with rolling out the accounts system, and whether the benefits that you had hoped to see from that are coming through?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: We've got essentially two parts of the business left to roll the accounting system into; one of which is the old Energy business; the other of which is the old Telecoms business, so one business within each of our Supply and Distribution divisions. Energy is actually next on the list.

And essentially, there's a reason why we've left Energy and Telecoms 'till last, because they both had very good, very robust systems in their own right and, therefore, but for the wider Group project, there was actually no burning platform to do anything particular about those systems. But having gone sort of 75% through putting the new system into the Group, we want to capture the benefits arising from the implementation in the remaining 25% of the Group. So we're going to be looking to push on with that over the course of the remainder of this financial year.

In terms of the benefits that we've captured from the new system, yes, we're capturing a lot of benefits in terms of the visibility which we're able to give managers around the business. One of which we talked about at half year; for example, in terms of the level of cash conversion that we're able to achieve then I firmly do believe that's through being able to give managers, people who hold the customer relationships
around the business, real time information as to what debts are outstanding, what cash has been collected. And therefore, when those people are speaking to their customers in the ordinary course of business, they're primed to ask the question, would you mind just paying our invoice please? And I think that's reflected globally in the level of cash conversion we have achieved for the full-year, the 96%.

I've said in the past, and I'll say it again, Finance can chase debts until they're blue in the face. Those debts are not going to get collected without the customer saying to their Finance department, would you mind paying Spice's invoice please?

JOHN LAWSON, ANALYST, INVESTEC: Morning, John Lawson from Investec. I know -- in the interests of obviously trying to dig out a bit more information, but in the divisional split which we used to have, is there any chance of getting any flavor for what the margins have been doing at the individual levels? And secondly, related to that, is how sustainable is the 48% margin in the Supply division?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: We'll deal with the issue of Supply first. Certainly, we do believe the margin is sustainable within Supply. I'm certainly not expecting it to leap forward in 2010 in the way that it has in terms of 2009, but certainly I think it's maintainable at around those levels.

In terms of Distribution, we'll speak generally about margins -- let's look at the five businesses that comprise the Distribution division. It'll come as no surprise to know that margins in Electricity have

Page 126 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
increased. It'll come as no surprise that margins in Facilities and Gas have decreased. Telecoms margins have broadly held constant over the course of the year, adjusting for Western Power Distribution . And Water margins are up a little bit from where they've been historically, mainly reflecting the mix benefit that Morrel has brought to the Water business.

JOHN LAWSON: Thank you. And perhaps just another question; it's something else. You've given us the five year record of -- and obviously talking about it proudly now. In terms of organic growth, you talk double-digit did I hear? And I just wondered is it just in the double-digits, or any flavor on that?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: I confess, I've not been back to quantify it, other than sort of looking each year and seeing that we have delivered sort of -- I think the best that we've achieved is around 20%. The lowest we've achieved is around 8%. When you sort of compound that up over the course of the five year period it is double-digit, but I confess I've not quantified the actual number. I can go away and do that if it's a burning desire to know.

WILL SHIRLEY, ANALYST, LIBERUM CAPITAL: Hi, it's Will Shirley from Liberum; just a couple of questions on Revenue Assurance. I was wondering if you guys had a split between the revenue earned from Electricity and from Gas; a rough split?
SIMON RIGBY: Chris, have you? [Maybe] one-third, two thirds?
CHRIS LEE: Yes, it's -- well, it's just under a third. We're probably about between 25% and 30% (inaudible
- microphone inaccessible).
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Yes, sorry, just for the microphone, that's 30% in Electricity, around 65% to 70%
from Gas.

WILL SHIRLEY: And have you got updated market share estimates for those, because previously you've published 80% market share in Gas or -- I can't remember was that -- is that --?
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: No real update from what we published last time. WILL SHIRLEY: And Electricity? No update?
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: No, no update.

ANDY CATCHPOLE: But it's the same customer base. I think our conversations with suppliers now, and I think I've seen a figure in excess of 90% quoted for the market share in Gas [vis-a-vis] the same customers for Electricity. So you could argue we have the same market share of Electricity. What we have to do is have conversations with the suppliers about imbalance generally, which isn't now a conversation about gas or a conversation about electricity. It's a conversation about imbalance, and it covers both.
WILL SHIRLEY: Right.

ALEX MAGNI, ANALYST, NOBLE: Morning gents, Alex Magni from Noble; a couple of financial -- or a couple of operating ones then I'll chase up with a couple of financial ones. In terms of the Distribution division, are there any other businesses, other than Gas and Facilities, where conditions are proving worse than your expectations? Or are those the main areas of weakness?
SIMON RIGBY: [Shall we take that]?
ANDY CATCHPOLE: No, there's no other weaknesses.

ALEX MAGNI: Alright. And then just on AirRadio, in terms of the contract renegotiation there, profitability is going to be lower. Can you quantify what we should expect going forward in terms of the drag or the headwind on profit?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Yes, we've never really disclosed AirRadio margins, other than to say that they were above average, relative to the wider Telecoms business. Margins are still above average relative to the wider Telecoms business. Certainly, on the back of the renewal, we're going to earn going forward a lower margin than we have historically over the course of the first five years of the contract. That didn't come as any great surprise to us.

Our challenge is to diversify that business further away from BA. It's not that we don't want to do more for BA, because that's firmly within our plans as well. We want to do a lot more for BA. What we also want to do is reduce our dependence in the process.

ALEX MAGNI: Okay. And just two quick financial ones; in terms of your working capital, can you explain the GBP9 million absorption in payables? Why was payables down so --?
Page 127 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Yes, that's what I was mentioning earlier. We've taken a decision to reduce creditor days within our supply chain. When the Group accounts come out you'll see the creditor days have gone down from something like around 70 days to 60 days. That's a conscious decision on our part to support some of our smaller sub-contractors and franchisees.
ALEX MAGNI: Is that the Freedom --?
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Freedom will be an example of that, yes.

ALEX MAGNI: Okay. And then last one, I don't know if it's a meaningful thing, but why have your deferred tax assets been impaired by nearly GBP5 million? Is there anything you could --?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: This is the vagaries of IFRS. What we've got to do under IFRS is value our Section 23 tax asset at each financial year. Section 23 tax asset is the benefit that we expect to get from the exercise of share options. And quite simply, having had a lower share price on May 1, 2009 relative to April 30, 2008 we therefore got a lower value deferred tax asset.
ALEX MAGNI: It's options related. It's not --? OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: It's options related, yes.
NICK SPOLIAR, ANALYST, ALTIUM CAPITAL: Nick Spoliar, Altium. Sorry, just on the working capital, I'd just like to ask the same question that Alex just asked on what's going on on the inventories, where there's the switch-round?
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: It's purely driven by activity mix. In the current financial year we effectively were
at a stage where we could invoice project work in the prior financial year. There were a couple of projects in
there that weren't capable of invoice at the financial year end. So it's timing and mix really.

NICK SPOLIAR: Okay, and how does that play going forward, in terms of what you were saying about white-collar work versus blue-collar work?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: In terms of going forward the mix between white and blue collar it shouldn't have that big an effect on inventory. There may be a marginal effect. The impact is more on the debtors line where with an increasing proportion of white collar work as we invoice that debtors will go up. But obviously there won't be a compensating increase in creditors by virtue of the fact that white collar is typically
self-delivered.

NICK SPOLIAR: And just on the contracts, obviously just a question for Andy, you've been winning quite a few contracts in Distribution. On FSG, what sort of people are you winning the contracts from there?

ANDY CATCHPOLE: Well, I won't mention one of our friendliest competitors, who we've just recently won a contract from, because that wouldn't be fair. But they are one of our best sales agents at the moment.
NICK SPOLIAR: Not just from the small guys on the back of --?
ANDY CATCHPOLE: No, no, no; quite a large business -- quite a large enterprising businesses. NICK SPOLIAR: And across Electricity and so on, Scottish Power ?
ANDY CATCHPOLE: Well, Electricity; Scottish Power , Balfour Beatty had that for 16 years. But you see you've got to innovate otherwise you'll get swiped.
NICK SPOLIAR: And UU pre-qualification work streams? Can you give me a feel for the quantum of that? ANDY CATCHPOLE: Well, UU have decided to come out with work streams very much like EDF, where
you do quite a lot of cradle to grave work. We've pre-qualified for those areas for work, which is
sub-stations, overhead lines, maintenance, all sorts of activities.

SIMON RIGBY: Andy's one of only three companies to qualify across all service islands, so we're in quite a rarified atmosphere to start with.

ANDY CATCHPOLE: Potentially, if you won the lot, which would be, I would have thought most probably difficult, you'd be around, I don't know, GBP60 million, GBP70 million per annum. So I would have thought that we're looking to have something sensible if we can win -- if we could do half that, we'd do well wouldn't we?




Page 128 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NICK SPOLIAR: Yes, terrific. And you were talking about the determinations. Obviously as we move from amp 4 to amp 5, there's a sense that there's a hiatus going on in Water. Are you experiencing that? Can you talk about that?

ANDY CATCHPOLE: No, I think Water -- Water at the very top level, are concerned about the return on capital; that's sort of the Company's point of view, whether they can get the return that they want, because most water companies are now owned by the banks or foreign institutions, so it's going to be a challenge for them.

From in the street, as it were, then there's a lot to do. Metering is a big issue. Leaks are still a big issue. All those sort of hard nut and bolt areas still need to be done. So I'm very confident that Water will see some significant growth.

MIKE FOSTER, ANALYST, FAIRFAX: Morning, Mike Foster of Fairfax. It's a question really I suppose about margins, and it's in the civils area; that you've given a bit of an insight in how you're in some ways supporting the Freedom model by extending credit. Have you seen costs falling? And to what extent have you passed those on to the customers? To what extent have they actually benefitted your margins perhaps?

ANDY CATCHPOLE: Well, costs in themselves are not really falling, not raw material costs. What we need to do for the customer, the customers expect you to always offer them lower cost per unit as it were. Now the skill there is to make sure that you can innovate around what you're giving the customer -- what service you're giving the customer.

And one of cheering moments of my life was the week before last when there were seven people having a meeting in a room; the customer, their consultant and the person who was going to build the job, and they all came from our business, which was very interesting. So that meant that we were maximizing total margins across that area.

So yes, if you dig a hole, there's going to be pressure on digging holes. Absolutely, because everyone in the room can dig a hole at different prices. But the technology side of the business, the upside of the business; the design, the planning, the innovation is where the margin will be made and that's got to be -- we need to replicate that across the whole of the Distribution business.

DAVID BROCKTON: It's David Brockton, Arbuthnot again. Sorry, two more for Oliver again, sorry Oliver. You've given us the creditor days, just -- debtor profile and any bad debts within Facilities as well.

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Dealing with Facilities question, I was very nervous at half year about, in particular, what might come out over Christmas, as the sort of rent quarter came up and retailers got out of their most profitable trading. I think the only bad debt of any significance we had over that period related to Zavvi. There's been nothing since, but we remain ever watchful, really, in terms of our exposure in that area.
In terms of debtor days as a business, again this will be disclosed in the Group accounts. But effectively in
2008 debtor days were circa, I think, 48 or 49 days. We've seen a reduction over the course of 2009 to
around 41, 42 days.

DAVID BROCKTON: Okay, thanks. And finally, just -- you talked about sensible headroom being maintained on your debt facilities. I was just wondering if you can give a bit more flavor around what you mean by sensible, and how much that is?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: From our perspective it's difficult to quantify in absolute terms. The way that I would analyze this and measure it would be in terms of our covenants. As you all know we have a debt ceiling of four times debt to EBITDA. At full year we were something like two times on that ratio. My personal view is that I would not like to see our ratio go above three times on the ratio of debt to EBITDA.

That might be high, relative to some of the other businesses that you follow, but I think that what you've got to bear in mind with Spice is that we do have a reasonable degree of visibility over future revenues. Yes, there's an execution risk in terms of turning those revenues into profits but also, therefore, we do have some degree of visibility over future cash flows.

We're also covenanted in the area of debt to EBITDA -- sorry, EBITDA to interest with a covenant of three times. And again, without necessarily putting a number on it, a sensible amount of headroom on that ratio is just as important. If you look at results excluding the acquisition of ComGroup, we were covered something like seven times EBITDA versus interest for 2009.

All things being equal in terms of forecasts over the course of 2010, that level of cover would have increased to around 10 times. Now that will be -- that level of cover will be eroded a little bit by the

Page 129 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
acquisition of ComGroup, but we're still going to be up or around those levels, not least because we've locked in the cost of our debt. So, a sensible amount of headroom is very important, certainly to me, within the business and we are certainly going to maintain that.

ALEX MAGNI: Alex again from Noble, just two quick follow-ons. In terms of the reduction of creditor days, can you then help us understand how the shift to white collar will reduce your cash conversion going forward?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Quite simply, because as the white collar business grows so debtors grow. But the white collar services are self delivered, so creditors don't grow because the employees are paid by the payroll on 30 day terms. So you've got a working capital investment as debtors grow, but your creditors remain the same.

ALEX MAGNI: So your creditors on -- subcontractors of the Freedom, what are the payment terms on those now?

OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: Well, subcontractors on Freedom that's blue collar, what we're talking about is white collar.
ALEX MAGNI: Yes.
OLIVER LIGHTOWLERS: That's why the cash conversion will reduce overtime. ALEX MAGNI: Right, no. So what I'm--
ANDY CATCHPOLE: (inaudible - multiple speakers) --are paid when paid basis, so that's self matching to a large extent.

ALEX MAGNI: Okay. I mean just a last one, on ComGroup, just trying to understand how you got it so cheap. Why would a company sell itself for three times operating?

SIMON RIGBY: Well they are in the same position as us. They had half the intellectual property to the Simoco product. And therefore, there was really only one home for either of us on this. One of the things which purchase prices are somewhat relative. We paid GBP100,000 for our half of Simoco. They paid something similar for their half of Simoco. They are getting something like GBP6.9 million now for that, so they are receiving, if you like, a substantial return on the investment which they have made.

We have bought the business at a very aggressive price, which we are very happy with, and it's a fantastic opportunity for our shareholders going forward. But the business isn't really worth anything much until you bring the two halves back together again where we have got now a global market and a global IP. So it's been, well it enhances the value of what we've got very considerably.
ALEX MAGNI: And you're happy that their profitability will remain at historic levels?

SIMON RIGBY: Yes. I would expect us to be able to cross-sell into their client base, and for us to cross-sell their services into our client base as well. So, we buy businesses and we grow businesses and I see this being absolutely no different than that. Our Telecoms businesses make very good margin by distribution standards, so hopefully the growth is going to come in a pretty rewarding area for us.

Okay. Right, well it remains only, really, for me to thank you all for coming along and listening to us today; assuming you did listen. For those of you who listening to us disembodied, if you've managed to survive this long, you can click and leave feedback for us now.

For those of you that are here in person, I've already said that we've got a couple of our Finance Directors here. We've also got a couple of our non-exec Directors here. And if anybody has not met our new Chairman, Peter Cawdron is here as well, so please do take the opportunity to meet Peter. Other than that, thank you very much, we are going to be around for little while, so please feel free to leg up any of us that you want to ask any specific questions of.
Thank you very much.

HD           E.ON and GDF fined for colluding on gas market

E.ON and Gaz de France Suez (GDF), two of Europe's biggest energy suppliers, have been  fined for acting as a cartel. The European  Commission handed out penalties of EUR553mln each after ruling that they had agreed not to compete with each other in their national gas markets.
It is the first anti-trust  fine ever dealt to players in the energy industry.

TD
The EU's  Competition Commission said that the deal was struck in 1975 after the energy giants had finished building the Megal gas pipeline from Russia.
The companies agreed not to sell gas transported by the pipeline in their respective German and
French markets, which was initially legal under the old energy monopoly regime.

However, E.ON and GDF maintained the secret pact after European gas markets were liberalised in August 2000 and only abandoned it in 2005. It helped them to maintain strong positions when the gas markets were opened to  competition.

The cartel was discovered during an anti-trust investigation, following raids on the offices of the two groups.

"This agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the EU," said Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner. "This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the commission will not tolerate anti-competitive behaviour."

Both companies pledged to appeal the decision. "The group calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today," GDF said.

SE     What's New
HD     GDF Suez Landmark  Offer To Open France
WC    629 words
PD     15 July 2009

In a bid to persuade the European Commission to call off a protracted anti-trust probe, GDF Suez has committed to significantly increase competition in France's gas market by offering to third parties almost
4.2 billion cubic meters (3 million tons) per year of extra import capacity at French LNG terminals and 3.1
Bcm/yr (300 million cubic feet per day) at pipeline entry-points into eastern France.

An independent trustee will be appointed to make sure GDF Suez fulfills its promises, and the commission has invited feedback from customers, rival suppliers and others within two months of the proposals publication in the Jul. 9 EU Official Journal.

TD
“The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market," and foster broader EU  competition, said EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

At LNG terminals, GDF Suez is to sell 2 Bcm/yr of firm long-term capacity at Montoir on France's Atlantic Coast, half starting in October 2010 and half from October 2011; and 2.175 Bcm/yr at Fos Cavaou starting January 2011. Some 175 MMcm/yr of the Fos Cavaou capacity will "primarily benefit shippers that have booked short-term capacities" at the terminal, due to open later this year (p8).

This extra 4.2 Bcm/yr (3.1 million tons/yr) could hurt the economics of three new LNG terminals planned to open in France in 2013-14, although less so Antifer and Dunkerque, which gas shippers are
co-developing, than the merchant Pegaz project (WGI Jul.9'08,p8).

On pipelines, GDF Suez is to sell off 2.72 Bcm/yr (80 gigawatt hours per day) of firm long-term capacity at the Obergailbach entry point from Germany, and 340 MMcm/yr (10 GWh/d) at the Taisnières entry point from Belgium, starting in October 2010 and running for the life of its existing bookings.

Further upstream, transport capacity equivalent to this roughly 3.2 Bcm/yr will be sold starting at the same time and running through 2027 at the Waidhaus entry point from the Czech Republic into Germany, and at the Medelsheim exit point from Germany into France; until 2025 at the Zeebrugge entry point and the Blaregnies exit point from Belgium into France; and, if wanted, until 2018 at both ends of the
Interconnector between the UK and Belgium.

GDF Suez has also committed to reduce its share of gas entry capacity in France to below 50% by 2014, from around two-thirds now. However, it said last week that its infrastructure subsidiaries Elengy and GRTgaz would step up investments, possibly meaning that GDF Suez's bookings will decline as a percentage, but not in volume terms.

These commitments didn't deter Brussels from last week imposing punitive  fines of over €1.1 billion ($1.5 billion) -- €553 million each -- on GDF Suez and Germany's  E.On for a separate anti-trust abuse, involving their decades-long market collusion until 2005 in the joint operation of the Megal pipeline for Russian imports. Both firms plan to appeal their  fines in EU courts.

Germany's E.On Ruhrgas and the former Gaz de France agreed in 1975, when they decided to jointly build the cross-Germany Megal line, not to sell any gas that it transported in each other's home markets. Despite the 30-year length of the alleged offenses, the  commission said the record fine -- the first it has ever imposed for an energy antitrust infringement -- related solely to 1999-2005.

"Market sharing is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement," EU commissioner Kroes explained. Each company says it is now a leading competitor on the other's home turf.

HD     GDF SUEZ bows to EC pressure  on entry capacity
WC    1,156 words
PD     16 July 2009

SC     EURGAS
LA      English

French gas market incumbent GDF SUEZ made the unprecedented move of offering to reduce its share of LNG regasification and pipeline entry capacity into the French network to less than 50% by 2014, down from the current level of 66%. The commitments were made by GDF SUEZ to remedy the concerns of the European Competition Commission, which is investigating the French incumbent over a possible abuse of its dominant position in the French gas sector.

The move means the energy group could give up significant firm long-term capacity at the Montoir de Bretagne and Fos Cavaou terminals as well as Taisnieres, at the Belgian border, and Obergailbach, at the German border.

TD
According to the official journal of the EU, GDF SUEZ will also sell to third parties equivalent upstream transport capacities running until 30 September 2027 at the Waidhaus entry point (at the German-Czech border) and the Medelsheim exit point (at the German-French border). GDF SUEZ will also release capacity running until 30 September 2025 at the Zeebrugge entry point and the Blaregnies exit point. Furthermore, at the request of purchasers, the company is to offer capacity to be used until 30 September
2018 on the bidirectional Interconnector gas pipeline at the NBP exit/entry point and at the Zeebrugge IZT
entry/exit point.
From 1 October 2014 at the latest, and for 10 years, GDF SUEZ is to limit its capacity subscription below
50% of total firm capacity for high-calorific gas in the northern and southern balancing zones of the
GRTgaz network and throughout the French territory, the EU said. This also involves all existing and
future gas entry points in France, including entry points between France and Spain.

At the Montoir terminal, the company pledged to release 1 billion cubic metres/year (1Gm3/year) from October 2010, and 1Gm3/year from October 2011. At the new Fos Cavaou terminal, it would release as much as 2.175Gm3/year from 1 January 2011, with 0.175Gm3/year primarily reserved for “transporters who have booked short-term capacities.”

According to a European  Commission statement, GDF SUEZ’ commitments could become legally binding, depending on the outcome of a market test (consultation) to be held by the  Commission from 9
July for two months.
Announcement coincides with GDF SUEZ and  E.ON anti-trust case

The Competition Commission has not drawn any conclusions, and both parties acknowledge there has been no finding of any infringement.

However, the offer by GDF SUEZ comes in the wake of a separate anti-trust case in which the Commission finedGDF SUEZ and German utility E.ON €553m each on 8 July over alleged “market sharing” in their respective countries. The Competition Commission had accused the two companies of agreeing not to compete with each other in their respective markets for the sale of Russian gas shipped in
1975, when they decided jointly to build the MEGAL pipeline that runs from Russia to France via Germany. E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF SUEZ both said they would file an appeal against the  Commission’s verdict with the European Court of First Instance.

While the case over French gas market dominance is not linked to the MEGAL decision, some sources saw GDF SUEZ’ offer of entry capacity as a reaction to the message sent by the  fine.


Page 135 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
“There has been no finding of an infringement [in the French market dominance case]. Essentially, GDF SUEZ offered these commitments because they don’t want the investigation hanging over them and I presume they did not want to run the risk of getting another  fine like they did this week,” a  Commission source told ICIS Heren.
In fact, GDF SUEZ’ commitments seem more likely to be a response to the  Commission’s statement of
22 June: “The  Commission’s preliminary assessment is that GDF SUEZ may have abused its dominant
position within the meaning of Article 82 of the EC Treaty by foreclosing access to gas import capacities in
France, thereby restricting  competition on the supply markets.”

“The foreclosure is deemed to be a result of the long-term reservation of most of France’s import capacity, the procedures for allocating import capacity in the new Fos Cavaou liquefied natural gas terminal, and
the strategic limitation of investments in additional import capacity in the Montoir de Bretagne liquefied natural gas terminal,” the statement read.
A golden opportunity for new entrants?
Some participants on the LNG market were broadly positive about the opportunity offered by GDF SUEZ’
capacity concession.

“It could be an exciting opportunity… We believe that there will some kind of open season on the capacity and we can assume it would be offered at the regulated tariff,” one European trader said.

While a recent Open Season held by GDF SUEZ for the expansion of its Montoir terminal has drawn little interest from third parties, a trader said these had been largely due to the terms offered by the incumbent. GDF SUEZ “was assuming it was going to sell the capacity at the expanded facility the same tariff as for current one, even though the costs of building the expansion would not have been as a high as for a new terminal. So in other words, they were not giving away any value for not being a greenfield terminal,” he said.

Other sources told ICIS Heren that the release of capacity would hardly be difficult for GDF SUEZ to accomplish as it was the majority capacity holder of the new terminal at Fos Cavaou, to where it could transfer existing contracts from Montoir.

One French market gas trader told ICIS Heren the offer of entry capacity would be of limited use without the break up of the incumbent’s supply contracts. The ability to do so is technically within the  Competition Commission’s remit, a spokesman for the body confirmed.

However, an industry specialist argued new entrants could benefit from the release of primary capacity: “There is currently a surplus of LNG supply in the world and prices on the prompt are certainly lower than long-term oil-indexed contracts so there are companies which would like to buy LNG [on the spot market] if they could get it at those prices,” he said.

“It could have an immediate short-term effect in allowing companies to enter the LNG trading chain and once you have built up those relationships, it is easier to continue in future,” he added.

The Commission is currently investigating Italy’s incumbent Eni over entry capacity, and filed a Statement of Objection on 19 March. While its decision in this case will largely impact pipeline import capacity, rather than the tiny LNG terminal at Panigaglia, it could still resonate with firms planning LNG terminals in Italy.

The ruling could also be pertinent for smaller EU markets, where the dominance of national incumbents over import capacity has largely been ignored.

BRUSSELS, July 17 (Reuters) - European Union authorities, which recently imposed hefty  fines on chipmaker Intel and utilities  E.ON and GDF Suez, intend to increase pressure on these sectors, the EU's antitrust chief said on Friday.

The European  Commission, tasked with ensuring fair play in the 27-country European Union, will also target erring drugmakers and transport companies that breach EU antitrust rules,  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"You will see us continuing to look deeply at key sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy, transport and technology," she said in the text of a speech to be delivered at an Irish think tank in Dublin. Kroes levied a total of 1.1 billion euros ($1.55 billion) in  fines on E.ON and GDF Suez last week, the first antitrust penalties on European utilities, for secretly carving up national gas markets.

This followed a 1.06 billion euro penalty on Intel in May for illegal efforts to squeeze out archrival AMD, marking the biggest antitrust  fine on a single company. Kroes last week signalled her determination to crack down on drugmakers suspected of fixing deals with generics producers to hold back cheap medicines, saying probes were under way.

The Commission is investigating privately owned French drugmaker Servier and a number of generics firms over the issue.

"We would do no favours to the economy by going soft on enforcement. If anything, anti-competitive activities, such as cartels, hurt consumers and the economy more in the bad times," Kroes said in her speech. "We will not hesitate to take action where there is clear evidence of a problem," she said. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Dale Hudson)

The European  Commission on July 8 fined French GDF Suez and German  E.ON €553 million ($772 million) each for cooperating to limit competition in each other's gas markets. This is the first fine imposed for an antitrust infringement in the energy sector, and the total €1.106 billion  fine to E.ON and GDF Suez is the second biggest sector  fine ever.
The Megal pipeline transports gas across southern Germany from the German-Czech and
German-Austrian borders to the French-German border in the west. When the companies decided to
build it in 1975 they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any Megal gas in Germany
and Ruhrgas would not sell any in France. GDF enjoyed a legal monopoly to import gas into France until
August 2000, while German suppliers had non-compete agreements of their own in place until they were
made illegal in April 1998.

TD
E.ON predecessor Ruhrgas and GDF Suez predecessor Gaz de France "agreed in 1975, when they decided jointly to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into Germany and France, not to sell gas transported over this pipeline in each other's home markets," the EC said in a statement announcing its decision. "They maintained the market-sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalized and only abandoned it definitely in 2005."

The EC opened its inspection into the energy companies after surprise inspections carried out in  E.ON and GDF premises in Germany and France in 2006. Formal proceedings were opened in July 2007 and a formal objection issued in June 2008.

E.ON and GDF Suez said on July 8 they would both appeal to the European Court of First Instance, but have agreed anyway to relinquish control on capacity, which is seen as a precondition for truly competitive energy markets (see page 3).

GDF Suez added in a statement that "the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today," while  E.ON Ruhrgas said that market collusion "never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005."

E.ON Ruhrgas CEO Bernhard Reutersberg said "the decision and especially the high  fine are not understandable."

Looking at previous experience of appeals against cartel  fines, competition lawyer Julianne O'Leary of London firm Stephenson Harwood said the success rate has not been great. But there have been more cases where fines have been reduced, she said, and also one where the appeal against the  fine was approved but the fine increased since the original methodology, which the appellant said was flawed, yielded a lower fine than the court ruled the proper methodology did.

The two companies might argue the case about parent company responsibility, which is almost without exception challenged in these cases, she said. It was Ruhrgas that entered into the agreement, not its present owner E.ON, and Gaz de France then was state controlled. "Interesting questions could arise
out of the question of state control," Harwood said. "But we will see more of these undertakings, such as
GDF Suez and  E.ON have made. They will do more for  competition than directives."

French gas incumbent GDF Suez has offered to free up 50% of its gas import capacity in a bid to settle an antitrust case brought by the European  Commission over suspected abuse of its dominant market position in France (see page 1). GDF Suez is offering to sell competitors up to 3.1 billion cubic meters/year of French gas grid entry capacity from October 1, 2010, and up to 4.175 billion cubic meters/year of liquefied natural gas terminal capacity by October 2011, according to a notice published in the EU's Official Journal on July 9.
GDF Suez has offered from October 1, 2010, to "sell to third parties firm long-term capacities" of 2.76
Bcm/year (80 GWh/day) at the German border entry point Obergailbach and 0.34 Bcm/year (10 GWh/d)
at the Belgian border entry point Taisnieres-H, said the notice. This is to continue for the "remaining
duration of GDF Suez's capacity bookings still to run" when and if the EC decides to make the
commitments binding, the notice said.

TD
GDF Suez has also offered to sell to third parties equivalent upstream transport capacities until September 30, 2027, at the Waidhaus entry point and the Medelsheim exit point in Germany and until September 30, 2025, at the Zeebrugge entry point and the Blaregnies exit point in Belgium. And if buyers request it, GDF Suez has offered to sell equivalent capacity until September 30, 2018, on the
Interconnector gas pipeline at the "NBP exit" entry point in the UK and at the "Zeebrugge IZT entry zone" exit point in Belgium.
GDF Suez has also offered to sell third parties firm long-term capacities of 1 Bcm/year from October 1,
2010, and 1 Bcm/year from October 1, 2011, in the Montoir de Bretagne LNG terminal, as well as 2.175
Bcm/year from January 1, 2011, in the Fos Cavaou LNG terminal. Some 0.175 Bcm/year of the Fos
Cavaou available capacity "will primarily benefit transporters having booked short-term capacities" the
notice said.

GDF Suez has additionally offered to limit its reserved share of firm long-term French entry capacity to below half the total available from October 1, 2014 at the latest until October 1, 2024. It has also offered from October 1, 2014, to October 1, 2021, to limit its capacity bookings for October 1, 2024, to October
1, 2029, to below half the total firm long-term entry capacities available as at October 1, 2014.

"For the purpose of the commitments, the gas entry points include all existing and future gas entry points in France, including the Spain-France entry point," the notice said.

"We will let more players into existing infrastructure," GDF Suez spokesman Jerome Chembin told Platts. "We are offering to invest in more infrastructure so that by 2014 our reserved share will only be about half of the available capacity – down from two thirds today." The other half would be available to competitors, said Chembin, but he would not give details of the investments needed or their likely cost. "We have to see what the market thinks of our offer," he said.
EC to test GDF Suez commitments

The EC is to test GDF Suez's commitments by asking the market if they remedy concerns about the company's market dominance. Interested parties have two months from July 9 to respond.

The EC has said that it intends, if the market responds favorably, to make the commitments legally binding. That would close the antitrust case without ruling whether GDF Suez had broken EU rules or not, thus avoiding potential  fines.

"This improved access to infrastructure for GDF's competitors is essential for effective competition...particularly for liquefied natural gas terminals and pipelines," EU  competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said on July 8 before GDF Suez announced full details of its plan.

Making the commitments binding would close the antitrust case without concluding if EU law had been broken or not, thus avoiding potential  fines. But the EC could still  fineGDF Suez up to 10% of its total global turnover if it does not comply with its commitments.
The EC has been targeting EU energy incumbents with antitrust cases ever since its energy sector
competition inquiry, started in mid-2005, found serious market flaws.

Results so far include Germany's  E.ON committing to sell its high voltage power grid and 4.8 GW of generation capacity, and Germany's RWE committing to sell its gas grid.

Italy's Eni is also facing pressure under an ongoing EC antitrust case to offer to sell its stakes in the TENP and Transitgas import pipelines, as well as in the companies managing the capacity rights in TENP, Transitgas and TAG pipelines.
The TENP and Transitgas pipelines run through Germany to Italy. The TAG pipeline runs from Austria to
Italy.

As far as the EC's €553 million ($776 million) market sharing  fines on GDF Suez and Germany's  E.ON Ruhrgas were concerned, it found that the two companies had agreed in 1975 not to sell Russian gas transported through the Megal pipeline that they built and owned jointly in each other's markets (see page 1). The Megal case is entirely separate from GDF Suez's commitments on import capacity, the EC said.

The latter follows an EC antitrust probe which found that "GDF Suez had long term reservations for most of France's gas import capacity, thereby largely closing off access to the French gas market to other potential gas suppliers." The EC said that GDF Suez had offered the commitments "whilst not acknowledging any infringement."

E.ON and RWE similarly refuted any allegations that they had broken EU rules when they made their commitments.

Card-carrying Europeans reacted in dismay to a recent far-reaching ruling on the EU's Lisbon Treaty by Germany's Constitutional Court. But the judges have in fact done Europeans a huge service by tackling the issue of how democracy can work in the era of supranational institutions.

TD
Do the people want to be deceived? Niccolò Machiavelli -- who was, it's safe to say, something of a cynic when it came to state power -- once wrote that anyone who wishes to reform a government "must, if his measures are to be well received and carried out with general approval, preserve at least the semblance
of existing methods, so as not to appear to the people to have made any change in the old order of things, although, in truth, the new ordinances differ altogether from those which they replace."

The Florentine diplomat's wisdom was valid in the Renaissance, when the world was being fundamentally restructured, and it also applies to the restructuring of the international order in the 21st century. As stated in the European Union's Lisbon Treaty: "The functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy." Is this a promise? Or have they been reading Machiavelli again? Are they really telling us the truth about what they have planned for democracy?

Germany's Federal Constitutional Court proclaimed the truth on June 30. It ruled that the EU of the Lisbon Treaty does not satisfy the minimum requirements for a democracy of the type described in the German constitution, and the European Parliament is effectively little more than an expensive, Machiavellian glass façade. And without proper supervision by the national parliaments, the politicians in Brussels are not legitimized by the people, it ruled.

Admittedly the court did rule that the Lisbon Treaty is basically compatible with German law and therefore can eventually be ratified. But before it can be, further legislation must be introduced in Germany that would strengthen the national parliament's involvement in any major decision-making in Brussels.

So is EU democracy nothing but a shiny bauble? Criticism of the German court's ruling has grown with each day that passes since the decision was handed down. Prominent European intellectuals have vocally expressed their outrage at the court's reservations about further steps toward European integration.
Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer described the ruling as "outrageous" in an opinion piece for the respected German weekly Die Zeit. "The decision comes at a time at which our European
neighbors and the Americans are increasingly gaining the impression that Germany is more and more turning away from Europe and is mainly interested in its own affairs," he wrote. "The Constitutional Court's decision strengthens this impression."

But this outrage conceals the fact that the ruling of the Karlsruhe-based Constitutional Court also represents the most important contribution yet to the future of democracy in the post-democratic era. The Karlsruhe judges are treating the European project the way it has long been seen by political scientists, as well as international law and globalization experts around the world, namely as the world's most exciting attempt to solve supranational problems with the help of supranational politics -- and to do so in a democratic fashion.

Can Western Democracy Work for Supranational Politics?

Page 142 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But how democratic can supranational politics really be? The judges' first important contribution is that they are taking the problem seriously. The hackneyed words of Europe's proponents are a mere smokescreen. A parliament like the European one is no democratic representation of sovereign populations if the vote of a citizen of Malta counts 12 times as much as that of a French citizen. A parliament like the one in Strasbourg and Brussels cannot legitimize the work of the European Commission, which effectively functions as a government, because it is hardly capable of controlling it.

It is naïve to believe that one can build a transnational super-state based on the model of conventional Western democracies, political philosophers argue. The difficulties do not lie solely in the attempt to channel the process of shaping the political will within large, heterogeneous areas like the European continent, across cultural and linguistic barriers, into an equitable process with a unified outcome. More importantly, there is a fundamental problem: Who exactly is the subject of this democracy supposed to be, as represented by its super-parliament? The people of Europe? It is not just the notoriously suspicious British, but each nation in Europe, which sees its sovereignty challenged when it is defeated in a vote.
After all, being sovereign means, in a conventional sense, not having to do what another nation says.

Because it is so difficult (perhaps impossible?) to democratically control political actors in international institutions, constitutional experts and political scientists are working on alternatives to the Western nations' traditional model of democracy everywhere such organizations exist. What legitimizes the power of the World Trade Organization? Which parliament monitors the activities of the International Criminal Court? How democratic is the Basel Committee, which supervises banks' credit policies? And who monitors the voting behavior of the nuclear powers on the United Nations Security Council?
"Output" Democracy

Does democratic legitimacy still play any kind of role anymore? According to the Frankfurt-based sociologist and legal scholar Gunther Teubner, a web of regulations and norms has developed over the heads of citizens and nations as a result of international treaties, economic regulations, interest groups and non-governmental organizations. This complex of rules has a significant influence on the daily lives of people without ever having been approved by a parliament, he argues.

In this regard, the insistence on the classical model of democratic legitimization from the bottom up -- in other words, from the citizen to the state -- has become downright old-fashioned. European politics threatens to become hopelessly ineffective if it allows itself to become too closely tied to parliaments. It is not surprising that Europe, too, is to be streamlined in what Udo Di Fabio, a member of the Federal Constitutional Court and one of the authors of the June 30 decision, calls the "wake of the global community." Di Fabio's former colleague Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem has already reflected publicly on the possibility of "no longer securing legitimization solely through institutions and processes, but also through results."

In other words, the Brussels bureaucracy no longer needs to ask itself: What is the interest of citizens? Instead, it can ask itself: What is in the interest of citizens? And it also needs to try to convince Europeans of its legitimacy on the basis of its results. Heidelberg-based international law expert Armin von Bogdandy speaks of "gubernative (sic) law-making" and expresses similarly paternalistic ideas when he argues that it is the executive which should decide which rules are to apply in Europe.

These are ideas from the theory of so-called "output" democracy, in which more weight is placed on the persuasive power of results than legitimization through "input" from democratic opinion-shaping processes within the population.

The notion of Europe as an output democracy is an apt description of what is now happening in Brussels. For instance, last week's "output" from the EU's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, was probably convincing for a majority of European citizens: She fined two large energy providers, Germany's  E.on and France's GDF Suez, €553 million ($781 million) each because of a profiteering cartel agreement between the companies. And it is correct to point out that this outcome could only be achieved because Brussels was not required to pay any heed to democratically elected decision-makers in Germany, for example.
The German government may have no problems with legitimacy, but it is also immensely pro-industry. Germany's ruling grand coalition government would never have dared to inflict such a blow on a German energy giant like E.on.

Are we better off under this output democracy? Perhaps. The only disadvantage is that it isn't actually a democracy. The shaping of the political will in this brave new political world does not take place from the bottom up, but precisely the other way around.

The judges have taken a stance against this system. That stance is important not just because of their appeal to the democratic principles of the German constitution, the Basic Law, which, from the court's


Page 143 of 157 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
standpoint, are sacrosanct. It is -- and this is their second major achievement -- also a serious attempt to rethink democracy for the age of major supranational decisions.
German Parliamentarians Must See European Politics as Their Responsibility

The far-reaching responsibility which the Constitutional Court has given the German Bundestag -- and other national parliaments -- in relation to European politics, creates a new role for the traditional parliamentary system. Under the classical model of democracy, the parliament is responsible for every decision that is to be made within the territory of the community known as the "nation" -- in other words, for domestic policy. Members of parliament are only very indirectly responsible for those issues that affect others, namely foreign policy. Representing the nation beyond its borders has since time immemorial been the responsibility of the executive branch. Under that model, a member of parliament knows very little
about foreign affairs.

But Europe is the ever-more-convincing proof that domestic and foreign policy can no longer be separated from each other. Each member of the government who sits on a council of ministers in Brussels is simultaneously carrying out both German and European politics. Each German representative on a
council should, in the best-case scenario, take the EU's other 26 members into account when making decisions. Naturally he or she has taken an oath to serve German interests. But that is exactly why the European Union exists: so that everyone does not simply represent his or her own interests, but also considers the interests of others, in a spirit of solidarity. If the political arena is being relocated in this way from the nation-state to Brussels, then it is only logical that the sphere of responsibility of the parliament, which is elected to control the executive, should relocate too. That is exactly what the Federal Constitutional Court is demanding: The Bundestag -- even the Bundestag -- must become a European parliament. And Bundestag members must see European politics as their responsibility, and not just as foreign policy.
Governments Must Learn to Explain Europe

The most important counter-argument to this position is that members of parliament would be out of their depth under that scenario. In the past, they have failed miserably when confronted with challenges involving EU politics -- such as when the guidelines from Brussels regarding the European Arrest Warrant were being discussed. Then, too, it was the Federal Constitutional Court that in 2005 stopped the overhasty and unconstitutional implementation of the Brussels guidelines into German law. The
Bundestag members who appeared before the Constitutional Court to argue their case stuttered like schoolboys in front of the judges. They could not say what they thought -- because they had not thought about anything.

In a representative parliament whose scope does not include big-picture politics, lawmakers are not used to taking responsibility for the actual subject matter of issues. Members of parliament play the role of providing a majority for the government -- or preventing it from forming a majority. End of story. Thus, it is not surprising that the Bundestag failed to reclaim for itself its right to exercise control when it came to the German laws relating to the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty.

Who, if not the Federal Constitutional Court, could have acted to change things? The Lisbon Treaty verdict is a massive appeal -- no, order -- to the people's representatives to finally engage with European issues. "A lot of work and little recognition," is how Bundestag member Gunther Krichbaum once described his work on the Bundestag's European Union committee, which he chairs. Is that all that Europe means for German democracy?

Card-carrying Europeans seem unanimous in the view that national legitimization of European decisions is impossible in the long run. A democracy consisting of 27 national parliaments would be too noisy, too slow and too nationalistic, they argue. But the Constitutional Court has neither ruled that political decisions by German government members who are on councils of ministers in Brussels need to be subject to approval by the Bundestag, nor ruled out further steps toward greater European integration. It is only trying to prevent the Bundestag from refusing to take responsibility for all these things. It is trying to prevent the situation where, in the words of the former Constitutional Court judge Dieter Grimm, "European politics continue to be conducted behind the Bundestag's back." The government should have leeway to make decisions in Brussels, just as it does in the national sphere, as long as it has the confidence of the Bundestag.

Tying European Union politics once again to the responsibilities of the parliament also means that future European integration will, in individual cases, need to be based on goals that can be communicated to the electorate. As of now, European integration is no longer something that will automatically continue by itself
-- in individual cases, the government must be able to explain to voters the utility of further steps toward greater integration, and those steps need to have majority support. Explain Europe: That will be the challenge for all the fervent Europeans among German democrats.

Nothing Is Simple in a United Europe

The Constitutional Court's model of a Europe of European parliaments is not as impracticable as distraught Europeans are making it out to be. It all comes down to the Bundestag members -- in contrast to the election campaigners in the ranks of Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union, with their
garbled calls for grassroots democracy and the right to unlimited control -- thinking about how they can be good Europeans.

So far, however, Europe's political thinkers have only come up with provisional ideas about how that could work. The Munich sociologist Ulrich Beck, for example, talks of a creative political culture within a "Europe of differences." Under this model, national parliaments would promote, in the words of former
Constitutional Court judge Dieter Grimm, "public discourse about European politics" within member states. The Frankfurt lawyer Erhard Denninger believes that a sense of "European solidarity" would emerge from an open competition between democracies.

And Ralf Dahrendorf, the respected German-British sociologist who died in June, even referred to ideas from the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in a bid to endow members of Western parliaments with a Kantian categorical imperative to be cosmopolitan. In a play on a famous line of Kant's, Dahrendorf writes: "Act in a way that your action's maxim could be seen as a principle of a global civic constitution that administers a universal law."

Not even the Federal Constitutional Court could have said it in a more complicated way. But then nothing is simple in a united Europe.

EUROPEAN UNION authorities, which recently imposed hefty  fines on chipmaker Intel and utilities E.ON and GDF Suez, intend to increase pressure on these sectors, the EU’s antitrust chief said yesterday.
The European  Commission, tasked with ensuring fair play in the EU, will also target erring
drug-makers and transport companies that breach EU antitrust rules,  Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes said. "You will see us continuing to look deeply at key sectors such as pharmaceuticals,
energy, transport and technology," she said at a think-tank in Dublin.

French gas incumbent GDF Suez is offering to sell competitors entry capacity rights at the French borders that will leave it with less than half the total by 2014. To appease the European  Commission's competition directorate it will shed up to 3.1 billion cubic meters/year of import pipeline capacity from October 1, 2010, and up to 4.175 billion cubic meters/year of liquefied natural gas terminal capacity by October 2011.

And as French import capacity is to grow at a faster rate than GDF Suez will book it, the company has said it will to have less than half the total long-term capacity by the start of the 2014 gas year.

TD
The offer is part of GDF Suez's bid to settle an antitrust case brought by the European  Commission over suspected abuse of its dominant market position in France. GDF Suez has offered from October 1, 2010, to "sell to third parties firm long-term capacities" of 2.76 Bcm/year (80 GWh/day) at the German border entry point Obergailbach and 0.34 Bcm/year (10 GWh/d) at the Belgian border entry point Taisnieres-H, said the notice.

This is to continue for the "remaining duration of GDF Suez's capacity bookings still to run" when and if the EC decides to make the commitments binding, the notice said. GDF Suez has also offered to sell to third parties equivalent upstream transport capacities until September 30, 2027, at the Waidhaus entry point and the Medelsheim exit point in Germany and until September 30, 2025, at the Zeebrugge entry point and the Blaregnies exit point in Belgium.

And if buyers request it, GDF Suez has offered to sell equivalent capacity until September 30, 2018, on the Interconnector gas pipeline at the "NBP exit" entry point in the UK and at the "Zeebrugge IZT entry zone" exit point in Belgium.
GDF Suez has also offered to sell third parties firm long-term capacities of 1 Bcm/year from October 1,
2010, and another 1 Bcm/year from October 1, 2011, in the Montoir de Bretagne LNG terminal, as well
as 2.175 Bcm/year from January 1, 2011, in the Fos Cavaou LNG terminal.

Some 0.175 Bcm/year of the Fos Cavaou available capacity "will primarily benefit transporters having booked short-term capacities" the notice said. GDF Suez has also offered to limit its reserved share of firm long-term French entry capacity to below half the total available from October 1, 2014 at the latest until October 1, 2024.
And it has offered from October 1, 2014, to October 1, 2021, to limit its capacity bookings for October 1,
2024, to October 1, 2029, to below half the total firm long-term entry capacities available as at October 1,
2014.

"For the purpose of the commitments, the gas entry points include all existing and future gas entry points in France, including the Spain-France entry point," the notice said (IGR 626/27).

GDF Suez said that it was "offering to invest in more infrastructure so that by 2014 our reserved share
will only be about half of the available capacity – down from two thirds today." Interested parties had until
early September to tell the EC if they thought GDF Suez's commitments would remedy the antitrust
concerns.

The EC has said that it intends, if the market responds favorably, to make the commitments legally binding. That would close the antitrust case without ruling whether GDF Suez had broken EU rules or not, thus avoiding potential  fines.
Giant fines for GDF Suez,  E.ON Ruhrgas

In a separate case, GDF Suez and  E.ON Ruhrgas have each been fined Eur553 ($773) million for breaking competition law, which the two companies are appealing.
The EC said that  E.ON predecessor Ruhrgas and GDF Suez predecessor Gaz de France "agreed in
1975, when they decided jointly to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into
Germany and France, not to sell gas transported over this pipeline in each other's home markets."

The size of the  fine – above expectations, the second biggest ever imposed for a cartel and the first in the energy sector – was partly to do with the value of the gas sold during the period of the infringement as well as the turnover of the two companies. But the  competition directorate told Platts that it decided to cap the E.ONfine at the GDF Suez level, although of the two, it was the bigger company and it had been benefiting from the agreement for two years longer.
The EC started its investigation following surprise inspections carried out in  E.ON and GDF premises in
Germany and France in 2006.
The Megal pipeline transports gas across southern Germany from the German-Czech and
German-Austrian borders to the French-German border in the west. When the companies decided to
build it in 1975 they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any Megal gas in Germany
and Ruhrgas would not sell any in France.

GDF enjoyed a legal monopoly to import gas into France until August 2000, while German suppliers had non-compete agreements of their own in place until they were made illegal in April 1998. But the German and French companies maintained the market-sharing agreement even after European gas markets were opened to competition by EC law in August 2000, the EC said. "The companies met on a regular basis
at various levels, discussed the implementation of the agreement in the newly liberalized market and monitored each other's actions," the EC said. "The parties' contacts after 1999 confirmed that there was a single and continuous anticompetitive market-sharing agreement in breach of antitrust law." The agreement remained in effect until September 2005, the EC said.

Germany and France were among the countries opposing full unbundling when the third package of measures was introduced to liberalize gas and power markets in the member states of the European Union.
Both strenuously denied the  fines were appropriate.  E.ON said that the agreements put in place back in
1975 had been needed to secure investment in the Megal pipeline, but were never implemented and
were formally repealed by the companies in 2004.

"The companies did not contravene EU law at any time,"  E.ON said. GDF Suez said that it had always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany and it was now  E.ON's main foreign competitor in the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market. Looking at previous experience of appeals against cartel  fines, competition lawyer Julianne O'Leary of London firm Stephenson Harwood said the success rate has not been great.

But there have been more cases where  fines have been reduced, she said, and also one where the appeal against the  fine was approved but the fine increased since the original methodology, which the appellant said was flawed, yielded a lower fine than the court ruled the proper methodology did.

The two companies might argue the case about parent company responsibility, which is almost without exception challenged in these cases, she said. It was Ruhrgas that entered into the agreement, not its present owner E.ON, and Gaz de France then was state controlled. "Interesting questions could arise out of the question of state control," she said in an interview. "But we will see more of these undertakings, such as GDF Suez and  E.ON have made. They will do more for  competition than directives."

HD      GAS MARKETS : E.ON AND GDF SUEZ TO FIGHT ONE BILLION EURO FINES WC     689 words

Both E.ON and GDF Suez will appeal against their €553 million fines for alleged market-sharing in France and Germany. The  fines, imposed by the European Commission on 8 July, relate to alleged breaches of EC Treaty rules on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article 81). The case goes back to an agreement signed in 1975 for the construction of the MEGAL pipeline across Germany.

The Commission notes that when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France (GDF) decided, in 1975, to build the MEGAL pipeline, they explicitly agreed in two letters that GDF would not sell any gas transported over the MEGAL in Germany. Likewise, Ruhrgas would not sell gas in France. The MEGAL pipeline, jointly owned and operated by E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF Suez, transports Russian gas across the German-Czech and German-Austrian borders to the French-German border in the West.

TD
The Commission originally sent a statement of objections to  E.ON, E.ON Ruhrgas and GDF back in June 2008. The case against  E.ON and GDF originates in "surprise" inspections at the companies' sites in France and Germany carried out in May 2006. Formal proceedings against the two companies were then opened, in July 2007. The  Commission even had to impose a  fine of €38 million on  E.ON for breach of the  Commission seal during the inspection.

The Commission maintains that the market-sharing agreement continued after European gas markets were liberalised. The two companies only halted the practice definitely in 2005. This is despite GDF's legal monopoly to import natural gas into France ending in August 2000. Likewise, Ruhrgas was protected from  competition in Germany by a system of demarcation agreements' with other German suppliers. Such agreements became illegal in April 1998.
COMPLETE DISAGREEMENT

In a statement, GDF Suez expressed its "complete" disagreement with the  Commission's conclusion that GDF Suez and  E.ON had colluded until 2005 in order to limit  competition on their respective markets. "The group also calls attention to the fact that the legal and regulatory context of the time was very different from that of the energy market today," noted the company in its defence. GDF Suez claims that it has always sought to develop and strengthen its presence in Germany.

GDF Suez further notes that it is  E.ON's main foreign competitor on the German natural gas market and a key player in opening the German energy market. The company will be filing an appeal against the Commission's decision at the EU's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

E.ON Ruhrgas will also appeal to the ECJ's Court of First Instance. "The  Commission assumes the occurrence of market collusion, which never took place between the companies, not even in the period from 2003 to 2005. It also ignores economic parameters.  Competition has long become reality on the European gas market," said  E.ON Ruhrgas CEO Bernhard Reutersberg.

The decision, but "especially" the high  fine, were incomprehensible, according to  E.ON Ruhrgas. The German company claims the agreements concluded during construction of the MEGAL pipeline were needed to secure the pipeline investment.  E.ON adds that they were not relevant to market developments, were never implemented and were formally repealed by the companies in 2004.  E.ON Ruhrgas further notes that it sold 8.7 billion kWh of gas in France in 2008. "No other major European gas supplier has managed to secure a larger share of the French gas market. There was certainly no market sharing, as claimed by the  Commission," said the company.

Announcing the Commission's decision to the press, on 8 July,  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes hoped these first Commission fines imposed for an anti-trust infringement in the energy sector would send a strong signal to energy incumbents. "Despite the legally binding decision by Europe's governments to open up the gas market to  competition, these companies continued to apply their
market-sharing agreement until September 2005, even after publicly declaring the original agreement null and void' in August 2004," said Kroes.

Despite the European  Commission getting EU member states to agree to energy sector liberalization directives, progress has been slow as national governments and companies drag their feet over implementation. However, competition law, and the harsh penalties it can exact, is proving a more potent force. In July, energy giants E.ON of Germany and GDF Suez of France were both issued with
€553 million ($772 million)  fines for agreeing not to compete in each other's gas markets.

This is the first  fine imposed for an anti-trust infringement in the EU energy sector, and the second largest fine ever issued, according to the European  Commission. The size of the  fines, which was at
the top end of expectations, was guided by the level of gas sales made from gas transported through the Megal pipeline – the subject of the investigation – the  Commission said. Both  E.ON and GDF have said they disagree with the judgment and will appeal.

TD
The Commission carried out surprise inspections at  E.ON and GDF premises in Germany and France in
2006. Formal proceedings were opened in July 2007 and a formal objection issued in June 2008.
The Megal pipeline transports gas across southern Germany from the German-Czech and
German-Austrian borders to the French-German border in the west. When what was then Ruhrgas and
GDF decided to build the pipeline in 1975 they explicitly agreed that GDF would not sell any Megal gas in
Germany and Ruhrgas would not sell any in France. GDF enjoyed a legal monopoly to import gas into
France until August 2000, while German suppliers had non-compete agreements of their own in place
until they were made illegal in April 1998. However, according to the  Commission, the agreement
remained in place even after the  Commission ordered the opening of gas markets in 2000.

The completion of the investigation and size of the  fines serve as a warning to other companies facing EU competition probes. They also reinforce the message that striking a deal that progresses the Commission's liberalization agenda can be less painful than fighting an investigation to its conclusion.

As in US anti-trust cases, this pits risk against justice. Any company facing an anti-trust probe has to weigh up the costs of fighting the case and potentially incurring a huge penalty against quick capitulation and cooperation. In some cases, innocence can often be more expensive and riskier to prove than to accept undue guilt and a lower  fine. An alternative is to pre-empt the  Commission's position, with the company concerned effectively punishing itself.

The European  Commission is clearly prepared to accept divestments that improve  competition in return for closing cases without a judgment. The precedent was set last year in the electricity sector, when the Commission accepted a proposal by  E.ON to sell its power grid to an independent operator and 4.8 GW of generating capacity to competitors to avoid anti-trust action. The  Commission consulted interested parties on the commitments and concluded that they were necessary and proportionate to remedy the concerns. The proposal was accepted.  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said at the time that for "the first time in European anti-trust history, a company is divesting very significant assets to address competition concerns." The anti-trust investigation centered on the allegation that  E.ON may have withdrawn available generation capacity from German wholesale electricity markets.

In similar fashion, GDF Suez announced in July an offer to sell competitors entry capacity rights on gas pipelines at the French borders that will leave it with less than half the total by 2014. The company will shed up to 3.1 Bcm/year of import pipeline capacity from October 1, 2010, and up to 4.175 Bcm/yr of LNG terminal capacity by October 2011. The offer is part of GDF Suez's bid to settle an antitrust case brought by the  Commission over suspected abuse of its dominant market position in France.

GDF Suez also said that it was "offering to invest in more infrastructure so that by 2014 our reserved share will only be about half of the available capacity – down from two thirds today." Interested parties have until early September to tell the  Commission if they think GDF Suez's offer would remedy the antitrust concerns. The  Commission has said that it intends, if the market responds favorably, to make the commitments legally binding. That would close the antitrust case without ruling, whether GDF Suez has broken EU rules or not, thus avoiding potentially huge  fines.

While E.ON and GDF Suez have said they will appeal the  fines imposed upon them by the  Commission, previous experience suggests only a limited chance of success.  Competition lawyer Julianne O'Leary of Stephenson Harwood in London said the success rate has not been great.

There have been more cases where fines have been reduced, she said, and also one where the appeal against the  fine was approved but the fine increased. The two firms might argue the case about parent company responsibility, which is almost without exception challenged in these cases, she said. It was Ruhrgas that entered into the agreement, not its present owner  E.ON, while GDF was state controlled at the time.

Other European energy companies face ongoing investigations and the twin examples of  fines for E.ON and GDF Suez in one case and GDF Suez's offer to divest partially its hold on gas import capacity in another will not be lost of Italian energy giant Eni. Eni faces having to sell its stakes in the TENP and Transitgas natural gas pipelines, as well as in the companies managing the capacity rights in TENP, Transitgas and TAG gas pipelines, if the  Commission finds against it.

Eni received a formal 'statement of objections' from the European  Commission in March, which alleged that from 2000-2005, Eni was responsible for limiting third-party access to the TAG gas pipeline through Austria and to the TENP and Transitgas pipelines through Germany to Italy. The  Commission opened a formal antitrust probe into Eni in April 2007 after surprise raids on its offices.

HD        Gas cartel fine is latest to top the €1bn mark. BY        Julianne O’Leary

LAST month, the European  Commission imposed fines totalling €1.1bn ($1.6bn) on  E.ON, its subsidiary E.ON Ruhrgas of Germany and GDF Suez of France for market sharing in breach of the European Commission Treaty competition rules on cartels and restrictive business practices (Article
81).

Breaches of  commission competition rules can result in fines of up to 10% of a company’s annual turnover in the previous financial year. A number of recent decisions have resulted in  fines exceeding
€1bn.

TD
The commission started its investigation following surprise inspections (so-called dawn raids) on both companies in 2006. It opened formal proceedings against the two companies in July 2007 and sent a Statement of Objections to both in June 2008.

It is common for the  commission to initiate investigations by dawn raids, often as a result of a customer or other third-party complaint. Increasingly its investigations are the result of one party to a cartel whistleblowing on the arrangement, although this does not appear to be the case here. The
commission sets out the case against the parties in the Statement of Objections and the parties have rights of defence and to be heard in response.

In its recent decision, the  commission found that when Ruhrgas (now  E.ON Ruhrgas, part of the  E.ON group) and Gaz de France (now part of GDF Suez) decided in 1975 to build the Megal pipeline across Germany to import Russian gas into Germany and France, they agreed in two letters that Gaz de France would not sell any gas transported over the Megal pipeline in Germany and neither would Ruhrgas in France.

At the time, the  commission notes, Gaz de France enjoyed a legal monopoly on importing natural gas into France, which was only removed in 2000. At the same time, Ruhrgas’ supply area in Germany was de facto protected from  competition by a system of demarcation agreements with other German suppliers until such agreements became illegal in April 1998.
The commission found that both parties maintained their market-sharing agreement even after
European gas markets were opened to  competition from August 2000 by Directive 98/30/EC.

The commission stated that the parties met on a regular basis at various levels, discussed the implementation of the agreement in the newly liberalised market and monitored each other’s actions. It said the parties’ contacts after 1999 confirmed that there was a market-sharing agreement in breach of Article 81.

The commission found that, although the parties declared in August 2004 that they had long regarded the letters as “null and void”, they continued until the end of September 2005 to implement the prohibition imposed on Gaz de France not to supply in Germany gas that had been transported over the Megal pipeline.

These are the first commission fines imposed for a cartel infringement in the energy sector, and the second highest fines ever imposed by the commission on a cartel. The highest such  fine to date was on the car glass cartel in November 2008, where the commission imposed fines of nearly €1.4bn.

The commission concluded that the agreement between the parties constituted a very serious infringement of the European  Commission competition rules and imposed a fine of €553m on each company.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the  commission will not tolerate any form of anticompetitive behaviour.

“Market sharing is one of the worst types of antitrust infringement. The agreement deprived customers of more price competition and more choice of supplier in two of the largest gas markets in the European Union. The commission has no alternative but to impose high  fines.”

Both companies have announced that they intend to appeal to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. GDF Suez has expressed its complete disagreement with the  commission’s conclusion. E.ON Ruhrgas has said that “the decision and especially the high  fines are not understandable”. The appeals would need to be lodged in Luxembourg in a little over two months from the date of the decision. Proceedings before the European courts can take a number of years.

There are no details as yet regarding the proposed grounds of appeal. In practice, it is reasonably rare for a commission decision to be overturned in its entirety. The parties will be likely to seek a reduction in the amount of the  fines, at the very least.

In a recent speech, Commissioner Kroes noted that energy was one of the “key sectors” which the commission will “be continuing to look deeply at”. Her statement also signals that the  commission will continue to focus its attention on energy incumbents.

Separately, GDF Suez has also recently offered the  commission certain commitments to remedy concerns about a possible abuse of its dominant position in the French gas sector. GDF Suez has not acknowledged any infringement.
The proposed commitments would involve the company immediately releasing a large share of its
long-term reservations of gas import into France. Commissioner Kroes has said that this would continue
until GDF Suez’s share was below 50% and that improved access to infrastructure is essential for
effective  competition.

“The proposed commitments could make it easier for would-be competitors to enter the French gas market and so contribute to delivering the benefits of the Single Market to French energy consumers in terms of greater choice of gas supplier and more  competition on process,” she said. The  commission is currently market testing these.

Neither the fine nor the GDF Suez commitments form part of the  commission’s energy sector inquiry, on which the commission published its final report in January 2007. However, they do reflect the commission’s continuing focus on the energy sector.

International talks are underway to secure Ukraine the funding to pay Russia for natural gas, to ensure deliveries to Europe can be guaranteed this winter, writes Keith Nuthall. The European  Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have been meeting with Russian and Ukraine officials to head off a repeat of last winter's supply crisis. Ukraine claims it needs around $4bn to stockpile Russian gas in the summer when demand is low, although European Union (EU) officials (quoted anonymously) claim Kiev needs significantly less - maybe $2bn.

- Germany's E.ON Ruhrgas and France's GdF have promised to resist an EC cartel  fine of EUR533mn each for allegedly cooperating on dividing natural gas market shares in national markets. The penalty follows a 1975 agreement by the then Ruhrgas and Gaz de France over their joint construction of the MEGAL pipeline across Germany, to import Russian gas into Germany and France. They agreed not to sell gas in each other's home markets, continuing the deal after EU energy markets were liberalised, until
2005. EU  Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the EC will not tolerate any form of anti-competitive behaviour.'

- Meanwhile, in a separate case, the EC is consulting interested parties on commitments offered by GdF to remedy concerns it has broken EU dominant market position rules in the gas sector. Brussels feared that GdF might be illegally restricting competitors from accessing gas import capacity into France. GdF has not admitted any infringement, but is offering a major reduction in long-term reservations in this capacity. Brussels said it could make these promises binding and thereby waive potential legal action.

- EU ministers have approved tougher contingency plans to help Europe deal with an oil supply crisis, although the reforms were weaker than the EC had requested. Under the new system, at least one-third of emergency 90-day stocks held by member states must match existing consumption patterns. Also, the EC has new powers to audit stocks to help advise on crisis distribution.

- Formal approval has been secured at the EU Council of Ministers for the EU's internal market energy package, including new rules on unbundling and the establishment of a more coordinated regulatory system for cross-border gas sales.

- Agreement has been struck at the EU Council of Ministers over the inclusion of combustion installations in oil refineries within the EU's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive. Ministers agreed existing large combustion plants being brought under this law must operate under current 'best available techniques' on emissions controls by 2019, with standards being tightened from 2016. New plants would have to meet these standards earlier - probably by 2011.
- Gazprom has admitted that its gas sales to Europe could fall 40% this year compared to 2008.

- The potential liberalisation and regularisation of EU trades in gas and oil with Russia, through its anticipated membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), could be delayed. Moscow now says it will only join the WTO as part of a customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus - a problem given Moscow-Minsk relations are cooling.

- A planned acquisition of Dutch gas and electricity company Essent by RWE, of Germany, has been approved by the EC, albeit on condition that RWE divests Essent's controlling shareholding in energy company Stadtwerke Bremen.

- The eight Baltic Sea EU member states have signed a memorandum of understanding on boosting energy interconnections between the countries. Electricity will be an initial priority, but a regional 'high level group' of these countries has also agreed to boost gas links, including reverse flow interconnectors and expanded LNG facilities.

- A second annual human rights meeting held between the EU and Turkmenistan might help provide the diplomatic cover that many EU politicians are demanding, to secure a fully-fledged energy cooperation deal between Brussels and this dictatorial - but gas-rich - central Asian republic.

- The new Swedish presidency of the EU has promised to push energy efficiency as a priority, maybe forging formal proposals for potential agreement at this December's EU summit.

- The EBRD is planning to loan EUR200mn to MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas, to help convert a Szoreg-1 reservoir in Hungary's depleting Algy? oil field, into an underground gas storage facility.

- The EIB is planning to lend EUR90mn to an energy consortium including German-owned Bayerngas Norge to help develop southern Norway's Trym gas field, linking it to Danish processing and exportation infrastructure.

- The bank also plans to lend up to EUR150mn to Portugal's REN Gasodutos, REN Atlantico, and REN Armazenagem, to help expand an LNG terminal in Sines; construct a compressor station at Carregado; and expand underground storage at Carrico.
