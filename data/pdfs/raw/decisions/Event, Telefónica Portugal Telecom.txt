BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday slapped a combined  fine of 79 million euros on Telefonica SA (TEF) and  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC.LB) after the two telecommunications firms agreed not to compete with one another in the Iberian market.

The European Commission said the non-compete clause for Spain and Portugal was illegal under European Union law and that Telefonica will be  fined EUR66.9 million euros and Portugal EUR12.3 million.

TD
"The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said.

The two telecoms firms, which are the largest operators in their home countries, inserted the clause in their contract in July 2010 on the back of Telefonica's acquisition of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties. The parties scrapped the agreement in early February 2011, after the commission launched antitrust proceedings.

The commission said in a statement that non-compete clauses were "one of the most serious violations" of EU competition rules and that by agreeing to stay out of each other's home markets, the operators "hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector."

Regulators said the  fine had taken into account the relatively short duration of the deal - four months- and the fact that neither party sought to keep the arrangement under wraps.

LISBON--Portugal  Telecom SGPS SA (PTC.LB) said Wednesday that a 12.3 million euro ($16.4 million) fine imposed by the European Union over a non-compete clause agreed with Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF) is "unjustified," and it may try to have it annulled.

Earlier Wednesday, the  European Commission imposed a combined fine of EUR66.9 million on both telecommunications firms saying their agreement not to compete in the Iberian market was illegal
under European Union law.

TD
The two telecoms firms, which are the largest operators in their home countries, inserted the clause in their contract in July 2010 following Telefonica's acquisition of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties. The parties scrapped the agreement in early February
2011, after the Commission launched antitrust proceedings.

In a statement,  Portugal Telecom said the clause "had neither the object of restricting competition between both companies nor the intent of unlawfully restricting such competition." In addition, the company said it eliminated the clause in February 2011 to avoid any doubts under competition rules.

"PT will consider bringing an action for annulment before the Court of Justice of the European Union once it has the opportunity to examine the full content of the decision and its grounds," it added.

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union has  fined Spanish and Portuguese telecommunications companies Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom 79 million euros (105 million dollars) for agreeing not to compete with one another, the bloc's executive announced Wednesday.

"Non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for consumers," the  European Commission said in a statement.

TD
The non-competition deal was set up in 2010, when Telefonica bought out its Portuguese rival's stake in
Brazilian mobile phone operator Vivo, a joint venture they had set up together.

The commission launched an investigation into the two Iberian operators in early 2011, and they dropped their arrangement weeks later, meaning it was in place for just 4 months.

"The commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"We will not tolerate anti-competitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," he added.

The bulk of the  fine - almost 67 million euros - must be paid by Telefonica, with  Portugal Telecom bearing just over 12 million euros of the penalty, reflecting a difference in the volume of sales. dpa hm jln Author: Helen Maguire

Portugal  Telecom and Telefonica have received a total  fine of EUR 79 million from the European Commission as the result of a non-competition agreement by the operators. The European Commission said that the non-competition clause, valid from September 2010 to February 2011, was contrary to EU law, pointing out it will not tolerate anti-competitive practices by incumbent operators. The EC finedPortugal Telecom EUR 12.3 million and Telefonica EUR 66.9 million.

The operators agreed to not compete against each other in Spain and Portugal when they reached agreement in 2010 for Telefonica to take full control of their Brazilian joint venture Vivo. The
non-competition agreement was ended in 2011 when the EU opened its anti-trust investigation.

Brussels, Jan 23 (EFE).- The European Commission imposed a 79-million-euro ($104.96-million)  fine Wednesday on Spain's Telefonica and Portugal  Telecom for agreeing not to compete against each other in the Iberian market.

The bulk of the  fine, 66.8 million euros, was levied against the Spanish giant, the European Union's executive arm said in a statement.

TD
The EC said a non-compete clause was included in the sales contract for Telefonica's July 2010 acquisition of Brazilian wireless operator Vivo, until then jointly owned by the two European telecom incumbents.

The two companies terminated the clause in early February 2011 after the commission launched anti-trust proceedings, the statement said.

"Non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for consumers," the EC said.

The commission recalled that Telefonica in 2011 earned roughly half of all revenue generated by Spain's telecoms sector.

Telefonica said it will appeal the EC's decision to the European Court of Justice, insisting that "at no time did it break the law" with the agreements reached with PT for the sale of Vivo.

In a press release, Telefonica expressed its "complete disagreement" with the commission's decision, saying that the clause was conditioned on verification of its legality and was never applied.

It added that once the the clause was assessed and found not to be in compliance with EU law it was scrapped from the agreement. EFE

Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom have been fined €79m by Europe's top antitrust authority for agreeing an illegal deal not to compete in their home markets.

The European Commission decision fines the Spanish operator €66.8m and Portugese group €12m for attempting to carve up markets to the detriment of consumers.

TD
"The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector," said Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner. "We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration."

The Commission argues the deal to "preserve the status quo" in the Spanish and Portugese markets held back the integration process in the EU telecoms sector. "Non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for consumers," the statement said.

Brussels served the telecoms groups with formal charges in 2011 over the non-compete clause, which was in place for less than a year.

The clause was part of Telefónica's €7.5bn acquisition of  Portugal Telecom's stake in Vivo, the Brazilian mobile joint venture. According to one person with knowledge of the deal, it followed lengthy negotiations to win the approval for the deal by the Lisbon government, which had originally vetoed a previous agreement.

The limited size of the  fine reflects the willingness of the groups to drop the clause and the short period of time - from July 2010 to February 2011 - that it was in force.

The non-compete clause said that it should be allowable only as permitted under law, said the person, and was withdrawn in February 2011 following interest from Europe's antitrust authorities. However, the regulator has argued that the cancellation does not mitigate the fact that the agreement existed in the first place.

The decision comes as European authorities are taking a closer look at how the telecoms market can be opened up across the region to benefit consumers, given the wider range of pricing and services in different countries. The commission sees the agreement as potentially hindering the creation of a single EU telecoms market.

Although much smaller than the  fine could have been - in theory up to 10 per cent of revenues - the decision is still expected to be opposed by Telefónica. The Spanish group is seeking to reduce its net debt to near €50bn, from €58bn last year, through asset disposals and a flotation of its business unit in Germany. The companies are likely to appeal the decision.
Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom were not immediately available for comment.

BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Spain's Telefonica said it would appeal after regulators  fined it and Portugal Telecom a total of 79 million euros ($105 million) for breaching EU rules by agreeing not to compete with each other in the Iberian market.

The European Commission said the deal between Telefonica , Europe's biggest telecoms company by revenues, and Portugal  Telecom lasted from September 2010 to the end of 2011.

The EU competition authority  fined Telefonica 66.89 million euros and  Portugal Telecom 12.29 million euros following a 10-month investigation that began in January 2011.
Telefonica said it "strongly disagreed" with the fine and would appeal the decision with the
Luxembourg-based EU Court of Justice, while Portugal  Telecom threatened to follow suit.
The non-compete deal was linked to Telefonica's 2010 buyout of the stake held by  Portugal Telecom
in their Brazilian joint venture, Vivo.

The Commission said the two companies' agreement hindered the creation of a single EU telecoms market and could have led to higher consumer prices.

"We will not tolerate anti-competitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. ($1 = 0.7530 euros)

The European Commission has imposed fines of € 66 894 000 on Telefónica and of € 12 290 000 on Portugal  Telecom for deciding not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets. Both companies have violated the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) which prohibits anti-competitive agreements on the grounds of affecting trade in the EU Single Market.

As Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia stated: "The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration."

In July 2010, in the context of the acquisition by Telefónica of the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties, the two companies made an agreement not to compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010. However, the Commission opened antitrust proceedings since non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules due to the fact that they undermine the open and competitive market. As a result, the companies decided to terminate the non-compete agreement in February 2011.
The Commission imposed the  fines, after taking into account the duration of the infringement, which was
4 months, and its gravity, including the fact that the agreement was not kept secret. The early termination
of the agreement was also taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance.
Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom are the largest telecoms operators in Spain and Portugal respectively.

European Union anti-trust authorities announced on Wednesday a  fine of 79 million euros ($105 million)
against Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom for breaching EU competition rules in Portugal and Spain.

The European Commission said it had slapped a  fine of 66,894 euros on Telefónica and 12,290 euros on Portugal  Telecom "for agreeing not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets."

The EU executive said that the breach occurred after the July 2010 acquisition by Telefonica of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, until then jointly owned by both companies, each the largest telecoms operator in their home country.

"The parties inserted a clause in the contract indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010" but terminated the non-compete agreement in February 2011 after the Commission opened antitrust proceedings, a statement said.

European Union anti-trust authorities announced on Wednesday a  fine of 79 million euros ($105 million)
against Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom for breaching EU competition rules in Portugal and Spain.

The European Commission said it had slapped a  fine of 66.9 million euros on Telefonica and 12.3 million euros on Portugal  Telecom "for agreeing not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets."

TD
The EU executive said that the breach occurred after the July 2010 acquisition by Telefonica of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, until then jointly owned by both companies, as Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom each became the biggest telecoms operators in their respective countries.

"The parties inserted a clause in the contract indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010" but terminated the non-compete agreement in February 2011 after the Commission opened antitrust proceedings, a statement said.

"We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," said the EU Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia.

Portugal Telecom said that the  fine, of which it has yet to be formally notified, "is unjustified and inappropriate to any possible unworthiness of its conduct."

The company said that the clause in question didn't have the intent or effect to limit competition, that steps were taken to ensure it didn't and that it was eliminated after several months.

Portugal Telecom said it would study seeking an annulment of the  fine before the EU's Court of Justice once it had received and reviewed the decision.

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday slapped a combined  fine of 79 million euros on Telefonica SA (TEF) and  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC.LB) after the two telecommunications firms agreed not to compete with one another in the Iberian market.

The European Commission said the non-compete clause for Spain and Portugal was illegal under European Union law and that Telefonica will be  fined EUR66.9 million euros and Portugal EUR12.3 million.

"The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said.

The two telecoms firms, which are the largest operators in their home countries, inserted the clause in their contract in July 2010 on the back of Telefonica's acquisition of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties. The parties scrapped the agreement in early February 2011, after the commission launched antitrust proceedings.

The commission said in a statement that non-compete clauses were "one of the most serious violations" of EU competition rules and that by agreeing to stay out of each other's home markets, the operators "hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector."

Regulators said the  fine had taken into account the relatively short duration of the deal - four months- and the fact that neither party sought to keep the arrangement under wraps.

HD           Portugal Telecom Says EU Fine 'Unjustified,' May Take Action

LISBON--Portugal  Telecom SGPS SA (PTC.LB) said Wednesday that a 12.3 million euro ($16.4 million) fine imposed by the European Union over a non-compete clause agreed with Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF) is "unjustified," and it may try to have it annulled.

Earlier Wednesday, the  European Commission imposed a combined fine of EUR66.9 million on both telecommunications firms saying their agreement not to compete in the Iberian market was illegal
under European Union law.

TD
The two telecoms firms, which are the largest operators in their home countries, inserted the clause in their contract in July 2010 following Telefonica's acquisition of Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties. The parties scrapped the agreement in early February
2011, after the Commission launched antitrust proceedings.

In a statement,  Portugal Telecom said the clause "had neither the object of restricting competition between both companies nor the intent of unlawfully restricting such competition." In addition, the company said it eliminated the clause in February 2011 to avoid any doubts under competition rules.

"PT will consider bringing an action for annulment before the Court of Justice of the European Union once it has the opportunity to examine the full content of the decision and its grounds," it added.

HD              EC fines Telefónica,  Portugal Telecom US$105mn for "non-compete" pact

LP
Spanish telco Telefónica (NYSE: TEF) has said it will appeal a 79mn euro (US$105mn)  fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) on the telco and  Portugal Telecom (PT) (NYSE: PT) for agreeing not to compete with each other in their home markets.

Europe's antitrust commission  fined Telefónica 66.9mn euros and  Portugal Telecom 12.3mn euros over the pact, it said in a statement on Wednesday.

TD
The parties included a temporary non-compete clause during 2010 negotiations over Telefónica's purchase of Portugal Telecom's stake in the jointly-owned Brazilian mobile operator Vivo.
Telefónica ended up paying 7.5bn euros in the deal in July that year.
The EC said the telcos had been in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (TFEU) which prohibits anti-competitive agreements.

The agreement not to compete was in place from the end of September 2010 and was terminated by the companies in early February 2011 after the commission opened antitrust proceedings.

"We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," the EC's VP in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said.

Telefónica said in a statement on Wednesday that both parties had agreed to eliminate the clause after a legal assessment showed it could not be applied.

The telco protested its innocence saying that at the time the agreement was signed there had been no attempt to make a "secret pact or attempt to conceal it, which ratifies the fact that it was never intended to breach the current legislation."

The company added that the agreements between Telefónica and PT never had any effect on consumers or the market.

The fine comes at an awkward time for Telefónica, when the company is seeking to reduce debt through the sale of non-core or underperforming assets to help it face the complicated scenario in the European market.

Telefónica aggressively pursued PT's stake in Vivo in 2010, seeing it as key to developing its business in Latin America's largest market where it faces fierce competition from the Brazil-owned Oi (NYSE: OIBR) and Carlos Slim's América Móvil (NYSE: AMX), which operates under the Claro
brand.
Like Slim, Telefónica foresaw synergies between its Sao Paulo-based fixed-line business Telesp and
Vivo.

At the end of December, 2012, Vivo continued to lead the mobile telephony market with a market share of 29.1%, followed by TIM with 26.9%, Claro with 24.6%, and Oi with 18.8%.

4G auction: The bidding for 4G spectrum has kicked off in earnest after Ofcom opened the auction. Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three will compete for the slices of spectrum in the lower frequency, while other companies, including BT and PCCW, the Hong Kong telecoms conglomerate, will compete for
higher-frequency airwaves to launch mobile broadband services. Fines: The European Commission has fined Telefónica, the Spanish owner of O2, and Portugal  Telecom for anti-competitive behaviour. It fined Telefónica €67 million (£56.2 million) and Portugal  Telecom €12.3 million after it said the companies had agreed not to compete with each other in their home markets in 2010 during negotiations over the sale of the Brazilian mobile phone company Vivo.

Spanish court orders 1st probe of civil-war crimes

Barcelona (EFE).- A Spanish court ordered an investigation into the Italian military's 1937-1939 aerial bombardments of Barcelona, the first such judicial probe of Spanish Civil War-era crimes.

TD
The ruling overturns a lower court's decision to reject the case, which was brought by the Barcelona chapter of the Italian anti-fascist group L'Altra Italia and two victims of the airstrikes.

The bombings of densely populated neighborhoods "are notable because it was a civilian target, since the battlefront was very far away" and they served as a "testing ground" for similar, subsequent crimes, the Barcelona Provincial Court said.

The court's acceptance of the case, filed with it a year ago after Spain's National Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to investigate the matter," marks the first time a Spanish court has applied international law on war crimes and crimes against humanity in ordering an investigation into alleged atrocities committed during the 1936-1939 civil war.

Mexico City (EFE).- Plastic bags containing dismembered bodies were found in the central Mexican city of
Toluca, sources in the Mexico state government told Efe.

Several suspected members of the La Familia Michoacana drug cartel have been arrested in connection with the gruesome discovery, the sources said.

Investigators suggest the suspects may also have been responsible for the deaths of the more than 30 people whose bodies were found over the course of Jan. 12-14 at various spots in the Valley of Mexico, which encompasses Mexico state and the Federal District.



EU regulators  fine Telefonica,  Portugal Telecom

Brussels (EFE).- The European Commission imposed a 79-million-euro ($104.96-million)  fine on Spain's Telefonica and Portugal  Telecom for agreeing not to compete against each other in the Iberian market.

The bulk of the  fine, 66.8 million euros, was levied against the Spanish giant, the European Union's executive arm said in a statement.

The EC said a non-compete clause was included in the sales contract for Telefonica's July 2010 acquisition of Brazilian wireless operator Vivo, until then jointly owned by the two European telecom incumbents.

The two companies terminated the clause in early February 2011 after the commission launched anti-trust proceedings, the statement said.

Mexico City (EFE).- The Mexican Supreme Court ordered the immediate release of Florence Cassez, a Frenchwoman convicted of kidnapping and other crimes in Mexico and sentenced to serve 60 years in prison.

The decision was approved by a majority of the members of the First Chamber of the high court, which changed an initial opinion that called for the case to be sent back to a lower court due to irregularities in the prosecution and trial.
The high court voted 3-2 to release Cassez without any conditions.

Earlier Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told France Info radio that the government was confident that the Mexican Supreme Court would throw out Cassez's prison sentence.



Stephens knocks Serena Williams out of Australian Open
International Sports Desk (EFE).- American teenager Sloane Stephens produced the biggest upset of the
2013 Australian Open, knocking fellow American Serena Williams out of the tournament with a 3-6, 7-5,
6-4 win in the quarterfinals.

"Today, I just really didn't have anything to lose. I mean, you're playing for the semis of a Grand Slam. You just got to go out and do it really," the 19-year-old Stephens said after the match.
The 31-year-old Williams, who was the No. 3 seed, had not lost a set in the tournament and coasted to a
6-3 win in the first set.
"This morning when I got up, I was like, look, dude, like, you can do this. Like, go out and play and do
your best," Stephens said in response to a question about whether she believed she could win the match.



Spain's economy contracts 1.3 pct

Madrid (EFE).- The Spanish economy contracted 1.3 percent in 2012, with the recession intensifying in the last quarter of the year and the gross domestic product falling 0.60 percent, compared to the previous quarter, while the unemployment rate neared 26 percent, the Bank of Spain said.

The drop in the GDP was due to a decline in domestic consumption and investment, the Bank of Spain said.

Employment fell last year at a faster rate than in 2011, with the drop estimated at 4.3 percent, due in large part to cuts in public sector jobs, the central bank said.

Public sector employment fell last year for the first time since the recession started as Spain's regional governments implemented austerity measures, the Bank of Spain said.

MOBILE & TELECOMS

Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom have been fined €79m by Europe's top antitrust authority for illegally agreeing not to compete in their home markets.

TD
The European Commission decision decided to  fine the Spanish operator €66.8m and the Portuguese group €12m for attempting to carve up markets to the detriment of consumers.

"The commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector," said Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner. "We will not tolerate anti-competitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration."

The clause was part of Telefónica's €7.5bn acquisition of  Portugal Telecom's stake in Vivo, the Brazilian mobile joint venture. The commission argued the deal to "preserve the status quo" in the Spanish and Portuguese markets held back integration in the EU telecoms sector .

"Non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for consumers," the statement said.

Telefónica will appeal against the decision to the European Court of Justice, saying it did not breach the law as the clause was subject to compliance with regulation and never applied.
Brussels served formal charges in 2011.
The limited  fine reflects the groups' willingness to drop the clause and the short period of time - from
July 2010 to February 2011 - that it was in force.

HD      ANTI-TRUST POLICY : TELEFÓNICA AND PORTUGAL TELECOMFINED 79 MN EURO WC     413 words

On 23 January, the European Commission imposed fines of more than €79 million on Telefónica of Spain and Portugal  Telecom for anti-competitive behaviour. The two operators had agreed not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets. They operators both hold a strong position on their markets of origin and were each handed a heavy  fine: €66,894,000 for Telefónica and
€12,290,000 for  Portugal Telecom.

In July 2010, in the context of the acquisition by Telefónica of the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties, the parties inserted a clause in the contract indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010. The parties terminated the non-compete agreement in early February 2011, after the Commission opened anti-trust proceedings (see Europolitics 4126).

TD
In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the early termination of the agreement as a mitigating circumstance - in line with its guidelines on fines. Conversely, the seriousness of the infringement was a deciding factor in the final sum of the fine. Indeed, non-compete clauses are one of
the most serious violations of fair and healthy competition. As such, Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) lists amongst the agreements that are prohibited those that "directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices" and "share markets or sources of supply" to the detriment of consumers in terms of choice and price, as the EU executive noted in its October 2011 statement of objections (4294).
Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia reiterated that he would not show leniency when it came to
"ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate
anti-competitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and
delay market integration".

Instead of competing with each other for offering clients the most advantageous conditions, as is expected in an open and competitive market, Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom deliberately agreed to recreate national barriers that should not exist. The agreement hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector, the Commission said in statement.

The Commission recalls that "any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages."

The European Commission on Wednesday slapped  fines of 66.8 million euros on Telefónica and
12.3 million on Portugal  Telecom for agreeing a non-aggression pact in their respective domestic
markets in breach of European Union competition rules.

The agreement not to compete in each other's main markets formed part of a deal reached in September 2010 under which Telefónica acquired PT's stake in their joint Brazilian mobile venture Vivo for 7.5 billion euros. Brussels said the Vivo transaction itself is not affected by the decision.

TD
"We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration," said EC vice president, Spaniard Joaquín Almunia, who heads the competition department.
Telefónica said it would appeal the decision. When Brussels opened its investigation into the
non-aggression pact in January 2011, the Spanish firm argued the agreement would only become
effective if it was ruled to be legal, effectively making it null and void from the start. The two operators
broke off the accord in February 2011.
Telefónica was  fined 152 million euros by Brussels in 2007 for imposing wholesale prices on rivals. At the time of the Vivo deal, the Portuguese government voiced concerns about an invasion of the
domestic market by Telefónica.

HD      Telefonica  will appeal before the European Court of Justice  the European Commission’s ruling  in connection to the agreements  with PT

Release date - 23012013

Madrid .- Telefonica S.A completely disagrees with the ruling announced today by the  European             Commission, which imposes a fine for the agreements reached, over two years ago, by the Company and Portugal  Telecom in the context of the acquisition by Telefonica of  Portugal Telecom’s stake in Brazilian mobile operator, Vivo.

TD
Telefonica believes it has not, at any time, breached the law and announces its firm intention to immediately appeal before the European Court of Justice.

In its ruling, the Commission examines a clause included in the contract signed between Telefonica and Portugal Telecom which was subject to compliance with regulation and which was never applied. Once the parties conducted their assessment on the legality of the clause, they concluded that the restriction foreseen therein could not be applied and therefore they decided to eliminate it.

Telefonica would like to point out that the agreements reached between Telefonica and  Portugal             Telecom were made public and notified to the relevant authorities at the time, so there was no secret pact or attempt to conceal it, which ratifies the fact that it was never intended to breach the current legislation, as admitted by the  European Commission’s own ruling.

Finally, Telefonica reiterates that these agreements had no effect on consumers at any stage and did not alter in any way the development of the market.

Today's comment: EU  fines Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom for Iberian collusion; TeliaSonera writes down NetCom; EU asks Poland to reconsider wholesale broadband deregulation; KPN signs Wi-Fi access deal with Fon.
Today we focus on four developments:

TD
Our take
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia stated that the commission will not tolerate
anti-competitive practices by incumbents, designed to "...protect their home markets, as they harm
consumers and delay market integration". The EU went further, claiming that the agreement between
Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom could have led to higher consumer prices, and hindered the creation of
a single EU telecoms market.

Telefónica now argues that the agreement, which formed part of its EUR7.5 billion acquisition of  Portugal Telecom's stake in Brazil's Vivo in September 2010, was never a legally-binding deal – effectively making the EU investigation null and void from the start. Prior to the Vivo deal, however, the Portuguese government had repeatedly voiced concerns about the threat posed to its domestic market by the possible entry of Telefónica, which operates across five other EU markets under the O2 brand.

A move into Portugal would have made a great deal of sense for Telefónica, given the geographical and cultural synergies between the Iberian neighbours. However, Telefónica is likely to claim its investment was tied up in Latin America – and unless the EU can categorically prove that Telefónica has not entered the Portuguese market as a direct result of the agreement, the appeal by the operators may well succeed. The majority of the large European incumbents have scaled back European expansion of late, due to a combination of continued macroeconomic uncertainty and sweeter investment opportunities in emerging markets.

The European Commission has fined Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom for their agreement not to compete with each other in the Iberian markets of Spain and Portugal.

Telefónica has said it will appeal on the grounds that the agreement was not legally-binding, and is likely to claim its investment was tied up elsewhere.

EU fines Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom for Iberian collusion: The  European Commission has fined Telefónica EUR66.9 million (USD89.1 million) and  Portugal Telecom EUR12.3 million for their agreement not to compete with each other in the Iberian markets of Spain and Portugal. The EU says the
gentleman's agreement between the operators lasted from September 2010 to the end of 2011, and was linked to Telefónica's 2010 buyout of  Portugal Telecom's stake in their Brazilian joint venture, Vivo. Telefónica says it "strongly disagrees" with the decision, and plans to lodge an appeal with the EU Court of Justice, while  Portugal Telecom says it is also considering appealing against the  fine. TeliaSonera writes down NetCom again: TeliaSonera has announced it plans to write down the value of NetCom by
2.91 billion Swedish kronor (USD446 million) – the second time it has written down the Norwegian mobile unit in the past year, following a SEK 2.75 billion impairment in April 2012. The Swedish giant made the announcement ahead of its fourth-quarter results to be reported on 31 January. In addition, TeliaSonera will book a loss of SEK1.55 billion on the sale of Norwegian subsidiary NextGenTel. It expects a one-time gain of SEK5.38 billion from the sale of shares in Russia's Megafon in November, while cuts in Swedish

HD     Brazil,Portugal,Spain : EC imposed  a fine of EUR 79 million on PORTUGAL TELECOM & SPANISH TELEFONICA

The European Commission has imposed an overall penalty of EUR 79 million on  Portugal Telecom
and Telefonica after the telecom companies opted for non-competition agreement.

With this, the Spanish operator Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom, the largest telecommunications service provider in Portugal, will have to shell out EUR 66.9 million and EUR 12.3 million respectively.

TD
The EC has stated that the non-competition clause, which had validity between from September 2010 and
February 2011, was opposing to the EU regulation, and stressed that it will never accept any
anti-competitive moves by the incumbent operators.

The telecom service providers have also decided to refrain from racing against one another in Spain and Portugal while they settled the agreement in 2010 for Telefonica to acquire 100% control of Vivo, the Brazil-based joint venture of the two firms. The EC has added that the non-competition deal was finished in 2011 while the EU launched its anti-trust inquiry.

The Spanish operator has revealed that it has strategy to challenge the EU order to the European Court of Justice, because "it has not, at any time, breached the law". Telefonica has stated that the controversial competition clause had gone through a compliance review, and it was removed from the
agreement while it was found that it lacked legal applicability. Moreover, the agreement was presented to the regulatory authorities then and "did not alter in any way the development of the market", added the Spanish telecom company.

Issuing an analogous statement,  Portugal Telecom has stated that the penalty was "unjustified" and it will also mull over taking legal action against the verdict.

HD     European Union: Antitrust - Commission finesTelefonica and Portugal Telecom 79 million for illegal non-compete contract clause

Section: General News - The European Commission has imposed fines of 66 894 000 on Telefonica and of 12 290 000 on Portugal  Telecom for agreeing not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets, in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) which prohibits anti-competitive agreements. In July 2010, in the context of the acquisition by Telefonica of the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties, the parties inserted a clause in the contract indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010. The parties terminated the non-compete agreement in early February 2011, after the Commission opened antitrust proceedings.

TD
Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: "The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration."

Instead of competing with each other for offering clients the most advantageous conditions, as is expected in an open and competitive market, Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom deliberately agreed to stay out of each other's home markets. By preserving the status quo in Spain and Portugal, the agreement hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector. Non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for
consumers.

The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256). In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the duration of the infringement (4 months) and its gravity, including the fact that the agreement was not kept secret by the parties. The early termination of the agreement was also taken into account by the Commission as a mitigating circumstance.
Background

Article 101 of the TFEU prohibits agreements that have the object or effect to restrict competition and may affect trade in the EU Single Market.

Both Telefonica and  Portugal Telecom are the largest telecoms operators in their home countries. For example, in 2011 Telefonica accounted for almost half of all revenue generated by the Spanish telecoms sector. Each of the parties has a very limited presence in the other party's home country.

The Commission opened an investigation on its own initiative in January 2011 (see IP/11/58) after it became aware of the agreement between Telefonica S.A. and  Portugal Telecom SGPS S.A. The Commission has a copy of the agreement concluded on the occasion of the Vivo transaction and of the non-compete clause, which originally was due to run from September 2010 to the end of 2011. The Commission sent the parties a Statement of Objections in October 2011 (see IP/11/1241).
The Vivo transaction itself is not affected by the decision. Action for damages

Page 40 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court and Council Regulation 1/2003 both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without these being reduced on account of the Commission fine.

The Commission considers that meritorious claims for damages should be aimed at compensating, in a fair way, the victims of an infringement for the harm done. More information on antitrust damages actions, including the public consultation and a citizens' summary, is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/documents.html

More information will be available under the case number 39839 in the Commission's public case registry on the competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. A periodic compilation of antitrust and cartel news is available in the Competition Weekly News Summary.

The EUR-67-million  fine imposed on Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica by the  European Commission for anti-competitive practices on the Iberian market is fair, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Telefonica had agreed a clause with  Portugal Telecom indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal, which represents an infraction regardless the intention of the companies, he added.

The Spanish company denies having violated any rules and has appealed to the European Court of

On 23 January, the European Commission imposed fines of more than €79 million on Telefónica of Spain and Portugal  Telecom for anti-competitive behaviour. The two operators had agreed not to compete with each other on the Iberian telecommunications markets. The operators both hold a strong position on their markets of origin and were each handed a heavy  fine: €66,894,000 for Telefónica and
€12,290,000 for  Portugal Telecom.

In July 2010, in the context of the acquisition by Telefónica of the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which was until then jointly owned by both parties, the parties inserted a clause in the contract indicating they would not compete with each other in Spain and Portugal as from the end of September 2010. The parties terminated the non-compete agreement in early February 2011, after the Commission opened anti-trust proceedings.

TD
In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the early termination of the agreement as a mitigating circumstance - in line with its guidelines on fines. Conversely, the seriousness of the infringement was a deciding factor in the final sum of the fine. Indeed, non-compete clauses are one of
the most serious violations of fair and healthy competition. As such, Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) lists amongst the agreements that are prohibited those that "directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices" and "share markets or sources of supply" to the detriment of consumers in terms of choice and price, as the EU executive noted in its October 2011 statement of objections..
Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia reiterated that he would not show leniency when it came to
"ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate
anti-competitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and
delay market integration".

Instead of competing with each other for offering clients the most advantageous conditions, as is expected in an open and competitive market, Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom deliberately agreed to recreate national barriers that should not exist. The agreement hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector, the Commission said in statement.

The Commission recalls that "any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages."

The European Commission has imposed fines of €66.89m on TelefÃ³nica and of €12.29 on  Portugal    Telecom for agreeing not to compete with each other in the telecoms markets on the Iberian peninsula.

The Commission says the two companies — which are the dominant players in Spain and Portugal respectively — agreed not to compete with one another during 2010 negotiations for TelefÃ³nica to buy complete control of Vivo, a Brazilian mobile operator which had been a joint venture.

TD
The companies terminated the non-compete agreement in early February 2011, after the Commission opened antitrust proceedings, says the Commission, but it believes that they still had a deal to stay out of each other's home markets.

JoaquÃn Almunia, Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, said: "The Commission is committed to ensuring the creation of a genuine single market in the telecoms sector. We will not tolerate anticompetitive practices by incumbents to protect their home markets, as they harm consumers and delay market integration."

The Commission said that the action by the two companies hindered the integration process of the EU telecoms sector and was in breach of article 101 of the treaty that governs the functioning of the European Union. In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the four months duration of the infringement and the fact that the agreement was not kept secret by the parties. The early termination of the agreement was also taken into account by the Commission as a mitigating circumstance.

The Commission has warned that any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour may seek damages in national courts.

Be Careful with (Unjustifiable) Non-Competes

On 23 January 2013, the  European Commission (EC) fined telecoms operators Telefónica and Portugal Telecom EUR67 million and EUR12 million, respectively, for entering into a non-compete arrangement with each other. The case provides a stark reminder that non-compete agreements must be justified and, if they are not, they may be seen and  fined as cartels.

TD
The non-compete arrangement was entered into in the context of the July 2010 acquisition by Telefónica of the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, which until then had been jointly owned by Telefónica and  Portugal Telecom. However, the arrangement had no relationship with that transaction, since it provided that from the end of September 2010 the two companies would not compete with each other in Spain and
Portugal. The arrangement was terminated in early February 2011 after the EC had opened an investigation into it.

The EC, in announcing the  fine, commented that "non-compete agreements are one of the most serious violations of EU competition rules, as they potentially result in higher prices and less choice for consumers". The level of the  fines, for a four-month agreement, reflected this.
Competition Law and Agriculture/Food?

As part of the reform discussions concerning the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), some members of the European Parliament (EP) have suggested an exemption from competition law for farm production. The members of the European Competition Network (ECN), a grouping of national competition authorities in the EU plus the EC, have expressed concerns about this and on 15 January
2013 published a joint resolution on the issue. This strongly expresses their view that competition law should apply in full in all sectors in the EU, including food and agriculture.

The resolution points out that competition law does not ban all types of cooperation between competitors. It goes on to encourage farmers to form co-operatives to counter large buyers (supermarkets etc.) in the EU, stating, "Where appropriate, farmers should be encouraged to form entities or organisations to
create efficiencies in order to respond to market challenges in a pro-competitive way." Although aimed at the politically sensitive farming sector, this general principle applies to suppliers throughout the food chain.
Commission Concerned with SEP Injunctions

On 21 December 2012, the EC indicated that its preliminary view is that Samsung has abused a dominant position by seeking injunctions against Apple in various EU countries on the basis of its 3G mobile phone standard-essential patents (SEPs). While recourse to injunctions is a perfectly legal remedy for patent infringements, such conduct may, in the EC's view, be considered abusive where SEPs are concerned and the potential licensee is willing to negotiate a licence on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (so-called FRAND) terms.

The EC's concern is that, since injunctions generally involve a prohibition of the product infringing the patent being sold, recourse to an injunction in this situation (where there is a willing licensee) risks excluding products from the market without justification and may distort licensing negotiations unduly in the SEP-holder's favour. The EC is careful to point out, however, that it does not question the availability
Page 47 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of injunctive relief for SEP holders outside the specific circumstances present in this case (such as where a third party is unwilling to take a licence, an "unwilling licensee").

This case is highly important in the context of the application of abuse of dominance rules in the EU to licensing conduct and litigation strategy concerning SEPs generally (not just where smartphones are concerned). There is to date no precedent (and limited guidance) and, if a decision is ultimately taken, the case will therefore be the first to establish when injunctions in SEP-related patent litigation are
allowed under EU and national competition law. Any company involved in licensing SEPs in any sector in the EU should watch it carefully.
