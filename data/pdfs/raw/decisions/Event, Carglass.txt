The European Commission slapped on Wednesday a  fine of 1.4 billion  euros on four car glass makers marking the biggest penalty ever imposed in a  cartel case.

Europe's top antitrust watchdog accused Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver of carving up the market for car glass in Europe among themselves and sharing trade secrets between early 1998 and early 2003.

"These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth two billion
euros in the last year of the  cartel," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"The commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour," she added.

The European Commission slapped on Wednesday a  fine of 1.4 billion euros (1.8 billion dollars) on four car glass makers marking the biggest penalty ever imposed in a cartel case.

Europe's top antitrust watchdog accused Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver of carving up the market for car glass in Europe among themselves and sharing trade secrets between early 1998 and early 2003.

"These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth two billion

"The commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour," she added.

The commission hit Saint-Gobain with the biggest EU  fine ever in a cartel case, ordering the company to cough up 896 million  euros for its role and ramping up its penalty by 60 percent because it is a repeat offender.

British glass company Pilkington was told to pay 370 million euros for its part in the  cartel while Japanese group Asahi had to pay 113.5 million  euros after its fine was reduced by half because it cooperated with trustbusters.
Belgian company Soliver was  fined 4.396 million euros.

EU regulators began investigating the  cartel on information from an anonymous tip and uncovered evidence that officials from the companies had met in airports and hotels in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels to illegally share sensitive information.

The commission hit Saint-Gobain of France with the biggest EU  fine ever in a cartel case, ordering the company to cough up 896 million  euros after ramping up its penalty by 60 percent because it is a repeat offender.

British glass company Pilkington was told to pay 370 million  euros while Japan's Asahi had to pay 113.5 million euros after its  fine was reduced by half because it cooperated with the investigation.
Belgian company Soliver was  fined 4.4 million euros.

In reaction, Saint-Gobain vowed to appeal the decision, describing its  fine as "excessive and disproportionate."

EU regulators began investigating the  cartel on information from an anonymous tip and uncovered evidence that officials from the companies had met in airports and hotels in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels to share sensitive information illegally.
Until Wednesday, the biggest  fine the commission had ever levied in a cartel case was a 992 million
euro penalty on lift makers Otis, Schindler, ThyssenKrupp and Kone in February 2007.

The commission has made a top priority of breaking up cartels and with Wednesday's decision has levied fines worth 2.3 billion  euros in seven cases so far this year.
Last year, Brussels set a record with  fines totalling 3.3 billion  euros -- money which goes into the EU
budget.

"Every euro paid in fines is one euro less that the member states have to pay (into the budget) and so ultimately taxpayers benefit," Kroes said.
"That, however, is scant consolation to the car manufacturers and millions of households affected by this
cartel," she added.

HD     EU levies its largest ever cartel fine of 1.3 billion euros against car glass companies

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The EU's antitrust chief on Wednesday  fined car glass producers Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver more than 1.3 billion  euros ($1.66 billion) for price-fixing, the largest sum ever levied by the EU for a  cartel.

France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA must pay 896 million  euros ($1.14 billion) -- more than any other company has been  fined before.

TD
The European Commission said the four companies control 90 percent of the glass used to make
European cars, a market worth 2 billion  euros in 2003.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the companies fixed prices over a period of five years. She said the  fines were high because European industry had to "learn the lessons the hard way."

"If you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine," she said. "These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years."

The EU said it increased Saint-Gobain's  fine by 60 percent because the company was a cartel repeat offender. It was  fined last year for an EU-wide window glass  cartel, following earlier fines for a Belgian flat glass  cartel in 1988 and a similar cartel on the Italian market in 1984.

Saint-Gobain said it had set aside only 560 million  euros ($714 million) for the "excessive and disproportionate"  fine. It said it would immediately appeal the EU decision to the EU Court of First Instance and would not have to pay the  fine until its legal challenge is exhausted.

"The fine represents approximately 95 percent of the annual sales of Saint-Gobain's automotive glass business in Europe and several decades' net income," it said.

European antitrust regulators can  fine companies up to 10 percent of global turnover for every year they broke the law. The money goes into the EU budget, usually funded by taxpayers, and is spent mostly on farm subsidies and research.
Kroes said the Saint-Gobainfine "may be the largest ever for a  cartel but it still falls well short of that
(10-percent) cap" because she said the company has an annual turnover of 43 billion  euros ($55 billion).

Asahi Glass Co. of Japan was  fined 113.5 million ($144.7 million) for its  European subsidiary, formerly called Glaverbel. It got a 50 percent reduction because it cooperated with regulators. The company said it would explain the impact of the  fine on its financial results at a later date.

Britain's Pilkington PLC -- owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass Co. -- must pay 370 million euros($471.6 million). A smaller company, Belgian-based Soliver NV, was  fined far less: 4.396 million euros ($5.6 million).

Regulators said Asahi, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain -- the three major suppliers of glass to  European automakers -- met regularly to discuss target prices, shared out markets and allocated car maker customers from early 1998 to early 2003. Soliver only joined some of these meetings.
The companies made glass for car windscreens, car doors, rear windows and sunroofs. The antitrust investigation was triggered by an anonymous tip-off, the EU executive said.
Kroes could not say how far the  cartel had hiked car prices but encouraged customers to seek damages from the glass suppliers through the national courts.

HD      EU breaks up car windscreen cartel

The EU Commission today fined four leading windscreen manufacturers over E1.3 billion for an illegal
cartel which was found to be price-fixing.

The four companies concerned - Asahi (Japan), Pilkington (UK), Saint-Gobain (France) and Soliver (Belgium) - controlled about 90pc of the European market for new and replacement windscreens. The four main manufacturers in  Europe discussed price-fixing, market sharing  and customer allocation in a series of meetings at airports and hotels in different European cities.

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth two billion  euros in the last year of the  cartel. The overall  fines are high because of the large market, the seriousness of the case, and Saint-Gobain's earlier offences. The Commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour. Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and  European
industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine."

Today's fines are the highest  cartel fines the European Commission has ever imposed, both for an individual company (E896,000,000 on Saint Gobain) and for a cartel as a whole. Between early 1998 and early 2003, Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver held regular discussions with a view to allocating car glass supplies to car manufacturers between them in response to their tenders and to keeping the market shares of each individual car glass supplier as stable as possible at the  European level. The evidence uncovered by the Commission revealed several meetings at airports and hotels in
different  European cities (for example in Frankfurt, Paris and at Charles de Gaulle (Paris) and Zaventem (Brussels) airport hotels) during which Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming car models to be produced and renegotiations of
on-going contracts, and exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information.

PAULSON SCRAPS ASSET PURCHASES, AIMS AT CONSUMER FINANCE

Treasury Secretary signals readiness to enter the second phase of the $700 billion bailout, but that is unlikely to include the original proposal to buy up troubled assets. Treasury is looking at ways to encourage private investors to return to the asset-backed securitization market. Barney Frank says some of the rescue package should be used to buy up troubled mortgages. The White House has again dismissed the use of TARP funds to aid the ailing auto sector.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French construction materials group Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA
(12500.FR) will appeal against the EUR896 million fine announced Wednesday by the European     
Commission, a Saint-Gobain spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires.

Saint-Gobain called the decision "excessive and disproportionate" before a Luxembourg court, the spokeswoman said.

TD
The payment of the  fine is suspended pending the appeal hearing, on the condition Saint-Gobain provides banking guarantees, the spokeswoman also said.
The Saint-Gobain added that the terms and reasons for the decision were not known.

She said the size of the fine represents "95% of the full-year revenue of the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) activity of its car glass division in Europe and several decades' net income."

The European Commission Wednesday fined car glass producers a total of EUR1.38 billion because of a market sharing cartel.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: U.S. stocks are expected to open flat Wednesday, with worries over the health of the financial system continuing to dominate sentiment, said Manoj Ladwa of U.K. spreadbettor TradIndex.

Volumes are likely to be thin and "the lack of significant economic data may leave investors looking for direction," Ladwa said.

TD
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's speech in Washington will be closely watched for an update on the financial rescue package.

On the corporate calendar, Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Macy's Inc.(M) and NetApp Inc.(NTAP) are the pick of the companies slated to report quarterly earnings.
At 1152 GMT, S&P 500 futures were up 7.1 points at 900.1, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 4 points at
1227 and Dow industrial futures were up 53 points at 8690.

EUROPEAN MARKETS:  European stocks are higher midday on growing hopes of more aggressive interest rate cuts following a Bank of England inflation report suggesting further rate cuts could lie ahead.

Weak euro zone industrial production data is "bolstering the case for the ECB to cut interest rates significantly further, starting with another 50 basis points cut at the December meeting," says Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Financial Markets.
Retail stocks are higher following updates from LVMH and Sainsbury.

The FTSE 100 is up 1.3% at 4301.1, after the release of the Bank of England's inflation report with investors warming to the prospect of another rate cut. A trader says the BOE's comment that inflation will fall well below 2% by late 2010 gives it room to cut rates further and a cut of 25 basis points at the next meeting is almost fully priced-in.
In Frankfurt, the DAX is up 0.7% at 4797.86 and in Paris, the CAC-40 is up 1.1% at 3373.64.

Bunds and gilts rebound from early price losses to head higher after Spain's EUR2.8B 2010 auction attracted strong demand. December bunds are up 0.16 at 118.20, while December gilts are up 0.35 at
114.15.

Rising risk aversion continues to overshadow currency markets, leaving the dollar rising against most currencies in Europe.

At 1032 GMT, the dollar was down at Y97.32 from Y97.80 late Tuesday in New York, according to EBS. The euro was down at $1.2537 from $1.2539, and the pound fell to $1.5293 from $1.5419.
===========================
TOP STORIES:

BOE SEES INFLATION WELL BELOW 2%, COULD CUT RATES AGAIN: The inflation rate will fall "well below" the 2% target in the medium term if the key interest rate remains at 3%, the Bank of England says in its quarterly inflation report. Due to a risk of deflation, BOE Governor Mervyn King says
Page 31 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the central bank is prepared to cut rates again if necessary. Sterling drops on the news, while London stocks push back into the black and gilts move higher.

CRUDE DROPS BELOW $58/BBL, NEW 20-MONTH LOW: Crude oil futures drop to new multi-month lows in European trading as expectations that global economic weakness will hurt crude oil demand continue to weigh on prices.

UK JOBLESS IN BIGGEST MONTHLY GAIN SINCE 1992: The U.K.'s claimant count jobless figure rises at its fastest pace for nearly 16 years in October and looks set to rise further as the economic slowdown weighs on the labor market, data from Office for National Statistics show.
============================
INSIGHT & ANALYSIS FROM DOW JONES NEWSWIRES:

=FOREX FOCUS: Global risk aversion will more than likely rise again - much to the benefit of the dollar and the yen.

=CHARTING  EUROPE: EUR/USD fell to a day's low of $1.2477 early Wednesday, but in doing so might have ended a minor degree Elliott wave A,B,C correction. And this means it is likely to rise back to the
$1.30 region and above in the days to come.

=TAKING STOCK: It seems there's nothing like a financial crisis to bring out the tweedy historian lurking within many a sharply-suited market analyst. How many times in the past year have you seen comparisons drawn with 1987's Black Monday, 9/11's aftermath, the Great Depression or other horrible days still further back in time?

The commission finedSaint-Gobain EUR896 million for its part in the  cartel and U.K.'s Pilkington

Kroes said the  fines were high because of the size of the market -worth EUR2 billion in the last year of the cartel -and because of the seriousness of the case.

Saint-Gobain paid the highest penalty as it is a repeat offender, Kroes said, having been  fined in 1984 and in 1988 for cartels in the flat glass sector in Italy and the Benelux countries.

"Management of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine," said Kroes.
Saint-Gobain called the decision "excessive and disproportionate" and said it will launch an appeal. The four companies controlled about 90% of the glass used in news cars and replacement glass in
Europe at the time.

The European Commission, the E.U's executive body, has the power to  fine companies 10% of their annual turnover for anti-competitive behavior.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In its latest crackdown on  cartel activity, the  European Commission
Wednesday fined four car-glass  producers a total of EUR1.38 billion for exchanging
commercially-sensitive information and sharing out contracts, the largest penalty ever imposed on a
cartel in Europe.

The commission fined France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (12500.FR) EUR896 million for its part in the cartel, a record for an individual company.

"Management of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way: if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The penalties should come as a stark warning for others and signals the  commission's determination to step up its pursuit of cartels.

Last week the commission confirmed it had raided several cement and building supplies companies on suspicion of cartel activity. The companies included France's Lafarge SA (12053.FR) and Switzerland's Holcim Ltd. (HOLN.VX).

The commission said Saint-Gobain, U.K.-based Pilkington PLC, which is owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202.TO), Asahi Glass Co. (5201.TO) of Japan and Belgium's Soliver Group "cheated the car industry and millions of car buyers" for five years between 1998 and 2003.
The four companies controlled about 90% of the glass used in new cars and replacement glass in
Europe at the time.

They shared out customers and colluded by meeting several times at airports and hotels in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels, where they discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming new car models and exchanged commercially-sensitive information.

Pilkington, which was acquired by Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006, was  fined EUR370 million, while Asahi must pay EUR113.5 million and Soliver EUR4.4 million.

Kroes said the  fines were high because of the size of the market - worth EUR2 billion in the last year of the cartel - and because of the seriousness of the case. The  commission, the European Union's executive body, has the power to  fine companies up to 10% of their annual revenue for anticompetitive behavior.
Saint-Gobain's  fine was increased by 60% because it is a repeat offender, Kroes said. It had been
fined in 1984 and in 1988 for cartels in the flat-glass sector in Italy and the Benelux countries.


Page 36 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Saint-Gobain called the decision "excessive and disproportionate" and said it will launch an appeal. The company took a EUR560 million provision for the  fine at the end of 2007.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 12 -- The European Union has ordered Japan's Asahi Glass Co. and three other firms to pay a total of 1.38 billion euros in fines for forming an illegal  cartel for selling sheet glass for automobiles, its executive body said Wednesday.

The sum is the largest ever ordered by the European Commission over an illegal cartel, surpassing the previous record fines of a total of 992 million euros imposed in February 2007 on 14 firms over a price cartel for elevator sales.

TD
The three other glass manufacturers  fined by the European Commission are Pilkington Group PLC of Britain, Saint-Gobain of France and Soliver Group of Belgium. Pilkington is a subsidiary of Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass Co.
Asahi Glass was  fined 113.5 million euros, Pilkington 370 million  euros, Saint-Gobain 896 million
euros and Soliver 4,396,000  euros.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes condemned the four makers in a statement, saying they have ''cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth 2 billion  euros in the last year of the  cartel.''

The European Union decided to impose high  fines, given the seriousness of the case and earlier offences by Saint-Gobain, the commissioner said.

According to the  European Commission, Asahi Glass, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain ''discussed target prices, market sharing and customer allocation in a series of meetings and other illicit contracts'' from early 1998 to early 2003.
Soliver also participated in some of these discussions.
The four makers controlled about 90 percent of the  auto glass market in Europe at the time. Asahi Glass confirmed in a statement that its European unit, AGC Automotive  Europe SA, has
received the order from the executive body of the European Union.

After receiving the full text of the  European Commission decision, the Japanese maker and its local unit will examine it and determine their future course of action, Asahi Glass said in the statement.

(Recasts after news conference)

BRUSSELS, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The European Commission imposed its highest ever  cartel penalty on Wednesday, fining a group of companies delivering car glass in Europe more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.64 billion) for what it called market distortion.

TD
It finedSaint-Gobain 896 million euros -- the biggest such penalty imposed by Brussels on an individual company -- for running a cartel with Asahi Glass, Pilkington and Soliver between 1998 and
2003.

Pilkington -- a UK unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass -- will pay 370 million  euros, Asahi 113.5 million and Belgium's Soliver 4.396 million for "discussing target prices, market sharing and customer allocation", the  Commission said.

"The Commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.

"Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and  European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way -- if you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine."

The highest  cartel fine handed down previously by Brussels was 992.3 million euros in 2007 to a number of elevator manufacturers, with ThyssenKrupp receiving the largest fine of 480 million euros.
REPEAT OFFENDER

The Commission said it increased the  fine for Saint-Gobain by 60 percent because the firm was a repeat offender, referring to the fact that the French company had previously been  fined for cartel activities in flat glass in 1984 and 1988.

Saint-Gobain, Pilkington and Asahi were also among four makers of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors fined 486.9 million euros a year ago for illegally coordinating price rises.

"Asahi cooperated fully with the  Commission and provided additional information to help to expose the infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50 percent," the EU executive said in a statement, addimg there was no reason for adjusting Pilkington's penalty.

Saint-Gobain said it would appeal against the  fine to the European Court of Justice -- the EU's highest court.
Asahi's  fine concerned its Belgian-based AGC Flat Glass unit. Soliver and Pilkington were not immediately available for comment.
In 2005, antitrust authorities raided several car glass producers across Europe following a tip-off from
"an anonymous informant", the Commission said.


Page 40 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver held regular discussions at airports and hotels in European cities with a view to ensuring they dominated the market, breaching the EU's strict competition laws.

"These four companies controlled about 90 percent of the glass used in  Europe in new cars and for original branded replacement glass for cars at that time, a market worth about 2 billion  euros in the last full year of the infringement," the  Commission said.

"The companies discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming car models to be produced and renegotiations of on-going contracts, and exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information." (Additional reporting by Mark John; Editing by Dale Hudson and Sharon Lindores)

BRUSSELS, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Wednesday fined four car glass manufacturers a record amount of 1. 38 billion euros (1.74 billion U.S. dollars) for price fixing in a period of five years.

The four companies are Saint-Gobain of France, Pilkington of Britain, Asahi of Japan and Soliver of Belgium. Saint-Gobain alone was fined 896 million euros (1.13 billion dollars), the highest  fine that has ever been imposed by the commission on an individual company.

TD
European Union (EU) Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who announced the  fines, said the four companies cheated car manufacturers and car buyers by manipulating the market between early 1998 and early 2003. The four companies controlled about 90 percent of the glass used in new cars sold in
the EU and original branded replacement glass for cars in the period. The  car glass business was worth
2 billion euros (2.5 billion dollars)in 2003, she said.

"Management of companies that damage consumers and damage  European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way," said Kroes. "If you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine."

The commission increased the fines for Saint-Gobain by 60 percent because it was a repeat offender, having already been fined for cartel activities in 1984 and 1988. Pilkington was fined 370 million euros (466 million dollars) while Asahi had its  fined reduced by 50 percent to 113.5 million euros (143 million dollars) as a reward to its cooperation with the  commission investigation.

The commission, the executive body of the  European Union, started an investigation on the basis of information provided by an anonymous informant. The information prompted the commission to carry out surprise inspections in 2005 at several sites of  car glass producers in Europe. The commission investigation revealed several meetings of the four companies with a view to allocate between them market shares, thus fixing prices in their profit.

EU investigators have raided biomedical analysis sites in France amid suspicions of anti-competitive practices, the  European Commission announced Thursday.

The "unannounced inspections" on a business association and an enterprise "both active on the biomedical analysis market" took place on Wednesday.

TD
The commission, the EU's executive arm, "has reason to believe that the provisions of the EC Treaty prohibiting cartels, restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant position have been infringed," it said in a statement, without naming the French entities which were searched.
The commission stressed that its investigations were at a preliminary stage and that the inspections do
"not mean that the enterprises concerned are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour."
There is no time limit for the  commission to complete its probe of suspected anti-competitive practices. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has made crusading against cartels a priority.
The European Commission on Wednesday slapped a  fine of 1.4 billion  euros (1.8 billion dollars) on four car glass makers for rigging the market, the biggest penalty ever imposed in a  cartel case.
With Wednesday's decision, the total  fines levied against cartel members had reached 2.3 billion  euros
in seven cases so far this year.
Last year, Brussels set a record with  fines totalling 3.3 billion  euros -- money which goes into the EU
budget.

By Taiga Uranaka TOKYO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares in two major Japanese glass makers  fined for their part in a European auto glass cartel slid more than 6 percent on Thursday, although they said they had already allowed for most of the penalties in their accounts. The European Commission imposed its highest ever cartel penalty, fining four companies more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion) for working together illegally in Europe's 2 billion euro auto glass market. It  fined French building materials group Saint-Gobain 896 million euros -- the biggest such EU penalty on an individual company -- for running a cartel with Asahi Glass , Pilkington and Soliver between 1998 and 2003. Pilkington -- a UK unit of Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass -- will pay 370 million  euros, Asahi 113.5 million and Belgium's Soliver 4.396 million for "discussing target prices, market sharing and customer allocation", the  Commission said.

TD
Nippon Sheet shares fell 8.4 percent to 316 yen while those of rival Asahi Glass, which the  European       Commission said cooperated with the inquiry, slid 6.1 percent to 510 yen. Shares in Saint-Gobain fell
5.20 percent on Wednesday. Nippon Sheet said it would book a special loss of 8.9 billion yen ($94 million) in the six months to September due to the  fine, adding to a previous loss provision of $374 million. Asahi Glass said it had already set aside money to pay the  fine. Saint-Gobain said it would appeal the decision but officials of both Nippon Sheet Glass and Asahi Glass said their firms needed to study the ruling before deciding what action to take. "Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way -- if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference. The highest  cartel fine handed down previously by Brussels was 992.3 million euros in 2007 to a number of elevator manufacturers, with ThyssenKrupp receiving the largest fine of 480 million euros. REPEAT OFFENDER The Commission said it increased the  fine for Saint-Gobain by 60 percent because the firm was a repeat offender, referring to the fact that the French company had previously been  fined for cartel activities in flat glass in 1984 and 1988. Saint-Gobain, Pilkington and Asahi were also among four makers of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors fined 486.9 million euros a year ago for illegally coordinating price rises. "Asahi cooperated fully with the Commission and provided additional information to help to expose the infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50 percent," the EU executive said in a statement. Asahi's fine concerned its Belgian-based AGC Flat Glass unit. In 2005, antitrust authorities raided several car glass producers across Europe following a tip-off from an anonymous informant, the Commission said. The Commission said the four firms held regular discussions in airports and hotels about the auto glass market, in which they together held a 90 percent market share for new cars and branded replacement glass. "The companies discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming car models to be
produced and renegotiations of on-going contracts, and exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information," the  commission said.

TOKYO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Nippon Sheet Glass, a major Japanese maker of sheet glass, said on Thursday it will book a special loss of 8.9 billion yen ($94 million) in the fiscal half just ended due to a  fine imposed for a unit's role in a  cartel in Europe. The European Commission imposed its highest ever cartel penalty on Wednesday, fining a group of companies delivering car glass in Europe more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.64 billion) for what it called market distortion. It fined Pilkington, a UK unit of Nippon Sheet Glass, 370 million  euros and Asahi Glass 113.5 million euros. Nippon Sheet Glass and Asahi Glass separately said they were currently reviewing their earnings forecasts in light of the  fines.

By Taiga Uranaka TOKYO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares in two major Japanese glass makers slid more than
6 percent on Thursday, with a fall in the value of the  euro set to hit their earnings on top of  fines for taking
part in a European auto glass cartel. An analyst said the  fines would have little impact on the earnings
of Asahi Glass Co Ltd and Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd as they had largely allowed for the penalties in their
accounts. The European Commission imposed its highest ever  cartel penalty, fining four companies
more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion) for illegally working together in Europe's 2 billion euro auto        
glass market. It fined French building materials group Saint-Gobain 896 million  euros -- the biggest such
EU penalty on an individual company -- for running a  cartel with Asahi Glass, Pilkington and Soliver
between 1998 and 2003.

Pilkington -- a British unit of Nippon Sheet -- will pay 370 million  euros, Asahi 113.5 million and Belgium's Soliver 4.396 million for "discussing target prices, market sharing and customer allocation", the Commission said. By midday, Nippon Sheet shares were down 9.6 percent at 312 yen while Asahi Glass, which the European Commission said cooperated with the inquiry, slid 6.5 percent to 507 yen. Shares in Saint-Gobain fell 5.20 percent on Wednesday. "The penalties were imposed for past actions, and they will have little impact on their earnings. Rather, their shares are affected by the yen's gains against the  euro," said Credit Suisse analyst Shinya Yamada. The yen retreated on Thursday from a two-week high against the euro as short-term players locked in profits, but it retained its overall strength as investors remain wary of riskier assets and favour the perceived safety of the Japanese currency. Nippon Sheet said it would
book a special loss of 8.9 billion yen in the six months to September due to the  fine, adding to a previous loss provision of $374 million. Asahi Glass said it had already set aside money to pay the  fine.
Saint-Gobain said it would appeal the decision but officials of both Nippon Sheet Glass and Asahi Glass said they needed to study the ruling before deciding what action to take. "Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way -- if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a

Nov 13 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in the New York Times business pages on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. * The Treasury Department
on Wednesday officially abandoned the original strategy behind its $700 billion effort to rescue the financial system, as administration officials acknowledged that banks and financial institutions were as unwilling as ever to lend to consumers. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is hoping to put in place a major new lending program that would be run by the Federal Reserve and aimed at unlocking the frozen
consumer credit market. * Momentum is building in Washington for a rescue package for the auto industry to head off a possible bankruptcy filing by General Motors Corp, which is rapidly running low on cash.

TD
* Life insurance companies, hobbled by real estate investments and committed to paying some costly retirement contracts, face more cuts in their credit ratings before the year is up and have little choice but to seek capital in unforgiving markets. * Asian shares fell on Thursday to their lowest point this month on uncertainty about whether the U.S. can succeed in its massive banking rescue and as Intel Corp's revenue warning stoked corporate earnings worries. * Hedge fund managers usually shun the spotlight. But five of them, billionaires all, are about to come under the glare on Capitol Hill. The money managers - Philip Falcone, Kenneth Griffin, John Paulson, James Simons and George Soros - have been called by a House panel to discuss some of their trade secrets at a hearing on Thursday. * At a hearing of the House
Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, legislators concerned about the rising tide of foreclosures encouraged the financial industry to alter the terms of more mortgages to allow people to stay in their homes. * Shares on Wall Street tumbled more than 4 percent on Wednesday as frightened investors wondered how long the economic slowdown would last, how deep it would cut and whether Washington could do anything to stop the bleeding.

* The banking giant Morgan Stanley outlined plans on Wednesday to cut 10 percent of the staff in its biggest business, the institutional securities group, which covers everything from investment banking to stock trading. * The $6 billion International Monetary Fund-led bailout of Iceland appeared to be on the back burner Wednesday amid haggling over how the country would compensate overseas customers who lost deposits when Icelandic banks failed. * Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall, reached a modest wage deal on Wednesday with employers in the flagship engineering sector, ending the threat of strikes in an area already hurting from an economic slowdown. * ING, the Dutch financial services company, reported its first quarterly loss on Wednesday as it wrote down the value of investments hurt by the tight credit markets. * The Nets have announced a program that they said can help fans weather the economic crisis - if not the team's injury troubles or its mediocre start. The team said Wednesday that it would
provide unemployed fans with 1,500 free tickets over the course of five home games if they sign up for the Nets Employment Program. * The Boston Red Sox froze their ticket prices at already-high 2008 levels Wednesday, a clear reflection of the worsening economic crisis. * Prices for the flat screens in televisions, personal computers and cellphones have plummeted in recent years - but the decline would have been even faster if it hadn't been for an international price-fixing  cartel, the Justice Department said on Wednesday. * Intel Corp, the world's largest producer of computer chips, warned on Wednesday that its sales could fall as much as 19 percent in the fourth quarter.

* Google Inc announced on Wednesday that it would begin selling space on YouTube search-results
pages to advertisers, part of its effort to turn its expensive acquisition into a major revenue producer. * The
European Commission fined companies controlling the Continent's  auto glass market a record 1.4
billion euros ($1.77 billion), on Wednesday for price-fixing over five years. Two of the companies have
been caught engaging in  cartel practices before. * A senior Swiss executive at the banking giant UBS has

Brussels, 12/11/2008 (Agence  Europe) -On Wednesday 12 November 2008, the  Commission imposed fines of a total in excess of 1.3 billion € on producers of  car glass for concluding agreements to divide up the markets. Asahi (Japan), Pilkington (United Kingdom), Saint-Gobain (France) and Soliver (Belgium) were found guilty of sharing "commercially lucrative and illegal" information at "meetings in airports and hotels in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels", the Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, announced. The arrangement is believed to have existed from 1998 to 2003.

The unprecedented level of the  fines is due, Ms Kroes explained, to the value of the market (estimated at two billion euros for the last year of the  cartel), the seriousness of the case and the fact that Saint-Gobain was a repeat offender. "If you don't want to listen, you should feel", said the Commissioner, quoting a Dutch proverb.

TD
At the time in question, the  cartel members controlled 90% of the market for glass parts used in the windows of new cars, and spare parts. 14 million new cars are sold every year in the  European Economic Area, the Commissioner told the Brussels press on Wednesday. As well as the division of the current market between them, she explained, the businesses in question are believed to have concluded agreements on the supply of glass for new and future models of car. An anonymous tip-off brought the matter to the  Commission's attention, Ms Kroes stated.

Saint Gobain was  fined 896 million euros for its five-year involvement in the  cartel. This figure has been increased by 60% for its recidivism, the company having been fined for similar behaviour on the same market in Italy and Benelux in 1984 and in 1988. Pilkington was fined 370 million, having also participated in the cartel for five years, AGC Asahi was  fined 113.5 million for four and a half years and Soliver 4.4 million for a year and a half. These are the highest  fines the Commission has ever imposed in a cartel case, both to a single company (Saint Gobain) and to all of the members of the  cartel as a body. The companies in question have the right to appeal against the  Commission's decisions at the Court of First Instance.

Where does the money go? Ms Kroes then took pains to disabuse her audience of the notion that the money raised by fines against sanctions will swell the coffers of the  Commission. "No way. It is going to the EU budget. So every  euro gathered (in fines: Ed) is one  euro less that the Member States have to contribute", the Commissioner said, stressing that this represents a saving for the  European taxpayer.
She acknowledged that a few months ago, she expressed her "wish" to put a proportion of the  fine money towards the resources available to fight cartels within DG Competition, but this position " was rejected by those who are taking this decision". Ms Kroes added that consumers who have been personally affected
by increased prices resulting from this  cartel might not take much comfort from the  fine, and referred to the White Paper of the Commission on individual actions against cartels, which is currently on the table of the Parliament (EUROPE 9365). (C.D. / trans.fl)

HD       Record Fine Shatters Car Glass Producers

The European Commission has imposed a record fine of over €1.3 billion on four car glass producers for their role in a market sharing cartel. One of the companies involved, Saint-Gobain, was fined €896 million – this is the largest cartel fine ever imposed by the Commission on an individual company and smashes its previous record penalty.

The Commission found that, between 1998 and 2003, Asahi, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain (Europe's three major players in this industry) had discussed prices, shared markets, allocated customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information - each of these in itself represents a very serious breach of competition law. The fourth producer, Soliver, also took part in some of the illicit contacts.

TD
Saint-Gobain's  fine was increased by 60% because it was a previous offender (having been caught on two previous occasions) whereas Asahi's fine was reduced by 50% due to its cooperation under the Commission's leniency regime. As the Commission commenced the investigation on its own initiative following an anonymous tip off, this was the maximum level of discount which was available to the "first to confess".

In its press release, the  Commission has made its position very clear – "If you cheat, you will get a heavy fine". In this case, "heavy" is perhaps a bit of an understatement!

Yesterday's announcement simply reaffirms that the  Commission and national competition authorities are continuing to crack down on cartels which they see as the most serious form of anti-competitive conduct. It also continues the recent trend of escalating  cartel fines in the EU and UK and, as penalties reach unprecedented levels, leniency becomes increasingly critical.

HD      ANTI-TRUST PROBES : CAR GLASS CARTEL RECEIVES RECORD FINE WC     401 words

The European Commission imposed, on 12 November, a record collective  fine of €1.38 billion on four car glass producers accused of having formed a  cartel. The French company Saint-Gobain received the highest fine of €896 million. The other companies targeted are the Japanese company Asahi (a  fine of
€113.5 million), the British company Pilkington (€370 million) and the Belgian company Soliver (€4.396 million). Asahi, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain are the three major players in  Europe.

TD
These are the highest  cartel fines the Commission has ever imposed, both for an individual company and for a cartel as a whole, specified the Commission. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes explained that "the overall  fines are high because of the large market, the seriousness of the case, and Saint-Gobain's earlier offences [...] Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will
get a heavy fine". In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the  cartel agreements.

The four companies are accused of having agreed, between early 1998 and early 2003, to fix prices and allocate between themselves  car glass supplies to car manufacturers and to keep the market shares of each individual car glass supplier as stable as possible at the  European level. They also exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information.

The Commission started this investigation on its own initiative on the basis of reliable information provided by an anonymous informant. It increased the  fines for St Gobain by 60% because it was a repeat offender (namely, in 1988 for Flat Glass Benelux' and in 1984 for Flat Glass Italy'). Asahi cooperated fully with the  Commission and provided additional information to help to expose the infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50% under the leniency notice.

Car glass is used in the automotive industry and comes in various shapes and sizes, such as windscreens, sidelights (windows for front and back doors), backlights (rear windows) and sunroofs. The main customers of the car glass suppliers are car manufacturers who assemble the glass pieces into the cars they produce. Some of the car glass deliveries are stored for replacement as original branded spare parts.

GENERAL INDUSTRIALS
Prices were fixed for five years

TD
Vehicle makers may seek damages

Europe's largest  cartel fine of €1.38bn ($1.7bn) was yesterday imposed on four leading glass manufacturers, after they illegally fixed the price of glass used in the automotive industry for five years.

France's Saint-Gobain will have to pay €896m, well in excess of a €560m reserve that it had set aside to cover an adverse finding in the case. The amount is a record  fine by European regulators on a single company for price-fixing. Pilkingtonfaces a €370m penalty; Japan's Asahi Glass must pay €113.5m; and Belgium's Soliver faces a relatively modest  fine of €4.4m.

"These companies cheated the car industry and carbuyers for five years in a market worth €2bn in the last year of the  cartel," said Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner.

The financial implications of the  European Commission's finding, which started with an anonymous tip-off and followed a three-year probe, may continue.

The decision could open the way for buyers of the glass - notably car manufacturers - to pursue private damages against the companies involved on the grounds that prices were illegally inflated.

Ms Kroes declined to quantify the impact of the  cartel - which was developed in secret meetings at hotels and airports across  Europe and controlled about 90 per cent of the  European auto glass market
- but suggested it was significant. The penalty on Saint-Gobain was particularly high because of its history of previous  cartel offences.
That led to the latest  fine on the company being increased by 60 per cent.

By contrast, Asahi, and its  European subsidiary AGC Flat Glass  Europe, benefited from a 50 per cent reduction because of its co-operation with the  commission's investigation. Saint-Gobain attacked the penalty, describing it as "excessive and disproportionate", and said it would appeal to the top  European courts.
The company also said it had given obligatory training for thousands of managers in competition rules. But lawyers in Brussels said the record penalties did not reflect a change in  commission policy.
•Three major producers of glass display screens used on laptops and mobile phones agreed to plead guilty yesterday and pay $585m in  fines in a case the Justice Department described as one of the most far-reaching price fixing conspiracies it ever detected.

The Department of Justice said LG Display of South Korea, which will pay $400m in  fines, and Chunghwa of Taiwan, which will pay $65m, would plead guilty to price fixing in the LCD market, while Sharp Corporation of Japan would plead guilty to conspiracy to fix prices in the specialised screens to three specific customers - Apple, Dell, and Motorola - and pay $120m in  fines.

The DoJ has come under fire for what some critics say has been a lax antitrust policy in their review of controversial mergers.

President-elect Barack Obama is expected to set a higher bar for merger reviews, and has signalled unease with the consolidation of the media industry.

Grubitzsch/EPA
The European commission yesterday fined four companies, including Britain's Pilkington, a record
euros 1.4bn (pounds 1.1bn) for operating a five-year  cartel in the euros 2bn car glass market.

TD
Condemning its "unethical and wholly illegal" behaviour, Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, imposed an euros 896m penalty on French group Saint-Gobain, the heaviest levied on a company.
Pilkington, owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass, must pay  euros 370m for its part in the  price-fixing
and market-sharing cartel that was in operation between early 1998 and early 2003. Senior
managers from the companies in the  cartel held secret meetings in airports and hotels in Brussels,
Frankfurt and Paris to rig the market for windscreens, sidelights, rear windows and sunroofs in new
European cars.

Kroes said that the EC had imposed such high  fines because "it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour".

She added: "Management of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine."

Saint-Gobain, the owner of UK plasterboard group BPB and formed in the reign of Louis XIV, saw its fine increased by 60% because it was a repeat offender. It was penalised in 1984 and 1988 over cartels in the flat-glass market in Italy and Benelux.

The French group said it would appeal against the "excessive and disproportionate"  fine at the court of first instance,  Europe's second highest court. Its penalty is marginally higher than that imposed on Microsoft for abusing its dominance and dwarfs the previous record in a  cartel case - the euros 480m imposed on German lift manufacturer ThyssenKrupp last year.

Saint-Gobain said it had only set aside euros 520m for the  fine, which amounted to about 95% of the annual sales of its  car-glass  business in Europe and several decades of net income.

But Kroes insisted the  fine fell "well short" of the 10% cap of total turnover she was allowed to impose, with Saint- Gobain's annual sales running at  euros 43bn. The scale of the  fine is designed to act as a deterrent and Pilkington's penalty was set at 10% of its  euros 3.7bn turnover.

Commission officials mounted dawn raids at the four companies in 2005 after receiving "reliable" information from an anonymous informant.

These prompted Japan's Asahi Glass and its EU subsidiary, AGC Flat Glass  Europe, to come forward and help expose the  cartel. Asahi's  fine was halved as a result, under EC leniency rules, to  euros
113.5m.

Condemning its "unethical and wholly illegal" behaviour, Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, imposed an euros 896m penalty on French group Saint-Gobain, the heaviest levied on a company.

TD
Pilkington, owned by Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass, must pay  euros 370m for its part in the  price-fixing
and market-sharing cartel that was in operation between early 1998 and early 2003. Senior
managers from the companies in the  cartel held secret meetings in airports and hotels in Brussels,
Frankfurt and Paris to rig the market for windscreens, sidelights, rear windows and sunroofs in new
European cars.

Kroes said that the EC had imposed such high  fines because "it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour".

She added: "Management of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine."

Saint-Gobain, the owner of UK plasterboard group BPB and formed in the reign of Louis XIV, saw its fine increased by 60% because it was a repeat offender. It was penalised in 1984 and 1988 over cartels in the flat-glass market in Italy and Benelux.

The French group said it would appeal against the "excessive and disproportionate"  fine at the court of first instance,  Europe's second highest court. Its penalty is marginally higher than that imposed on Microsoft for abusing its dominance and dwarfs the previous record in a  cartel case - the euros 480m imposed on German lift manufacturer ThyssenKrupp last year.

Saint-Gobain said it had only set aside euros 520m for the  fine, which amounted to about 95% of the annual sales of its  car-glass  business in Europe and several decades of net income.

But Kroes insisted the  fine fell "well short" of the 10% cap of total turnover she was allowed to impose, with Saint- Gobain's annual sales running at  euros 43bn. The scale of the  fine is designed to act as a deterrent and Pilkington's penalty was set at 10% of its  euros 3.7bn turnover.

Commission officials mounted dawn raids at the four companies in 2005 after receiving "reliable" information from an anonymous informant.

These prompted Japan's Asahi Glass and its EU subsidiary, AGC Flat Glass  Europe, to come forward and help expose the  cartel. Asahi's  fine was halved as a result, under EC leniency rules, to  euros
113.5m.
A Belgian company, Soliver, was  fined euros 4.4m.

HD        EU fines auto glass cartel a record €1.4 billion

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission on Wednesday fined companies controlling the  European auto glass market a record €1.4 billion for price-fixing over five years. Two of the companies named have been caught engaging in  cartel practices before.

The action comes a week after investigators raided several big cement makers in  Europe, including other repeat offenders.

TD
Antitrust experts said such signs of chronic price-fixing raised questions about whether  European enforcement efforts could be effective without the threat of jail terms - as are routinely handed down in the United States.

The European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, insisted that stiff  fines should be enough to dissuade company executives from fixing prices, restricting supplies and dividing up markets in Europe.

''If you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine,'' she said at a news conference. The biggest  fine, €896 million, or $1.1 billion, on the French glass maker Saint-Gobain, was set so high - a record for a single company
- partly because it was a ''repeat offender,'' she said. The other repeat offender, Pilkington, which is the
British unit of Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan, was  fined €370 million.

Both were  fined last year for fixing the prices of flat glass for buildings and homes. Saint-Gobain also was fined twice in the 1980s for glass cartels in Italy and in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
The fine for Saint-Gobain, though substantial, is not likely to cripple the company. It had net income of
€2.1 billion in 2007 on sales of €43.4 billion.

Sophie Chevallon, a spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain, said the employees involved with the  cartel had been demoted. She was unable to say whether they might face further disciplinary or legal action.

In a statement, the company called the  fine ''excessive and disproportionate'' and said it planned to appeal the decision to EU courts in Luxembourg. The  fine represented ''several decades'' of profits for its automotive glass business in  Europe, it said.

Other companies involved in the car glass cartel were Asahi, a Japanese company,  fined €113.5 million, and Soliver, a Belgian company, fined €4.4 million.

The auto glass cartel came to light after an anonymous tip, Kroes said. Executives had met at airports and hotels in Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels to discuss contracts with carmakers and the allocation of glass supplies for new car models, she said.

The result was that the  European car industry - currently struggling with plummeting sales as a global credit crunch tightens its grip - had been paying more than it needed to for windshields, windows and
Page 75 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
sunroofs. Prices also were higher than they should have been for branded replacement glass sold to everyday consumers, she said, although the  commission did not say by how much.

The total penalty was the largest  fine against a single cartel in the EU, beating the €992 million fine against elevator makers last year. Even so, experts said that the efforts by the European Commission to ratchet penalties to ever-higher levels showed the limits of their enforcement abilities.

Policy makers in the United States decided a decade ago that handing out prison terms to individual perpetrators was the most effective way to deter  cartel formation, said Julian Joshua, a former top competition official at the  commission. ''Perceptions of acceptable behavior change when people who are members of your country club end up behind bars,'' he said.
The European Commission has no authority to prosecute criminal cases, though it can impose  fines
directly without the need for a judge's approval.

Kroes said she was pressing to make it easier for consumers and industries that had been hurt by high prices from cartels to sue for private damages, as in the United States.

Yet even in  European countries where jail is an option, authorities have shied away from using such a strong sanction.

Only Britain has jailed price-fixers under a law passed in 2002 that makes  cartel participation punishable by up to five years imprisonment, said Joshua. France and Ireland have the option but have not jailed anyone, he said.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission slapped its biggest penalty yet on a single company for operating a cartel, fining French glass maker Saint-Gobain SA 896 million  euros ($1.12 billion) for fixing the price of glass supplied to  Europe's car manufacturers.

The fines handed out to four European glass makers totaled 1.36 billion  euros and capped a surge in aggressive fines the European Union has issued to bust price-fixing cartels, from zipper and candle-wax manufacturers to brewers, under Neelie Kroes, the EU's antitrust regulator. Seven of the top 10 cartel fines the EU has levied have come in the past three years. Its total 2007  cartel fines set a record at 3.3 billion  euros.

TD
Also fined on Wednesday were Pilkington PLC of the United Kingdom, Japan's Asahi Glass Co. and Belgium's Soliver NV. The four companies together control 90% of the global market for  car glass, valued at 2 billion  euros in 2003, when the  commission began its investigations after receiving an anonymous tip.

From 1998 to 2003, the  commission said, the companies collaborated in "a series of meetings and other illicit contacts" to keep prices for car windscreens, windows and sun roofs higher than demand would dictate.

The companies "cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years," Ms. Kroes said, adding that the fines were necessary for "companies to learn the lesson the hard way."

The commission raised the fine on Saint-Gobain by 60% as a repeat offender. The company, which is based near Paris and is the largest supplier of building materials in the EU, was  fined for operating glass cartels in 1984, 1988 and again last year.

Saint-Gobain called the  fine "excessive and disproportionate" and said it will appeal. The  fine represents approximately 95% of the annual sales of Saint-Gobain's automotive-glass business in Europe and several decades' net income for the unit, the company said. Saint Gobain provisioned
560 million euros for the potential  fine last year, more than 300 million  euros short of the
commission's figure. The company's shares fell 4.6% on Wednesday to 28.35  euros in Paris.

Ms. Kroes defended the record-setting levy as appropriate because the company has overall annual revenue of 43 billion euros. EU rules limit cartel fines to 10% of annual revenue -- several times more than the commission's proposed fine.

The commission also imposed a penalty of 370 million  euros on London-based Pilkington. Pilkington said it had budgeted for the fine and would book it as an extraordinary item in the current year. The commission said it cut Asahi's fine in half, to 113.5 million  euros, because the Japanese firm cooperated with investigators. A spokesman for Asahi couldn't be reached. Soliver received the smallest penalty because it participated in only a few of the price-setting meetings, the  commission said. Soliver didn't return calls seeking comment.

Ms. Kroes is charged with guaranteeing fair competition among multinationals with substantial market share throughout the EU, but she can't pursue jail time for  cartel offenders, as can her U.S. counterpart, for example. A  fine is the only meaningful punishment the  commission can hand out.

HD     BELGIUM: Auto glass makers fined EUR1.4bn. BY      just-auto.com editorial team

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling EUR1,383,896,000 on  car glass manufacturers Asahi, UK-based Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver for illegal market sharing, and exchange of commercially sensitive information.
Asahi, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain are the three major players in  Europe. Between early 1998 and early
2003 the companies discussed target prices, market sharing and customer allocation in a series of
meetings and other illicit contacts, which is against the  commission’s ban on cartels and restrictive
business practices. The Belgian company Soliver also took part in some of the discussions.

TD
The four companies controlled about 90% of the glass used in  Europe in new cars and for original branded replacement glass for cars at that time, a market worth about EUR2bn in the last full year of the infringement.

The commission started the  cartel investigation on its own initiative following a tip-off from an anonymous source.
The fines imposed are the highest cartel fines the EC has ever imposed, both for an individual company
- EUR896m on Saint Gobain - and for a cartel as a whole. The EC increased the  fine on St Gobain by
60% because it was a repeat offender. Asahi provided additional information to help expose the
infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50% to EUR113.5m. Pilkington was  fined EUR370m and
Soliver EUR4.396m

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth EUR2bn in the last year of the  cartel. The overall  fines are high because of the large market, the seriousness of the case, and Saint-Gobain’s earlier offences.

“The commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot and will not tolerate such illegal behaviour. Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy fine.”

(Adds analyst comment)

TOKYO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Shares in two major Japanese glass makers slid more than 6 percent on Thursday, with a fall in the value of the  euro set to hit their earnings on top of  fines for taking part in a European auto glass cartel.

TD
An analyst said the  fines would have little impact on the earnings of Asahi Glass Co Ltd and Nippon
Sheet Glass Co Ltd as they had largely allowed for the penalties in their accounts.
The European Commission imposed its highest ever  cartel penalty, fining four companies more than
1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion) for illegally working together in  Europe's 2 billion euro auto glass market.

It fined French building materials group Saint-Gobain 896 million  euros -- the biggest such EU penalty on an individual company -- for running a  cartel with Asahi Glass, Pilkington and Soliver between 1998 and 2003.

Pilkington -- a British unit of Nippon Sheet -- will pay 370 million  euros, Asahi 113.5 million and Belgium's Soliver 4.396 million for "discussing target prices, market sharing and customer allocation", the Commission said.
By midday, Nippon Sheet shares were down 9.6 percent at 312 yen while Asahi Glass, which the
European Commission said cooperated with the inquiry, slid 6.5 percent to 507 yen.
Shares in Saint-Gobain fell 5.20 percent on Wednesday.

"The penalties were imposed for past actions, and they will have little impact on their earnings. Rather, their shares are affected by the yen's gains against the  euro," said Credit Suisse analyst Shinya Yamada.

The yen retreated on Thursday from a two-week high against the  euro as short-term players locked in profits, but it retained its overall strength as investors remain wary of riskier assets and favour the perceived safety of the Japanese currency. [ID:nT239877]

Nippon Sheet said it would book a special loss of 8.9 billion yen in the six months to September due to the fine, adding to a previous loss provision of $374 million. Asahi Glass said it had already set aside money to pay the  fine.

Saint-Gobain said it would appeal the decision but officials of both Nippon Sheet Glass and Asahi Glass said they needed to study the ruling before deciding what action to take.

"Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and  European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way -- if you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference.

The highest  cartel fine handed down previously by Brussels was 992.3 million  euros in 2007 to a number of elevator manufacturers.

REPEAT OFFENDER

The Commission said it increased the fine for Saint-Gobain by 60 percent because the firm was a repeat offender, having been  fined for cartel activities in flat glass in 1984 and 1988.

Saint-Gobain, Pilkington and Asahi were also among four makers of flat glass used for windows, doors and mirrors fined 486.9 million euros a year ago for illegally coordinating price rises.

"Asahi cooperated fully with the  Commission and provided additional information to help to expose the infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50 percent," the EU executive said in a statement.
Asahi's  fine concerned its Belgian-based AGC Flat Glass unit.

In 2005, antitrust authorities raided several car glass producers across Europe following a tip-off from an anonymous informant, the Commission said.

The Commission said the four firms held regular discussions in airports and hotels about the  auto        glass market, in which they together held a 90 percent market share for new cars and branded replacement glass.

"The companies discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming car models to be produced and renegotiations of ongoing contracts, and exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information," the  commission said.

Nov 13 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in the New York Times business pages on
Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.

* The Treasury Department on Wednesday officially abandoned the original strategy behind its $700 billion effort to rescue the financial system, as administration officials acknowledged that banks and financial institutions were as unwilling as ever to lend to consumers. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is hoping to put in place a major new lending program that would be run by the Federal Reserve and aimed at unlocking the frozen consumer credit market.

TD
* Momentum is building in Washington for a rescue package for the auto industry to head off a possible bankruptcy filing by General Motors Corp , which is rapidly running low on cash.

* Life insurance companies, hobbled by real estate investments and committed to paying some costly retirement contracts, face more cuts in their credit ratings before the year is up and have little choice but to seek capital in unforgiving markets.

* Asian shares fell on Thursday to their lowest point this month on uncertainty about whether the U.S. can succeed in its massive banking rescue and as Intel Corp's revenue warning stoked corporate earnings worries.

* Hedge fund managers usually shun the spotlight. But five of them, billionaires all, are about to come under the glare on Capitol Hill. The money managers - Philip Falcone, Kenneth Griffin, John Paulson, James Simons and George Soros - have been called by a House panel to discuss some of their trade secrets at a hearing on Thursday.

* At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, legislators concerned about the rising tide of foreclosures encouraged the financial industry to alter the terms of more mortgages to allow people to stay in their homes.

* Shares on Wall Street tumbled more than 4 percent on Wednesday as frightened investors wondered how long the economic slowdown would last, how deep it would cut and whether Washington could do anything to stop the bleeding.

* The banking giant Morgan Stanley outlined plans on Wednesday to cut 10 percent of the staff in its biggest business, the institutional securities group, which covers everything from investment banking to stock trading.

* The $6 billion International Monetary Fund-led bailout of Iceland appeared to be on the back burner Wednesday amid haggling over how the country would compensate overseas customers who lost deposits when Icelandic banks failed.

* Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall, reached a modest wage deal on Wednesday with employers in the flagship engineering sector, ending the threat of strikes in an area already hurting from an economic slowdown.

* ING , the Dutch financial services company, reported its first quarterly loss on Wednesday as it wrote down the value of investments hurt by the tight credit markets.

Page 83 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* The Nets have announced a program that they said can help fans weather the economic crisis - if not the team's injury troubles or its mediocre start. The team said Wednesday that it would provide unemployed fans with 1,500 free tickets over the course of five home games if they sign up for the Nets Employment Program.

* The Boston Red Sox froze their ticket prices at already-high 2008 levels Wednesday, a clear reflection of the worsening economic crisis.

* Prices for the flat screens in televisions, personal computers and cellphones have plummeted in recent years - but the decline would have been even faster if it hadn't been for an international price-fixing  cartel, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.

* Intel Corp , the world's largest producer of computer chips, warned on Wednesday that its sales could fall as much as 19 percent in the fourth quarter.

* Google Inc announced on Wednesday that it would begin selling space on YouTube search-results pages to advertisers, part of its effort to turn its expensive acquisition into a major revenue producer.
* The European Commission fined companies controlling the Continent's  auto glass market a record
1.4 billion euros ($1.77 billion), on Wednesday for price-fixing over five years. Two of the companies have
been caught engaging in  cartel practices before.

* A senior Swiss executive at the banking giant UBS has been indicted in an investigation of the bank and its offshore private banking services for wealthy Americans, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.

GLASSMAKER Pilkington has been fined £310m by the European Commission for operating a car   
glass cartel.

The St Helens-based giant's Japanese owner said today it may appeal against the penalty, imposed following an investigation which dates back more than three years.

TD
The Commission slapped fines totalling £1.16bn (1.383bn  euros) on four companies, the highest
cartel fines it has ever imposed.

France's Saint-Gobain was hit with the biggest fine of £752.14m. Japan's Asahi Glass was ordered to pay £95m and Belgium's Soliver received a £3.7m fine.
Saint-Gobain received a higher penalty as it was a repeat offender, said the  Commission.

In 2005, EU anti-trust authorities raided several car glass producers across Europe following a tip off from an anonymous informant, the Commission said in a statement.

It said that between early 1998 and early 2003 the companies discussed target prices, market sharing and customer allocation in a series of meetings and other illicit contacts.

The four firms controlled about 90 per cent of the glass used in the  European Economic Area for windscreens, sidelights, back lights and sunroofs in new cars, a market worth 2bn  euros at the time.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth two billion  euros in the last year of the  cartel.

"The Commission has imposed such high fines because it cannot, and will not, tolerate such illegal behaviour.

"Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and  European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine.

"The overall  fines are high because of the large market, the seriousness of the case and Saint-Gobain's earlier offences."

The Commission's investigations revealed the companies had held meetings at airports and hotels in different European cities, including Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels to exchange commercially lucrative and confidential information. It added that they held regular discussions with a view to allocating themselves supplies to car manufacturers to keep their market shares as stable as possible.
Pilkington was bought for £2.2bn by Japan's Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006.

In a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchanage, it said: "The company will examine the decision and decide on future action, including a possible appeal."

It added that it had made a provision of £250m for the  fine and was reviewing its first-half results and outlook for the full year to take account of the  fine.

HD          Saint-Gobain is fined a record $1.12 billion --- Punishment signals  tough EU crackdown on auto-glass cartel

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission slapped its biggest penalty yet on a single company for operating a cartel, fining French glass maker Saint-Gobain SA 896 million  euros ($1.12 billion) for fixing the price of glass supplied to  Europe's car manufacturers.

The fines handed out to four European glass makers totaled 1.36 billion  euros and capped a surge in aggressive fines the European Union has issued to bust price-fixing cartels, from zipper and
candle-wax manufacturers to brewers, under Neelie Kroes, the EU's antitrust regulator.

TD
Seven of the top 10 cartel fines the EU has levied have come in the past three years. Under Ms. Kroes, the commission has levied a total 6.7 billion  euros in fines against cartels.

Also fined on Wednesday were Pilkington PLC of the United Kingdom, Japan's Asahi Glass Co. and Belgium's Soliver NV. The four companies together control 90% of the global market for  car glass, valued at 2 billion  euros in 2003, when the  commission began its investigations after receiving an anonymous tip.

From 1998 to 2003, the  commission said, the companies collaborated in "a series of meetings and other illicit contacts" to keep prices for car windscreens, windows and sun roofs higher than demand would dictate.
The companies "cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years," Ms. Kroes said, adding the
fines were necessary for "companies to learn the lesson the hard way."

The commission raised the fine on Saint-Gobain by 60% as a repeat offender. The company, which is based near Paris and is the largest supplier of building materials in the EU, was  fined for operating glass cartels in 1984, 1988 and again last year.

Saint-Gobain called the  fine "excessive and disproportionate" and said it will appeal. The  fine represents approximately 95% of the annual sales of Saint-Gobain's automotive-glass business in Europe and several decades' net income for the unit, the company said. Saint Gobain provisioned 560 million euros for the potential  fine last year, more than 300 million euros short of the  commission's figure. The company's shares fell 4.6% on Wednesday to 28.35 euros in Paris.
Ms. Kroes defended the record-setting levy as appropriate. The company has overall annual revenue
of 43 billion euros, and EU rules limit  cartel fines to 10% of annual revenue -- several times more than
the commission's proposed fine.

The commission also imposed a penalty of 370 million  euros on London-based Pilkington. The company didn't return calls and emails seeking comment. The  commission said it cut Asahi's  fine in half, to 113.5 million  euros, because the Japanese firm cooperated with EU investigators. A spokesman for Asahi couldn't be reached. Soliver received the smallest penalty because it participated
in only a few of the price-setting meetings, the  commission said. A spokesman for Soliver didn't return calls seeking comment.

The car glass case underscores the importance of rules drawn up in 2006 that multiply a fine, which is based on market size, by the number of years companies fixed prices. Previously, the commission merely increased the base  fine by 10% per year the cartel operated.

Observers said they expect the EU to continue to pursue hefty  cartel penalties. Ms. Kroes is charged with guaranteeing fair competition among multinationals with substantial market share throughout the EU, but she can't pursue jail time for cartel offenders, as can her U.S. counterpart, for example. A  fine is the only meaningful punishment the commission can hand out.
The EU set a record in 2007 by handing out 3.3 billion  euros of cartel fines, including a 479 million
euro levy on Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG for fixing the prices of elevators and escalators. So far in
2008, the  commission has imposed fines of 2.3 billion  euros. The proceeds go to the EU's annual
budget.

Ms. Kroes said she hoped to entice more companies to admit guilt under a settlement program started in July that offers a 10% rebate in exchange for a guilty plea.

HD            Glass Makers Are Fined $1.7 Billion in Europe's  War on Price Fixing

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission fined companies controlling the Continent's  auto glass market a record 1.4 billion euros ($1.77 billion), on Wednesday for price-fixing over five years. Two of the companies have been caught engaging in  cartel practices before.

A week earlier, investigators raided several big cement makers in  Europe, including other repeat offenders. Antitrust specialists said such signs of chronic price fixing raised questions about whether European enforcement efforts could be effective without the threat of jail terms, as are routinely handed down in the United States.

TD
The European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, insisted that stiff  fines should be enough to dissuade executives from fixing prices, restricting supplies and dividing markets in  Europe.

''If you cheat, you will get a heavy  fine,'' Ms. Kroes said at a news conference. The biggest  fine, 896 million euros ($1.1 billion), on the French glass maker Saint-Gobain, was set so high -- a record for a single company -- partly because it was a repeat offender, she said. The other repeat offender, Pilkington, which is the British unit of Nippon Sheet Glass of Japan, was  fined 370 million euros ($470 million).

Both were  fined last year for fixing the prices of flat glass for buildings and homes. Saint-Gobain was also fined twice in the 1980s for  cartel pricing in Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
The fine for Saint-Gobain, though substantial, is not likely to cripple the company. It had net income of
2.1 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in 2007 on sales of 43.4 billion  euros.

Sophie Chevallon, a spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain, said the employees involved with the  cartel had been demoted. She was unable to say whether they might face further disciplinary or legal action.

In a statement, the company called the  fine ''excessive and disproportionate,'' and said it planned to appeal the decision in  European courts in Luxembourg. The  fine represented ''several decades'' of profit for its automotive glass business in  Europe, it said.

Other companies involved were Asahi, a Japanese company, fined 113.5 million euros ($144 million), and Soliver, a Belgian company,  fined 4.4 million euros ($5.6 million).
The auto glass cartel came to light after an anonymous tip, Ms. Kroes said.

Executives had met at airports and hotels in Brussels, Frankfurt and Paris to discuss contracts with automakers and the allocation of glass supplies for new models, she said.

The result was that the  European auto industry -- currently struggling with plummeting sales as a global credit crisis tightens its grip -- had been paying more than needed for windshields, windows and sunroofs.

Prices were also higher than they should have been for branded replacement glass sold to consumers, she said, although the  commission did not say by how much.

European officials last week raided the offices of several big cement makers, including the French company Lafarge,  fined in 2002 for participating in a plasterboard  cartel, and HeidelbergCement, fined in 2003 by German authorities for rigging markets there.

The fine against the glass makers was the largest  fine against a single cartel in the European Union, topping the 992 million euros ($1.2 billion) levied against elevator makers last year. Even so, experts said that the efforts by the European Commission to raise penalties to ever-higher levels showed
the limits of their enforcement abilities.

Policy makers in the United States decided a decade ago that prison terms were the most effective way to deter  cartel formation, said Julian Joshua, a former competition official at the  commission.

''Perceptions of acceptable behavior change when people who are members of your country club end up behind bars,'' he said.

Ms. Kroes said she was pressing to make it easier for consumers and industries that had been hurt by high prices from cartels to sue for damages, as in the United States. That could make discovery of price fixing even more costly for companies.

Yet even in  European countries where prison is an option, authorities have shied away from using such a strong sanction.

Only Britain has imprisoned price fixers under a law passed in 2002 that makes  cartel participation punishable by a sentence up to five years, Mr. Joshua said. France and Ireland have the option but have not imprisoned anyone.

Interest rates Hopes of more rate cuts were heightened as the Bank of England said that the economy was probably already in recession as it published its quarterly inflation report yesterday. It said that output would shrink for a year, before picking up in the second half of next year. It also forecast that inflation, at present at a 16-year high of 5.2 per cent, could drop sharply to as low as 1 per cent in 2011.

TD
Unemployment: In the three months to September the number of people without a job rose to
1.825million, the highest level since the three months to December 1997, offical figures showed. The
number of people on jobless benefit rose by 36,500, the biggest increase since December 1992.

Average earnings growth: In the three months to September, average earnings, including bonuses, eased to 3.3 per cent, down from 3.4 per cent in the three months to August. The growth in earnings excluding bonuses remained steady at 3.6 per cent.

Eurozone industrial production: The  European Union statistics body said that industrial production in the 15-country area fell by 1.6 per cent month-on month in September and by 2.4 per cent
year-on-year. The  eurozone economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter and us estimated to have contracted by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter.

Iceland's rescue package: The International Monetary Fund's $6billion (Pounds 3.99billion) package of loans for Iceland has been delayed by the insistence of the Netherlands, Germany and Britain that it must be conditional on guarantees to foreign depositors. Page 63

Chinese retail sales: Official figures showed that growth in Chinese retail sales fell in October to 22 per cent, from 23.3 per cent in September, but also showed that there was a sharp slowdown in spending in every sector, raising doubts about the headline figure.

Hong Kong's economy: Economists believe that year-on-year growth in Hong Kong in the quarter from July to September fell to about 2.5 per cent, a level not seen since 2003 during the Sars virus outbreak. Page 65
Banking & finance

Nationwide: The building society said that it planned to raise Pounds 1.5billion via a three-year government-backed bond. Nationwide is the fifth UK lender to make use of a government guarantee.

The European Commission imposed a record fine of almost Euro 1.4billion (Pounds 1.17billion) on four car glass manufacturers yesterday for operating a  cartel and sharing commercial secrets for five years.

The penalty included the heaviest punishment inflicted on a single company: Saint-Gobain, of France, has been ordered to pay  Euro 896million.

TD
Fines were imposed on Pilkington, of Britain (Euro 370million), Asahi/AGC, of Japan (Euro
113.5million), and Soliver, of Belgium (Euro 4.4million).

The four were found guilty by  European anti-trust regulators of running a  cartel between early 1998 and 2003 by discussing target prices, market-sharing and customer allocations. They agreed these during secret meetings in hotels and airports.

Neelie Kroes, the  European Competition Commissioner, said: "These companies cheated the car industry and car buyers for five years in a market worth  Euro 2billion in the last year of the  cartel. The overall fines are high because of the large market and seriousness of the case."

Ms Kroes also urged individuals or businesses that believe that they have suffered from the anti-competitive behaviour to seek damages against the companies before national courts.

Saint-Gobain's penalty reached record levels after the Commission increased the initial  fine by 60 per cent because the company was a repeat offender. Asahi's fine was halved after it provided information that helped to break the  cartel.
The Commission made a series of dawn raids in 2005 at the premises of several  car glass
manufacturers after receiving an anonymous tip-off.

At the time, the four companies controlled about 90 per cent of the  European market for new and replacement car glass used in windows and sunroofs. Saint Gobain described the  fine as "excessive and disproportionate" and said that it would appeal.

The previous highest fine, of Euro 992.3million, was imposed last year on a group of companies for operating a lifts cartel. The biggest individual penalty of  Euro 480million was imposed on ThyssenKrupp, one of that  cartel's members.

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202.TO) said Friday that its profits for the interim period ended Sept. 30 tumbled on year due to the yen's strength, higher raw materials costs and weak demand in North America and elsewhere.

The Tokyo-based company said its net profit plunged 64% to Y18.31 billion in the fiscal first half from a year-earlier profit of Y51.47 billion.
Sales for the half fell 0.7% to Y431.08 billion from Y433.94 billion, while operating profit dropped 36%
to Y17.20 billion.

On Wednesday, the  European Commission fined four car-glass  producers, including Nippon Sheet Glass's unit Pilkington PLC, for exchanging commercially-sensitive information and sharing out contracts. Totaling EUR1.38 billion, the  fine was the largest ever imposed on a  cartel in Europe.

Of that, Nippon Sheet said Thursday that it has to pay EUR370 million, or about Y45 billion. However, it added that it will look into the decision by the  European authority to consider its response, which could include appeal.

Even so, the company revised the amount of reserves it set aside in anticipation of the penalty, forcing it to book a special loss of Y8.9 billion in the second quarter ended September.

For this fiscal year ending March 2009, Nippon Sheet Glass lowered its earnings outlook in expectation that the currently-difficult business environment will continue throughout the second half. It cut net profit outlook to Y9 billion from Y27.5 billion, and lowered its operating profit projection to Y20 billion from
Y31 billion. Sales are now pegged at Y810 billion, lower than the Y880 billion previously forecast.
The company compiles earnings based on Japanese accounting standards.

LP
The latest round of  fines and criminal complaints levied against Japanese companies says it all: the light touch of Japan's good-governance types helps to perpetuate a corrosive corporate modus operandi.

Busted on three continents in as many alleged cases of price-fixing this week, the companies read like a Who's Who of Japan Inc.; they include Sharp, Nippon Sheet Glass, and a unit of Nippon Steel Corp.

TD
A widely accepted cost of doing business in Japan, it seems, amounts to paying moderate  fines, doing the ritual-bow-and-apology jig and dumping some fall guys. What can be done?

Tougher fines are an obvious step, as is consideration of jail time instead of the more usual suspended sentences.
For guidance on financial penalties, Japan's regulators might look to  Europe and the U.S.

This week, the  European Commission and the U.S. slapped fat fines on seven European and Asian companies, including three in Japan, allegedly involved in auto-glass or liquid-crystal display cartels. The auto-glass-related fines totaled a substantial $1.7 billion; the LCD  fines came to nearly $600 million.

The fines came as Japan filed criminal complaints against three of its steel companies for alleged price fixing.

The hefty  European and U.S.  fines stand in contrast to Japan's practice of capping criminal penalties at $5 million per violator and an administrative  fine of as much as 10% of the revenue from a company's cartel-controlled sales.

Over the past six years, Japan's antitrust watchdog has punished - or filed criminal complaints against - dozens of steel makers in five different incidents. The nation's two biggest steel producers, Nippon
Steel and JFE Holdings, have been caught up in each incident.

In the most recent case, in June, Nippon Steel was  fined $6.8 million - a drop in the bucket for a company expecting revenue of $54 billion and $3.3 billion in net profit in the fiscal year through March. For all three firms  fined in that case, the sum was only $20 million.

It's also time for corporate chieftains to implement internal controls. One low-hanging fruit is the kansayaku system. Most Japanese companies employ these board-level compliance officers, who are supposed to be independent of management. Too often, kansayaku are industry allies or ex-regulators of the firm's industry.

That Japan's companies may not be any more lax than those in other nations is hardly an excuse for regulators, prosecutors and well-meaning business executives to accept the status quo.

=HEARD ON THE STREET: Iceland's Lesson For The G20

By Joel Sherwood
A DOW JONES COLUMN

As a test case for an internationally coordinated financial rescue, efforts to drum up emergency aid for
Iceland are distinctly dispiriting ahead of this weekend's G20 summit.

TD
Getting help to Iceland is urgent. International trading of the kronur is essentially frozen. The
import-dependent island economy is on the cusp of a slump and faces rampant near-term inflation.
There have been reports of possible mass emigration.

Iceland and the International Monetary Fund did agree on a $2 billion loan back on Oct. 24 to help restore the tiny island economy's stability after its banking sector collapsed. But the IMF has set an important condition. Iceland has to secure twice that amount from other sources before the IMF hands over any money. That's a pretty tall order for a borrower already teetering on the brink.

So it's little surprise that the rescue effort has hit a wall. Some other institutions that might lend to Iceland are waiting for the IMF money to come first. Sweden's central bank, for one, will consider letting Iceland draw on a EUR500 million swap facility only after the IMF approves its part of the bailout.

Further complicating the matter is a dispute between Iceland and the U.K. and the Netherlands over billions of pounds of deposits in an overseas unit of a failed Icelandic bank. No one talked about this as a potential deal breaker when a tentative IMF loan was announced three weeks ago. Now it seems the IMF has bowed to pressure from London and the Hague not to extend any credit until the two governments' disputes with Reykjavik are resolved. That may yet prove a protracted, legally complex process.

Iceland's leaders haven't covered themselves in glory with a number of u-turns. And rushing to borrow funds from Russia - another deal that's still pending - didn't endear the government to western creditors.

The result is that the rescue of a tiny island economy has become bogged down in multilateral wrangling. As the leaders of the world's biggest economies gather in Washington this weekend, the Icelandic experience should serve to temper expectations. Investors banking on a coherent international response to the much bigger issues facing the world's economy risk being disappointed.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Finishing Touches At The Vivendi Hybrid

By Matthew Curtin
A DOW JONES COLUMN

After the tech bubble burst in 2000, Vivendi nearly toppled over. During this crisis, the French entertainment and telecoms hybrid is outperforming its media rivals.

Page 105 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The reason: Around 70% of Vivendi's revenue comes from subscriptions to its broadband, television, mobile-phone, online-game and other services, and relatively little from volatile advertising. Vivendi is bravely sticking to its earnings outlook for the full year. Bertelsmann, News Corporation (owner of the Wall Street Journal), Time Warner and TFI - the main rival to Vivendi's Canal Plus television unit in France - have all lowered forecasts.

Underpinning Vivendi's performance are two big acquisitions it made in late 2007 and closed earlier this year. They consolidated its position as France's number two fixed-line and wireless operator and
created Activision Blizzard, one of the world's biggest games businesses in which Vivendi has a 54%
stake. Vivendi's music, telecoms, TV, and games units now all have critical mass.

The company came close to doubling its net debt through the deals. But such is Vivendi's cashflow, that net borrowings are expected to return to under EUR6 billion by the end of 2009, close to the level before the deals were done.

If Vivendi's finances look manageable, more elusive is sustaining the broad revenue growth Vivendi reported in the third quarter. Tough economic conditions could peg back subscriber growth at Canal Plus, and telecoms concerns SFR, and Maroc Telecom. In France, SFR's margins are under pressure from subscriber acquisition and retention costs. And the slack regulatory regime makes France Telecom, the still-dominant former monopoly, tough to compete with in multimedia broadband.

Vivendi still has unfinished business. Most importantly, there's the future of Vodafone's stake in SFR - which Vivendi would like to buy. The U.K. operator does not want to sell. Perhaps a deep recession will encourage the two sides to strike a deal.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Japan's Complacent Corporate Controls

By James Simms
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The latest round of  fines and criminal complaints levied against Japanese companies says it all: the light touch of Japan's good-governance types helps to perpetuate a corrosive corporate modus operandi.
Busted on three continents in as many alleged cases of price-fixing this week, the companies read like a
Who's Who of Japan Inc.; they include Sharp, Nippon Sheet Glass, and a unit of Nippon Steel Corp.

A widely accepted cost of doing business in Japan, it seems, amounts to paying moderate  fines, doing the ritual-bow-and-apology jig and dumping some fall guys. What can be done?

Tougher fines are an obvious step, as is consideration of jail time instead of the more usual suspended sentences.
For guidance on financial penalties, Japan's regulators might look to  Europe and the U.S.

This week, the  European Commission and the U.S. slapped fat fines on seven European and Asian companies, including three in Japan, allegedly involved in auto-glass or liquid-crystal display cartels. The auto-glass-related fines totaled a substantial $1.7 billion; the LCD  fines came to nearly $600 million.

The fines came as Japan filed criminal complaints against three of its steel companies for alleged price fixing.
The hefty  European and U.S.  fines stand in contrast to Japan's practice of capping criminal penalties at
$5 million per violator and an administrative  fine of as much as 10% of the revenue from a company's
cartel-controlled sales.

Over the past six years, Japan's antitrust watchdog has punished - or filed criminal complaints against - dozens of steel makers in five different incidents. The nation's two biggest steel producers, Nippon Steel and JFE Holdings, have been caught up in each incident.

In the most recent case, in June, Nippon Steel was  fined $6.8 million - a drop in the bucket for a company expecting revenue of $54 billion and $3.3 billion in net profit in the fiscal year through March. For all three firms  fined in that case, the sum was only $20 million.

It's also time for corporate chieftains to implement internal controls. One low-hanging fruit is the kansayaku system. Most Japanese companies employ these board-level compliance officers, who are supposed to be independent of management. Too often, kansayaku are industry allies or ex-regulators of the firm's industry.

That Japan's companies may not be any more lax than those in other nations is hardly an excuse for regulators, prosecutors and well-meaning business executives to accept the status quo.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Easy Generosity At Microsoft

By Martin Peers
A DOW JONES COLUMN

Interest-free loans are no longer merely the preserve of car salesmen. Software giant Microsoft unveiled its own 0% deal Thursday for "qualifying" customers buying certain kinds of business software.

It is probably a coincidence but still worth noting that the offer came the day after tech-bellwether Intel lowered guidance for the fourth quarter, a sign that the PC market is weakening -- never good news for Microsoft.

The offer also shows how the economic slump could sharpen the divide between strong and weak companies. Microsoft, working with outside firms, has long offered financing to certain business customers. While it is using those firms to arrange the 0% offer, it is subsidizing the cost. Microsoft had
$20.7 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet at Sept. 30, giving it the wherewithal to spend money to boost sales. Weaker companies, needing to preserve cash, might struggle to show such generosity.

Microsoft isn't, however, bearing the credit risk -- unlike rivals such as International Business Machines, which runs a customer-financing business.

That is fortunate. Assessing credit risk is hardly Microsoft's specialty. Indeed, as the current crisis demonstrates, that is something even the so-called experts have struggled to get their arms around in the past few years.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Pension Pain At BT Group May Spread

By Sean Walters
A DOW JONES COLUMN

Call it the revenge of the Old World. On top of a recession hammering earnings,  Europe's companies could face bigger payments to plug pension deficits than standard accounting measures suggest. No wonder BT Group is proposing radical changes like raising the retirement age from 60 to 65.

According to the U.K. telco's accounts, its pension plan, with assets of more than GBP 34 billion ($51 billion), had a GBP 900 million pretax surplus at the end of September.

But the plan's liabilities are discounted against a benchmark of AA-rated corporate-bond yields. As those rose to 7.25% in September from 6.85% in March, it helped reduce the plan's GBP 33.4 billion liabilities by about GBP 1 billion.

However, BT faces a triennial pension-fund valuation at year end -- where the actuaries don't use the corporate-bond benchmark. They typically discount liabilities using a lower modified risk-free rate, which Merrill Lynch estimates at around 0.5% above U.K. government-bond yields, currently 4.75%. If there is a deficit on that basis, trustees can claim top-up payments.

Under that scenario, and assuming Sept. 30 asset values, the implied deficit for BT could hit GBP 5 billion. That would mean a GBP 500 million annual cash call to plug the gap over 10 years. Admittedly, the calculation doesn't incorporate any changes to BT's pension conditions to reduce liabilities. But it also ignores any hit to the fund's assets from October's market wipeout. [ 14-11-08 1700GMT ]

Other companies in the spotlight on pension deficits include British Airways, Grupo Ferrovial and ITV. Without a sharp bounce in the price of equities and other assets, expect more retirement conditions to be rewritten as companies scramble to avoid pension-related cash calls.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Energy Prey Can Find Partners

By Liam Denning
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The energy sector's big boys walk with a renewed swagger these days.

The most striking example is Exelon Corp.'s hostile bid for smaller independent power producer NRG Energy. Jim Rogers, chief executive of big utility Duke Energy, said this week he expects to see the entire IPP sector consolidate or be bought out within 18 months.

The case runs thus: The IPPs are generally smaller than regulated utilities. Part of their appeal is the potential for growth as they build new power plants. But these companies are highly leveraged, making them dependent on access to external capital to fund new projects.

Consider, for example, a new 1,000 megawatt nuclear-powered plant. At a notional cost of $5 million per megawatt, the bill could top $5 billion. That is a hefty number for a sector where market values are measured in single-figure billions of dollars.

Hence, the argument for absorption into bigger, better-capitalized utilities. There is some merit to this. The IPPs have been hurt by the credit crunch, with stocks typically down by 50% or more this year. Warren Buffett's sudden swoop on Constellation Energy Group in September appeared to herald open season on generators.

So are they all just prey waiting for a predator? Not necessarily. Constellation, having spooked the market about a potential collateral call in its trading business, was a special case.

The IPPs are neither homogenous nor forced to expand at all costs. At midyear, net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization multiples ranged between 2.9 times (at Reliant
Energy) and 6.5 times (at Calpine) for the main IPPs, according to CreditSights analyst Andy DeVries. In terms of liquidity, none face near-term maturity concerns.

Equity investors targeting the sector for growth should also bear in mind that a necessary period of cash conservation, limiting development-capital expenditure, is no reason to exit from the stocks altogether. Fewer new power plants, while limiting growth in power volumes, also serve to tighten electricity markets, supporting prices.

But what if the world has changed and the financing pool that IPPs enjoyed before the credit crunch never regains its former depth? That is entirely possible. However, there is no reason why merchant generators can't partner with other companies to defray risks and costs on individual projects, rather than sell the entire business.

Earlier this week, another company with a reeling stock price from a different part of the energy business, Chesapeake Energy, did exactly that. Rather than sell itself to an oil major, it brought in StatoilHydro to help develop a major natural gas prospect.

NRG's defense will be a test case. Right now, the price implied by Exelon's offer is at a 13% premium to NRG's stock price, suggesting skepticism about the deal happening under the current terms. Such sentiment is justified.
Overheard

Liquidity is a fluid concept -- and a vital one in today's tumultuous markets. On Fortress Investment Group's third-quarter earnings call Thursday, co-president Michael Novogratz explained that his global macro hedge fund, down about 19% year-to-date, has gone 80% liquid while waiting for clarity in the markets.

When an investor asked him to define "liquid," the normally silk-tongued Mr. Novogratz stammered through his answer.



Page 108 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's interesting, it's a shifting bar right now," he explained. "Outside of, uh . . . outside of, uh . . . S&P futures and G3 currencies everything varies to degrees of illiquidity. Markets are almost functionally shut in anything small-cap or anything credit related."

So what does the 80% liquid really mean? After regaining his poise, the definition he reached was any position that could be sold within one to two weeks. Yikes.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Google Isn't Immune

By Martin Peers
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The Achilles heel in Google's business model is showing itself.

The Internet giant's big perceived advantage over traditional media has long been its consumer-driven business model. Whereas traditional media has more of a marketer-driven approach -- advertisers buy ads on TV or in newspapers and hope to persuade people to buy their products -- search ads only cost money if consumers click on them. And the price advertisers pay for search ads should reflect how often the clicks translate into purchases.

This approach ensures Google is directly exposed to consumer behavior. And that's an issue now. Consumers are cutting back spending so much they're showing "a reduced desire to even search for new products, much less purchase them," according to Majestic Research, which tracks consumer behavior and keyword pricing. IAC, whose Ask.com search engine's ad sales are handled by Google, noted on a conference call last week that the search trends "have not been good over the last 30 to 60 days ... particularly on commercial-oriented queries."

What's more, those consumers still in buying mode are browsing around for bargains more, thereby reducing the returns on individual clicks. And that is reducing the price that marketers are willing to pay for keywords, a point also noted by IAC.

The result is likely to be a sharp slowing in Google's growth rate. Analysts have already begun cutting estimates: Jefferies, for instance, is now projecting 2009 revenue growth of 11% compared with its
19.7% forecast less than a month ago. More estimate cuts are inevitable, keeping pressure on Google stock.

Growth of 11% is nothing to sneeze at - particularly when revenue is falling at many traditional media outlets. But it's proof, for anyone who needed it, that not even Google is immune to the economy. [

GLASS giant Pilkington has been hit by a £309m  fine for its involvement in a  European cartel.

The European Commissionfined four companies - St Helens based Pilkington and its rivals, Saint-Gobain , Asahi Glass and Soliver - more than £1bn for their role in fixing glass prices in the automotive industry between 1998 and 2003.

TD
The Commission said the four firms held regular discussions in airports and hotels about the  auto       glass market, in which they together held a 90% market share for new cars and branded replacement glass.

It said: "The companies discussed the allocation of  car glass to be supplied for upcoming car models to be produced and renegotiations of ongoing contracts, and exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information."
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "Companies that damage consumers and  European
industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way"
Pilkington, which employs nearly 2,000 in the St Helens area, is been owned by Japanese glassmaker
Nippon Sheet Glass.

The European Commission imposed, on 12 November, a record collective  fine of €1.38 billion on four car glass producers accused of having formed a  cartel. The French company Saint-Gobain received the highest fine of €896 million. The other companies targeted are the Japanese company Asahi (a  fine of
€113.5 million), the British company Pilkington (€370 million) and the Belgian company Soliver (€4.396 million). Asahi, Pilkington and Saint-Gobain are the three major players in  Europe.

TD
These are the highest  cartel fines the Commission has ever imposed, both for an individual company and for a cartel as a whole, specified the Commission. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes explained that "the overall  fines are high because of the large market, the seriousness of the case, and Saint-Gobain's earlier offences [...] Management and shareholders of companies that damage consumers and European industry by running cartels must learn their lessons the hard way - if you cheat, you will
get a heavy fine". In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the combined market share and the geographical scope of the  cartel agreements.

The four companies are accused of having agreed, between early 1998 and early 2003, to fix prices and allocate between themselves  car glass supplies to car manufacturers and to keep the market shares of each individual car glass supplier as stable as possible at the  European level. They also exchanged commercially lucrative and confidential information.

The Commission started this investigation on its own initiative on the basis of reliable information provided by an anonymous informant. It increased the  fines for St Gobain by 60% because it was a repeat offender (namely, in 1988 for Flat Glass Benelux' and in 1984 for Flat Glass Italy'). Asahi cooperated fully with the  Commission and provided additional information to help to expose the infringement and its  fine was reduced by 50% under the leniency notice.

Car glass is used in the automotive industry and comes in various shapes and sizes, such as windscreens, sidelights (windows for front and back doors), backlights (rear windows) and sunroofs. The main customers of the car glass suppliers are car manufacturers who assemble the glass pieces into the cars they produce. Some of the car glass deliveries are stored for replacement as original branded spare parts.

TOKYO, Nov. 15 -- Selected editorial excerpts from the Japanese press:
CRACK DOWN ON CARTELS WITH HARSHER PENALTIES (The Daily Yomiuri as translated from the
Yomiuri Shimbun)

TD
Japanese, U.S. and  European Union antitrust watchdogs have recently meted out a flurry of penalties to companies.

Driving up prices of products through forming a  cartel is a malicious act that will eventually leave consumers out of pocket by forcing them to pay higher prices for products.

In Japan, it is essential for the Fair Trade Commission to do its utmost to crack down on cartels, while beefing up penalties, including raising fines the FTC imposes, to make companies think twice about violating the law.

The FTC this time plunged the scalpel into cartels allegedly formed by four major steel companies over the sale of galvanized steel plates. The FTC has filed criminal complaints with the public prosecutors against all but one company, which voluntary reported its involvement in the cartels, on suspicion of violating the Antimonopoly Law.

It has been pointed out that the steel industry still has a deep-rooted tendency to form cartels, as evidenced by its history of having received administrative punishments over cartels formed over the sale of stainless steel plates.

Meanwhile, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced Wednesday that it had imposed a fine of more than 1.3 billion  euro, or nearly 170 billion yen, on four European and Japanese car glass producers, including Asahi Glass Co., for price-fixing. Asahi Glass was fined about
14 billion yen.

The U.S. Justice Department has found wrongdoing in the activities of three liquid crystal display makers--Japan's Sharp Corp., a South Korean company and a Taiwanese company. The department on Wednesday imposed  fines totaling 585 million dollars (about 55 billion yen) on the three companies for conspiring to prevent the prices of LCD monitors used for personal computers from dropping. Sharp faces a fine of about 11.5 billion yen.

As the FTC and EC are also investigating cartels over the sales of LCD screens, it is possible that criminal or administrative  fines imposed on LCD makers will expand.

What is conspicuous in the recent spate of  cartel cases is the huge amounts of  fines imposed by the EU and U.S. authorities. The United States imposes a  fine of up to 80 percent of sales of the products found to have been sold at higher prices through cartels, while the EU imposes a  fine of up to 10 percent of each company's total sales.

In Japan, on the other hand, the upper limit of criminal  fines slapped on violators is 500 million yen. The upper limit of administrative  fines that the FTC can impose in addition to criminal  fines is 10

Page 114 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
percent of sales of the products transacted through cartels. Repeat offenders, however, would see their administrative  fines boosted by 50 percent.

A bill to revise the Antimonopoly Law that is under deliberation at the Diet would enable the FTC to impose a fine 50 percent higher on companies that have played a leading role in forming cartels. The statute of limitations for prosecuting violators would be extended from three years to five years.

Due to bitter rivalry between the ruling and opposition camps, deliberations on the legislation are not progressing. The bill needs to be passed through the Diet, but even if the revised law is enacted, Japan's punitive measures will remain far lighter than those of the United States and EU nations.

Wouldn't it be advisable for Japan to consider gradually raising criminal and administrative  fines with international standards in mind?

Antitrust watchdogs in other countries are adopting ever-harsher stances toward cartels and bid-rigging. Japanese companies must take to heart the fact that their very existence could be jeopardized unless they operate in compliance with law.

PRICE-FIXING CARTELS (IHT/Asahi as translated from the Japanese-language Asahi Shimbun's editorial published Nov. 14)

TD
Companies in the same industry that conspire to raise the prices of certain products or services leave purchasers with no choice but to pay unfairly high prices. Forming price-fixing cartels is a malicious economic crime prohibited by the Anti-Monopoly Law.

The past week saw a spate of antitrust actions both in Japan and abroad against price-fixing cartels involving domestic companies. The proliferation of cartels indicated by these moves is troubling.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that three companies--Sharp Corp. of Japan and South Korean and Taiwanese makers--had pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix the price of
liquid-crystal display panels used for products like personal computers and cellphones.

Also on Wednesday, the  European Commission fined four Japanese and European car glass producers, including Asahi Glass Co. and Pilkington Group Ltd. of Britain, a subsidiary of Nippon Sheet Glass Co., for their involvement in a price-fixing conspiracy. Asahi Glass and Pilkington were also  fined in November 2007 for fixing the price of flat glass used in the construction industry.

On Tuesday, the Fair Trade  Commission filed a criminal complaint against three domestic steel plate makers. It says they colluded to raise prices of zinc-alloy coated steel plates, used mainly for roofing on houses.
It was the first antitrust action against a price-fixing  cartel in Japan in 17 years.

Preventing such anti-competitive practices requires a powerful deterrence in the form of stiff penalties. That is the only way to convince companies that forming an illegal  cartel doesn't pay. From this point of view, the nation's penalties for cartels are still too light.

In the LCD panel case, Sharp and the two other makers agreed to pay a total of $585 million (about 56 billion yen) in criminal fines. The European Commission has also slapped hefty  fines on the four  car glass makers--a record 1.38 billion euros (about 170 billion yen) in total.

In Japan, companies accused of price-fixing can be punished with both criminal  fines (up to 500 million yen) and surcharges (10 percent of the sales linked to the cartels for large companies). Even the maximum combination of the two, however, is still much lower than the  fines typically imposed by U.S. or European antitrust regulators.

Borrowing from their way of doing things, the FTC has introduced a corporate leniency program that allows regulators to lessen penalties for companies that blow the whistle on their co-conspirators. This new system has proved effective, leading to a series of law-enforcement actions, including the one against the steel-plate  cartel.

The penalties and surcharges should be raised sharply to strengthen the effectiveness of anti-monopoly enforcement in this nation.

The world economy is likely to sink deeper into recession. Companies and industries facing financial difficulties could easily resort to anti-competitive practices like price-fixing out of desperation. International cooperation to prevent such antitrust violations is vital for stemming the current economic turmoil and restoring stability to the market-oriented economy.

The government has submitted to the Diet a revision to the Anti-Monopoly Law that would raise the surcharges for companies that have played leading roles in cartels and bid-rigging scams. The bill would also extend the statute of limitations in such cases.

The Diet should act swiftly to enact the legislation while considering steps to further stiffen punishments for antitrust offenses.

HD         EDITORIAL / Crack down on cartels with harsher penalties

Japanese, U.S. and  European Union antitrust watchdogs have recently meted out a flurry of penalties to companies.

Driving up prices of products through forming a  cartel is a malicious act that will eventually leave consumers out of pocket by forcing them to pay higher prices for products.

TD
In Japan, it is essential for the Fair Trade Commission to do its utmost to crack down on cartels, while beefing up penalties, including raising fines the FTC imposes, to make companies think twice about violating the law.

The FTC this time plunged the scalpel into cartels allegedly formed by four major steel companies over the sale of galvanized steel plates. The FTC has filed criminal complaints with the public prosecutors against all but one company, which voluntary reported its involvement in the cartels, on suspicion of violating the Antimonopoly Law.

It has been pointed out that the steel industry still has a deep-rooted tendency to form cartels, as evidenced by its history of having received administrative punishments over cartels formed over the sale of stainless steel plates.
===
U.S., EU take hard line

Meanwhile, the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced Wednesday that it had imposed a fine of more than 1.3 billion  euro, or nearly 170 billion yen, on four European and Japanese car glass producers, including Asahi Glass Co., for price-fixing. Asahi Glass was fined about
14 billion yen.

The U.S. Justice Department has found wrongdoing in the activities of three liquid crystal display makers--Japan's Sharp Corp., a South Korean company and a Taiwanese company. The department on Wednesday imposed  fines totaling 585 million dollars (about 55 billion yen) on the three companies for conspiring to prevent the prices of LCD monitors used for personal computers from dropping. Sharp faces a fine of about 11.5 billion yen.

As the FTC and EC are also investigating cartels over the sales of LCD screens, it is possible that criminal or administrative  fines imposed on LCD makers will expand.

What is conspicuous in the recent spate of  cartel cases is the huge amounts of  fines imposed by the EU and U.S. authorities. The United States imposes a  fine of up to 80 percent of sales of the products found to have been sold at higher prices through cartels, while the EU imposes a  fine of up to 10 percent of each company's total sales.

Firms need to realize risks

In Japan, on the other hand, the upper limit of criminal  fines slapped on violators is 500 million yen. The upper limit of administrative  fines that the FTC can impose in addition to criminal  fines is 10 percent of sales of the products transacted through cartels. Repeat offenders, however, would see their administrative  fines boosted by 50 percent.

A bill to revise the Antimonopoly Law that is under deliberation at the Diet would enable the FTC to impose a fine 50 percent higher on companies that have played a leading role in forming cartels. The statute of limitations for prosecuting violators would be extended from three years to five years.

Due to bitter rivalry between the ruling and opposition camps, deliberations on the legislation are not progressing. The bill needs to be passed through the Diet, but even if the revised law is enacted, Japan's punitive measures will remain far lighter than those of the United States and EU nations.

Wouldn't it be advisable for Japan to consider gradually raising criminal and administrative  fines with international standards in mind?

Antitrust watchdogs in other countries are adopting ever-harsher stances toward cartels and bid-rigging. Japanese companies must take to heart the fact that their very existence could be jeopardized unless they operate in compliance with law.

Economics

House prices: Homeowners will have to wait a decade before property prices return to 2007 levels, a leading estate agent said yesterday. Average house prices are tumbling at a rate of Pounds 78 a day and are set to fall in total by 16 per cent this year and 11 per cent by the end of 2009, according to a forecast from Savills, bringing the average value down from Pounds 182,080 in December 2007 to a low of Pounds 136,123. Page 68

TD
First-time buyers: Savills also said that it did not expect mortgage availability to relax for first-time buyers until at least 2010 - by which time, it predicts that house prices will be on their way back up, meaning new homeowners could miss out on the chance to secure a good price on their first home. Page 69

Debt levels: The deteriorating economy has contributed to a sharp rise in the number of people struggling with debt, according to official figures released yesterday. The Ministry of Justice reported there were 13,653 bankruptcy petitions in courts in England and Wales in the third quarter of 2008, 7 per cent increase on the same time last year. Page 72

US retail sales: American retail sales fell at their fastest rate for almost two decades last month providing new evidence that the world's biggest economy is weakening far faster than expected. While Wall Street had expected a decline in retail sales in October, the 2.8 per cent fall was far bigger than the 2.1 per cent economists had forecast. Page 75

G20 summit: Global central banks are ready to take further steps to ease market tensions and bolster faltering economic growth, top policymakers said yesterday, as world leaders gathered for talks on the economic crisis. Speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve Chairman, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the President of the  European Central Bank, said that close cooperation would continue and that central bankers had not exhausted all their policy options.

Eurozone recession: The eurozone has fallen into recession for the first time since the single currency was introduced in 1999, Eurostat,  European Union statistics agency, said that third-quarter GDP across the 15-nation eurozone shrank 0.2 per cent, following a 0.2 per cent fall in the previous quarter. A recession is defined as two quarters of negative growth.

US government loans: The White House has been in talks with Congress about finding a way to accelerate loans to carmakers under a $25 billion (Pounds 16.9 billion) programme already appropriated for the troubled industry, Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman said.
Banking & finance

Bradford & Bingley: Rod Kent, the chairman of the nationalised bank, stood down with three other non-executive directors. Richard Pym, the chief executive, steps up to be executive chairman, B & B said. The bank was shorn of its 200 branches and Pounds 24 billion of deposits when it was taken into state ownership in September. Page 64

Lehman Brothers: Around 1,500 of Lehman Brothers' creditors descended on Indigo, the music venue at the O2, to stake their claim on the stricken investment bank's $288 billion carcass. Row upon row of dark suits shuffled into the auditorium to listen to headline act Tony Lomas, the PricewaterhouseCoopers administrator. Page 67

RAB Capital: yesterday closed a dozen underperforming funds and gave warning that the effects of investor redemptions and sliding markets would leave it with just $2billion of assets by the end of the year. It started the year with $7.2 billion of funds under management, and began November with $2.8 billion. Page 71

New Star Asset Management: The embattled fund manager renegotiated its banking covenants yesterday in a move that added Pounds 3.5million to its debt bill and spurred speculation that it could be pushed into an emergency rights issue. New Star, led by John Duffield, its colourful chairman, also embarked on a Pounds 20 million-a- year cost-cutting programme that is likely cut up to 60 jobs. Page
71

HBOS: The chairman of HBOS gave warning that the bank may have to be completely nationalised if the merger with LloydsTSB falls through. In a letter to shareholders Lord Stevenson of Coddenham urged them to vote for the deal saying HBOS will need to raise more than Pounds 12 billion of additional capital if shareholders throw the merger out. Page 71

Freddie Mac: The mortgage giant, said its net worth was less than zero and asked for $13.8 billion from the US Treasury, after Fannie Mae posted a $29 billion loss for the same period and cautioned that it might need federal funds by the end of the year to survive. Page 75

Royal Bank of Scotland: is preparing to sack up to 3,000 staff across its worldwide workforce as it braces itself against the onslaught of the global recession. Up to 1,000 jobs are expected to be lost in the UK.

Citigroup: Citigroup is cutting at least 10,000 jobs in its investment bank and other divisions throughout the world, according to the Wall Street Journal. Citigroup announced in October it had cut 11,000 jobs in the third quarter.
Construction
& property

Saint-Gobain: The European Commission imposed its highest ever cartel penalty, fining four companies more than Euro 1.3 billion for illegally working together in Europe's Euro 2 billion auto        glass market. It  fined French building materials group Saint-GobainEuro 896 million - the biggest such EU penalty on an individual company - for running a  cartel with Asahi Glass, Pilkington and Soliver between 1998 and 2003.
Consumer goods

Wine sales: Sales of wine, for some time a supposed safe haven for investors, are finally feeling the full effect of the credit crunch, with the biggest fall in prices for seven years. Prices were down 12.4 per
cent in October, according to the Liv-ex 100  Fine Wine index. Page 73

InBev: The Stella Artois brewer moved closer to completing its proposed takeover of Anheuser-Busch, the Budweiser owner, after receiving the green light from the US Department of Justice subject to a loosening of its control of Labatt, its Canadian beer, in the United States. It will next week draw down a
$45 billion syndicated loan and a $9.8 billion bridging loan to fund the deal.
Engineering

GKN: GKN said is cutting production at twice the rate it announced just over two weeks ago. At the end of last month the engineering group said a fall-off in orders from carmakers meant that production in the second half would be 20per cent lower than in the first half. Yesterday, GKN, which supplies all the top carmakers, said that production would now be 40 per cent lower. Page 65

EADS: Shares in EADS gained 4.8per cent after the  European aerospace group's quarterly results beat expectations and the company raised its 2008 profit forecast. EADS also announced  Euro 200 million of cost savings for 2011 and 2012 on top of existing restructuring plans, and boasted a strong cash buffer against global financial turmoil.

Phytopharm: Shares in Phytopharm, a developer of drugs from plant extracts, plunged more than 43 per cent yesterday after Unilever, the consumer goods giant, pulled the plug on its lead diet product. Phytopharm had been conducting trials with Unilever on Hoodia, a weight-loss drug extracted from a South African plant that had traditionally been used by Kalahari bushmen to stave off hunger. They had hoped the extract could be used in Unilever's Slimfast range of products.

Vernalis appointed the former management team from Acambis to head the British biotechnology company, and the group's incoming chief executive promised significant changes.

Industrials

Dyson Group: Shares in Dyson Group plunged 40.6 per cent after the company, which develops high performance materials used primarily in the automotive industry, says that it expects to miss a full-year profit target due to falling sales volumes and could breach its banking covenants next year if the downturn worsens.
Leisure

Macau: Macau has become the latest - and probably glitziest - victim of the credit crunch. The dread sweeping through Macau and its once irrepressible investors is that the gambling town's woes do not begin and end with the financial problems of Sheldon Adelson, of Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Page

Media

Canwest Global Communications: The media group posted a C$1 billion (Pounds 550 million) quarterly loss as it wrote down the goodwill and broadcast licences related to its Canadian conventional
television business, sending its shares down 9 per cent.

Centaur Media: The trade magazine publisher reported a 16 per cent plunge in group revenues for the four months to the end of October, which also affected margins in the period. The company, which publishes titles such as Money Marketing, said that it would keep costs under review.
Natural resources

Norilsk Nickel: The Russian miner expects the financial crisis to continue sapping demand for its products this year but it will not get any worse in 2009, Anton Berlin, the company's head of market development, said. "First the speculative demand fell,speculators closed positions ... That is pushing the market down," he said.

Gazprom: Russia's gas export monopoly, said that it had no intention of buying a stake in Repsol, the Spanish oil company. Russian news agencies earlier this week quoted deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov as telling a Russian Spanish inter-governmental  commission in Madrid that Gazprom was considering buying the stake.
Retailing

Richemont: The luxury goods company behind Cartier jewellery and Mont Blanc pens conceded yesterday that the severity of the credit crunch had finally dawned on its customers.

Page 73

John Lewis: Sales at John Lewis, the department store, tumbled almost 10 per cent last week, despite earlier signs of a modest recovery in high street trading in the run-up to Christmas.

Logica reported revenue of Pounds 845 million versus Pounds 789 million for the same period a year ago, which was adjusted for acquisitions and disposals.
Technology
Sun Microsystems: which sells server computers, has started a broad restructuring that could see up to
6,000 employees lose their jobs. The US company disclosed that it would lay off 5,000 to 6,000
workers, or 15 per cent to 18 per cent of its work force. The company, already dealing with cuts
announced in May, expects to save $700 million to $800 million a year as a result, while also taking up
to $600 million in charges in the next 12 months.
Telecoms

Nokia: The world's largest mobile phone maker, issued its second profit warning in three months yesterday blaming a "sharp pull back" in global consumer spending over the past few weeks.It also predicted that global handset sales would fall in 2009 as the economic downturn picked up speed. Page
75
Transport

EasyJet: Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou last night launched an aggressive attempt to regain control of easyJet in a fresh clash with the management of the no frills airline he founded 13 years ago and whose shares have plunged. He has threatened to oust chairman Sir Colin Chandler and appoint himself to that role if the board does not accept two new directors appointed by him. Yesterday he disclosed he had raised his direct stake to 27 per cent. Page 64
Utilities

Energy demand: Britain's worsening recession is set to trigger a 7 per cent plunge in electricity demand next year, according to new research. With hundreds of factories expected to close in the months
ahead and consumers adopting an increasingly frugal approach towards their energy use, a new study to be published by energy consultancy Inenco next week will show that within 6-12 months, peak UK electricity demand could be 7 per cent lower than it was a year ago. Page 72

Price for Merrill appears steep

As capital markets crumble, John Thain's decision to sell Merrill Lynch to Bank of America looks more impressive by the day.

TD
One key figure, however, may have more mixed feelings about the deal -- BofA's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, who has to make money from Merrill in a terrible environment.

The deal was announced in mid-September, just as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Merrill's stock is down 29% since, compared with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which are down 66% and 55%, respectively. Without BofA, Merrill's shares would likely have slumped more, even with the government backing now on offer.

But a good deal for Merrill shareholders may have come at the expense of BofA investors. At the time of the deal, the bank stood to acquire Merrill for $45 billion, or 1.8 times tangible book value, a measure of net worth that strips out intangible assets. With Goldman and Morgan Stanley now trading at around 0.8 times and 0.4 times tangible book value, it looks like BofA overpaid.

Of course, the dollar value of the deal has fallen in line with BofA's shares. But assuming the transaction goes through, BofA's shareholders will be diluted by about 23%.

Merrill's two main businesses are its investment bank and its wealth-management division. It also owns half of money manager BlackRock. In the investment bank, write-downs could still be large. Merrill retains mortgage-related assets equivalent to 207% of tangible equity, versus 88% and 55% for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, according to Bernstein Research.

Merrill's wealth-management business is the most dependable source of earnings. But even that could disappoint. In 2001, when markets tanked, the business posted a roughly 40% drop in pretax
earnings.
Today, wealth management's earnings aren't so closely tied to market conditions, but a 25% drop from
2007's peak could leave the unit making about $1.8 billion after tax. Then BofA would need to subtract
the cost of servicing Merrill's preferred shares -- around $580 million.

Of course, a market recovery would boost earnings, and BofA is promising $7 billion of annual cost savings. But the bank has to meld two very different cultures and risks losing top earners if it goes too far.

Time for a tougher Japan

The latest round of  fines and criminal complaints against Japanese companies says it all: The light touch of Japan's good-governance types helps to perpetuate a corrosive corporate modus operandi.

Busted on three continents in as many alleged cases of price-fixing last week, the companies read like a Who's Who of Japan Inc.; they include Sharp, Nippon Sheet Glass, and a unit of Nippon Steel.

A widely accepted cost of doing business in Japan, it seems, amounts to paying moderate  fines, doing the ritual-bow-and-apology jig and dumping some fall guys. What can be done?

Tougher fines are an obvious step, as is consideration of jail time instead of the more usual suspended sentences.

For guidance on financial penalties, Japan's regulators might look to Europe and the U.S. Last week, the European Commission and the U.S. slapped fat fines on seven European and Asian companies, including three in Japan, allegedly involved in auto-glass or liquid-crystal-display cartels. The auto-glass-related fines totaled a substantial $1.7 billion; the LCD  fines came to nearly $600 million.

The fines came as Japan filed criminal complaints against three of its steel companies for alleged price fixing.

The European and U.S.  fines stand in contrast to Japan's practice of capping criminal penalties at $5 million per violator and an administrative  fine of as much as 10% of the revenue from a firm's
cartel-controlled sales.

=HEARD ON THE STREET: Missing Issing At The ECB By Matthew Curtin
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The European Central Bank is behind the curve. With the  euro zone economy officially in recession for the first time since the creation of the single currency, the central bank should be cutting rates faster as price pressures fall away.

TD
The ECB has misjudged how the credit crisis would strangle growth in the  euro zone and stunt it in emerging markets. That is removing nearly all of the upward pressure on prices that worried the central bank earlier in the year. In particular, the bank has misread how quickly Germany's export-led success, and the rising wage expectations that went with it, would reverse.

As recently as Sept. 10, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told the  European Parliament that the risks to inflation were on the upside. He cited the bank's economic forecasts for  euro-zone growth of more than 1% this year and around 1% next.

In this context, it's easier to understand why the ECB, having raised its basing lending rate in July, has since cut it by a relatively modest percentage point. The Bank of England has cut its key interest rate
3.75 percentage points and the Fed has cut by 3.25 percentage points. The ECB's rate is at 3.25%
compared with 3% at the BOE and 1% at the Fed.

The ECB's hawkishness partly stems from a reluctance to let  euro-zone governments off the hook by cutting rates. In the long run, economic reforms, notably of tax systems and labor markets, would do more to promote  euro-zone growth and make prices more responsive to changes in supply and demand.

But the central bank is now likely to make up for lost ground on the rate-setting front. Financial markets are pricing in further cuts to bring the ECB's key lending rate to 1.5% or even 1% in the months ahead which would bring real rates closer to zero. That still begs the question why the ECB hasn't moved faster, sooner.

The answer may lie in the lack of an authoritative figure like Otmar Issing, the former Bundesbank chief economist. In the mid-1990s, Issing convinced markets the German central bank could cut rates further than many were expecting to help prevent a slump without sacrificing the bank's inflation-fighting credentials. In contrast, the credit crisis and the recession are the first big tests on which the ECB will make its reputation.

Europe's Auto Industry

European governments look likely to cave in to auto-industry lobbying for state aid to support the sector through the recession. The key now is what conditions are attached. If they are too soft, there could be serious long-term economic damage from rewarding the industry's failures with taxpayers' cash.

It's easy for the automakers to play on government instincts to preserve jobs. There are around 1.6 million people working in the German and U.K. auto sectors alone, according to local industry bodies.

But auto sales in  Europe are slumping, down 15% in October compared with the previous year, and the recession is exposing just how bloated the industry is.

Two of Europe's leading car-makers, Renault and Peugeot-Citroen, are slashing production by 25% and 30%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, equivalent to approximately 370,000 vehicles. But the French duo already had excess annual capacity of 1.2 million cars in 2007, according to analysts at Automotive World. Across  Europe's auto makers, the figure was closer to 2.25 million.

Only massive job cuts can restore the sector even to the modest levels of profit many of the region's manufacturers enjoyed in 2007.  European car-makers and auto suppliers would have to shed 26% of their work force, Goldman Sachs estimates. That's politically unpalatable for politicians in Germany, France and the U.K.

But providing support for the auto sector to retain its current capacity is wrongheaded. In return for loan guarantees and tax breaks to keep up R&D in areas such as fuel efficiency, the governments need to extract commitments to take out capacity. In doing so, car-makers would retain key skills and gain flexibility, allowing output to match demand more closely when the economy revives. That would be sufficient payback for taxpayers' short-term help.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Dollar Enjoys Special Status

By Joanna Slater
A DOW JONES COLUMN
Nothing seems to rattle the dollar much these days, not even worsening economic news out of the U.S. The dollar's relative imperviousness to a string of bad economic surprises has much to do with its
unique role in global finance. Despite predictions that the dollar was done as the world's reserve
currency, it turns out to have a tenacious grip on that status.

That wasn't always easy to believe during the dollar's six-year swoon, which saw it tumble to an all-time low against the  euro and multidecade lows against currencies like the British pound and the Canadian dollar.

Part of the dollar rebound is due to the weakening of other economies. But as the crisis has deepened, investors, companies, and banks world-wide have raced to get their hands on dollars, either because they needed the U.S. currency to do business and pay back borrowing, or because they perceived the buck as a safe haven.

That demand threatened to destabilize the financial system, prompting the Federal Reserve to open swap lines with 14 central banks, including three in emerging markets, so that they could provide dollars directly to their local banks.

The European Central Bank also has enlarged its purview -- extending a lifeline to Hungary, which is outside the euro zone. And there have been calls for the  euro to play an expanded role.

But global central banks aren't clamoring for  euros. For now, in the words of hedge fund FX Concepts, "the world runs on dollars, just like a car runs on petrol." In the current crisis, there has so far been little demand for alternative fuels.




=HEARD ON THE STREET: Doubts Remain About Citi

By Peter Eavis
A DOW JONES COLUMN

Page 129 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Is the drop in Citigroup's share price a sign that investors are having doubts about the U.S. government's financial-system rescue?
All eyes are on how Citi, with its global reach and $2 trillion in assets, fares. Despite big moves by the
Bush administration -- including equity injections and a commitment to guarantee bank borrowings --
the bank's stock is down 49% since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in mid-September, compared with
a 29% decline for the KBW Banks Index.

One reason for the slide may be that investors simply felt Citi's shares deserved a lower valuation. After the drop, they trade at 1.4 times tangible book value, more or less in line with Bank of America's multiple. And BofA's shares also have halved since Lehman's collapse.

But while BofA faces big challenges, including dealing with acquisitions it has made during the crisis, Citi's seem greater at this point. It has higher leverage and more at-risk assets. While Citi's chief executive, Vikram Pandit, has started a big restructuring, he still has a lot of work to do.

The course of Citi's restructuring could shed light on how the government's policies are working. The authorities appear to be betting that the banking sector is mostly solvent and needs help to see it through a period of low confidence. But that aid could become counterproductive if Citi actually slows restructuring. And Mr. Pandit's critics contend he could move faster.

One measure of confidence for large banks is whether they can comfortably refinance their borrowings. In the face of a global deleveraging wave, even government guarantees of debt mightn't be enough to generate sufficient interest.

The last big bond offering Citi did was in August, when it sold $3 billion of five-year notes. That was before the Lehman blow-up. Meanwhile, Citi's credit default swap spread, while well down from last month's spike, still is higher than it was just before Lehman cratered.
The market isn't yet convinced this Citi can be rebuilt.




=Heard On The Street: Housing Needs Reality Test

By David Reilly
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The bailout line keeps getting longer. First came the banks, then insurers led by American International Group and even card companies such as American Express. Now car makers hope for a turn. Joe the plumber probably isn't far behind.
The pressing question for the Obama administration: Where should it end?

Investors who fear a deflationary spiral don't see a need for restraint. Others argue government needs to let the bankruptcy process expunge excess capacity formed by the credit bubble.

The new administration needs to decide whether it uses bankruptcy or tries to avoid it. But whichever route it takes, it must include a method for taking capacity out of the system.

Even if a company is deemed too big to fail, and bankruptcy must be avoided, the administration needs to do more than pump in money to maintain the status quo.
An equally big challenge for the new administration will be to present markets with a coherent strategy
-- and stick with it. The Obama team needs to make clear how it will decide which companies pose
systemic risks.

Markets have tired of the current game of whack-a-mole -- highlighted by last week's market plunge when Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson reversed his position on the use of funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

The crisis has, of course, been unpredictable, so lines have shifted. Yet markets haven't been sure of the principles guiding the government. Instead they have received conflicting signals -- Bear Stearns was rescued, Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail and AIG was bailed out twice.
A clear plan would give some comfort, especially to debt markets.

As for the administration's plan, reflation by itself will only go so far in healing the economy's ills, given oversupply in areas ranging from autos to consumer credit to housing. [ 17-11-08 1712GMT ]
"People are looking for some costless way to make everything right, but I don't think there is one," said
Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust.

If the government fails to address oversupply, the result could be zombie companies -- or even a zombie economy along the lines of Japan during the 1990s.

Housing is one example. There is currently more than 10 months of home inventory. Homeowner vacancy rates are at historic highs of about 2.8%, compared with pre-bubble levels of about 1.7%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Yet still they build. Data due out this week are expected to show that housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 in October, according to Credit Suisse.

Housing construction levels are back where they were in the early 1980s. But it still begs the question: Why?

Clearly there is always going to be some activity in certain parts of the country. And projects take time to work through the system. But Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg suggests, only half-jokingly, that the Treasury should impose a moratorium on home building. "It sounds like lunacy, but we have to destroy the housing capital stock to help put a floor under the market," he said.

The same holds true for other parts of the economy. Government should cushion the blow as the economic adjustment takes place, or it risks a negative spiral taking hold. But any bailout strategy has to recognize that, painful as it is for jobs, capacity must come out of the system.
Overheard

As if proof were needed of the toxic effects of Leon Black's face-off with Jon Huntsman, along come Hexion Specialty Chemicals' third-quarter results. The Apollo Management-controlled company is embroiled in a legal battle with Huntsman Corp. and two banks after agreeing to buy the chemicals firm and then trying to back out of the deal.

In the first nine months of 2008, Hexion spent $227 million on "pending merger costs," most of which relate to Huntsman. A huge number in itself, it really hits home when you consider Hexion had a net loss of $269 million.

General Motors just announced a landmark deal -- and not in Washington. In St. Louis, it offloaded a used Chevrolet Suburban in its latest "remarketed vehicle" auction. That Chevy's particular significance: It was the 13 millionth sale. As if GM needs bad luck like that.

Nokia Paints Bleak Picture

By Molly Neal
A DOW JONES COLUMN
Nokia's latest profit warning is a red flag to investors in the telecommunications sector and far beyond. Confirmation of weak consumer spending was no surprise. More alarming was Nokia's suggestion that
the credit crunch has limited the ability of retailers to build up handset inventories.

That's bad news for the industry as a whole and more evidence of the far-reaching impact of the financial crisis on the broader economy and global trade. While massive injections of liquidity into the banking system have saved it from collapse, until that liquidity filters down to individual businesses, the global economy is in dire straits.

There will be knock-on effects from Nokia to its own suppliers, such as semiconductor companies. The slowdown in handset sales also bodes ill for smaller handset rivals with weaker finances, some of which, like Sony Ericsson, were struggling to sell enough phones even before the credit squeeze intensified in September.

But more broadly, with financial-sector companies trying to repair balance sheets, credit is seriously tight. Any evidence of businesses struggling to finance new inventories paints a bleak picture. With consumers and regular businesses also starting to fixate on their balance sheets, and curb spending, there is a risk the downward cycle in the economy will start feeding off itself.

Clearly there is always going to be some activity in certain parts of the country. And projects take time to work through the system. But Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg suggests, only half-jokingly, that the Treasury should impose a moratorium on home building. "It sounds like lunacy, but we have to destroy the housing capital stock to help put a floor under the market," he said.

The same holds true for other parts of the economy. Government should cushion the blow as the economic adjustment takes place, or it risks a negative spiral taking hold. But any bailout strategy has to recognize that, painful as it is for jobs, capacity must come out of the system.

As if proof were needed of the toxic effects of Leon Black's face-off with Jon Huntsman, along come Hexion Specialty Chemicals' third-quarter results. The Apollo Management-controlled company is embroiled in a legal battle with Huntsman Corp. and two banks after agreeing to buy the chemicals firm and then trying to back out of the deal.

In the first nine months of 2008, Hexion spent $227 million on "pending merger costs," most of which relate to Huntsman. A huge number in itself, it really hits home when you consider Hexion had a net loss of $269 million.

=HEARD ON THE STREET: Time For A Tougher Japan

By James Sims
A DOW JONES COLUMN

The latest round of  fines and criminal complaints against Japanese companies says it all: The light touch of Japan's good-governance types helps to perpetuate a corrosive corporate modus operandi.

Busted on three continents in as many alleged cases of price-fixing last week, the companies read like a Who's Who of Japan Inc.; they include Sharp, Nippon Sheet Glass, and a unit of Nippon Steel.

A widely accepted cost of doing business in Japan, it seems, amounts to paying moderate  fines, doing the ritual-bow-and-apology jig and dumping some fall guys. What can be done?

Tougher fines are an obvious step, as is consideration of jail time instead of the more usual suspended sentences.

For guidance on financial penalties, Japan's regulators might look to Europe and the U.S. Last week, the European Commission and the U.S. slapped fat fines on seven European and Asian companies, including three in Japan, allegedly involved in auto-glass or liquid-crystal-display cartels. The
auto-glass-related fines totaled a substantial $1.7 billion; the LCD  fines came to nearly $600 million.

The fines came as Japan filed criminal complaints against three of its steel companies for alleged price fixing.

The European and U.S.  fines stand in contrast to Japan's practice of capping criminal penalties at $5 million per violator and an administrative  fine of as much as 10% of the revenue from a firm's
cartel-controlled sales.




=HEARD ON THE STREET:
Nokia Paints Bleak Picture

By Molly Neal
A DOW JONES COLUMN
Nokia's latest profit warning is a red flag to investors in the telecommunications sector and far beyond. Confirmation of weak consumer spending was no surprise. More alarming was Nokia's suggestion that
the credit crunch has limited the ability of retailers to build up handset inventories.

That's bad news for the industry as a whole and more evidence of the far-reaching impact of the financial crisis on the broader economy and global trade. While massive injections of liquidity into the banking system have saved it from collapse, until that liquidity filters down to individual businesses, the global economy is in dire straits.

There will be knock-on effects from Nokia to its own suppliers, such as semiconductor companies. The slowdown in handset sales also bodes ill for smaller handset rivals with weaker finances, some of which, like Sony Ericsson, were struggling to sell enough phones even before the credit squeeze intensified in September.

But more broadly, with financial-sector companies trying to repair balance sheets, credit is seriously tight. Any evidence of businesses struggling to finance new inventories paints a bleak picture. With consumers and regular businesses also starting to fixate on their balance sheets, and curb spending, there is a risk the downward cycle in the economy will start feeding off itself.

HD        European cement cartel probe could lead to £4 billion in fines

NEWS - Five major manufacturers under investigation as  European Commission raids offices across the continent
Five major concrete firms face a total  fine of up to £4 billion if they are found guilty of forming an illegal
cartel.

TD
Earlier this month,  European Commission officials raided UK and  European offices of Holcim, Cemex, Lafarge, and Heidelberg – as well as Dyckerhoff in Germany – on suspicion of illegal  cartel activity.

If the firms are found guilty, they could be  fined up to 10 per cent of their combined worldwide turnover, about £4 billion.
Three of the five firms being investigated – Dyckerhoff, Heidelberg, and Lafarge – have been  fined
previously.
In 1994, the  European Commission fined cement companies – including Lafarge – for operating a
cartel, dividing up cement markets and sharing information.
German authorities also  fined cement companies €660 million in 2003 for  cartel activity, while the EU
finedLafarge €250 million in 2002 for its part in a plasterboard  cartel.

Cartel law specialist John Cassels, of Field Fisher Waterhouse (see panel), said that, if found guilty, the companies could be hit with  fines at least as large as those imposed last week on  car glass manufacturers – a total of £1.2 b illion .

Mr Cassels said: "If the current raids result in finding that there has been a cartel, Dyckerhoff, Heidelberg, and Lafarge will be repeat offenders and could face very significant fines, easily as big as the car glass fines.

"Fines could run as high as 10 per cent of group turnover." He added : "Those that buy ce - ment from companies that are found to have been engaged in a  cartel are also likely to bring actions for damages to recoup losses.

"Directors of companies found to be involved in cartels can be sent to prison. In a recent case, three directors were prosecuted by the Office of Fair Trading and sentenced to three years each in prison." With the cement industry already under pressure due to the economic downturn, the  fines could put some companies close to bankruptcy.

But Mr Cassels said: "It has never been found to be a good defence to say a  fine will make a company bankrupt.
"It is much better to co-operate. If so leniency will be shown and  fines reduced."

The European Commission runs a leniency programme whereby the first member of a  cartel that comes forward with relevant information can gain total immunity from  fines.

Mr Cassels said: "Whistle-blowers can get complete immunity from prosecution because it's hard enough to discover cartels. Companies that come forward with information can get a significant reduction in their  fine." The  European Commission said: "We have reason to be lieve that the companies concerned may have violated EC Treaty antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position." All of the firms involved told Construction News they were co-operating fully with the  Commission's investigation.
There are currently two other investigations of construction industry cartels being carried out by the
Office of Fair Trading in the UK.

In April this year, the OFT formally alleged 112 construction firms were engaged in bid rigging having probed thousands of tenders for construction work covering schools, hospitals and private sector developments. In total, £3 billion worth of tenders were affected.

Last month, the OFT launched an investigation into eight recruitment firms following allegations regarding fixing the rates of workers supplied to construction sites in the UK.

HD           Saint-Gobain CFO Sees Single-Digit Earnings  Drop In '08

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French construction materials group Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA (12500.FR) sees a single-digit drop in earnings for the full year of 2008, Chief Financial Officer Benoit Bazin Saturday told a shareholders' meeting.

In October, Saint-Gobain cut its forecasts for 2008 to "slightly below the targets announced at the end of July." At the end of July, Saint-Gobain had said it was "expecting operating income at constant exchange rates and recurring net income close to the high 2007 levels."

TD
The decrease in 2008 will "stay within a single-digit drop, between -5% and -10%," Bazin said, adding
2009 would also see a drop compared with 2008 due to the toughening of market conditions.

"The group's fundamentals remain solid," Bazin said, despite the ongoing slowdown in residential markets in Europe.
Bazin also said Saint-Gobain still hasn't received a notification of a EUR896 million  fine for an
auto-glass cartel from the European Commission.

The fine is "much higher" than expected and than the EUR560 million provisioned at the end of 2007, Bazin said, adding Saint-Gobain will provision another amount at the end of 2008, without providing a figure.
He also reiterated that Saint-Gobain will appeal the decision.

Bazin also said that Saint-Gobain still plans to sell its packaging unit but will wait for better market conditions.

HD           Toyota’s  tiny iQ wins award
WC          981 words

A flood of new models is on the way from Toyota in 2009.

One of the most interesting will be the iQ, a highly innovative small car. It is under three metres in length, yet can seat three adults and a child. Power comes from the company’s 1.0 litre engine, now developing 68bhpor the 1.4 litre 90bhp D-4D diesel. A brand new 1.33 litre petrol engine will come later next year.

TD
The car is very nimble in heavy traffic and extraordinarily easy to park, with a turning circle of just 3.9 metres (the average car takes between ten and 11 metres). The car is also very at home on the motorway, easily keeping up to the 130km/h Italian speed limit – and that with the 1.0 litre engine. The car will go on sale here in January, at an expected price of around &euro;14,000.

The iQ has just been voted Japanese Car of the Year, winning by a cricket score of 526 points from the Citroen C5, which got 223 points. The other main scorers were the Nissan GT-R with 201 points; Audi A4, 180 points; and Jaguar XF with 115 points.

Opel’s bailout? It seems likely that Germany is willing to back Opel, should General Motors, its American parent, run out of money. Already, the state parliament of Hesse, where Opel has its main manufacturing plant, has passed a unanimous vote to underwrite a guarantee which could go to
&euro;500 million.

The federal government is considering a similar measure but wants an assurance that any money it provides will stay in Germany and not go towards propping up GM in the USA. Opel is understood to have given this undertaking. It is also apparent that Brussels will back such moves, as Industry Commissioner Gunter Verheugen has said that he would welcome the assistance.

Insignia’s award Opel got a welcome boost last Monday, when the Insignia won the crown of European Car of the Year 2009. It was an extremely close run thing, as the Opel won by just one single vote from the Ford Fiesta, 321 points against 320.

Third spot went to the Volkswagen Golf IV, which scored 223 points. The other finalists were the Citroen C5, 198 points; Alfa Romeo MiTo 148; Skoda Superb 144 and last place went to the new Renault Megane, with 121 points.

US carmakers sell shares As America’s two leading car manufacturers struggle to survive, they have sold shareholdings held in Japanese companies. Ford is reducing its shareholding in Mazda from 33.4 per cent to just over 13 per cent.

However, Ford remains Mazda’s single largest shareholder and cooperation between the two companies will continue, as it has since 1979. Mazda is directly acquiring 6.87 per cent of the shares, while the remainder is being bought up by 20 business partners.

General Motors, meanwhile, has sold its remaining 3.2 per cent shareholding in Suzuki, thereby raising &euro;180 million. Technical cooperation between the two companies will continue. Up until March 2006, GM held more than 20 per cent of the Japanese company. It has also sold its shares in Isuzu and Subaru.

Windscreen cartel fined The European Commission has imposed record fines of &euro;1.38 billion on four glassmakers for operating a cartel fixing the price of windscreens and other car glass.
Saint-Gobain of France was  fined &euro;896 million, Pilkington of Britain &euro;370 million, Asahi of Japan &euro;113.5 million and Soliver of Belgium &euro;4.3 million. Saint Gobain is to appeal its  fine to the European court in Luxembourg.

Cute new ‘boxy’ cars en route We are going to see a growing number of cute, new boxy cars on the market during 2009. Already, the Kia Soul and Toyota Urban Cruiser are on the way. A few days ago, Nissan announced that it is to sell its up to now Japan-only Cube in the USA – and in  Europe from next autumn.

For Europe, the car will use the well known 1.5 litre diesel engine, as well as a petrol unit of the same capacity. Just 3.89m long, the Cube has an unusual four wheel drive system called e.AWD, where an electric motor provides power to the rear wheels, the front ones being driven by the engine. The latest (third) generation of the Cube went on show earlier this week at the Los Angeles Motor Show.

Boxster and Cayman at LA Also on view at Los Angeles are the latest versions of the Porsche Boxster and Cayman models. The external changes are slight, confined to lights, bumpers, wheels and the
like. Main improvements are to the engines, where the 3.4 litre flat six engine has direct petrol injection.
The entry level 2.9 litre unit now develops 255bhp in the Boxster and 10bhpmore in the Cayman. In ‘S’
versions, the 3.4 litre engine now has 310bhpand 320bhp. As an option, the cars may be equipped
with a seven speed DSG-type double clutch gearbox, which the company claims gives faster
acceleration and improved economy compared to the six speed manual transmission.

Two-wheel drive VW Tiguan Volkswagen has released a two wheel drive version of the Tiguan in mainland Europe, facing up to similar versions of the Ford Kuga and others. Initially, it is being sold with the 140bhp version of the 2.0 litre TDi engine. Getting rid of the 4Motion driven system reduces fuel consumption to a claimed 6.2l/100km. The CO2 figure drops from 182g/ km to 164g/km.

Car of the Year The winner of the Semperit Irish Car of the Year is the Citroen C5. Full details in next week’s edition.

In the waning months of the current administration, the U.S. Department of Justice has announced a wide variety of enforcement actions including: bringing a lawsuit to challenge the combination of two of the four largest domestic beef packers; requiring a divestiture in a foreign beer brewer's acquisition of
the largest U.S. brewer; imposing one of the largest  fines on this side of the Atlantic for a  price-fixing   cartel; and mounting an investigation that led to the abandonment of Yahoo! and Google's plans to collaborate in the sale of Internet search advertising.

Other recent antitrust developments of note included a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that members of a standard-setting organization did not unlawfully conspire to exclude another member's technology from the industry standard.

TD
Acquisitions

The Department of Justice and the attorneys general of more than 10 states filed a civil complaint seeking to enjoin the proposed combination of the third- and fourth-largest U.S. beef packers. Beef packers buy fed cattle from feedlots, slaughter and process the cattle and then package cuts of beef for sale to wholesalers and grocery store chains.

The department asserted that, if not blocked, the transaction would place more than 80 percent of domestic fed cattle capacity in the hands of three firms and eliminate a competitively significant market participant. The department alleged that the acquisition would lessen competition among beef packers in the sale of boxed beef. The department also stated that the combination would reduce competition among packers for the purchase of fed cattle from feedlots.

According to the complaint, when the meat-packing industry reduces production levels, cattle producers are paid less and customers pay more for beef because the supply of cattle and demand for beef are relatively insensitive to price changes, thereby increasing the packers' margins. The department also asserted that the transaction would increase the incentive and ability of major packers to engage in coordinated output and pricing decisions.
United States v. JBS SA, No. 08-cv-5992 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 20, 2008), CCH Trade Reg. Rep. ¶45,108 (No.

Comment: The enforcement action reported immediately above examines the competitive impact of the proposed transaction on sellers to the merging firms as well as consumers of these firms' products.

The Department of Justice announced the settlement of its challenge to the proposed acquisition of the leading U.S. brewer, Anheuser-Busch Cos., by the second-largest brewer in the world, Belgium-based InBev NV/SA. The department alleged that the transaction would have lessened competition substantially, in violation of §7 of the Clayton Act, in the market for beer in parts of upstate New York and required the divestiture of Labatt brand beer, which is brewed and sold by InBev's Buffalo-based subsidiary.

Page 143 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The department stated that although InBev (with its leading brands Labatt, Stella Artois, Bass and Beck's) had a small share of U.S. beer sales nationwide, the transaction would have combined two of the three major beer manufacturers and eliminated significant head-to-head competition in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse metropolitan areas. The department alleged that in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, Labatt had 13 to 21 percent of beer sales and that, with Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser, the combined firm would have accounted for 41 to 45 percent of those local beer markets. Other than the recently combined MillerCoors, with 26 to 28 percent, no other brewer had over 5 percent of those markets.

The department stated that beer is a separate relevant product market and that the price of wine or other alcoholic beverages does not significantly influence or constrain the price of beer. The Justice Department determined that the relevant geographic markets are relatively narrow because exclusive beer distribution territories, which are common throughout the United States, lead to localized pricing and competitive strategies. The department also noted that entry of a significant new entry to the region was unlikely because of the importance of brand acceptance in the beer market.

The Department of Justice announced the closing of its investigation into the proposed merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, the third- and fifth-largest airlines in the United States. The department stated that on most city-pair routes where the airlines compete with each other, they also compete with other airlines. The department added that consumers are likely to benefit from improved service due to the combination of the airlines' complementary networks and that the merger will likely produce substantial and credible efficiencies, including cost savings in airport operations and fleet optimization.

The European Commission (EC) had approved the proposed combination in August, noting that the airlines' transatlantic passenger routes are mostly complementary because each has major hubs in different U.S. cities. The EC observed that the airlines already cooperate with one another on transatlantic routes as members of the Sky Team alliance, which also includes Air France, KLM and Alitalia.

Joint Ventures

The Department of Justice announced that, after the department gave notice of its plans to bring an action to challenge Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc.'s Internet advertisement agreement, the search engine companies abandoned their proposed collaboration.

Internet search engines generate revenue by selling advertisements that are relevant to the consumer's query and are usually displayed above and to the right of the list of results of a given query. These search engine and search advertising services are also offered to third-party syndication partners, such as newspapers' Web sites.

According to the Department of Justice, the agreement would have given Yahoo! the option to place Google-sold ads on Yahoo!'s search result pages instead of ads sold through its own competing search advertising platform. After determining that Internet search advertising and Internet search syndication constitute separate relevant product markets, the department found that Yahoo! was Google's most significant competitor in these two markets and that the firms' combined shares of these markets were
90 percent and 95 percent, respectively. The department asserted that the proposed collaboration would have reduced competition in these markets by diminishing the important competitive rivalry between the firms and reducing Yahoo!'s incentives to invest in certain areas of its search advertising business.

A district court granted a motion to dismiss claims that music companies used two joint ventures to facilitate collusion by imposing uniform prices for downloadable digital music and unpopular restrictions on the use of such digital music files in order to buoy the prices of compact discs. The court discounted as conclusory and implausible allegations that the ventures were shams, as they were formed to address widespread music piracy, and stated that the plaintiffs did not challenge the legality of the joint ventures themselves. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that an illegal agreement should be inferred from the defendants' adoption of parallel price and use restrictions after forming and participating in the ventures.

The Department of Justice announced that three Asian-based electronics manufacturers agreed to plead guilty and pay substantial criminal  fines for participating in conspiracies to fix prices of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, used in computer monitors, televisions and other electronic devices. The department asserted that two of the firms participated in meetings with other coconspirators where they agreed to charge certain prices for standard-size LCD panels. The third firm was alleged to have
entered into three bilateral agreements directed at fixing LCD prices sold to three leading U.S. consumer electronics and computer manufacturers. The assistant attorney general for antitrust stated that prosecuting international cartels is the antitrust division's highest priority because they cause the
greatest harm to consumers.

Standard-Setting Agencies

A developer of wireless communications technology for cellular networks claimed that members of a cellular telecommunications standard-setting organization conspired to remove the complaining developer's technology from the organization's standard in violation of §1 of the Sherman Act.

A district court granted summary judgment for the defendants and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. Relying on the Supreme Court's 1986 Matsushita decision, the appellate court stated that the plaintiff failed to present evidence supporting the inference of a conspiracy and excluding the possibility of independent parallel conduct, and therefore did not establish the "contract, combination, or conspiracy" required by

The court noted that e-mails showed that the defendants disliked the plaintiff's technology for different reasons and wanted to remove it from the standard at different times. The panel observed that informal communications between rivals is an important part of the process of developing procompetitive standards that promote compatibility and increase economic efficiency.
The court also added that "common dislike is not the same as an explicit understanding to conspire." Golden Bridge Technology Inc. v. Motorola Inc., No. 07-40954, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 22063 (Oct. 23,

HD      Recent Developments In Cartel Prosecutions

The investigation and prosecution of domestic and international cartels continues to be a top priority for antitrust authorities worldwide, including in Canada. The past month has seen a number of significant developments in this area, including guilty pleas in Canada and the United States and the imposition of record administrative  fines (over €1 billion) in the  European Union. A brief overview of these developments is provided below.
Canada

TD
The Canadian Competition Bureau's pursuit of alleged price fixing affecting retail gasoline markets in Quebec continues. Charges were laid in June 2008 against 13 individuals and 11 companies accused of fixing gasoline prices in Victoriaville, Thetford Mines, Magog and Sherbrooke, Quebec. While many defendants have indicated their intent to vigorously contest the charges, certain individuals and companies have pleaded guilty and agreed to pay  fines exceeding $2 million in total. Most recently, one of the individual defendants pleaded guilty on October 31, 2008 and agreed to be sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment to be served in the community.

The Bureau relied on a number of different investigative tools in connection with its investigation, including search warrants and wiretaps. Surprise search and seizures (or "dawn raids", as they are commonly referred to in  Europe) are used frequently by the Bureau when investigating cartels, and being prepared to deal with such an event should be an important part of any company's competition
compliance program. For guidance on how to respond to search and seizures in Canada, please see our firm's publication, "Are You Prepared for a Search?".

While the Quebec gasoline proceedings involve allegations of a purely domestic  cartel, other recent developments may impact the Bureau's approach to the prosecution of international cartels. For instance, in July of this year, the Bureau announced that two individuals had been extradited to the United States
for their role in a deceptive telemarketing scheme involving American consumers and had been found guilty and sentenced to a combined 42 years in prison by the U.S. Federal Court in the Southern District of Illinois. This is the first time that a Competition Bureau investigation has resulted in an extradition from Canada to a foreign jurisdiction. Given that the United States has sought the extradition of foreign nationals in international conspiracy cases, it is quite possible that the authorities in Canada could be asked to extend this precedent to extradite Canadian nationals who are allegedly involved in international cartels that impact U.S. commerce.
Lastly, on November 21, 2008, the Competition Bureau announced that Akzo Nobel Chemicals
International BV pleaded guilty to criminal charges for its role in an international  cartel between October
1, 1998 and June 30, 2001 to fix the price of hydrogen peroxide sold in Canada. Akzo agreed to pay a
fine of CDN$3.15 million (or approximately 15% of the affected volume of commerce). This case is yet
another example of an international  cartel investigation where the Bureau benefited from the
co-operation of an immunity applicant. The Bureau's investigation of this international conspiracy
continues and more  fines or charges may be forthcoming. In 2006, the  European Commission fined
seven firms (including Akzo Nobel) a total of €388 million for their involvement in price-fixing related to
sales of hydrogen peroxide between 1994 and 2000 in the European Economic Area. The European     
Commission's 2006 investigation also benefited from the co-operation of an immunity applicant.

Europe

On November 12, 2008, the  European Commission announced that it had imposed administrative  fines of over €1.3 billion on the participants in a conspiracy to allocate markets/customers, and exchange confidential information relating to the sales of car glass in the European Economic Area. These  fines were the highest ever imposed by the Commission, both for an individual company (€896 million for
Saint Gobain) as well as for a  cartel as a whole. According to the  European Commissioner for Competition, the record  fine was warranted because of the large size of the market (the annual turnover in the relevant market was €2 billion in the last year of the conspiracy), the seriousness of the case and the repeat nature of the offence (Saint Gobain was a repeat offender). The four companies can now appeal their fines at the European Court of First Instance.

In another development this month, the  European Commission confirmed that it had carried out unannounced inspections or "dawn raids" at the premises of several cement companies operating in the European Union. According to the  Commission, the companies are suspected of having violated Articles
81 and 82 of the EC Treaty (provisions dealing with cartels and abuse of dominant position).  European press sources report that the companies searched include Lafarge, Holcim, Cemex, Heidelberg Cement and Dyckerhoff.
United States

Also on November 12, 2008, three leading electronics manufacturers – LG Display Co. Ltd, Sharp Corp. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. - agreed to plead guilty and pay a total of US$585 million in criminal fines in the United States for their roles in fixing prices in the sale of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels. LG alone was ordered to pay US$400 million, which is the second highest criminal  fine ever obtained by the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Also noteworthy is the fact that Chungwa is the first Taiwanese company to plead guilty to a price fixing offence in the United States.

The LCD investigation, which remains ongoing, has involved co-ordination between enforcement officials in the U.S., Canada, the E.U. and Asia. This is by now a regular feature of international  cartel investigations. The Competition Bureau, for example, holds bi-monthly bilateral meetings with its U.S., E.U. and Japanese counterparts to co-ordinate investigative steps and timing.
Conclusion

Antitrust authorities continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute  cartel activity, a trend which shows no signs of abating. The developments described above speak to the seriousness with which antitrust authorities regard cartels and the risks companies and individuals face in engaging in such conduct.

HD          Cartel behaviour sours SA milk market
BY          Melanie Peters

Competition commissions around the world are increasing penalties to stamp out cartels and eight of
South Africa’s milk companies face a possible massive  fine next year.

An investigation into a milk  cartel in South Africa has been dragging on for years and the Competition Commission has accused Clover Industries, Clover SA, Parmalat, Ladismith Cheese, Woodlands Dairy, Lancewood, Nestle SA and Milkwood Dairy of delaying tactics so they can skim the cream off the top through price fixing.

TD
In an interview with the Weekend Argus last week, Competition Commissioner Shan Ramburuth said anti-competitive behaviour must be “very profitable” as milk companies had spent a fortune on expensive lawyers and other experts to get continued postponements to tribunal hearings.

He said he believed consumers were being “cheated out of competitive prices” for a basic food group while the companies continued to profit.

Heather Irvine, director of Deneys Reitz, one of South Africa’s largest independent commercial law firms, said this month the European Commission imposed the highest  fine ever by any competition authority on four car-glass  manufacturers – n1.3 billion (over R23 billion).
And the US Department of Justice imposed its second-highest criminal  fine ever, $585 million (nearly
R6bn), on a company involved in fixing the price of liquid crystal display panels.

She said: “These cases reinforce (perceptions) that global competition authorities continue to regard price- fixing, market division and collusive tendering as the most egregious contraventions of competition law.

“Fines imposed for cartel conduct have risen steadily in the last few years, and will probably continue to rise until they start deterring companies from colluding with their competitors.

“On the other hand, as the global financial crisis worsens, companies may increasingly be able to argue that fines should be reduced because they cannot pay them.

“Consumers would ultimately suffer if competitors are forced to cut down on investments in new technology, research and development, or even to exit the market, because they have to pay  fines amounting to several years of profits.”

She said the recent cases also demonstrated that the ability of global competition authorities to detect and prosecute cartels operating in a number of different jurisdictions has greatly improved.

The eight South African milk companies have been accused of contravening the Competition Act by fixing prices of raw and retail milk.


Page 150 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last month the Competition Appeal Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal by these companies to avoid a price-fixing hearing.

According to the  commission, these companies have been co-ordinating their strategies to fix the purchase price of raw milk. Some have agreed rather to sell surplus milk to one another than to consumers at lower prices, abused their dominant positions to force milk producers to sell them all their raw milk, kept smaller producers out of the market and have colluded on the selling price of “long life” milk.

The investigation started in 2005 and was brought to the tribunal in December 2006. The Competition Commission recommended that the dairy industry be  fined R100m two years ago after it found that big industry players were guilty of conspiring to set prices.

Then last February the tribunal set a date for September this year for the hearing but a series of technical appeals has delayed matters. The case will now go to the tribunal sometime in the next six months.

Recently Judge Dennis Davis, the judge president of the Competition Appeal Court, warned the competition law system was in danger of being brought into disrepute if cases were constantly postponed.

The chairman of the National Consumer Forum Thami Bolani said companies which overcharged and fixed prices on staple foods like bread and milk were robbing the poor of this country, especially the children. Consumer foods maker Tiger Brands was  fined R99m for admitting a role in fixing the price of bread in the Western Cape.

“Harsher action needs to be taken. Our competition laws needed to be tougher, like in those in Canada and Australia where  cartel bosses are sentenced to jail.
“They do not only receive financial penalties, they get a jail sentence too.

“These measures would stop price- fixing practices once and for all. In this country, where cartels receive a fine of R100m, they simply increase the price of the product and the consumer bears the brunt of the penalty.”
Recently Cosatu’s Western Cape secretary Tony Ehrenreich spoke out against price-fixing cartels. “The collusion around the prices of milk, bread and chicken contributed directly to high food prices and
starvation in communities; price- fixing around bank charges, cellphone rates and steel prices that led
to higher prices and bigger profits than elsewhere in the world for South African companies.”

He said import parity prices charged by Sasol allow it to charge the same price for petrol as petrol produced from oil, even though its costs were 50% lower because Sasol produces it from coal.

“These practices cannot be right or legitimate just because there is a BEE partner, or the company is trying to sell shares to ordinary citizens as a way to insulate itself from social pressure.”

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Construction materials group Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA's (12500.FR) Chief Executive Pierre Andre Chalendar said Monday he has seen a "worrying" drop in new construction in Europe and expects the fourth quarter to be more difficult for the auto and construction sectors at home.

Speaking on BFM radio, Chalendar said the company fared better in France over the third quarter than in other countries but that the fourth quarter "will be more difficult for everything linked to the auto
sector as automobile constructors reduce their production." He added that in the domestic construction sector, "we are starting to experience a real slowdown."

TD
Chalendar also repeated the company sees the European Commission's November decision to  fine the company EUR896 million in a  car-glass  producers cartel case as "disproportionate and exaggerated." The company has not launched an appeal, however, because it has not yet officially received the decision, he added.

UK COMPETITION OFT Clears Stella Artois/Budweiser Merger After a lengthy investigation, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) gave its approval to the acquisition by InBev (Belgium) of the US's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch. The deal is one of the largest cash acquisitions in corporate history and secures InBev's position as global leader in the beer market. The OFT's initial investigation disclosed that InBev's ownership of the Stella Artois and Beck brands made it the leading supplier of premium lager in the UK.
The acquisition of the Budweiser brand would further increase its market share. The investigation indicates that the deal was unlikely to raise competition concerns in the off-trade market (i.e.

TD
retail sales through shops, supermarkets and specialist outlets) where the barriers to market for rival brands are low. The OFT took a closer look however at the impact on the on-trade channel (i.e. pub, bar and restaurants), where the parties represent over 50% of sales of premium lager.

Nevertheless, it was apparent that the majority of the UK's on-trade market comprises sales of draught beer where the parties do not have overlapping interests since Budweiser is sold only in bottles. Although InBev and Anheuser-Busch do compete for sales of bottle beer and "fridge shelf space" in the on-trade market, the OFT concluded Budweiser and Beck's are not considered close substitutes by consumers. Follow-On Damages Claim In Coal Haulage Market On 17 November 2008, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) confirmed that Enron Coal (Enron), a company in liquidation since 2002, is seeking damages from English, Welsh and Scottish Railway Limited (EWS). This claim follows from the 2006 decision by the Office of Rail Regulation that EWS had abused its dominant position in the market for coal haulage by rail, in breach of both national competition law and Article 82 of the EC Treaty. EWS was found to have formed exclusive agreements with industrial coal users from 1996 until 2005, and engaged in predatory pricing for 18 months from July 2002. Accordingly, EWS was  fined £4m. Enron are now seeking damages in the CAT for the loss suffered by EWS imposing additional costs in relation to coal haulage,
and preventing Enron from obtaining new business or extending business. Enron is seeking damages and lost profit, restitutionary damages, an account of profits, interest, costs and further relief. Cardiff Bus Guilty Of Predatory Pricing The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has found that Cardiff Bus, a bus service operated by Cardiff Council, abused its dominant position by charging below cost prices. In 2004, Cardiff Bus introduced a low-cost bus service to compete with a "no frills" service offered by 2 Travel, a new-entrant to the market. When 2 Travel had gone out of business in 2005, Cardiff Bus removed its low-cost service altogether. On 18 November 2008, the OFT found that Cardiff Bus had been the only significant provider
of bus services in the area and the dominant player in the market. By dropping its prices to a loss making level in order to evict the new competitor from the market, Cardiff Bus had abused its dominant position. Under the Competition Act 1998, there is limited immunity from  fines for such abuse where the market effected or the turnover of the undertaking concerned is not substantial, although the OFT does have discretion to waive the immunity and impose  fines where appropriate. In this instance the OFT held that the conduct was of minor significance and decided not to  fine Cardiff Bus. Nevertheless, third parties that have suffered a loss as a result of Cardiff Bus's anti-competitive conduct may still bring a claim for damages. Interestingly, this is the first finding of an abuse of dominance by the OFT since 2003. Marine Hose Directors Receive Reduction In Prison Sentences The UK Court of Appeal (CoA) has reduced the prison sentences of three directors imprisoned earlier this year in the first successful prosecutions for cartel offences under the Enterprise Act 2002. The three directors, who had been arrested by the Department of Justice in the USA, negotiated a plea bargain that would allow them to be returned to the
UK provided they pleaded guilty to participating in the marine hose  cartel. A director of PW Consulting and two directors of Dunlop Oil & Marine were sentenced to 36, 36 and 30 months in prison by the Crown
Court in June 2008. On 14 November 2008, the CoA reduced these prison terms. The CoA explained that
Page 153 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
it would have reduced the sentences still further to take into account the directors' co-operation in the investigation and their loss of livelihood, however it had been constrained by the sentences imposed by the USA officials as a result of the plea bargains. The Directors concerned will now serve between 20-30 months. British Airways Executives In Magistrates' Court Four executives of British Airways appeared in court on 12 November 2008 on charges of colluding with Virgin Atlantic to fix the prices of passenger fuel surcharges on long-haul flights. The executives are charged with the  cartel offence under the Enterprise Act 2002. If they are found guilty of the offence they could face a maximum of five years in prison, disqualification from acting as a director and personal  fines. The executives were not required to enter a plea at this stage but the case has been transferred to Southwark Crown Court for a trial by jury. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have already agreed a settlement in the USA, and offered to pay damages to any customers who purchased flights between July 2004 and April 2006. EU COMPETITION
Commission Imposes Record Fines On Cartel Participants On 12 November 2008, the  European           Commission (Commission) imposed fines in excess of €1.3bn on Asahi (Japan), Pilkington (UK),
Saint-Gobain (France) and Soliver (Belgium), for their participation in a  car glass cartel. During
1998-2003, the companies held regular discussions involving the allocation of tenders for supplies of glass
for car manufacture. During the discussions the companies exchanged commercially lucrative and
confidential information. Not only did the Commission impose the largest  fine to date for a single  cartel,
but they also imposed the largest cartel fine for a single company. Saint-Gobain's  fine was increased by
60% to €896m, due to its prior involvement in two glass cartels (one in 1984 and another in 1988).
Pilkington was  fined €370m and Soliver just over €4m. Asahi received a 50% reduction in its  fine to reflect
its co-operation with the  Commission during the investigations. On 17 November 2008, it was reported
that the companies intend to appeal the Commission's decision. Surprise Inspections In The Biomedical
Analysis Market On 12 and 13 November 2008, the European Commission (Commission) carried out
unannounced inspections at the premises of a business association and enterprise, both active in the
biomedical analysis market in France. The inspections, which follow a complaint from clinical laboratory
Labco, are a preliminary stage of the  Commission's investigations into possible illegal restrictive practices
in breach of Articles 81 and/or 82 of the EC Treaty. According to French newspaper Les Echos, the
premises of the Order des pharmaciens (France's National Order of Pharmacists) have been subject to a
number of searches. The duration of the investigation is dependant on the complexity of the case and the
co-operation of those involved. Application Of Competition Law To Compulsory Insurance Scheme
Advocate General Mazák (the AG) has given his Opinion on whether a body providing insurance against
accidents at work and occupational diseases is an "undertaking" for the purposes of EC competition law.
Case C-350/07 came before the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) on a preliminary reference from a court
in Saxony (Germany). The background to the case is that the insurance body concerned, MMB provided
statutory occupational accident insurance company to a private company, Kattner. In November 2004,
Kattner decided to cancel its affiliation with MMB on the basis that it had decided to obtain private
insurance. MMB advised Kattner it could not opt out of the affiliation. Kattner appealed the decision
claiming that compulsory affiliation breaches EC competition law. One issue referred to the ECJ was
whether MMB is an "undertaking" under Articles 81 & 82 EC. In his Opinion the AG's took the view that a
body operating a social security scheme based on the principle of solidarity would not be an "undertaking"
where certain elements of the scheme are subject to State supervision. The AG also took the view that the
compulsory affiliation of certain employers to insurance associations operating such social security
schemes did not breach the EC Treaty rules on free movement of services. ECJ Rules On Agreement To
Reduce Capacity The  European Court of Justice (ECJ) has given its ruling on the question of whether an
agreement between Irish beef processors to reduce processing capacity may amount to a restrictive
practice in breach of Article 81(1) EC. Case C-209/07 came before the ECJ on a preliminary ruling from
the Irish Supreme Court. The background was that, following concerns in 2002 about overcapacity in the
Irish beef market, the 10 largest processors formed the Beef Industry Development Society (BIDS). BIDS
formed a rationalisation plan to reduce capacity by 25%. Under the plan, BIDS would offer a standard
contract to processors exiting the market to whom a compensation payment was made from a fund
created by a levy on members of BIDS remaining in business. The Irish Competition Authority challenged
the scheme on the basis that it breached Article 81(1) EC and the issue eventually went before the Irish
Supreme Court. The ECJ concluded that the standard form agreement to reduce capacity would fall within
the scope of Article 81(1) EC as it involves co-ordination of behaviour on the market and limits
independent action. The ECJ did not rule out that the crisis in the sector may be relevant for consideration
of whether the Agreement might benefit from exemption under Article 81(3) EC, but this did not affect the
analysis of whether it fell within the scope of Article 81(1) EC. Advocate General Recommends Reduction
Of Fines In Citric Acid  Cartel n 6 November 2008, Advocate General Mengozzi (the AG) gave his Opinion
on an appeal brought before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM).
In 2001, the European Commission (Commission) fined ADM and four other companies a total of
€135.2m for their participation in an illegal price-fixing cartel in the citric acid sector. The  Commission
found that between March 1991 and May 1995, the companies met regularly and allocated specific sales
quotas, fixed target prices, exchanged customer information and eliminated price discounts. Furthermore,
the companies took concerted action to prevent imports from China. The Court of First Instance (CFI)
dismissed ADM's appeal against its  fine of €36.7m in 2006. ADM lodged an appeal with the ECJ citing
errors in the CFI's judgment, in particular in relation to ADM's role as a ringleader in the  cartel and its
Page 154 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
assessment of the impact of the  cartel on the market. The AG recommends ADM's  fine to be reduced to
€29.4m on the basis that insufficient evidence had been produced to demonstrate that ADM was the
ringleader. The AG also raised concerns regarding the level of factual information set out in the statement
of objections. He highlighted that the right of defence requires a sufficient level of information to enable the
accused to be aware of the case against it. However, in other respects, the AG recommends upholding the
Commission's decision and dismissing much of the rest of the appeal, in particular with regard to the
impact of the cartel on the market. Commission Approves Acquisition Of ILOG By IBM On 10 November
2008, the European Commission (Commission) cleared the acquisition of ILOG S.A., a French
company active in the development of computer software, by US company International Business
Machines Corporation (IBM). IBM is a worldwide company active in the development, production and
marketing of various IT solutions. Following an investigation, the  Commission confirmed that although
there were some horizontal overlaps in the parties respective activities with regard to the application
development and deployment of software and supply chain management applications, these overlaps
were limited and the merged company would continue to face strong competition. Furthermore, the vertical
and conglomerate links between ILOG and IBM would not impede competition, as the merged company
would not have the ability to restrict access to ILOG's products. PROCUREMENT ECJ Ruling In Coditel
Case On 13 November 2008, the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) gave its ruling in the Coditel case
(C-324/07) following a preliminary reference from a Belgian court. The Coditel case concerned the award
of a services concession for television cable network services by a local authority to an inter-municipal
co-operative society. Unlike public contracts, service concessions fall outside the scope of the Public
Procurement Directive (2004/18/EC), however a challenge was taken on the question of whether the EC
rules on free movement and the general principles of  European law required the contract to go out to an
open tender. The central issue was whether the contract could be treated as an "in house" arrangement
not requiring an open tender, in accordance with the test the ECJ has established under earlier case law
(notably the Teckal case C-107/98). Under this test, it had to be demonstrated that the level of control
exercised by the local authorities over the concessionaire was equivalent to that which it exercised over its
own departments and whether the concessionaire would carry out the essential part of its activities with
the controlling authority or authorities. In this instance, it was clear that the second limb of the test was met
so the real issue was one of "control". The ECJ held that where a number of public authorities own a
concessionaire to whom they entrust the performance of a public service task, the control that they
exercise over that entity may be exercised jointly. Having considered the facts of the case, the Court
concluded that the level of control required was met in this instance. Italian Tramway Contract Constitutes
"Works Contract" In 2002 the Municipality of L'Aquila in Italy launched a tender procedure for the design
realisation and management of a tramway. The intention being that the Municipality would award a works
concession. However, having received no bids, the Municipality awarded the contract to the construction
group CGRT. Under the contract between the Municipality and CGRT, the tramway concessionaire that
would eventually run the tramway would enter into a service agreement with the Municipality and also pay
CGRT a periodic payment for the right to exploit the tramway. Following complaints, the  Commission took
an action before the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) over the question of whether the contract between
the Municipality and CGRT was wrongly categorised as a public works concession and should have been
treated as a public works contract under the procurement rules. On 13 November 2008, the ECJ held (in
Case C-437/07) that, since CGRT did not assume any of the risks associated with the exploitation of the
tramway, the contract constituted a "public works contract". Consequently, the contract should have been
tendered in accordance with the procurement rules and the "public financing" procedure the Municipality
had used did not fulfil its obligations under those rules. STATE AID France Ordered To Recover Illegal Tax
Aid The French Government has failed to convince the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) that it was
unable to recover illegal aid provided under a tax exemption scheme. In 2003, the European                    
Commission (Commission) decided that a provision in the French General Tax Code, which provided a
two year exemption from corporation tax for companies acquiring firms in difficulty was incompatible with
the rules on State aid under the EC Treaty. The  Commission's decision required the French Government
to identify the principal companies benefiting from the scheme and to seek recovery of the aid. Although
the principal beneficiaries were identified, by 2006 no recovery orders were issued and the  Commission
initiated an infringement action before the ECJ. On 13 November 2008 (in Case C-214/07), the ECJ
confirmed the  Commission's decision and rejected France's defence that it was not possible to obtain
recovery. The ECJ pointed out that the  Commission had not complained that France had not sought
recovery from beneficiaries that had ceased trading but only with regard to companies that were still
trading. Recapitalisation Of ING Approved The  Commission has approved an emergency recapitalisation
scheme for the Dutch financial group, ING in recognition of the fact that loss of confidence in the institution
would have had a serious impact on the Dutch economy. The Dutch authorities now have six months to
submit a restructuring plan that will ensure the Group's long-term viability. Rescue Aid For Italian Regional
Air Carrier Alpi Eagles SpA, a regional air carrier based in the Veneto region of Italy will be granted a
€17m loan to recommence flight operations following approval by the  European Commission of a notified
rescue scheme. The aid will not only help secure jobs for the 150 staff working for the company but also
maintain transport links for the region. However, rescue aid is only a temporary solution. Within six months
the company will either have to be restructured, liquidated or be able to operate without the benefit of a
publicly guaranteed loan.  Commission Seeks Penalties Against Greece Over Aid For Airline After years
Page 155 of 158 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of wrangling over State aid to Olympic Airways, the European Commission (Commission) has taken Greece to court again to force recovery of the aid. On 12 May 2005, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), in Case C-415/03, confirmed that certain aid provided to the airline was unlawful and should be recovered. The Commission alleges that this aid was never recovered and launched a further action before the ECJ to enforce the earlier Judgment. On 12 November 2008, there was a hearing before the ECJ (Case
C-369/07) at which the  Commission argued that the ECJ should impose a daily penalty for every day that Greece has failed to comply with the ECJ's 2005 Judgment. The Greek authorities claim that the aid has been fully recovered and that further action is unnecessary. This case is the first time that an action has been taken under Article 228 of the EC Treaty to impose penalties on a Member State for failure to comply with competition or State aid rules. A ruling on the case is expected next year. The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.
