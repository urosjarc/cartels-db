(Adds new Commission quote in paragraph 9)

BRUSSELS, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Europe's top antitrust authority is due to fine companies for fixing prices for road surface material  bitumen  after BP blew the whistle on the cartel, sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.

TD
At least one person familiar with the case thought it likely that BP would escape any  fine related to the cartel, which took place on the Dutch market and had been investigated by the European  Commission for four years.
BP declined to comment.

The investigation also involved oil giants Total, Shell and Exxon Mobil, as well as a group of Dutch construction firms, a European  Commission document showed.

The fines, which are capped at 10 percent of a company's annual turnover, will be imposed at a meeting of EU commissioners on Sept. 13, the sources said.
The fines will be decided under the  Commission's old guidelines as the case began so long ago,
though the regulator changed them recently to put greater emphasis on punishing large firms and repeat
offenders.

Before deciding on a sum, the  Commission looks into the seriousness and duration of the offence, previous violations, and whether the company helped authorities in their investigations.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
A spokesman for the  Commission would not say what case was at issue.

"I can confirm that an Article 81 decision is due to be taken by the college next week," spokesman Jonathan Todd said. "The  Commission has made it a top priority to crack down on cartels." Article 81 covers cartels.
Total declined to comment, while Shell said it had cooperated with the  Commission in its investigation. "As long as the European  Commission has not reached a decision yet, we have nothing to say," a Shell
spokesman added from The Hague.

The case was handled by Internal Markets Commissioner Charlie McCreevy because Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes sat on the board of one of the companies investigated, Dutch construction firm Ballast Nedam, for almost 15 years.

Others investigated were Kuwait Petroleum, Swedish  bitumen  specialist Nynas, Esha Group's Smid & Hollander refinery in the Netherlands and Dutch builders BAM Group, Heijmans, Dura Vermeer and Koninklijke Volker.

Kloeckner Bitumen  BV was also involved.

A spokesman for BAM said he did not know what the outcome of the  Commission's investigation would be.

"We are hearing the same rumours (about a possible  fine). We don't know whether we will be  fined, we are waiting for the European  Commission decision," he said.

Ballast and Heijmans said they were waiting for the  Commission's decision and would not comment further.

An unrelated Dutch investigation into hundreds of construction companies has already found that Ballast, BAM and Heijmans fixed prices.
Shell and Kuwait Petroleum were  fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in 2005 for petrol
price fixing  in those countries.

In the Commission's case, those five companies will escape higher-than-usual  fines because of the old rules. Under the new guidelines offences unearthed by national regulators are taken into account.

The Commission charged the companies in 2004 following raids two years earlier which also examined the bitumen  markets in Belgium and Spain. (Additional reporting by David Lawsky in Brussels, Anna Mudeva in Amsterdam and Jean Michel Belot in Paris) [20060905 094328 GMT]

The European Commission is likely to set  fines on 13 September on firms it has deemed guilty of price-fixing of bitumen.  The fines will be the culmination of a four-year probe into an alleged  cartel operated in the Dutch market by regulators. Firms reportedly being investigated include Shell, Total and Exxon.

UPDATE 2-EU to  fine firms in bitumen cartel soon - sources (Adds companies' comments, background on fines)

CHEMICALS  CARTEL EU (UPDATE 3)

UPDATE 3-EU to  fine firms in bitumen cartel soon - sources (Adds new  Commission quote in paragraph 9)

TD
By Sabina Zawadzki

Brussels, Sept 5 Reuters - Europe's top antitrust authority is due to fine companies for fixing prices for road surface material  bitumen  after BP blew the whistle on the cartel, sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.

At least one person familiar with the case thought it likely that BP would escape any  fine related to the cartel, which took place on the Dutch market and had been investigated by the European  Commission for four years.
BP declined to comment.

The investigation also involved oil giants Total, Shell and Exxon Mobil, as well as a group of Dutch construction firms, a European  Commission document showed.

The fines, which are capped at 10 percent of a company's annual turnover, will be imposed at a meeting of EU commissioners on Sept. 13, the sources said.

The fines will be decided under the  Commission's old guidelines as the case began so long ago, though the regulator changed them recently to put greater emphasis on punishing large firms and repeat offenders.

Before deciding on a sum, the  Commission looks into the seriousness and duration of the offence, previous violations, and whether the company helped authorities in their investigations.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
A spokesman for the  Commission would not say what case was at issue. ``I can confirm that an Article
81 decision is due to be taken by the college next week,'' spokesman Jonathan Todd said. ``The
Commission has made it a top priority to crack down on cartels.'' Article 81 covers cartels.
Total declined to comment, while Shell said it had co-operated with the  Commission in its investigation.
``As long as the European  Commission has not reached a decision yet, we have nothing to say,'' a Shell
spokesman added from The Hague.

The case was handled by Internal Markets Commissioner Charlie McCreevy because Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes sat on the board of one of the companies investigated, Dutch construction firm Ballast Nedam, for almost 15 years.

Others investigated were Kuwait Petroleum, Swedish  bitumen  specialist Nynas, Esha Group's Smid & Hollander refinery in the Netherlands and Dutch builders BAM Group, Heijmans, Dura Vermeer and Koninklijke Volker.
Kloeckner Bitumen  BV was also involved.

A spokesman for BAM said he did not know what the outcome of the  Commission's investigation would be. ``We are hearing the same rumours (about a possible  fine). We don't know whether we will be  fined, we are waiting for the European  Commission decision,'' he said.

Ballast and Heijmans said they were waiting for the  Commission's decision and would not comment further.

An unrelated Dutch investigation into hundreds of construction companies has already found that Ballast, BAM and Heijmans fixed prices.

Shell and Kuwait Petroleum were  fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in 2005 for petrol  price fixing  in those countries.

In the Commission's case, those five companies will escape higher-than-usual  fines because of the old rules. Under the new guidelines offences unearthed by national regulators are taken into account.

The Commission charged the companies in 2004 following raids two years earlier which also examined the bitumen  markets in Belgium and Spain. (Additional reporting by David Lawsky in Brussels, Anna Mudeva in Amsterdam and Jean Michel Belot in Paris)

HD      UPDATE 2-EU fines 14 firms 266.7 mln euros in bitumen  case

(Adds byline, shares, company reactions, details, background)

BRUSSELS, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Europe's top antitrust authority  fined 14 companies on Wednesday a total of 266.7 million euros ($338.4 million), including a 108 million-euro penalty for Shell , for fixing prices of road surface material  bitumen  in the Netherlands.

TD
Four of the firms said they intended to appeal.
Oil giant Shell received the biggest  fine, while French peer Total was ordered to pay 20.25 million euros. Dutch firm Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin was  fined 27.36 million euros and Kuwait Petroleum 16.63
million euros.

"The fines for Shell were the highest because it was a repeat offender and because it played a leading role in the cartel," EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd told a briefing.
Todd also confirmed that the EU executive was investigating suspected  bitumen  cartels in Belgium and
Spain.

BP , which blew the whistle on the Dutch cartel in 2002, received immunity from  fines. The Dutch market had been under investigation by the European Commission for four years.
Shell said in a statement on its Web site that it regretted its involvement.

"We never should have been present at these meetings," Rein Willems, director of Shell Netherlands BV, said.
"We firstly will study the judgement. After that we will decide in what way we will respond."
Shell's stock was down 0.79 percent in London, while shares in Total were down 0.5 percent in Paris. BP
was up 0.69 percent.

Fines of between 10 million and 20 million euros were handed down to Esha, Kloeckner  Bitumen, Nynas, Wintershall, Heijmans and Koninklijke BAM .

Ballast Nedam , Dura Vermeer and Hollandsche Beton Groep, a unit of Dutch construction group BAM, were given fines of less than 8 million euros.
BAM, Nedam, Heijmans and Beton said they would appeal.

Dutch builder Heijmans added that it had lowered its 2006 net profit outlook. It now expects net profit to be 78 million euros ($99 million), down from 87 million euros before the news.

According to a statement, it had made a provision of 45 million euros for the final settlement of the investigation, but the EU  fine was higher than anticipated at that time. Following the news, Heijmans shares were off 1.21 percent.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is mainly used to make asphalt, binding other road surfacing materials together. Eight of the companies  fined are bitumen  suppliers, while the other six are purchasers of the by-product.
REPEAT OFFENDERS
The fines, the seventh-highest amount ever handed down in a  cartel case, were decided under the
Commission's old guidelines as the case began so long ago.

The regulator changed them recently to put greater emphasis on punishing large firms and repeat offenders.

Before deciding on a sum, the  Commission looks into the seriousness and duration of the offence, previous violations, and whether the company helped authorities in their investigations.

"Some of the companies involved obstructed our investigation and that's the reason why the  fines are so high," Todd added.

The case was handled by EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy because Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes sat on the board of one of the companies investigated, Dutch builder Ballast Nedam, for almost 15 years.

Shell and Kuwait Petroleum were  fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in 2005 for petrol  price fixing  in those countries. (Additional reporting by Emma Davis in Brussels and Nicola Leske and Harro ten Wolde in Amsterdam) ($1=.7880 euro)

BRUSSELS, Sept 13, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Commission fined 14 companies on Wednesday a total of 266.7 million euros (338.3 million dollars) for operating a cartel in the Dutch market for road  bitumen.

TD
The European Union's top regulator found that eight suppliers and six road builders had fixed the prices in The Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, breaking EU antitrust rules.
The suppliers were BP, Esha, Kloeckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynaes, Shell, Total and
Wintershall.

The construction companies buying the  bitumen  were Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep, which is now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep, Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin.

The commission accused the companies of fixing the gross price of all road bitumen  sold in The Netherlands and agreeing to minimum rebates for buyers participating in the cartel and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders.
"This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies," the  commission
said in a statement.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is used to bind surfacing materials that make asphalt.

The commission estimated the Dutch  bitumen  market to be worth 62 million euros in 2002, the last year the cartel was operating.

BRUSSELS, Sept 13, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Commission fined 14 firms on Wednesday a total of 266.7 million euros (338.3 million dollars) for operating a cartel in the Dutch road  bitumen  market, with energy giant Shell singled out for its leading role.

TD
The European Union's top regulator found that eight suppliers and six road builders had fixed the prices in The Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, breaking EU antitrust rules.
The suppliers were BP, Esha, Kloeckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynaes, Shell, Total and
Wintershall.

The construction companies buying the  bitumen  were Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep, which is now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep, Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin (KWS).

The commission accused the companies of fixing the gross price of all road bitumen  sold in The Netherlands and agreeing to minimum rebates for buyers participating in the cartel and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders.
"This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies," the  commission
said in a statement.
Shell received the biggest  fine, 108 million euros, because it is a repeat offender and started the  cartel
with KWS, which was given the second biggest  fine of 27.36 million euros.

KWS's  fine was also increased because it obstructed the  commission's probe by refusing investigators access to its premises, forcing them to seek help from the Dutch competition watchdog and police.
BP would have been  fined 30.78 million euros, but the penalty was entirely waived and Kuwait
Petroleum's  fine was cut by 30 percent because they cooperated with investigators.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is used to bind surfacing materials that make asphalt.

The commission estimated the Dutch  bitumen  market to be worth 62 million euros in 2002, the last year the cartel was operating.

Commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger said the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes had not participated in the decision to  fine the companies because she had sat on Ballast Nedam's board from 1990 to 2004.
Reading a statement from Kroes, he said that the company's board members had been unaware of the
cartel until 2004, when they were notified about the  commission's investigation.

HD     EU fines Shell, Total, 12 others 267 mln eur in bitumen price-fixing cartel

BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) - The European Commission said today it has  fined 14 companies involved in the supply and purchase of road bitumen  in the Netherlands 267 mln eur for participating in a
price-fixing cartel from 1994-2002.
The pricing cartel violated article 81 of the EC Treaty competition ban on restrictive business practices.

TD
The 14 companies have been  fined a total of 266.7 mln eur.  Bitumen  suppliers BP plc, Esha, Kloeckner Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynds, Shell BV, Total SA and Wintershall, were all  fined, as were construction companies Ballast Nedam NV, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans NV, Hollandsche Beton Groep (now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep), Koninklijke BAM Groep NV and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin.
Shell and KWS had their  fine increased as they began and led the  cartel.

Shell was fined an additional 50 pct for as it as a repeat offender, having previously been in PVC and polypropylene cartels. KWS was  fined an extra 10 pct for refusing to give investigators access to their premises.

BP, however, was granted full immunity from what should have been a 30.78 mln  fine, for cooperating. Kuwait Petroleum had a 30 pct reduction.

The commission said that between at least 1994 to 2002, the  cartel fixed the gross price of all road pavement bitumen  sold in the Netherlands, and agreed uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were  cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. frances.robinson@afxnews.com fr/joy

The commission granted BP PLC (BP) full immunity for cooperating in the investigation. In contrast, it doubled Royal Dutch Shell NV's (RDSA)  fine to EUR108 million as a repeat offender.

TD
The cartel fines represent the seventh largest ever levied by EU regulators and underline their determination to fight cartels. Companies are liable to up to 10% of their worldwide turnover if they participate, but they can appeal all decisions to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
In 2001, the  commission imposed fines of EUR790 million on a vitamin  cartel. Last year, it imposed
fines of EUR388 million on a hydrogen peroxide  cartel and EUR344 million on an acrylic glass  cartel.

"The result of the  cartel was the price of  bitumen  was higher than it otherwise would have been," said E.U. antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd. Although  bitumen  is a "small market" Todd said the "fine is very high compared because "very large companies were involved, the  cartel lasted for a time and that it was a very serious infringement." In addition, some companies were "repeat offenders" and some "obstructed our investigation."

TD
He said similar probes were ongoing in both the Belgian and Spanish  bitumen  markets.

BP was granted full immunity from a  fine which would otherwise have been EUR30.78 million, while Kuwait Petroleum Corp. had its  fine reduced by 30% to EUR16.6 million. Shell, Total SA (TOT) and Nynas, also claimed a reduction of the  fine, but failed to qualify. Shell's  fine was upped by 50% because it had participated in other similar cartels, the  commission said. Total was  fined EUR20.25 million and Nynas EUR13.5 million.

None of the construction companies applied for leniency. Ballast Nedam, which was  fined EUR4.65 million, first joined the  cartel in 1996, when it became a major road builder in the Netherlands. Wintershall AG,  fined EUR11.6 million, sold its  bitumen  business to BP at the end of 1999.

Others bitumen  suppliers fined were Esha, EUR11.5 million and Kockner & Co. AG (KCO.XE), EUR10 million.

In its statement, the  commission said Volker Wessels Stevin had obstructed its probe, refusing
commission investigators access to its facilities.

Europe had a long history of tolerating  price-fixing, dating back to medieval guilds, analysts say. In the
Netherlands, cartels were legal until 1996.

TD
But that tolerance is fast disappearing. The EU's antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes has vowed to be a "whistle blower" and to show "zero tolerance" toward cartels.

Ironically, though, she served on the supervisory board of Ballast Nedam during the period which the offense took place. In a statement, she said she had recused herself from the investigation and that the company's supervisory board learned about the investigation only in 2004, shortly before she left to become competition commissioner. She refrained from voting on the  fines at Wednesday's commission meeting.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is mainly used to make asphalt, binding other road surfacing materials together. This  cartel covered all bitumen  used for road construction in the Netherlands, a market valued around EUR62 million in 2002.

In June 2002, BP applied to the  commission for immunity from  fines. In October 2002, the commission carried out inspections of various  bitumen  suppliers and road constructors. It sent statements of objections in October 2004. A hearing was held in June 2005.

The evidence showed that from at least 1994 to 2002, a delegation of the  bitumen  suppliers met with the six biggest road construction companies in the Netherlands in a series of meetings, called the "bitumen  consultation" or "bitumenoverleg", the  commission said.

BRUSSELS, Sep 13, 2006 (DJCS via Comtex) --
(Updates with a reaction from Shell)

TD
The European  Commission Wednesday fined 14 companies EUR266.717 million for fixing prices of
bitumen,  a tar used in road construction.
Regulators found that eight suppliers and six purchasers participated in a  cartel in the Netherlands from
1994 to 2002.

The commission granted BP PLC (BP) full immunity for cooperating in the investigation. In contrast, it doubled Royal Dutch Shell NV's (RDSA)  fine to EUR108 million as a repeat offender.

"We should not have attended these meetings and we regret our involvement in this case," President-Director Rein Willems of Shell Nederland BV said in a statement.

The cartel fines represent the seventh largest ever levied by EU regulators and underline their determination to fight cartels. Companies are liable to up to 10% of their worldwide turnover if they participate, but they can appeal all decisions to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
In 2001, the  commission imposed fines of EUR790 million on a vitamin  cartel. Last year, it imposed
fines of EUR388 million on a hydrogen peroxide  cartel and EUR344 million on an acrylic glass  cartel.

"The result of the  cartel was the price of  bitumen  was higher than it otherwise would have been," said E.U. antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd. Although  bitumen  is a "small market" Todd said the "fine is very high comparatively, because "very large companies were involved, the  cartel lasted for a time and that it was a very serious infringement." In addition, some companies were "repeat offenders" and some "obstructed our investigation."
He said similar probes were ongoing in both the Belgian and Spanish  bitumen  markets.

BP was granted full immunity from a  fine, which would otherwise have been EUR30.78 million, while Kuwait Petroleum Corp. had its  fine reduced by 30% to EUR16.6 million. Shell, Total SA (TOT) and Nynas, also claimed a reduction of the  fine, but failed to qualify. Shell's  fine was upped by 50% because it had participated in other similar cartels, the  commission said. Total was  fined EUR20.25 million and Nynas EUR13.5 million.

None of the construction companies applied for leniency. Ballast Nedam, which was  fined EUR4.65 million, first joined the  cartel in 1996, when it became a major road builder in the Netherlands. Wintershall AG,  fined EUR11.6 million, sold its  bitumen  business to BP at the end of 1999.

Others bitumen  suppliers fined were Esha, EUR11.5 million and Kockner & Co. AG (KCO.XE), EUR10 million. Bitumen  buyers fined include Ballast Nedam NV (33654.AE), EUR4.65 million, Dura Vermeer NV, EUR5.4 million, Heijmans NV (34193.AE), EUR17.1 million, Holladsche Beton Groep NV, EUR7.2 million, Koninklijke Groep BAM NV (33731.AE), EUR13.5 million and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin NV, EUR27.36 million.

The European Commission fined 14 companies on Wednesday a total of Eur266.7 million ($338.3 million) for operating a cartel in the Dutch market for road  bitumen.

The European Union's top regulator found that eight suppliers and six road builders had fixed the prices in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, breaking EU antitrust rules. The suppliers were BP, Esha, Kloeckner Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynaes, Shell, Total and Wintershall. The construction companies buying the  bitumen  were Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep, which is now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep, Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin.

TD
The commission accused the companies of fixing the gross price of all road bitumen  sold in the Netherlands and agreeing to minimum rebates for buyers participating in the cartel and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. "This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies," the  commission said in a statement.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is used to bind surfacing materials that make asphalt. The commission estimated the Dutch  bitumen  market to be worth Eur62 million in 2002, the last year the cartel was operating.

Six construction companies where also  fined.
Shell and builders Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin had their  fine increased as they began and led the

(Adds detail, quote, shares)

The European  Commission has fined 14 makers and buyers of bitumen  in the Netherlands, including Shell and Total, a total Eur266.7 million ($338 million) for fixing bitumen  prices over an eight-year period, the  commission said Wednesday.

TD
The commission found that eight suppliers of road  bitumen;  BP, Esha, Klockner Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynas (Neste/PDVSA), Shell, Total and Wintershall, took part in a cartel fixing the gross price of bitumen  sold in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, and agreed minimum rebates for construction companies.

Shell was given the largest  fine of Eur108 million as it instigated and led the  cartel alongside construction group Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin, the  commission said.
Shell's fine was also increased as a result of it previous participation in the secret  market-sharing and
price-fixing cartel in the European PVC industry during the early 1980s.

"We shall first study the details of the decision and then decide whether we will appeal it," a Shell spokeswoman said.
Shell's shares were trading 0.9% lower at 1747 pence by 1330 GMT in London while the Dow Jones
Stoxx oil and gas index was unchanged.

BP avoided a  fine, which would otherwise have been Eur30.78 million, as it blew the whistle on the cartel that provided important information during the investigation, the  commission said. Kuwait Petroleum received a 30% reduction.

Kuwait Petroleum was  fined Eur16.63 million, Total Eur20.25 million, Germany's Wintershall Eur11.62 million, Sweden's Nynas Eur13.5 million, Dutch Klockner  Bitumen  Eur10 million and Dutch Esha Eur11.5 million.
Six construction companies where also  fined at total Eur75.2 million

The fines conclude a four-year investigation into suspected  price-fixing in European bitumen  markets which began in 2002 when a number of oil companies' offices were raided by competition officials.

Bitumen,  a by-product of refining crude, is mainly used to make asphalt, binding other road surfacing materials together.

Under the cartel, which ran from at least 1994 to 2002, a delegation of the  bitumen  suppliers met with the six biggest road construction companies in the Netherlands in a series of meetings, called the "bitumen  consultation," the  commission said.

In the joint meetings, the companies fixed the gross price of road  bitumen  and two rebates for the construction companies that own the asphalt production plants. One minimum rebate was set for the road construction companies that were part of the  cartel and a lower maximum rebate for other companies that were not part of the  cartel.

"This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies," the  commission said in a statement, adding that the  cartel caused the price level of  bitumen  in the Netherlands to rise above that in neighboring countries, even after the discounts granted to the large road builders.

The commission said, although its original investigation covered several European member states, it could not prove that the Netherlands  cartel formed part of a larger collusion covering other member states.

HD     EU fines 14 companies over €250 million for price fixing cartel in Dutch road works sector

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union  fined 14 companies involved in Dutch road works a total of €267 million (US$340 million) Wednesday, ruling that they had run a  cartel over eight years to fix the price of a key asphalt ingredient.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC has to pay by far the highest fine in the road bitumen  probe with €108 million (US$137 million). In a statement, the EU Commission said the company was an instigator, took the leadership in the  cartel and was a repeat offender.

TD
"We should not have attended these meetings and we regret our involvement in this case," President-Director Rein Willems of Shell Nederland BV said in a statement.

Alexandra Wright of the parent company Royal Dutch Shell PLC in London said the company would need time to study the reasoning behind the  fines before it decides whether to appeal. She could not comment on whether Shell's  fine is the largest the company has ever faced.
The EU head office said the KWS company tried to obstruct the  Commission's investigation. The fines were the seventh-largest imposed on a  cartel by the EU head office. EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes has often stressed that one of her main objectives is to counter
market-distorting cartels.
The bitumen  road construction market in the Netherlands was valued at €62 million (US$79 million) in
2002 and the fines combined were over four times the annual value.

"It is very high compared to the value of the market," said EU spokesman Jonathan Todd, arguing that there were serious aggravating circumstances involving Shell and KWS, which was  fined €27.36 million (US$34.77 million).

Shell's  fine was increased by 50 percent because of its involvement in previous cartels and another 50 percent for instigating and leading the  cartel.

KWS'  fine was also increased by 50 percent for its leading role in the  cartel and another 10 percent for obstructing the probe. The  Commission said EU inspectors were twice refused access to KWS buildings.

On the other hand, BP PLC was granted full immunity for cooperating and escaped a €30.8 million (US$39.1 million)  fine. Kuwait Petroleum had its  fine reduced by 30 percent to €16.6 million (US$21.1 million).

Ballast Nedam NV, which was  fined €4.7 million (US$5.91 million), said it "regrets any violations committed in the past by (its) subsidiaries in the Dutch market."

But the company said "there is no justification for fining the company ... certainly not with a  fine of this size," and it plans to appeal. It noted its  fine was greater than the total cost of the  bitumen  it had purchased during the years in question.

Page 33 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Todd said similar investigations into the  bitumen  sector were also ongoing in Spain and Belgium.
In the biggest EU antitrust fines, a 2001 vitamin  cartel ruling cost eight drug companies €855 million
(US$1.09 billion) in EU fines and, in a German cement  price-fixing case, 12 firms were ordered to pay
€702 million (US$892 million).

The Commission said the Dutch  cartel stretched from 1994 to 2002, when representatives from eight suppliers and six construction companies would meet for "bitumen  consultation" to fix prices and optimize profits.

"All  cartel members, both suppliers and buyers, therefore had an interest in participating in the  cartel," the EU statement said. It kept small players at a disadvantage. The Dutch government also had to pay more for the extension of its highway net.

Other suppliers  fined were Esha with €11.5 million (US$14.62 million), Kloeckner  Bitumen  at €10 million (US$12.7 million), Nynas at €13.5 million (US$17.2 million), Total with €20.3 million (US$25.7 million) and Wintershall with €11.6 million (US$14.8 million).

Other construction companies were Dura Vermeer €5.4 million (US$6.9 million), Heijmans €17.1 million (US$21.7 million), Hollandsche Beton Groep €7.2 million (US$9.2 million) and Koninklijke BAM €13.5 million (US$17.2 million).

HD     EU fines 14 companies over euro250 million for price fixing cartel in Dutch road works sector

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union  fined 14 companies involved in Dutch road works a total of euro267 million (US$340 million) Wednesday, ruling that they had run a  cartel over eight years to fix the price of a key asphalt ingredient.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC has to pay by far the highest fine in the road bitumen  probe with euro108 million (US$137 million). In a statement, the EU Commission said the company was an instigator, took the leadership in the  cartel and was a repeat offender.

TD
"We should not have attended these meetings and we regret our involvement in this case," President-Director Rein Willems of Shell Nederland BV said in a statement.

Alexandra Wright of the parent company Royal Dutch Shell PLC in London said the company would need time to study the reasoning behind the  fines before it decides whether to appeal. She could not comment on whether Shell's  fine is the largest the company has ever faced.
The EU head office said the KWS company tried to obstruct the  Commission's investigation. The fines were the seventh-largest imposed on a  cartel by the EU head office. EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes has often stressed that one of her main objectives is to counter
market-distorting cartels.
The bitumen  road construction market in the Netherlands was valued at euro62 million (US$79 million) in
2002 and the fines combined were over four times the annual value.

"It is very high compared to the value of the market," said EU spokesman Jonathan Todd, arguing that there were serious aggravating circumstances involving Shell and KWS, which was  fined euro27.36 million (US$34.77 million).

Shell's  fine was increased by 50 percent because of its involvement in previous cartels and another 50 percent for instigating and leading the  cartel.

KWS'  fine was also increased by 50 percent for its leading role in the  cartel and another 10 percent for obstructing the probe. The  Commission said EU inspectors were twice refused access to KWS buildings.

On the other hand, BP PLC was granted full immunity for cooperating and escaped a euro30.8 million (US$39.1 million)  fine. Kuwait Petroleum had its  fine reduced by 30 percent to euro16.6 million (US$21.1 million).

Ballast Nedam NV, which was  fined euro4.7 million (US$5.91 million), said it "regrets any violations committed in the past by (its) subsidiaries in the Dutch market."

But the company said "there is no justification for fining the company ... certainly not with a  fine of this size," and it plans to appeal. It noted its  fine was greater than the total cost of the  bitumen  it had purchased during the years in question.

Todd said similar investigations into the  bitumen  sector were also ongoing in Spain and Belgium.

In the biggest EU antitrust fines, a 2001 vitamin  cartel ruling cost eight drug companies euro855 million (US$1.09 billion) in EU fines and, in a German cement  price-fixing case, 12 firms were ordered to pay euro702 million (US$892 million).

The Commission said the Dutch  cartel stretched from 1994 to 2002, when representatives from eight suppliers and six construction companies would meet for "bitumen  consultation" to fix prices and optimize profits.

"All  cartel members, both suppliers and buyers, therefore had an interest in participating in the  cartel," the EU statement said. It kept small players at a disadvantage. The Dutch government also had to pay more for the extension of its highway net.

Other suppliers  fined were Esha with euro11.5 million (US$14.62 million), Kloeckner  Bitumen  at euro10 million (US$12.7 million), Nynas at euro13.5 million (US$17.2 million), Total with euro20.3 million (US$25.7 million) and Wintershall with euro11.6 million (US$14.8 million).

Other construction companies were Dura Vermeer euro5.4 million (US$6.9 million), Heijmans euro17.1 million (US$21.7 million), Hollandsche Beton Groep euro7.2 million (US$9.2 million) and Koninklijke BAM euro13.5 million (US$17.2 million).

The firm has been  fined 4.65 million euros (£3.1 million) for operating a  cartel in the Dutch road  bitumen
market and is set to appeal the ruling.

The European  Commission has fined 14 firms a total of 266.7 million euros (£180.4 million), after its regulator found that eight suppliers and six road builders had fixed prices in The Netherlands from 1994 to 2002.

TD
Ballast Nedam were one of eight construction companies buying the  bitumen  from the suppliers; BP, Esha, Kloeckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynaes, Shell, Total and Wintershall.

In a statement the firm said: “There is no justification for fining Ballast Nedam concerning the purchasing of bitumen,  and certainly not with a  fine of this size.
“Not only has the  Commission based its position on inaccurate and incomplete information in the case of
Ballast Nedam, it has misjudged and grossly exaggerated Ballast Nedam’s role.

“The total volume of  bitumen  Ballast Nedam bought in the period 1996-2001 was small (£700,000-£1.4 million).

In the firm’s 2006 half-year results, it posted a revenue of £394.8 million up from £386.7 million in 2005, and a pre-tax profit of £16.2 million, up 26 per cent.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European  Commission Wednesday fined 14 companies EUR266.717 million for fixing prices of  bitumen,  a tar used in road construction.
Regulators found that eight suppliers and six purchasers participated in a  cartel in the Netherlands from
1994 to 2002. [ 13-09-06 1000GMT ]

TD
The commission granted BP PLC (BP) full immunity for cooperating in the investigation. In contrast, it doubled Royal Dutch Shell NV's (RDSA)  fine to EUR108 million as a repeat offender.

The cartel fines represent the seventh largest ever levied by EU regulators and underline their determination to fight cartels. Companies are liable to up to 10% of their worldwide turnover if they participate, but they can appeal all decisions to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
In 2001, the  commission imposed fines of EUR790 million on a vitamin  cartel. Last year, it imposed
fines of EUR388 million on a hydrogen peroxide  cartel and EUR344 million on an acrylic glass  cartel. [
13-09-06 1005GMT ]

"The result of the  cartel was the price of  bitumen  was higher than it otherwise would have been," said E.U. antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd. Although  bitumen  is a "small market" Todd said the "fine is very high compared because "very large companies were involved, the  cartel lasted for a time and that it was a very serious infringement." In addition, some companies were "repeat offenders" and some "obstructed our investigation."
He said similar probes were ongoing in both the Belgian and Spanish  bitumen  markets.

BP was granted full immunity from a  fine which would otherwise have been EUR30.78 million, while Kuwait Petroleum Corp. had its  fine reduced by 30% to EUR16.6 million. Shell, Total SA (TOT) and Nynas, also claimed a reduction of the  fine, but failed to qualify. Shell's  fine was upped by 50% because it had participated in other similar cartels, the  commission said. Total was  fined EUR20.25 million and Nynas EUR13.5 million. [ 13-09-06 1123GMT ]

None of the construction companies applied for leniency. Ballast Nedam, which was  fined EUR4.65 million, first joined the  cartel in 1996, when it became a major road builder in the Netherlands. Wintershall AG,  fined EUR11.6 million, sold its  bitumen  business to BP at the end of 1999.

Others bitumen  suppliers fined were Esha, EUR11.5 million and Kockner & Co. AG (KCO.XE), EUR10 million. Bitumen  buyers fined include Ballast Nedam NV (33654.AE), EUR4.65 million, Dura Vermeer NV, EUR5.4 million, Heijmans NV (34193.AE), EUR17.1 million, Holladsche Beton Groep NV, EUR7.2 million, Koninklijke Groep BAM NV (33731.AE), EUR13.5 million and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin NV, EUR27.36 million.
In its statement, the  commission said Volker Wessels Stevin had obstructed its probe, refusing
commission investigators access to its facilities. [ 13-09-06 1134GMT ]
Europe had a long history of tolerating  price-fixing, dating back to medieval guilds, analysts say. In the
Netherlands, cartels were legal until 1996.



Page 39 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But that tolerance is fast disappearing. The EU's antitrust commissioner Neelie Kroes has vowed to be a "whistle blower" and to show "zero tolerance" toward cartels.

Ironically, though, she served on the supervisory board of Ballast Nedam during the period which the offense took place. In a statement, she said she had recused herself from the investigation and that the company's supervisory board learned about the investigation only in 2004, shortly before she left to become competition commissioner. She refrained from voting on the  fines at Wednesday's commission meeting.

Bitumen,  a by-product of fuel production, is mainly used to make asphalt, binding other road surfacing materials together. This  cartel covered all bitumen  used for road construction in the Netherlands, a market valued around EUR62 million in 2002.

In June 2002, BP applied to the  commission for immunity from  fines. In October 2002, the commission carried out inspections of various  bitumen  suppliers and road constructors. It sent statements of objections in October 2004. A hearing was held in June 2005. [ 13-09-06 1136GMT ]

The evidence showed that from at least 1994 to 2002, a delegation of the  bitumen  suppliers met with the six biggest road construction companies in the Netherlands in a series of meetings, called the "bitumen  consultation" or "bitumenoverleg", the  commission said. These meetings were usually preceded by preparatory meetings of the suppliers and separate preparatory meetings of the six biggest road construction companies.

In the joint meetings, participants fixed the gross price of road  bitumen  to be invoiced to the asphalt production plants and two rebates for the construction companies that own these asphalt production plants. A uniform minimum rebate for the road construction companies that were part of the cartel and
a lower maximum rebate for other road construction companies that weren't part of the cartel. The latter therefore had to pay higher prices.

The construction companies participating in the  cartel appeared not to be particularly concerned about the absolute level of the price of  bitumen,  as long as they received larger discounts than their smaller competitors, the  commission said. This caused the price level of  bitumen  in the Netherlands, even after the discounts granted to the large road builders, to gradually rise above that in neighbouring countries, the  commission added.

The European Commission (EC) fined 14 Dutch companies a total 266.7 mln euro ($338.3 mln) for operating a cartel in the Dutch market for road  bitumen,  the EC said on September 13, 2006.

According to the EC, 14 suppliers and road builders had fixed all  bitumen  prices in the Netherlands from 1994 until 2002 and thus broken the European Union (EU) antitrust rules.

Anglo-Dutch oil group Royal Dutch Shell Plc, a supplier of  bitumen,  received the highest  fine of 108 mln euro ($137 mln). Shell, together with construction company Royal Volker Wessels Stevin NV, were accused of initiating and leading the  cartel.

Bitumen  road builders Royal BAM Group, Heijmans NV and Ballast Nedam NV were  fined 20.7 mln euro ($26.2 mln), 17.1 mln euro ($21.7 mln) and 4.65 mln euro ($5.9 mln), respectively.

Shell did not deny to have attended meetings with  bitumen  suppliers and road builders during the given period, but asked for its  fine to be decreased. None of the other companies asked for  fine indulgence.

Bitumen  is a by-product of fuel production, which is mainly used for binding road surfacing materials that make asphalt.

Shell, Total and 11 other companies were yesterday  fined a total of Euros 267m (Dollars 339m) after the European  Commission found they had fixed prices in the Dutch market for road  bitumen.

A cartel brought together eight suppliers and five buyers of  bitumen,  a substance used to make asphalt for road surfaces.

TD
In a series of meetings between 1994 and 2002, the  cartel's members agreed prices and rebates aimed at freezing out smaller construction groups that were not part of the agreement.
The bitumen  suppliers involved in the  cartel were BP, Shell, Total, Wintershall, Esha, Klockner
Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum and Nynas.
The buyers were Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke
Volker Wessels Stevin (KWS).
BP was not  fined as it blew the whistle on thecartel and was granted immunity from punishment. Shell received by far the biggest  fine, Euros 108m, followed by KWS with Euros 27m and Total with
Euros 20m.

Shell's  fine was substantially increased because of the group's previous convictions in  cartel cases and its "leading role" in the arrangement.

KWS was also punished more severely than others because of its elevated role in the cartel and because it obstructed the investigation. The group twice refused to allow Commission inspectors to enter its premises during raids, forcing the watchdog to ask for police help.

The regulator acknowledged that the  fines were high compared to earlier cases, especially given that the Dutch  bitumen  market is worth only Euros 62m a year, or less than a quarter of the total  fine imposed yesterday.

However, the punishment was in line with a trend that has seen the  Commission ramp up financial penalties on companies that engage in competition abuses.

Chemical groups have been especially hard hit because so many of them carry previous convictions for similar cartel abuses.

Shell said it regretted its participation in the illegal activity and would study the  Commission's decision before reacting.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and 11 other oil companies and road builders were  fined €267-million ($380-million) by the European Union for fixing the price of  bitumen,  a petroleum byproduct used to make asphalt. Shell, whose  fine was increased for being a repeat offender, received the biggest
penalty at €108-million. BP PLC, which was also part of a Dutch cartel that lasted at least eight years, escaped a fine because it co-operated in the probe, the European Commission said. The penalties are part of a crackdown by the EU's antitrust arm and regulators in member states on the construction industry. RDSA (London) fell 10 pence (21 cents) to £17.52 FP (Paris) was unchanged at €50.35 ($71.63). Bloomberg

HELSINKI, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Finnish oil refiner Neste Oil will book a 6.75 million euro ($8.6 million) charge in its 2006 operating profit due to an EU  fine on its joint venture for  bitumen price fixing,  the firm said on Thursday.

TD
Neste Oil's 50 percent owned Swedish subsidiary Nynas Petroleum was  fined on Wednesday 13.5 million euros. Venezuelan oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. owns the rest of Nynas.
"As we own half of the company, it means the effect on us is half of the  fine," Neste Oil spokesman Juha
Rouhiainen said.

The European  Commission, Europe's top antitrust authority,  fined Nynas and 13 other companies a total of 266.7 million euros for fixing prices of road surface material  bitumen  in the Netherlands.
Nynas is a Swedish oil company specialising in  bitumen  and naphthenic specialty oils.

The Swedish oil company AB Nynas Petroleum confirmed on Wednesday (13 September) that it is one of
13 companies fined by the European  Commission for alleged price fixing  in the Dutch road building and
bitumen  supply sectors.
Nynas Petroleum was  fined EUR13.5m, which corresponds to approximately 1% of its turnover.

TD
"Nynas, despite strong competition, has been successful on many markets in Europe so we feel particularly sad about being included in an investigation like this one. Unfortunately our own investigation also shows that we have made some mistakes, which we have admitted to the EU  Commission," said Staffan Lennstrom, President of Nynas Petroleum.
One euro (EUR) is worth approximately 0.67 British pounds (GBP).

Brussels, 13/09/2006 (Agence Europe) - The  Commission has fined 14 road bitumen  companies in the Netherlands a total of 266.717 million EUR for having taken part in a price-fixing cartel, a restrictive practice which runs counter to article 81 of the Treaty. Between 1994 and 2002, eight suppliers and six buyers of road bitumen  in the Netherlands set the gross price for all  bitumen  sold in the Netherlands and agreed on uniform minimum rebates in favour of the construction companies which were in on the  cartel, and a smaller maximum rebate for all the other road construction companies. This seventh highest collective fine ever imposed by the Commission on a cartel is due to the length of time for which the infringement continued, the number of companies involved and the fact that some of them were repeat offenders. The agreement covered all  bitumen  used in road construction in the Netherlands, a market estimated at some 62 million EUR in 2002.

TD
Bitumen,  which is a by-product of fuel production, is mainly used in the production of asphalt, binding other road surfacing materials together.

Informed of the situation in 2002, the  Commission carried out an investigation, which showed that the six largest road builders in the Netherlands were attending so-called "bitumen  consultation" meetings, which were preceded by preparatory meetings between the suppliers on the one hand, and between the six largest road building companies on the other. Those taking part set the gross price for road  bitumen  to
the invoiced to the asphalt production plants and two rebates for the construction companies that own these asphalt production plants. The road building companies which were not part of the  cartel did not enjoy the same rebate and, therefore, paid higher prices. The level of  bitumen  prices in the Netherlands thus gradually rose to exceed that of its neighbour countries, even taking account of the rebates paid to the large road construction companies.

Due to its participation in a  cartel for polypropylene and PVC, and for its role as leader and instigator in this affair, Shell's  fine was increased to 108 million EUR. For having hindered the investigation, denying Commission inspectors access to its premises, KWS also saw its  fine increased, to 27.36 million. The other fines, some of which have been reduced, are: Esha (11.5 million), Klöckner Bitumen  (10 million), Kuwait Petroleum (16.632), Nynäs (13.5), Total (20.25), Wintershall (11.625) for the bitumen  suppliers, and Ballast Nedam (4.65), Dura Vermeer (5.4), Heijmans (17.1), Hollandsche Beton Groep (7.2), Koninklijke BAM (13.5) for the  bitumen  buyers. Having brought the affair to the light of the  Commission, BP enjoyed a total exemption, escaping a  fine of 30.78 million EUR.

The European Union  fined 14 companies involved in Dutch road works a total of 267 million euros, or $340 million US, on Wednesday, ruling they had run a  cartel over eight years to fix the price of a key asphalt ingredient.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC has to pay by far the highest  fine in the road bitumen  probe with $137 million US. In a statement, the EU  commission said the company was an instigator, took the leadership in the  cartel and was a repeat offender.

The fines were the seventh-largest imposed on a  cartel by the EU head office.

BP, Kuwait Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Germany's Wintershall were among 14 firms fined a total of €266.7 million ($339 million) by the European  Commission for operating a road bitumen  cartel.

In a four-year investigation, the  commission found that eight suppliers and six purchasers of road bitumen  in the Netherlands participated in a  price-fixing cartel from 1994 to 2002 in violation of European competition rules, which forbid restrictive business practices. The companies agreed uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were  cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders.

TD
The commission imposed relatively high fines on Shell and construction firm KWS as they were found to have instigated and led the cartel. Shell's  fine was increased to €108 million for being a repeat offender, while KWS incurred a higher  fine for trying to obstruct the investigation.
BP's  fine was waived due to its collaboration with the  commission, while Kuwait Petroleum had its
fine reduced by 30%.
Shell and Kuwait Petroleum were  fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in 2005 for gasoline
price-fixing in those countries.

The European  Commission has fined 14 makers and buyers of bitumen  in the Netherlands, including Shell and Total, a total of Eur266.7 million ($338 million) for fixing  bitumen  prices over an eight-year period, the  commission said September 13.

The commission found eight suppliers of road  bitumen—BP,  Esha, Klockner Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynas (Neste/PDVSA), Shell, Total and Wintershall—took part in a cartel fixing the gross price of bitumen  sold in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, and agreed minimum rebates for construction companies.

TD
Shell was given the largest  fine of Eur108 million as it instigated and led the  cartel alongside construction group Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin, the commission said. Shell's fine also was increased as a result of its previous participation in the secret market-sharing and price-fixing cartel in the European PVC industry in the early 1980s.

"We shall first study the details of the decision and then decide whether we will appeal it," a Shell spokeswoman said.

BP avoided a  fine, which would otherwise have been Eur30.78 million, as it blew the whistle on the cartel and provided important information during the investigation, the  commission said. Kuwait Petroleum received a 30% reduction in its  fine to Eur16.63 million, also for assisting with the probe.

Among the other companies, Total was  fined Eur20.25 million, Germany's Wintershall Eur11.62 million, Sweden's Nynas Eur13.5 million, Dutch Klockner  Bitumen  Eur10 million and Dutch Esha Eur11.5 million. Six construction companies where  fined at total of Eur75.2 million.

The fines conclude a four-year investigation into suspected  price-fixing in European bitumen markets, which began in 2002 when a number of oil companies' offices were raided by competition officials.

Bitumen,  a byproduct of refining crude, is mainly used to make asphalt, binding other road-surfacing materials together. Under the  cartel, a delegation of the  bitumen  suppliers met with the six-biggest road construction companies in the Netherlands in a series of meetings, called the "bitumen consultation," the  commission said.

In the joint meetings, the companies fixed the gross price of road  bitumen  and two rebates for the construction companies that own the asphalt production plants. One minimum rebate was set for the road construction companies that were part of the  cartel and a lower maximum rebate for other companies not part of the  cartel.
"This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies," the
commission said in a statement. It added that the  cartel caused the price level of  bitumen  in the

Page 58 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Netherlands to rise above that in neighboring countries, even after the discounts granted to the large road builders.

The commission said, although its original investigation covered several European member states, it could not prove that the Netherlands  cartel formed part of a larger collusion covering other member states.

ROYAL Dutch Shell, which had been enjoying a brief respite from regulators, has been  fined £73m by the European  Commission for its part in a  cartel that fixed prices of road  bitumen  for eight years.

The EU fined 14 companies a total of £180m. Shell's  fine was the heaviest, and was raised by 50pc for its leading role in the  cartel and 10pc for obstructing the probe. Shell's shares closed down 12p
to 1803p.

TD
Others probed included Kuwait Petroleum, Total, and BP. By cooperating, BP escaped a £20m  fine.

HD         Dutch Heijmans Considers EC Fine Disproportional

Dutch construction company Heijmans NV considers the 17.1 mln euro ($21.7 mln)  fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) for fixing prices of  bitumen  disproportional, the company said on September 13, 2006.

The EC has conducted an investigation into restrictive trade practices in the purchase of  bitumen,  a basic material in asphalt production. The investigation concerned the period from 1994 to the spring of
2002.

TD
According to Heijmans, the fine bears no relation to the revenue involved and to the already imposed fines by the Dutch anti-cartel watchdog NMa in the investigation into the construction industry. Heijmans made a provision of 45 mln euro ($57.1 mln), booked in 2003 and 2004, to settle the investigation into the construction industry.
Heijmans is now considering to lodge an appeal against the decision of the EC.

The 17.1 mln euro  fine is higher than anticipated and Heijmans will make a further provision of 9.0 mln euro ($11.4 mln), to be booked in 2006.

As a result, Heijmans (  www.heijmans.nl ) downgraded its after-tax profit expectation for 2006 to 78 mln euro ($99 mln) from 87 mln euro ($110.4 mln). The company confirmed, however, the earlier proposed dividend of 1.45 euro ($1.84) per share for 2006.

Dutch builder Ballast Nedam NV is shocked with the 4.65 mln euro ($5.9 mln)  fine imposed by the
European Commission (EC) for fixing prices of  bitumen,  the company said on September 13, 2006.

The fine relates to agreements made between major oil companies and a number of Dutch construction firms in the period 1996-2001. The EC has conducted an investigation into restrictive trade practices in the purchase of  bitumen,  a basic material in asphalt production.

TD
Ballast Nedam announced earlier that the EC was investigating into possible infringements of the competition rules in the past related to the purchase of  bitumen  and that a subsidiary of Ballast Nedam was among the companies involved in the investigation. Now it was unclear whether a  fine would be imposed on Ballast Nedam, neither a provision was taken for that purpose, the company said.

Ballast Nedam sees no reason for a sanction because of participating in a  price-fixing cartel, and certainly not for a  fine of that size. According to the company, the EC's position is based on inaccurate and incomplete information.

Ballast Nedam (  www.ballast-nedam.nl ) will appeal against the EC's decision. The outcome of the appeal is so uncertain that no reliable estimate can be made of a potential  fine, and the company will therefore not make a provision. The builder maintained its earlier profit outlook for 2006.

The European  Commission has imposed a EUR 13.5mn fine on Finnish Neste Oil's Swedish associated company, Nynäs, for participating in asphalt cartel in the Netherlands. Nynäs and 13 other companies agreed on asphalt  bitumen  prices in secret meetings in 1994-2002. The  cartel was led by Shell and KWS.

Neste Oil has a 50% holding in Nynäs. The  fine will decrease Neste Oil's net sales in 2006 by EUR
6.75mn.

HD     CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS : EU FINES 14 COMPANIES FOR ROAD BITUMEN CARTEL WC     402 words

Fines totalling 266.717 million were imposed by the European  Commission on 13 September on eight suppliers and six purchasers of road  bitumen  in the Netherlands. Between 1994and 2002, the companies participated in a  cartel to fix prices in violation of the EC Treaty competition rules' ban on restrictive business practices (Article 81). The high  fines are indicative of the seriousness of the offence, the limited size of the particular market, the length for which the  cartel had been in operation and the size of the companies involved.

Shell's  fine was increased by 50% for having begun the  cartel and for being a repeat offender (several years ago it was found guilty of participating in the polypropylene and PVC(II) cartels), resulting in a total fine of over 100 million. KWS was also heavily targeted for its part in instigating the  cartel (an increase of
50%) and a further 10% for obstructing the enquiry (another 27 million).

TD
Certain companies cooperated during the enquiry and provided the Commission with valuable information on the  cartel. This was rewarded in line with the Commission's Leniency Notice. BP was granted full immunity from a  fine, while Kuwait Petroleum had its fine reduced by 30%.

The bitumen  suppliers (BP, Esha, Klöckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynäs, Shell, Total and Wintershall) and the road construction companies - Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep (now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep), Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin - fixed the gross price of all road pavement bitumen  sold in the Netherlands, and agreed uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies. This  cartel supplied all bitumen  used for road construction in the Netherlands, a market valued around 62 million in 2002.

Enquiries into the existence of similar cartels are also being conducted by the  Commission in Belgium and Spain (the latter having already been sent a statement of objections).

European regulators  fined Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and other companies a total of 267 million euros, $380 million (Canadian), for fixing the price of a petroleum-based road surface material.

Shell, which had its fine increased for being a repeat offender, received the biggest penalty while BP PLC escaped a fine because of its co-operation with the investigation, the European Commission said. The  fines relate to sales of  bitumen,  which is used to make asphalt.

The cartel restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies, the
Brussels-based commission said.

The European
Commission has presented a 10-point programme for action at the national and European level designed to foster innovation as a main asset of the EU economy. The plans will be presented to EU leaders at an informal summit next
month, and form part of the bloc’s continued commitment to the Lisbon
Agenda, aimed at spurring job creation and economic growth.
Without the backing of EU leaders, the Commission strategy would not have to be taken on board and applied. However, the Commission’s zero-tolerance
policy towards companies breaking EU rules and its continued right of initiative in the development of policy are encouraging.
The Commission is likely to continue its enforcement of the bloc’s strict anti-trust regulations. The push towards development of an innovation policy to spur economic growth will be welcomed by leaders at next month’s informal summit, hosted by Finland, a recognised leader in the field.

Focus on Innovation Key to Achieving Competitive Economy—Commission
The European  Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU), yesterday announced a
10-point programme for action at the national and Community level designed to foster innovation as a
main asset of the EU economy. The programme will form the basis for discussions by EU leaders at an
informal summit in Lahti (Finland) next month. The new strategy is part of a broader plan to deliver results
under the EU’s Lisbon Agenda for Jobs and Growth, which aims to make the bloc the world’s most
competitive economy by 2010. If this goal is to be achieved, however, important and widespread
structural reforms are needed in member states. At the presentation of the plans yesterday,  Commission
Vice-President Günther Verheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy, said that, “Europe
needs to become a truly knowledge-based and innovation-friendly society, where innovation is not feared
but welcomed, is not hindered but encouraged“, according to an official statement.
The latest  Commission initiative comes after EU leaders called on the executive to present “a
broad-based innovation strategy for Europe that translates investments in knowledge into products and
services”. In response, the 10-point plan mooted yesterday focuses on the following:
"ZeroTolerance":  Commission Comes Down Hard on Cartels

On the same day that EU competitiveness dominated the  Commission’s innovation policy proposals, the bloc’s executive issued hefty  fines to 14 companies for breaching anti-trust rules, and engaging in decidedly anti-competitive practices. EUBusiness reports that eight suppliers and six road builders had fixed the prices of  bitumen  in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002. These have now been  fined a total of
266.7 million euro (US$338.3 million) for operating the  cartel; energy giant Shell was singled out for its leading role in the  price-fixing. The other suppliers were BP, Esha, Kloeckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynaes, Total and Wintershall, while the construction companies buying the  bitumen  were Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep (which is now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep), Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin (KWS), according to EUBusiness.

Justifying the sanctions, a  Commission statement noted that the operation of such a  cartel "restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road-building companies." Shell received the biggest  fine,
108 million euro (US$137.4 million), because this was not the first time the company had been implicated in such an operation, and because it was responsible for starting the cartel with KWS, which was handed the second-biggest  fine of 27.36 million euro. The European Commission has consistently stated that it will not tolerate practices by companies which violate the bloc’s anti-trust legislation. In June this year, the Commission warned that it would increase the size of  fines on companies found to be in breach of such rules (see Europe: 29 June 2006: ).
Outlook and Implications

Despite the  Commission’s best intentions to boost innovation policy with this 10-point programme, ultimate responsibility for action lies with the individual member states. This initiative is also by no means the first of its kind that the  Commission has attempted to push through, with the most recent having
been in October 2005, when a communication entitled “More Research and Innovation”, comprising 19 actions aimed at putting research and innovation at the centre of EU policies and funding, was mooted. Some leaders have already come out against the creation of a European Institute of Technology, fearing that it would be a waste of resources and would not attract the caliber of students who travel to the United States’ established institutions. At the most banal level, some initiatives fail in Europe purely because members cannot decide where to locate a particular building. Businesses agree, however, that increased investment in research and development will bode well for future EU competitiveness in the high-tech and high-end product sectors, where the EU has a competitive advantage over Asian rivals.

The Commission’s Competition Directorate-General is similarly keen to establish itself as a feared department. Not afraid to go to court over European mergers and acquisitions, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is also adamant that any breach of the bloc’s competition laws, applicable in all 25 member states, will not be tolerated. This is definitely one area in which the  Commission is very active, and indeed successful, in enforcing Community law.

The Competitiveness Council will examine the communication on innovation policy at the end of the month, before leaders discuss the proposals on 20 October.
Establishment of innovation–friendly education systems. Establishment of a European Institute of Technology. Working towards a single labour market for researchers. Strengthening research-industry links.
Fostering regional innovation through the new cohesion policy programmes.
Reforming R&D and innovation state aid rules and providing better guidance for R&D tax incentives. Enhancing intellectual property rights protection (IPR).
Digital products and services—an initiative on copyright levies. Development of a strategy for innovation-friendly "lead markets". Stimulation of innovative practices through procurement.

EC tars and feathers another cartelTHE EUROPEAN Commission has fined 14 companies nearly
?267m ($339m) for participating in a price fixing  cartel of road bitumen  in the Netherlands in its latest
antitrust crackdown.Repeat offender Shell was the hardest hit with a ?108m  fine, which included a 50%
increase under new anticartel rules, but BP, also a repeat  cartel offender, was granted immunity for
blowing the whistle.The  cartel, which was active in the Netherlands between 1994 and 2002, saw
bitumen  suppliers fix a rebate for the six participating Dutch construction companies while raising the
overall price for bitumen,  forcing those outside of the  cartel to pay more in an effort to keep smaller road
building companies from participating in the market.Other chemical companies implicated in the  cartel
include Esha, Klockner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynas, Total and Wintershall along with six Dutch
construction companies.KWS was  fined an extra 10% for refusing to give investigators access

TD
to their premises while Kuwait Petroleum's  fine was cut 30% to just over ?16.5m for its help during the Commission's investigation.Last week's announcement makes the  bitumen  case the seventh-largest cartel fine in EU history.The European  Commission introduced harsher rules against cartels in June this year as part of its mission to crackdown on anticompetitive behavior, especially on repeat offenders."The three main changes - the new entry fee, the link between the  fine and the duration of the infringement,
and the increase for repeat offenders - send three clear signals to companies. Don't break the antitrust rules if you do, stop it as quickly as possible, and once you've stopped, don't do it again," said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.<BR>

ANTITRUST -- BP, Kuwait Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Germany's Wintershall were among
14 firms fined a total of €266.7 million ($339 million) by the European  Commission for operating a road
bitumen  cartel. In a four-year investigation, the  commission found that eight suppliers and six
purchasers of road bitumen  in the Netherlands participated in a  price-fixing cartel from 1994 to 2002 in
violation of European competition rules. The companies agreed uniform minimum rebates for the
construction companies that were  cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road
builders. The  commission imposed relatively high fines on Shell and construction firm KWS as they were
found to have instigated and led the cartel. Shell's fine was increased to €108 million for being a repeat
offender, while KWS incurred a higher fine for trying to obstruct the investigation.

TD
BP's  fine was waived due to its collaboration with the commission, while Kuwait Petroleum had its  fine
reduced by 30%. Shell and Kuwait Petroleum were fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in
2005 for gasoline  price-fixing in those countries

(Adds Aalberts, IMI, Delta reaction, updates shares)

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Europe's top antitrust authority slapped a 314.7 million euro ($398.4 million) fine on 30 companies for taking part in a copper fittings  cartel, the fifth-biggest penalty ever imposed by EU competition watchdogs.

TD
Aalberts of the Netherlands received about a third of the total penalty, which was announced on Wednesday. The company was  fined 100.8 million euros -- almost double its first-half net profit of 51 million euros.

Shares in Aalberts sank 8 percent to 57.75 euros in Amsterdam. It said it did not plan to take a provision for the fine as it was investigating whether to appeal.

The 30 companies belong to the groups IMI , Delta , Advanced Fluid Connections , Legris, Frabo, Mueller , Tomkins , Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer as well as Aalberts, the European Commission said.

Britain's IMI and Delta were  fined 48.3 million euros and 28.3 million respectively. Germany's Viegener was fined 54.3 million euros and Legris of France 46.8 million.
Shares in Tomkins were down 1.2 percent at 238 pence after hitting their lowest for the year. IMI and
Delta were flat.

The Commission said in a statement its investigation had found that companies had met in Paris to discuss prices and had uncovered scribbled notes by British competitors signalling price rises using a specific code for each company.

The cartel took place between 1988 and 2004, with price lists agreed for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Britain, Portugal and Sweden.

Some of the companies had continued with the cartel or had given misleading information to Brussels after it began probing the industry, resulting in their fines being increased, the  Commission said.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Copper fittings are used in tubes for plumbing, heating and sanitation and their prices were higher because of the  cartel.
Mueller had its fine waived for blowing the whistle on the scheme.

The EU executive increased the  fines for Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris by 60 percent because they had continued their illegal arrangements after the  Commission's initial inspections.

The fine for Advanced Fluid Connections was raised by a further 50 percent for providing misleading information, the  Commission said.

IMI owned Aquatis France and Simplex Armaturen, which were  fined a total of 2 million euros, during part of the  cartel period, but sold them in 2002. The British engineering firm said it may appeal against its fine.

Delta said the  fine was payable within three months and could be met from its cash resources, though the group might appeal.

The move came just a week after the  Commission fined 14 companies a total of 266.7 million euros, including a 108 million euro penalty for Shell , for fixing prices of road surface material  bitumen  in the Netherlands.

HD        Survey reveals an industry rife with dodgy deals

CORRUPTION

A survey by the Chartered Institute of Building reveals a range of attitudes within the industry to what corruption is and what the response should be. But companies which turn a blind eye to it could be storing up severe problems for the future, warns Emma Crates

TD
PICTURE the following scene. You are out having a beer with a colleague who works for a subcontractor.

The subcontractor is desperate to secure more work with your company. Your colleague says that he can get you free tickets for the European Champions League Final.

Nothing more needs to be said. It is, of course, a generous gift. Many would accept it without hesitation. But there may also be an unspoken assumption that if he gives you the coveted tickets, you may send more work his way.

Is this a corrupt practice? Many in the industry would find the scenario familiar. Some may accept it as the way business has always been done. But it is a small example of the way relationships can become increasingly blurred, paving the way for fraud and corruption on a wider scale.
Corruption, by it's covert nature, is difficult to measure. But that has not stopped people having a go. The World Bank estimates that, in Great Britain alone, fraud and corruption costs the construction
industry up to £3 billion annually. So, for an industry now topping £100 billion, that works out at 3 pence
in every pound spent.

The fraud that we know about is hitting the headlines with increasing frequency. Only last week The Eu ropean Commission fined 14 companies, including Shell and Total, that had taken part in a road bitumen  price-fixing cartel that lasted for eight years in the Netherlands.

As this piece is being written the Office of Fair Trading is investigating alleged price-fixing among construction employment agencies. In March 2005 it smashed its second roofing cartel in a year and has pledged to clamp down on shady activities in the construction sector.

If a new survey by the Chartered Institute of Building is any thing to go by, £3 billion could be a conservative estimate. The CIOB launched an on-line inquiry with its members which set about examining common perceptions about corrupt practice.

Within seven days 1,404 members had replied - the highest number of responses that the CIOB had ever received. And they were not just ticking boxes; they were also writing reams in the "do you have anything to add?" section at the end. It was clear there were issues that people needed to get off their chests.

"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about this. Hopefully one day they will get caught, " wrote one respondent, echoing the sentiments of many.

Page 78 of 103 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"As an honourable man, I do not work for clients who prove to be unethical. Over the years this has cost me a lot of work, but at least I am widely respected for my stance, " wrote another.

Depressingly, half of the respondents thought that corruption was either extremely common or fairly common in the construction industry, and just over a third had come across  cartel activity in the UK.

The level of crime was also at a significant financial level in some companies, with 17 per cent of respondents believing that corruption had cost their company more than £100,000 in year.

And - a statistic to provide further food for thought for investigators - only one third of all the corruption detected was reported to the police.
But what emerged was also illuminating in terms of attitudes to the greyer end of doing business. "Corruption has changed due to tighter accounting practices, " wrote one respondent. "Brown envelopes
no longer exist. Rather there are paid-for trips and events, even video cameras, which can be written off
for tax purposes. All of which are used to sway decisions when awarding contracts."

Possibly the most shocking figure to come out of the survey was whether respondents had personally been offered bribes. Out of the 1,404 respondents, who represented a wide range of levels and disciplines and ages, 575 admitted that they had been offered a bribe at some time in their career. And
23 per cent of all respondents said that this had happened on more than one occasion. The survey did not inquire as to whether any of the bribes had been taken up.

"The majority of respondents recognised what corruption was and how it can manifest itself. But what is concerning is the level of tolerance to particular corrupt practices, " says CIOB deputy chief executive Michael Brown.

There is, he adds, some confusion within the changing definitions of corruption. A number of working practices that were seen as 'standard' in the past are now seen as corrupt. Take cover pricing, which
can occur when a company is invited to tender for a project, does not wish to win it, but does not want to lose the client's goodwill, either. The contractor may check his quote with other rivals on the list, then deliberately put in a higher bid. This obviously distorts the market place for fair pricing.

"Cover pricing is now under serious scrutiny, not just from industry but from the Office of Fair Trading, " comments Mr Brown .

Several respondents to the survey wrote about senior managers leaking quotations to other companies. But in the survey only 18 per cent of respondents defined cover pricing as "very corrupt".
A far larger number - 45 per cent -regarded it as a moderately corrupt activity.

However, 56 per cent thought that using bribery to obtain planning permission was 'very corrupt', and a similar number agreed the same on concealing bribes.

But Jonathan Hook, global engineering and construction leader with Pricewaterhouse Coopers warns: "Anything that would involve paying bribes is corrupt. It's dangerous to go down the route of 'moderately corrupt'. Companies have to get the message across that the little stuff is not acceptable."

A lso with paperwork such as invoices and t ime sheets there seemed to be a blurring of what was seen as negotiation and corrupt practice.
"Start high because you will always be knocked down' in some quarters is a motto, " comments Mr
Brown.

Adding false extra costs to an invoice was seen by 39 per cent of respondents as moderately corrupt. But nearly one-fifth of those who replied described it as either "not very" or "not at all" corrupt.

Aside from the varying attitudes to economic crime, one strong theme that came out of the survey is that respondents were not clear what they should do if they discovered corruption. For example, there were anecdotes of colleagues noticing site managers stealing from sites "by the vanload" and covering their tracks by falsely claiming loss, damage or incorrect delivery of goods. Many had got away with the pract ice for years.
There was a strong body of opinion - three-quarters of everyone questioned - who thought that the
Government was not doing enough to tackle the problem.

But Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, says that, aside from ministers setting a better example, there may not be much more that the Government could do.

"The laws are quite tight any way. Whether they can regulate and legislate for this is another matter, " he argues. But he agrees there is a need for more education on whistleblowing.
"The research seems to indicate that people are identifying corruption and keeping quiet about it. Smaller companies could well be worried that if they blow the whistle it could be the end of their
businesses.

"Rather than Government intervention, the best proposition would be a self-regulating agency for the industry. And if the CIOB initiative leads anywhere - it should lead to guidance and advice on where people d raw the line, " he comments.

HD     CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS : EU FINES 14 COMPANIES FOR ROAD BITUMEN CARTEL WC     402 words

Fines totalling €266.717 million were imposed by the European  Commission on 13 September on eight suppliers and six purchasers of road  bitumen  in the Netherlands. Between 1994and 2002, the companies participated in a  cartel to fix prices in violation of the EC Treaty competition rules' ban on restrictive business practices (Article 81). The high  fines are indicative of the seriousness of the offence, the limited size of the particular market, the length for which the  cartel had been in operation and the size of the companies involved.

Shell's  fine was increased by 50% for having begun the  cartel and for being a repeat offender (several years ago it was found guilty of participating in the polypropylene and PVC(II) cartels), resulting in a total fine of over €100 million. KWS was also heavily targeted for its part in instigating the  cartel (an increase of 50%) and a further 10% for obstructing the enquiry (another €27 million).

TD
Certain companies cooperated during the enquiry and provided the Commission with valuable information on the  cartel. This was rewarded in line with the Commission's Leniency Notice. BP was granted full immunity from a  fine, while Kuwait Petroleum had its fine reduced by 30%.

The bitumen  suppliers (BP, Esha, Klöckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynäs, Shell, Total and Wintershall) and the road construction companies - Ballast Nedam, Dura Vermeer, Heijmans, Hollandsche Beton Groep (now part of Koninklijke BAM Groep), Koninklijke BAM Groep and Koninklijke Volker Wessels Stevin - fixed the gross price of all road pavement bitumen  sold in the Netherlands, and agreed uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. This restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller road building companies. This  cartel supplied all bitumen  used for road construction in the Netherlands, a market valued around €62 million in 2002.

Enquiries into the existence of similar cartels are also being conducted by the  Commission in Belgium and Spain (the latter having already been sent a statement of objections).

HD      EU seeks to attract  more cartel whistleblowers

BRUSSELS, Sept 29, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Union on Friday proposed new measures aimed at attracting whistleblowers within trade cartels, and to streamline the national and bloc-wide systems used to break them up.

TD
Under the new system, which the European  Commission hopes will be in place by the end of the year, companies offering sufficient information to bring about dawn raids and a legal investigation will obtain full immunity from prosecution.

The scheme, in the form of proposed amendments to the existing 'leniency programme', will set up a kind of hurdle race for potential whistleblowers.

The first company to provide the key "threshold" information will get the gold medal of full immunity, with those providing a lesser help merely receiving lower  fines when a cartel court case is held.

Such leniency has been "a very effective tool" since the first EU system was introduced ten years ago, said EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd.

"It is difficult for the  Commission to be sure of the presence of these cartels unless there is a whistleblower," he added.
While the EU is seeking to refine its rules on treating the whistleblowers, national representatives of the
25 EU members were also meeting in Brussels on Friday to agree a model national programme as close
as possible to the  Commission's programme.
Since the current EU whistleblower leniency rules were introduced in 2002 until the end of last year, the
Commission has granted 51 conditional immunities.

So far the information received has led to five formal  cartel cases, which have led to a total of more than one billion dollars in fines.
In its latest successful  cartel case, the European Commission earlier this month fined 14 firms a total of
266.7 million euros (338.3 million dollars) for operating a cartel in the Dutch road bitumen  market, with
energy giant Shell singled out for its leading role.
Interested parties have until October 27 to comment on the proposals before they are adopted by the
Commission.

The European  Commission has fined 8 suppliers and 6 purchasers of road  bitumen  in the Netherlands a total of €266.717 million ($337.4 million) for operating a  price fixing cartel from 1994-2002 in violation of EU competition rules. Amongst those  fined were oil companies Shell, BP and Total. Other oil companies hit with penalties were Esha, Klöckner  Bitumen,  Kuwait Petroleum, Nynäs, and Wintershall.

The companies were convicted of fixing the gross price of all road pavement  bitumen  sold in the Netherlands, and agreeing uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were  cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. From at least 1994-2002, a delegation of  bitumen  suppliers met with the six biggest road construction companies in the Netherlands in a series of meetings, called the "bitumen  consultation." The  Commission found that the  cartel restricted price competition and disadvantaged smaller companies.

TD
The participating construction companies appeared not to be concerned about the absolute price of the bitumen,  so long as they received larger discounts than their smaller competitors. This caused the price of bitumen  in the Netherlands, even after the discounts granted to the large road builders, gradually to rise above that in neighboring countries. All  cartel members, both suppliers and buyers, therefore had an interest in participating in the  cartel.

BP applied for immunity from  fines in June 2002, sparking the investigation, and owing to the company's cooperation, it has escaped all penalty. Shell and purchaser KWS, however, had their  fines increased by
50% as they began and led the  cartel. Shell's  fine was also raised for being a repeat offender, while KWS's  fine was increased for trying to obstruct the Commission's investigation. The case was restricted to activities in the Netherlands. Despite Commission inspections in five other EU member states, it
could not be established that the  cartel formed part of a larger collusion.

BP, Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC), Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Germany's Wintershall are among 14 firms fined a total of €266.7 million ($339 million) by the European  Commission for operating a road bitumen  cartel. In a four-year investigation, the  commission found that eight suppliers and six purchasers of road bitumen  in the Netherlands participated in a  price-fixing cartel from 1994 to 2002 in violation of European competition rules.

The companies agreed to uniform minimum rebates for the construction companies that were  cartel members, and a smaller maximum rebate for all other road builders. The  commission imposed relatively high fines on Shell and construction firm KWS as they were found to have instigated and led the  cartel. BP's fine was waived due to its collaboration with the  commission, while KPC had its  fine reduced.

TD
Shell and KPC had been fined by regulators in Italy in 2000 and Sweden in 2005 for gasoline price fixing.
