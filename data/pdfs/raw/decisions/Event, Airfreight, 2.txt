BRITISH  AIRWAYS, Air France-KLM and nine other  airlines  were fined €779m (£672m) for fixing  air
cargo prices between 1999 and 2006.

TD
Lufthansa of Germany and its subsidiary, Swiss, escaped penalties for bringing the  cartel to the attention of the European Commission. BA was  fined €104m, while Air France-KLM, along with subsidiary Martinair, was fined €340m - the biggest in the case. Singapore  Airlines, SAS, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile,  Air Canada and Luxembourg-based Cargolux  Airlines were also ordered to pay penalties.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  co-ordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," said the EU competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia said. "The commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behaviour."

Air New Zealand has escaped being  fined by the European Commission, investigating price fixing of cargo by airlines  in the European Economic Area.
The EC has dropped the case against a number of  airlines,  including Air New Zealand. But it has imposed a total of $1.4 billion of  fines on 11 airlines  for operating as a  cartel. Qantas was imposed the least  fine at over $15.7 million.
The heftiest  fines were imposed on Air France-KLM at almost half a billion dollars and British  Airways
over $184 million.

Air New Zealand says this brings closure to one more part of the ongoing investigations and proceedings which commenced in February 2006.

TOSHIBA
Electronics Firm Remains

TD
Cautious Despite Net Surge

Toshiba Corp. enjoyed a surge in net profit as electronics makers race to grab a piece of the burgeoning market for smartphones and tablet computers that use the flash-memory chips the Japanese company makes.

Yet Toshiba remained cautious despite the solid earnings, leaving its full-year outlook unchanged, citing a challenging foreign-exchange environment that threatens Japan's economy.

Toshiba, which also makes consumer electronics and nuclear power plants, on Tuesday posted a fiscal second-quarter net profit of 27.35 billion yen ($336.8 million) compared with a profit of 94 million yen in the same period a year earlier.

Operating profit surged to 71.02 billion yen from 36.46 billion yen. Revenue rose 3% to 1.630 trillion yen from 1.583 trillion yen.

EU Fines 11 Carriers
$1.11 Billion in  Cartel Case

The European Union's antitrust body on Tuesday  fined 11 airlines  a total of 799 million  euros ($1.11 billion) for forming a global  cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France-KLM SA received the largest fine with 340 million  euros, including the three different carriers that are now part of the group -- Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC was fined 104 million euros. Other airlines  fined include Singapore Airlines Ltd.,  fined
74.8 million euros; Qantas  Airways  Ltd., 8.8 million euros; Cathay Pacific Airways  Ltd., 57.1 million
euros; and Japan Airlines International Co., 35.7 million euros.

The EU also  fined Scandinavian airlineSAS AB 70.2 million  euros; LAN Chile, 8.2 million  euros; Luxembourg-based Cargolux, 79.9 million  euros; and Air Canada, 21 million  euros.

The European Commission said the airlines  colluded on some surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006.

Packer, Murdoch to Join
Broadcaster's Board

Ten Network Holdings Ltd. has made peace with James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch, saying Tuesday that the businessmen have accepted its offer to join the free-to-air broadcaster's board.

As foreshadowed by Ten last week, Chairman Nick Falloon said that he will leave the company following its annual shareholder meeting in December. Ten wouldn't comment on a successor. A spokeswoman said the issue is "a matter for the board."

Mr. Murdoch, a nonexecutive director of News Corp., said he is looking forward to "working collaboratively with the company on its multichannel strategies and working with the other directors to grow value for all of the company's shareholders."
News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal.

Chinese Video Site Files
For U.S. Public Offering

Tudou Holdings Ltd., one of the largest Chinese online video companies, filed plans for an initial public offering in the U.S., giving a first glimpse into the finances of China's highly competitive online video sector.

Tudou operates a website similar to Google Inc.'s YouTube, allowing users to watch streaming video and to upload their own content. But unlike YouTube, the bulk of Tudou's videos are of licensed professional content such as Chinese-language television shows. YouTube, which also offers some content from large media companies, is blocked in China.

The Shanghai-based company reported in Monday's prospectus that it was still operating at a loss as of September, but that losses shrank to 83.7 million yuan ($12.5 million) in the first nine months of this year, or roughly 17% less than the same period in 2009. Tudou, which has raised a total of $135 million in funding since its website went live in 2005, hopes to list American depository shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

DEAN FOODS
Dairy Company's Profit Hit
As Milk Sales Decline

The head of Dean Foods Co. said U.S. consumers are cutting spending on food staples such as milk despite retailers' deep discounting and spilling profits at the nation's largest dairy company by revenue.

Overall U.S. fluid milk sales fell 1.6% year-on-year in the third quarter despite promotion by stores, and retail sales dropped 4%.

The Dallas-based company reported a profit of $24.3 million in the three months to Sept. 30, compared with $49.7 million a year earlier. Earnings-per-share declined to 13 cents from 27 cents.

Revenue increased to $3.1 billion from $2.8 billion in the quarter as Dean managed to pass through some of the higher commodity costs -- notably butterfat prices.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 10 -- The European Commission has imposed fines on 11 airlines,  including Japan Airlines Corp., for operating a global cargo cartel for more than six years to the detriment of businesses in the European Union.

JAL was fined 35.7 million euros while Air France-KLM was ordered to pay 310.08 million  euros, the biggest of the fines slapped on the carriers for fixing prices on international cargo shipments between December 1999 and February 2006.

TD
Among the other airlines  involved are British  Airways,  which must pay 104.04 million euros, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and  Air Canada. Lufthansa, which reported the cartel to the European Commission, was not fined. The fines amounted to 799.44 million euros in total.

The commission, the EU's competition watchdog, said the  airlines  ''co-ordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts,'' harming consumers in the common market.

The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 18  airlines  over the cargo cartel following its own investigation.

HD      EU Fines Airlines over Cargo Cartel

The European Commission has fined 11 international  airlines  around 800 million euro (US$1.1 billion) for fixing the price of air cargo between 1999 and 2006. A lengthy investigation by European, U.S., and Asian regulators has uncovered evidence of close co-ordination between  airlines  on surcharges for fuel and security. According to the  European Commission, the fixing of fuel surcharges began in 1999 and was later expanded to include a security surcharge. The carriers had been in close contact so as to ensure that international  air cargo carriers were able to co-ordinate the two flat-rate surcharges per kilogram for all freight items. The three worst offenders were  Air France-KLM, British  Airways,  and Luxembourg's Cargolux Airlines. Air France-KLM, which also owns Martinair, received the largest single penalty of 340 million euro. Other airlines  fined for involvement in the  cartel include Singapore  Airlines, Air Canada, Quantas, LAN Chile, Martinair, and Japan  Airlines.

TD
However, the German carrier Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss  Air avoided a fine on the grounds that they had alerted the authorities to the existence of the cartel.Significance: The fine issued by the Commission is one of the largest ever imposed by the European Union (EU). Under the EU's strict competition law, almost all forms of  cartel or price-fixing among competitors are banned. Although it was permissible for the  airlines  to levy the surcharges, under EU competition law a surcharge must become subject to market competition, which the fuel and security surcharges had not. The  European                    Commission believes that had it not intervened in 2006, the  cartel would have continued unabated, with serious financial ramifications for both  European businesses and consumers. In the United States a similar case has been brought. The U.S. Department of Justice has already  fined 18 airlines  within the cargo cartel a total of US$1.6 billion. The latest action by the EU will also act as a legal precedent for several similar legal moves by European companies against the offending  airlines.  The Swedish telecoms firm Ericsson and the Dutch electronics company Philips are spearheading a legal case on behalf of a number of European companies against Air France-KLM for the sum of 400 million  euro. The European Commission is hoping that the substantial fines will send a clear signal that  cartel activity is not tolerated within the EU.

The European Commission has dropped a case against  Air New Zealand alleging anti-competitive conduct but 11 other airlines  have been fined 799.4 million ($1.4 billion) for being part of a freight cartel.

Over a period of seven years, from 1999 to 2006,  airlines  including Air France-KLM, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and British  Airways  operated a worldwide  cartel that affected the price of  air freight services.

TD
Commission vice-president for competition policy Joaquin Almunia said the  cartel would have continued operating had the  commission not started its investigation.

Air New Zealand welcomed the news it had been dropped from the  commission's list. A spokesman said the airline had always maintained its innocence and therefore was confident, and not surprised, the fine was dropped.

Almunia said the  cartel harmed companies and consumers in  Europe and if the  commission had not stopped it, the price hikes would have continued through the economic downturn until today. The commission's investigation showed that the  airlines  had discussed the surcharge it would impose, such as fuel increases, among themselves during alliance meetings. The surcharge was boosted after
9/11 to include inflated security charges.

``The fact that fuel prices were increasing or that security costs rose after the 2001 terrorist attacks, is not an acceptable reason to stop competing against each other. If companies costs' increase it's normal that their prices also increase. But companies cannot collude to fix the price for customers as this ultimately harms not only the latter but also the end consumers.''

German airlineLufthansa also did not receive a  fine as it was the first to inform the  commission about the cartel.

Air France-KLM has to pay 310.1 million, while British  Airways  was fined 104 million. Air France-KLM will also have to pay the 29.5 million  fine for Martinair, which it now owns.  Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas will have to pay  fines between 8.2 million and 79.9 million. Cathay Pacific said it was evaluating its options with regard to a
57.12 million fine. The commission dropped charges against 11 other carriers, including  Air NZ, and one consultancy, because it couldn't prove they participated in the  cartel.

Almunia said it was important to clarify that the  commission supported the consolidation of the industry as long as it did not create monopolies or excessive market power.

``We have approved numerous mergers and alliances in the sector. But the existence of an alliance agreement cannot give a blank cheque for naked price co-ordination among the members.''

Air NZ faces proceedings from the Commerce  Commission over its alleged involved in a freight
cartel. This case is currently before the High Court.

The US Justice Department has charged 18  airlines  and several executives in its investigation of the cargo cartel and imposed more than US$1.6 billion in  fines. - additional reporting AP

HD     Boersen-Zeitung: Lufthansa's Swiss Air avoids EU fine for price fixing

The European Commission (EC) has fined 11 airlines  for setting up a price fixing  cartel but German
Lufthansa and its subsidiary Swiss  Air will avoid punishment because they blew the whistle on the  cartel.

Franco-Dutch  Air France-KLM will pay the most with EUR 310 million. British Airways  has been fined EUR 104 million, Luxembourg-based Cargolux- EUR 79 million, Singapore Airlines – EUR 75 million, Hong-Kong-based Cathaway Pacific – EUR 57 million.  Fines have been also slapped on Japan  Airlines, Dutch Martinair,  Air Canada, Australian Qantas and Lan Chile.

TD
Almost all  airlines  have had their fines cut because of their co-operation with the EC. The authority is willing to reduce them further because not all of the airlines  participated in the  cartel during all six years and have not generated their entire revenues in Europe.

HD               SIA Cargo to contest  $134m fine

LP
SINGAPORE Airlines' freighter arm is to appeal against a €74.8 million (S$134 million)  fine
imposed on it by the European Commission for alleged price-fixing.

On Tuesday, the European Commission fined 11 airlines  a total of €799.5 million for their participation in what was said to be an air cargo cartel.

TD
SIA, Japan  Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Qantas,  Air Canada, Air France/KLM and British  Airways were among those accused of fixing fuel and security surcharges over a period of more than six years.

These charges are usually payable by freight forwarders who book cargo space on  aircraft  and shippers that transport goods.

Such moves to fix prices is anti-competitive and against the principles of a free market, the authorities said.

The Commission's vice-president for competition Joaquin Almunia said in a statement: 'It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers...With today's decision, the  Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behaviour.'

In a statement yesterday, SIA Cargo said it would study the grounds of the decision when full details were available.

'Singapore  Airlines Cargo strongly contests, however, any suggestion that it has been involved in a global conspiracy to fix surcharges or rates.'

Air France/KLM,  Air Canada and Cathay have also expressed unhappiness with the decision.
At a briefing for reporters and analysts yesterday, a day after the  airline announced its
second-quarter results, SIA chief executive Chew Choon Seng stressed: 'We have consistently
maintained that we have never indulged in anti-competition conduct so it is disappointing that they
have included us in the roll call.'

The European Commission's probe is part of a global investigation that started more than four years ago.

Anti-trust watchdogs in several countries including the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have made similar allegations against the carriers and in some cases,  fines have been imposed.

In Australia, for example, at least six of the carriers being investigated have already agreed to pay penalties totalling more than A$40 million (S$52 million).
They include Qantas which was  fined A$20 million, as well as British  Airways  and Martinair
Holland, which paid A$5 million each.

Page 16 of 61 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the US, British  Airways  and Korean Air each paid US$300 million in criminal  fines in 2007, while
Air France/KLM agreed to a US$87 million US civil antitrust claims settlement earlier this year.
SIA Cargo firmly denies all related allegations and has not paid any  fines.
But it has made a provision of about $134 million - the  fine imposed by the European Commission
- in its financial statements for the current financial year that ends March 31, in the event that its
appeal is not successful.

SINGAPORE — Singapore  Airlines said its cargo unit is likely to appeal against a ruling by the
European Commission that it was involved in a price-fixing case involving several carriers.
Analysts said this incident is unlikely to have a big impact on the group’s financial performance.

TD
SIA’s cargo handling unit and 10 other  airlines  face a combined $1.4-billion  fine.

Along with  Air France-KLM, British  Airways  and Qantas, SIA Cargo is being taken to task for allegedly taking part in an  air-freight cartel.
This allegedly involved coordinating surcharges for fuel and security over a six-year period until
February 2006.

“We have constantly maintained we have never indulged in anti-competition conduct, so it is disappointing that they have included us in the roll call, so we will indeed lodge an appeal against it,” said SIA chief executive officer Chew Choon Seng.
SIA said it will provide about $134 million for the  fine it faces.

While the incident is not expected to have a big impact on SIA’s bottomline, analysts say it may dampen shareholder sentiment in the short term. On Wednesday, SIA shares fell 1.23 per cent to
$16.12.
But there may be reason for shareholders to cheer in the second half of the year.

SIA said there is room for yields to improve, which are currently about 5 per cent below pre-crisis levels.

“Our forward bookings show premium yield will show steady increase,” Mr Chew said. “It should keep up or exceed what we saw in the first half,” he said.

SIA said the recent slide in the US dollar has helped the  airline because it spends more in US currency than it earns.

Announcing financial results for its second quarter on Tuesday, SIA reported interim dividend of 20 cents, raising speculation that total payout might match pre-crisis levels of $1. But SIA said interim dividends are not a reliable gauge because its profit position was much stronger before the financial crisis.

Analysts are now projecting total dividends for the current financial year at 50 cents a share, half the pre-crisis level.

Section: Business News - The European Commission on Tuesday fined 11 air cargo carriers, including
Air France-KLM and British Airways,  a total of 799 million  euros (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) for price fixing
in cargo services.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," said Joaquin Almunia,  commission vice president in charge of competition.

TD
The 11 carriers fined by the commission were Air Canada, Air France-KLM, British  Airways,  Cathay
Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Martinair, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas.

Germany's Lufthansa, which also participated in the price-fixing  cartel, received full immunity from penalty because it was the first to provide information about the  cartel.

The commission found that the carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over six years, from December 1999 to February 2006.

The cartel arrangements consisted of numerous contacts between  airlines,  at both bilateral and multilateral level, covering flights from, to and within  Europe.

Air France-KLM was hit with the biggest sum of  fine, which amounted to 183 million euros (255 million U.S. dollars), while British  Airways  came in second, facing a  fine of 104 million euros (145 million U.S. dollars).
"With today's decision the  commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel
behavior," Almunia said. - PNA

WSJ 08/11/2010. The European Commission is likely to fine several airlines  this week, ending investigations into an alleged global cartel in air freight transport which dragged on years, three people familiar with the case say. The commission could fine airlines,  including two of the largest  European ones such as Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) and British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN), a total of hundreds of millions of euros for colluding in setting surcharges, mainly a fuel surcharge, for their cargo operations. In what is truly a global case, many countries around the world, from South Africa to New Zealand, have been investigating issues related to price fixing in  air cargo. In the US, total fines of more than $1.5bn were levied against  airlines  that admitted fixing fuel surcharges. Eighteen airlines  have been charged.

TD
In Europe, the commission can fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global revenue, though penalties tend to be much smaller and reflect the length of the offense and the size of the market affected. More ...  http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101108-712540.html

The fines Qantas has received for taking part in a global  air freight  cartel have now topped more than $100 million after the  European regulator finally dished out its penalty.
In the latest chapter in the unravelling of the  cartel, the European Commission has fined Qantas
€8.8 million ($12.1 million) as part of penalties totalling €800 million imposed on 11 airlines.

TD
The other  airlines  include Singapore  Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Despite the  fine and the grounding of its A380 fleet, shares in Qantas broke a three-day losing streak yesterday, closing up
5¢ at $2.80. The  fine was lighter than investors and the  airline had expected.

Qantas had set aside $31 million for potential penalties.  Air France-KLM received the biggest  fine of €310 million, while British  Airways  was fined €104 million, Singapore  Airlines €74.8 million and Cathay Pacific €57 million.
Qantas had previously told the Australian regulator it expected a “very substantial penalty” in
Europe.
However, it and LAN Chile (€8.2 million) received the smallest  fines.

The European Commission’s vice-president for competition, Joaquin Almunia, said the EC would not tolerate cartel behaviour.
“It is deplorable that so many  airlines  co-ordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European
businesses and European consumers,” he said.

Qantas said in a statement that it “acknowledged the improper conduct” by its freight division and had “co-operated fully” with  European authorities and other regulators.

Air New Zealand trumpeted the decision as a “positive verdict”. It was one of 11  airlines  against which the European authorities dropped charges.

In 2007 Qantas was ordered to pay a $US61 million criminal  fine in the US after it pleaded guilty to illegally fixing air cargo rates. A year later it was  fined $20 million by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
It still faces class actions in Australia and the US.

0028 GMT [Dow Jones] Malaysian  Airline  System (3786.KU) may rise to MYR2.18 (10-day moving average) vs yesterday's close at MYR2.16 (+0.5%), says dealer; this after national carrier, in filing to stock exchange, says EU terminates proceedings against MAS, cargo unit MASkargo on possible infringement of  European competition laws in cartel case to fix air-freight tariffs. "As a result, neither MAS nor MASkargo has been  fined by the European Commission," national carrier says. On Tuesday, EU fined 11 other airlines  total of EUR799 million in antitrust investigation started in 2006. "This is the
one of the largest fines ever imposed by the EU antitrust body...there will be some relief that MAS wasn't fined when many other regional  airlines  like Singapore Airlines (C6L.SG) and Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) have been slapped with hefty penalties," says dealer. Air France KLM (AF.FR) received biggest  fine of EUR340 million, while British  Airways  (BAY.LN) fined EUR104 million.

KUALA LUMPUR (Dow Jones)--Malaysian  Airline  System Bhd. (3786.KU) said Thursday that the European Commission has dropped its charges against the  airline and its unit MASkargo in an  air cargo cartel case and that it isn't subject to any  fine.

"MAS and its group companies have a policy of compliance with all applicable laws, including competition laws, in their countries of operation," the company said in a statement.

This comes after Thai  Airways  International PCL (THAI.TH) said Wednesday that it had been cleared of air cargo cartel charges by the European Commission.

The Commission on Tuesday fined 11 airlines  a total of EUR799 million for forming a global  cartel to fix air-freight tariffs, mainly fuel surcharges, ending an investigation that dragged on for years with the fourth-largest  fine in a cartel case.

Air France KLM SA (AF.FR) received the biggest fine with EUR340 million, including the three different airlines  that are now part of the group--Air France, KLM and Netherlands-based Martinair. British Airways  PLC (BAY.LN) was  fined EUR104 million.

(ADPnews) - Nov 11, 2010 - The French government criticised the  European Commission for the hefty fine imposed on Franco-Dutch airlineAir France-KLM (EPA:AF).

On Tuesday, Brussels announced a  fine of EUR 310 million (USD 425m) on Air France-KLM for cargo price-fixing. The cartel case concerned 11 airlines,  which have to pay a fine of EUR 798.82 million in total. British Airways  (LON:BAY) will pay EUR 104 million.

TD
Following the announcement, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau said that just like
Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo, he was shocked by the amount of the  fine.

Secretary of State for  European Affairs Pierre Lellouche also said that the  fine is equal to the price for two Airbus  A380 and will have a negative effect on the French  air transport sector. He recalled the losses in the sector recorded in 2009 amid the economic crisis. Therefore, Lellouche defined the  fine as "disproportionate" and "discriminatory".

The ACCC warns that executives can now be jailed for collusion

EXECUTIVES face up to 10 years jail if they engage in the kind of anti-competitive conduct that has seen Qantas  fined more than

TD
$12 million by European regulators, ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel has warned.
Mr Samuel said yesterday that a $1 billion  fine levied against airlines  by the European Commission
for fixing  air cargo prices was a reminder of the price of collusion, which now included jail.

``You'd have to be a really stupid executive to be involved in  cartel activity after July last year,'' Mr Samuel told the ABC. ``What we've got here is, in a sense, a double problem that's occurred for the airlines  involved. One is: they've had to pay significant penalties. The second is: serious reputational damage.''
Despite Mr Samuel's stern warning, the penalty against Qantas was below expectations.

The airline set aside $31m for potential penalties in  Europe, as well as the yet to be resolved regulatory action in New Zealand, and there had been speculation the  fine would be in the tens of millions of dollars.

Instead, the $12.3m  fine was the second-lowest of the penalties levied against the 11  airlines  and only a fraction of the $425.6m levied against  Air France-KLM.

But the  airlines'  collective conduct was savaged by EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia. Mr Almunia said the price-fixing began with co-ordination of a fuel surcharge and was extended after
9/11 to cover a security charge as well as a refusal to pay  commission on those surcharges to freight forwarders.

``The fact that fuel prices were increasing or security costs rose after the 2001 terrorist attacks is not an acceptable reason to stop competing with each other,'' Mr Almunia said. ``Had it not been for the commission's intervention, the  cartel would not have ended in 2006 and more than likely it would have continued through the economic downturn, creating even more harm to companies and consumers.''

Qantas's  European penalty comes in addition to a $20m  fine slapped on it by the ACCC in 2008 and a $US61m penalty from US regulators a year earlier. A US-based Qantas executive, Bruce
McCaffrey, was sentenced last year to six months' jail and  fined $US20,000 for his part in the freight price-fixing cartel.

Two other employees excluded from the US plea bargain have not been charged and both deny involvement.
Qantas said last night that it was still looking at the  European decision.

HD       E.U. fines 11 airlines  over cartel pricing

The European Commission has fined 11 airlines  and air carriers a total of €799.5 million for participating in an air cargo cartel.

The commission handed Air France the highest  fine, €182.9 million, or about $253 million, for its involvement in a cartel that lasted from late 1999 until 2006 and that E.U. officials said had raised prices for businesses that shipped goods.

TD
Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, said Tuesday that the  airlines  had colluded over surcharges for fuel and security during a particularly difficult period for the industry after the terrorist attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.
He said that could not be an excuse for their activity.

‘‘The fact that fuel prices were increasing or that security costs rose after the 2001 terrorist attacks is not an acceptable reason to stop competing against each other,’’ Mr. Almunia said. ‘‘The companies always had an alternative’’ to collusion, despite the difficulties created by the regulatory and economic environment, he said. He said he had rejected pleas for additional reductions by five  airlines,  which argued that they were unable to pay because the size of the  fines would put them out of business.
Such reductions ‘‘will remain the exception rather than the rule,’’ he said.

The Dutch carrier KLM received the second-highest  fine, €127.2 million, while Martinair was  fined €29.5 million. That brought the total charge for the  Air France-KLM Group to €339.6 million.

Air France said it ‘‘considers that the level of the  fines is disproportionate’’ as ‘‘the actions in question had no detrimental effect on the freight shippers nor the freight forwarders.’’
The airline said it would appeal to E.U. courts.

British  Airways  was told to pay €104 million. The Scandinavian  airline SAS got a penalty of €70.2 million, which was higher than would have otherwise been the case because it had previously been caught fixing prices in a separate case.
SAS said it had ‘‘not been involved in a global  cartel’’ and would appeal.
Lufthansa was exempted from the  fine because it brought the  cartel to the commission’s attention. Other airlines  that received  fines were Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan  Airlines, LAN
Chile, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas.
Carriers from the United States that were part of the original investigation escaped  fines because the
commission was unable to find enough evidence against them, Mr. Almunia said.

BRUSSELS
SINGAPORE Airlines’ cargo unit said it was “disappointed” by the  European Union’s decision to
fine it 74.8 million euros (S$132.7 million).

TD
The carrier is “likely to appeal” against the ruling, it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. SIA
added that it “strongly contests” the view that it was involved in price fixing.

Air France-KLM and British Airways  were among 11 carriers fined a total of 799.4 million  euros by
EU regulators for coordinating air-cargo fuel and security surcharges.

Air France and its units got the biggest penalty of 339.6 million  euros and British  Airways  was
fined 104 million euros, the European Commission said on Tuesday.

Air France-KLM,  Europe’s largest airline, and British  Airways  are recovering from record losses last year when the financial crisis ravaged sales.

Airlines “are much more financially sound now than they were a year and a half ago,” said Mr Jacob Pedersen, an analyst with Sydbank in Aabenraa, Denmark. “They must be satisfied this happened now and not back then because that would have been far worse.”

The EU fines come three years after regulators sent complaints to 26 airlines,  following coordinated anti-trust raids worldwide that led to jail terms for some executives, as well as fines and settlements.

The United States authorities have  fined 18 airlines  at least US$1.6 billion (S$2 billion) and filed criminal charges against 14 executives for price- fixing.
“It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing,” EU competition commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said. Extra security costs in the aftermath of the attacks on Sept11, 2001, also
were not “an acceptable reason to stop competing”, he told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.

SAS, owner of Scandinavia’s biggest airline, got a 70.2-million-euro penalty and Cargolux  Airlines International,  Europe’s third-biggest air-freight carrier, was fined 79.9 million euros, the commission said.

The global airline industry has lost money in seven of the past nine years, racking up losses of more than US$50 billion, according to the International  Air Transport Association.
The EU cannot  fine companies more than 10 per cent of the previous year’s sales.

Air France-KLM Group said it would appeal against a combined  fine that puts its total payout over the provision it set aside to cover the  cartel probes.



Page 33 of 61 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
From 530 million euros set aside as a provision in 2008,  Air France-KLM had already paid out almost 330 million euros in fines and class-action awards in the US, Canada and Australia, spokesman Brigitte Barrand said in a telephone interview.

SAS also said it will appeal against its  fine. “SAS believes that it has not been involved in a global cartel and that, therefore, the  fines are disproportionate,” it said in a statement to the Stockholm Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Deutsche Lufthansa,  Europe’s second-largest airline, wasn’t fined because it was the first to inform on the cartel, the EU’s anti-trust agency said.
Cathay Pacific  Airways,  which was fined 57 million euros, is reviewing its options with lawyers, the
Hong Kong-based carrier said in a statement yesterday.

Qantas, Australia’s largest airline, “acknowledged the improper conduct” by its freight unit during the period, and will consider the fine when the full decision is received next week, the carrier said in an
e-mailed statement.

In 2008, the Sydney-based company was  fined A$20 million by Australia’s anti-trust regulator for its role in the cartel.

Cargo airlines  often work together to carry freight, setting aside as much as 10 per cent of space for partners. Carriers’ price structures include surcharges that change depending on oil prices and security measures.

Bangladesh, Nov. 12 -- Eleven reputed and major airlines  are to pay a fine of euro 800 million for running air cargo cartel in Europe. Noteable among the airlines  who have been penalised are British Airways,  Air France-KLM, Qantas and JAL. The decision to impose  fine came after a long four-year investigation by the European Commission (EC), Europe's top antitrust regulator. The  airlines  have been running the cartel for six years.

TD
The companies who fear they were overcharged for the cargo service will now be encouraged to demand claims. The other affected  airlines  are Air Canada, Cathay Pacific and Singapore  Airlines. Lufthansa, the German  airline and its subsidiaries got immunity because it acted as "whistle blower" euphemism for leaking out the fraud. Two  airlines  Scandanavian Airlines System (SAS) and  Air France-KLM will appeal for revision because of the dspropotinate size of the penalty. More than 20 international carriers have so far paid large fines in North America and Asia. The US Justice
Department collected more than $1.6 billion as fines. Several  airlines  executives have served jail terms.

The airlines  everywhere have been squeezing the passengers in recent times. They charge cancellation fee, extract exorbitant charge for an extra luggage, have stopped serving food and beverage on domestic flights, take extra money for travelling on week-ends and arbitrallily revise  air fares marking peak and lean periods. And in the world of global diplomacy, Britain sprang a major surprise when its foreign secretary backed Brazil's claim for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The British move came a day after President Obama backed India's claim which was criticised by China whose expanding global influence Washington's wants to contain.

Obama backtracked from his earlier stand saying the US has no intension to contain China's global influence. The South American country has long campaigned for a UN seat. Brazil, like India, is what is known as BRIC (Brazil, India, China and Russia) nations. China and Russia are already permanent members of the UN Security Council.

"We will continue to call for reform of the UN including an expanded Security Council," British foreign secretary William Hague was quoted as saying. Brazil's case has been somewhat weakened because it in conjunction with Turkey had opposed sanctions on Iran.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Financial Express.

HD      ANTI-TRUST POLICY : COMMISSION SLAPS 799 MILLION EURO FINE ON 11 CARGO CARRIERS WC     574 words

It took the European Commission four years, but it succeeded in gathering evidence of a global price-fixing cartel on air cargo services in the European Economic Area (EEA). On 9 November, the executive fined 11 air freight carriers a total of €799,445,000 for fixing prices on these services from December 1999 to 14 February 2006. The carriers are  Air Canada, Air France-KLM, British  Airways, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan  Airlines, LAN Chile, Martinair, SAS, Singapore  Airlines and Qantas. Lufthansa (and its subsidiary Swiss), which blew the whistle, received full immunity.

The cartel had already been nabbed in 2008 in the United States, where four carriers were  fined US$504 million, and in 2009 in Canada and Australia.

TD
The Commission's services demonstrated that  air cargo carriers maintained close contacts on flights from, to and within the EEA, introducing surcharges for their clients, freight forwarders. The carriers first imposed a surcharge on fuel then introduced a security surcharge. The EU executive failed to gather sufficient evidence, however, of two other surcharges and freight rates and had to drop these allegations, along with those against 11 other carriers and a consultancy firm.

"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers," commented Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. He added: "With today's decision, the  Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behaviour."

In setting the level of the  fines, the Commission took into account the sales of the companies involved in the market concerned, the serious nature of the infringement, the geographical scope of the  cartel and its duration. The highest  fine of €339.58 million was imposed on  Air France-KLM, of which €182.92 million
for Air France, €127.16 million for KLM and €29.5 million for their subsidiary Martinair.

All the cargo carriers were granted a 50% reduction on sales between the EEA and third countries in order to take into account the fact that only part of the harm of the  cartel fell outside the EEA. They also received a 15% reduction on account of the regulatory environment in the sector, which can be seen as encouraging price coordination. The initial  fines for Martinair, Japan  Airlines, Air France-KLM, Cathay Pacific, LAN Chile, Qantas,  Air Canada and British  Airways  were reduced because they cooperated with the Commission. On the other hand, the executive rejected the request for reduction by five carriers claiming inability to pay, since the conditions for reduction were not satisfied.

Air France-KLM has already announced that it will appeal the decision before the EU General Court. It claims that the  fines are "disproportionate" since the economic analyses conducted as part of the procedure demonstrated that "the behaviour in question did not have a harmful impact on freight shippers or forwarders that work with the shippers".

HD             Airlines brace for damages claims after EU ruling

The €799 million (HK$8.49 billion)  fine imposed last week on 11  airlines,  including Cathay Pacific Airways,  Singapore  Airlines and British  Airways,  for antitrust offences in  Europe may be just part of the penalty.

What is expected to have airline executives waking up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night is that the European Commission ruling and fine mean customers who became victims of the
price-fixing cartel can now sue for damages.

TD
At least five of the  airlines  - Air France and its subsidiary KLM, Lan Chile, SAS and Singapore
Airlines - have indicated that they will, or will consider, appealing the ruling.
The European Commission has vowed to protect consumer interests after announcing the
multi-carrier fine for cargo surcharges collusion last week. The  cartel activities occurred to and from
Europe between December 1999 and February 2006.

Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said it was basic justice that consumers should be able to obtain compensation for the harm caused by cartels.

Any person or company affected by anti-competitive behaviour may bring the matter before the courts of the member states of the  European Union and seek compensation, the regulator said.

A paper on general antitrust penalties published by the  commission at the end of last year serves as a non-legally binding guideline for plaintiffs to calculate damages and seek compensation correspondingly.

"National courts in  Europe must follow the ruling of the  European Commission on the question of the involvement of the concerned  airlines  in the cartel," said Patrick Boylan, an antitrust lawyer at Simmons & Simmons, a London-based law firm. "There are a number of parties, according to certain law firms in London, set to bring a case against the  airlines  involved."

According to English law, a plaintiff can bring an action not only against a British defendant but also foreign parties, Boylan said. "Airlines should consider the picture from an international perspective when they draw up their defence strategy."

Actions for follow-on damages had already been filed in Britain and the Netherlands even before the regulator announced the ruling.

In Britain, two flower importers have sought to bring a group action against British  Airways  before the High Court, in which they seek to represent all direct and indirect users of  air-freight services. The matter is now before the Court of Appeal and a judgment is expected in the next few weeks.
"This ruling could have a significant impact on the risk to  airlines  of class actions in England and
Wales," Boylan said.

Air France-KLM faces a damages claim for €500 million from Equilib, a company set up by plaintiffs for the purpose of bringing a claim.
Page 38 of 61 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The developing landscape for follow-on damages claims, however, will depend on whether  European governments come to terms with a unified procedure for bringing class actions in their own countries, given that many  European countries have yet to introduce class action in their legal system. Unlike Europe, there have been more than 70 class actions launched in the United States against  airlines  in relation to the freight  cartel, leading to several settlements.

Some observers say greater transparency in the industry makes it less likely a  cartel will be allowed to operate in the future.

After the deregulation of the aviation market in  Europe and the US over the past three to four years, the air cargo market has become more transparent, said Sunny Yu, an executive director of CDSR Group, a Hong Kong-based freight forwarding firm.

For example, airlines  operating in Hong Kong no longer used the same fuel charge scale unified by the Board of Airlines Representatives, an  airline trade body. The  airlines,  however, issue their own fuel surcharges every month.

More competition had been introduced into the market and the  air cargo market has become more fragmented, Yu said. "After deregulation the freight rates are very transparent and no carrier can manipulate prices at present," he said.

In light of the worldwide antitrust probe,  airline executives have refrained from any occasion which involved price discussions. "Carriers need to differentiate themselves through price, value-added service and efficiency now," Yu said.

The global aviation industry used to be highly regulated with  air rights on certain routes controlled by a limited number of  airlines.

"Since there was not enough cargo space to cater for cargo demand, freight rates as well as fuel surcharges were manipulated by the supply side [airlines]  at that time," an executive from a freight forwarding firm said.
Freight forwarders, the selling agents of cargo space to exporters, are the direct customers of  airlines. However, the executive said it was hard for a freight forwarder to file a lawsuit against the  airlines  for
damages because extra costs were usually passed on to the exporters or shippers, the customers of
freight forwarders.

After a three-year investigation and a year of successive postponements due to pressure by the aviation sector, the European Commission was expected to fineAir  France-KLM, British  Airways,  SAS, Cargolux and six non-European airlines  a total €798.82 million, on 9 November, for illegal practices in freight transport. Only the whistleblower, Lufthansa-Swiss, escapes the financial sanctions under the Commission's leniency programme. The 12  airlines  are alleged to have operated a  cartel on tariffs for freight transport to and from the EU.

HD     EC Fines 11 Air Cargo Carriers $1 Billion

The European Commission (EC) has fined 11 air cargo carriers a total of $1.09 billion (799 million Euros) for operating a worldwide cartel which affected cargo services within the European Economic area (EEA). The airlines  involved are Air Canada, Air France-KLM, British Airways,  Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Martinair, Qantas, SAS and Singapore Airlines.

The carriers coordinated their action on surcharges for fuel and security without discounts over a six year period. Lufthansa (and its subsidiary Swiss) received full immunity from fines under the Commission's leniency program, as it was the first to provide information about the cartel.

TD
"It is deplorable that so many major  airlines  coordinated their pricing to the detriment of  European businesses and European consumers,"says Joaquin Almunia, vice president for competition, adding, “With [this] decision the Commission is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate  cartel behavior.”
The cartel members coordinated various elements of price for a period of over six years, from December
1999 to February 2006. The  cartel arrangements consisted of numerous contacts between  airlines,  at
both bilateral and multilateral level, covering flights from, to and within the EEA.  Airlines providing
airfreight services primarily offer the transport of cargo to freight forwarders, who arrange the carriage of
these goods, including associated services and formalities on behalf of shippers.

The contacts on prices between the  airlines  concerned initially started with a view to discuss fuel surcharges. The carriers contacted each other so as to ensure that worldwide  airfreight carriers imposed a flat rate surcharge per kilo for all shipments. The cartel members extended their cooperation by introducing a security surcharge and refusing to pay a commission on surcharges to their clients (freight forwarders).

The aim of these contacts was to ensure that these surcharges were introduced by all the carriers involved and that increases (or decreases) of the surcharge levels were applied in full without exception. By refusing to pay a  commission, the airlines  ensured that surcharges did not become subject to competition through the granting of discounts to customers. Such practices are in breach of the EU competition rules.

On the other hand,  Commission allegations of collusion on two other surcharges and regarding freight rates in the Statement of Objections have been dropped from the case for insufficient evidence. The Commission also dropped charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm which had previously received the Statement of Objections for the same reason.

In setting the level of the  fines, the Commission took into account the sales of the companies involved in the market concerned, the very serious nature of the infringement, the EEA-wide scope of the  cartel and its duration.

HD        European Commission Imposes Heavy Fines on 11 Air Cargo Carriers

On Tuesday, the  European Commission ('Commission') imposed a total  fine of just over €799 million on 11 air cargo carriers for engaging in a price-fixing cartel in the air cargo market. The  Commission found that the 11 carriers had coordinated their actions on surcharges for fuel and security and commission on surcharges over a six year period from December 1999 to February 2006. The  cartel covered flights both within the EU and between the EU and third countries.

The carriers agreed on a fuel surcharge per kilo (which varied according to a fuel price index), followed by a surcharge in relation to security contracts. This was coupled with regular contact between the carriers to ensure that everyone was imposing the surcharges, that no  commission was given and that no discounts to customers were permitted.

TD
The highest  fines were imposed on Air France (€182,920,000), KLM (€127,160,000) and British Airways  (€104,040,000). The  fine imposed on Scandinavian carrier, SAS, was increased by 50% for recidivism, to take account of its involvement in an earlier  cartel in the airline sector.

Lufthansa and its subsidiary (Swiss International Airlines) were granted a 100% leniency reduction for bringing the cartel to the attention of the Commission. Interestingly, the Commission only proceeded against those carriers that applied for leniency, with the exception of Singapore Airlines. The charges against another 11 carriers and one consultancy firm were dropped.

Although five of the carriers applied for a reduction in penalty due to financial hardship, none were found to have met the strict criteria. Despite this, several reductions to the level of  fines were made:

All carriers received a reduction of 15% due to the general regulatory environment in the sector which was seen as encouraging price coordination (the  Commission stressed that this was only viewed as a mitigating factor, not as an excuse for the  cartel).

All carriers received a 50% reduction on sales between the EEA and third countries, to reflect the fact that part of the harm for these routes fell outside the EEA.
Four carriers were also granted a 10% reduction for limited participation in the infringement.

By introducing these  fine adjustments, the Commission has adopted a more nuanced and tailored approach than in its earlier  cartel cases. The fines are however still significant and clearly aimed at deterrence. The  Air France-KLM group and SAS have indicated that they are likely to challenge the decision.
This is the 6th  cartel decision adopted by the  Commission this year.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Franco-Dutch airlineAir France-KLM (AF.FR) Wednesday reported that it swung to profitability in the three months through Sept. 30, fueled by a recovery in revenue from passenger and cargo operations after the depressed levels of a year earlier, as well as an unspecified positive currency effect.

TD
Second-quarter operating profit came in at EUR576 million, after a loss of EUR47 million in the year-before quarter.

The company said it had managed to improve the yield of its passenger operations in terms of revenue per available seat kilometer by 19% in the quarter, with passenger traffic up 0.6% while capacity was reduced by 0.5%, improving the load factor of the  airline's planes by almost a full percentage point. Passenger operations produced an operating profit of EUR453 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of EUR15 a year earlier.

The second-quarter yield on cargo operations surged 34% from the very depressed year-ago level, and cargo revenue was 38% higher at EUR786 million. The segment contributed an operating profit for the second straight quarter of EUR7 million, compared with a year-ago loss of EUR147 million.

Peter Hartman, president and chief executive officer of KLM, said cargo operations are expected to be profitable for the full year. "We are more than pleased with our cargo performance" in the quarter, Hartman told a news conference.

A solid earnings performance by Air France-KLM for the quarter had been widely expected in the light of strong earnings by other major European carriers for the three months through September. A consensus among a panel of 19 analysts polled by the company had forecast second-quarter EBIT at EUR377 million, and a net profit for the period of EUR218 million.

Air France-KLM recently upgraded its guidance for the financial year ending March 31, 2011, and Wednesday gave a more detailed forecast for full-year EBIT of more than EUR300 million, compared with previous guidance that it would be profitable at the operating level.

It said has set an objective of a 3% reduction in fixed costs on a constant currency and fuel price basis over the three years through 2014. It is also aiming for an adjusted operating margin above 7% of revenue, a return to a debt to equity ratio of 50%, and a return on capital employed of 8% after tax.

Revenue surged 19% in the quarter to EUR6.65 billion. And net profit for the period was EUR290 million versus a year-ago loss of EUR147 million.
For the six months through September--the first half of  Air France-KLM's financial year ending March
31, 2011--the  airline reported an operating profit of EUR444 million, against a year-ago loss of EUR543
million. Revenue was 15% higher at EUR12.37 billion, and  Air France-KLM posted a net profit of
EUR1.03 billion after a EUR573 loss a year before.
Page 47 of 61 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Air France-KLM and 10 other international  airlines  were fined a total of EUR339.6 million last week by the European Commission for having organized a global cartel on air cargo tariffs.

The airline said that the size of its  fines exceeds the level of provisions it has already taken against anti-trust litigation, obliging it to book an unexpected EUR127 million charge to its earnings for the first six months of its financial year.
According to latest data from the International  Air Transport Association, passenger traffic rose 10.5%
in September from a year before.

He didn't spell out what types of  aircraft  aren't being replaced.

Deliveries of the  aircraft  were originally expected in the next two to three years, according to the carrier.

Air France-KLM has set a target of reducing its investments by 400 million euros through 2012 and plans to develop its fleets of highly efficient  aircraft  such as the double-decker Airbus  A380 and Boeing 777 on high-density routes.

There was a double dose of good news for British  Airways  yesterday, which was soaring on the
blue-chip index thanks to positive news from across the Channel and an important legal victory. The
company advanced 11.5p to 272.9p following the release of latest figures from  Europe's largest  airline,
Air France-KLM. The carrier posted net earnings in the second-quarter of €260m, after losing €147m in
the same period a year earlier. Analysts welcomed the results and  Air France-KLM enjoyed a large rise
in its share price on the Paris market. There was another reason to celebrate for BA as it won an appeal
that prevents its cargo customers from banding together for a lawsuit over its involvement in fixing cargo
prices. Earlier in the month, BA was one of 11  airlines  to be fined by the European Commission for
taking part in the  cartel.

Business | Market Report
THERE WAS a double dose of good news for British  Airways  yesterday, which was soaring on the
blue-chip index thanks to a positive read-across from across the Channel and an important legal victory.

TD
The company advanced 11.5p to 272.9p following the release of latest figures from  Europe's largest airline, Air France-KLM. The carrier, which was created in 2004 following a merger between the French and Dutch airlines,  posted net earnings in the second-quarter of €260m, after losing €147m in the same period a year earlier.
With an increase in passenger traffic last month of 3.1 per cent, analysts welcomed the results and  Air
France-KLM enjoyed a large rise in its share price during trading yesterday on the Paris market.

There was another reason to celebrate for BA, which in October posted its first profit for two years. The airline won an appeal that prevents its cargo customers from banding together for a lawsuit over its involvement in fixing cargo prices. Earlier in the month BA was one of 11  airlines  fined by the European Commission for taking part in the  cartel.

Overall, the FTSE 100 finished 76.15 points up on 5,768.71, with investors cheerful as it looked more likely that Ireland would accept a bailout. Rising commodity prices helped the miners move up, and Fresnillo and Kazakhmys ended the day near the top of the leaderboard, up 68p to 1,414p and 44p to
1,470p respectively.

Another member of the sector to gain was Xstrata, as reports that Glencore - which holds a 34.4 per cent stake in the miner - was thinking about an initial public offering revived speculation over a merger. There were rumours earlier this year that it was a possibility, but Xstrata investors spoke of their reluctance because of difficulties valuing the commodities company.

"There has been speculation that Glencore might look to proceed down the listing route in part to give a sort of independent external price, and almost at the last minute of that process, go down the route of merging with Xstrata rather than listing." said Panmure Gordon's Alison Turner. "Or, indeed, take it through to IPO, after which they could pursue a merger in a situation where both companies now had an independent market value as a basis to start a discussion." The miner jumped 26.5p to 1,338.5p.

BG Group was also the subject of market chatter, as gossips revisited an old favourite. After speculation last month that China National Offshore Oil Corporation was looking at making a £14-a-share bid for the gas explorer, the talk was that it was sniffing around the British energy giant again.

The company received a boost from HO Markets reiterating its "buy" recommendation, with Daniel Harris, head of dealing at the broker, saying it "is ideally positioned to take advantage of shifting global markets, and is in a strategically superior position to most of its market peers". Amid the gossip and positive sentiments, BG Group did manage to reach 1,246p, but by the end of the session it had dropped back to 1,232p, an increase of 13p.

There was some solid acquisition news elsewhere, as Weir Group announced that it had bought American Hydro Corporation, which produces hydro-electric power station turbines. The deal means that the Glasgow-based pump and valve maker can move into renewable energy, and investors responded positively, pushing it up 36p to 1,725p.

ON THE FTSE 250, QinetiQ's strong first-half results and its statement that dividends could be reintroduced at the end of the year led to a huge share price rise of more than 13 per cent, but not everyone was convinced. Analysts from Investec said that the fact that the defence firm's numbers beat expectations was "due to Global Products, up 65% y-o-y, where the Q-NET product to the US Army has sold particularly well."

The broker warned that current orders may not be repeated in future, noting that both "the UK and US Services businesses are under revenue and margin pressure." Still, the market did not listen to its "sell" advice, and QinetiQ moved up 13.5p to 112.5p.

Also going strong was PartyGaming, as it revealed that its planned merger with the Austrian company bwin had been approved by the federal  cartel office in Germany. The companies are expected to combine in the first quarter of next year, and Gibraltar-based PartyGaming climbed 12.2p to 232.2p.

At the opposite end, Lamprell plummeted 47p to 295p while Keller Group, which said its results for the year would be "around the bottom end of the current range of market expectations", fell 49p to 546p.

THERE WAS a new face on the Alternative Investment Market yesterday, as Zanaga Iron Ore listed, raising £62.1m as a result. The exploration company, which operates in the Republic of Congo and has an investment deal with Xstrata, placed 39.8m shares at 156p a pop, and by the end of the session it had risen 7p to 163p.

HD       European Commission Finds Airlines Guilty Of Fixing Prices Of Air Cargo And Imposes Fines Of
€799m

Eleven airlines  have been fined a total of €799m (approx. $1.1bn) as a result of the  European                 Commission's finding this week that they fixed the price of fuel and security surcharges on cargo flights worldwide. The  European Commission has been investigating the industry since 2006 in an inquiry that covered a six-year period from December 1999 to February 2006.
Price fixing

TD
Agreements between competitors to fix prices are contrary to EU competition rules and can result in  fines
of up to 10% of worldwide group revenue.

The Commission found that 12  airlines  (Air Canada, Air France-KLM, British Airways,  Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Lufthansa/Swiss, Martinair, SAS, Singapore Airlines and Qantas) contacted each other throughout the six-year period with the aim of ensuring that all airlines  imposed a flat rate fuel surcharge per kilo for all cargo shipments on flights to, from and within the EEA. The Commission also found that the airlines  agreed to introduce a uniform security surcharge and
collectively refused to pay commission on surcharges to their customers (freight forwarders who arrange the transport of goods by air on behalf of companies wanting to transport goods). The  Commission
found that these alleged agreements meant that there was no price competition on fuel or security surcharges between  airlines.

Following its investigation and after considering the  airlines'  defence arguments the  Commission dropped all charges against an additional 11 carriers (mainly based outside the EU) and one consultancy firm. Fried Frank advised one of those carriers.

Fines

The fines in this case amount to €799m in total (approx. $1.1bn), with almost half (€340m) being imposed on Air France/KLM, which also owns Martinair. All but one of the airlines  had their fines reduced
because they cooperated with the investigation, and the Commission also reduced fines against all airlines  by 15% on the basis that price coordination was encouraged by the regulatory regime in several overseas countries. Additional reductions were granted to four  airlines  because the Commission found that they were involved to a limited extent in the  cartel. Lufthansa did not receive any fine because it
'blew the whistle' to the Commission, and as a result received 100% immunity from fines. In a departure from recent decisions, despite five airlines  claiming that they could not afford to pay any fine, the Commission decided not to reduce any fines for this reason.
What next?

The airlines  which have been fined will now need to consider whether to appeal the  Commission's decision to the  European courts. If they do so, they must lodge their appeals within two months.

HD       EU fines ten airlines  800m in price fixing  case

According to industry sources, the European Union has fined ten airlines,  a combined 800m for their role in a global cartel that colluded to fix air cargo rates. Air France-KLM has been handed the largest fine of 310.1m, while British Airways  has to pay 104m and Singapore Airlines will pay 76.4m. In addition, the EU has also fined Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, Cargolux, Japan Airlines, LAN Chile, Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Qantas and Martinair for their involvement in the cartel. Lufthansa was also found guilty of price fixing; however the company received immunity because it had alerted the Commission to the existence of the  cartel and cooperated in the  Commission's investigations.

TD
The announcement of the  fines, brings to an end a four year investigation that began in 2006. The Commission was due to release its decision a year ago, however the case was delayed after the airlines  claimed they could not pay heavy  fines due to the slump in the  air cargo market. The  airline companies now have two months to launch an appeal in the  European Court of Justice.
