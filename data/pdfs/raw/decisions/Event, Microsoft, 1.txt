HD         EU May Curb Microsoft Fixes To Avoid Crt Challenge-Source

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Europe's  antitrust chief, Mario Monti, intends to limit any punishment leveled against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in order to avoid clashing with judges who have overturned a string of his antitrust decisions, according to a source close to the case.

The European Union Commission still intends to fine Microsoft for past abuses - but regulators are seeking ways to avoid demanding more proprietary code than Microsoft is willing to give. In particular, Monti wants to avert a battle over intellectual property rights that could give judges at the European Court of First Instance enough ammunition to suspend the decision.

TD
In previous cases, the court has slapped injunctions on Brussels that stop regulators from forcing companies to give up valuable data or innovative ideas. Last year, Monti was forced to concede defeat in a major trans-Atlantic intellectual property battle by withdrawing a ruling against U.S. pharmaceuticals-data collector IMS Health Inc. (IMS) after the court's president, Bo Vesterdorf, suspended the ruling in October 2001.

The IMS case highlighted European regulators' aggressive stance toward intellectual property rights and raised concern among high-technology companies that use copyrights and patents to protect products against encroachment by rivals. Since that setback, Monti has redoubled efforts to try to "bulletproof" other high-profile probes in general, including the case involving  Microsoft.

Under one plan, according to the source, Monti would find  Microsoft guilty and impose a record  fine for monopoly abuse - but he would stop short of demanding more proprietary data than the company has already offered in recent negotiations. That would be good for  Microsoft, which has argued that its rivals are trying to clone its most valuable products including a network management program called Active Directory.

Europe's trustbusters instead want  Microsoft and its competitors, such as Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW), to hash out the details among themselves, and to settle further disputes before Europe's national courts. Under the plan,  Microsoft's rivals would be encouraged to take Monti's finding of monopoly abuse to local judges, who can enforce E.U. decisions against dominant companies.

The solution could avoid another clash between Monti and Judge Vesterdorf over intellectual property rights. Under the plan, Monti would put the burden on  Microsoft to avoid litigation in the national courts by voluntarily yielding further code.

Monti's "idea is to lay the knife on the table and ask  Microsoft to apply it themselves," said the source, referring to further concessions expected from the company.

The software giant has made less progress in a second part of the E.U.'s  antitrust case that focuses on multimedia software.

So far, regulators are skeptical about the company's offer to place a folder on its computer desktop to inform users of the media and video options available on accompanying CDs. Such a deal would be less severe for Microsoft than E.U. regulators have so far suggested, and leave its Windows Media Player reinstalled on more than 90% of all new desktop computers.

The regulators say that plan doesn't give multimedia rivals, like RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK), a level playing field to compete against software bundled with Windows.

Page 5 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Speaking Tuesday, Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes reiterated that the company still is "working actively with the European Commission toward an amicable settlement of the case."

Even if Microsoft overcomes the E.U.'s concerns about servers and media player, the company still faces at least two separate  antitrust challenges in Europe.

Since last year, the Commission has been investigating whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, like handhelds and smartphones.

The regulators also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree unfair technology licensing terms.

HD            EC wants deal with Microsoft, not punishment: Company's hope, too: Monti seeks solution that resonates  beyond Brussels

BRUSSELS - It would not take a genius to guess Mario Monti's dream solution to the  European        Commission's long-running investigation of  Microsoft Corp. But working out quite how to get there could be beyond the talents of the best and brightest at either the company or the Commission.

Mr. Monti, Europe's  competition Commissioner, would like an outcome that resonates in Brussels and beyond. It would probably involve a  fine, but also an understanding with the company on changes to its products and policies.

TD
Such a result would show that the five-year-long investigation was not for naught.

At the same time it would protect Mr. Monti from a legal counter-offensive by the software giant and the risk that the Commission measures could be suspended by a court.

A deal could also be a desirable outcome for  Microsoft, which is much more concerned about the investigation's impact on its future business than it is about formal censure for monopolistic practices
-- embarrassing though that could be.

The fine is the least important part of the equation, although politically Mr. Monti cannot be seen to let the company off without sanction. The initial sum is likely to be in the 100-million-200-million, judging from official guidelines and previous cases.

However, the Commission could seek to multiply this figure several times to dissuade the company from future offences.  Microsoft has a cash hoard of US$52-billion.

The two sides are in constant, and surprisingly amiable, negotiations. But there is little time left, as a draft Commission decision against the company inches ever closer to formal adoption. Unless there is a settlement, Brussels is expected to pronounce its verdict by late March.
The Commission has argued that  Microsoft has committed two "abuses".

The first allegation is that the company has refused its rivals access to the technical information they need for their servers to work better with Windows-driven personal computers. The second is that Microsoft has "abused its dominant position" by bundling its Media Player program with the rest of Windows.

The company denies that either practice breaks EU  competition law. It adds that the Commission's proposed remedies of forcing  Microsoft to reveal more information and "unbundle" Media Player could violate its intellectual property rights.



Page 7 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nevertheless,  Microsoft has proposed remedies of its own and on the issue of servers'
"inter-operability," the two sides are thought to be moving closer. So far, however, the Media Player
dispute has proved much more intractable.

While the argument over "inter-operability" can boil down to disclosing more or less information, the sort of issue that is open to compromise, the question of selling Media Player separately from Windows leaves little such scope. And the techniques, which the Commission alleges are illegal "bundling," go to the heart of  Microsoft's business model.
Both sides are only too aware they could apply to a range of other  Microsoft products as well.

If the two sides managed to crack this problem, there is little doubt that  Microsoft could make a payment as part of an all-encompassing deal.

And even if there is no settlement in the next few weeks, the Commission could still step away from a full-scale confrontation by issuing a "cease and desist" order.

This would allow the Commission to fine the company and order it to stop its "abuses," but leave room for negotiation on how Microsoft should comply.

In May, Mr. Monti will win new powers to impose settlements, which will clearly boost his negotiating clout.

However, a partial settlement in March is still possible, as is a wide-ranging decision against the company. At the moment both sides are working hard for a deal.
Mr. Monti would like an outcome he will be remembered for.
Bill Gates would be happy with a mere footnote to Window's long and successful history.

The next month will tell whether the  European Commission's five-year case against Microsoft ends in compromise or in court. The stakes are high. It is crucial to keep sight of those whom competition
policy serves: consumers.

Frits Bolkestein, single market commissioner, has warned against infringing Microsoft's intellectual property rights, which could invite legal challenge. Mario Monti, competition commissioner, will be similarly keen to avoid making a ruling that could be overturned by an injunction.

TD
The Commission believes  Microsoft has abused its dominance in personal computer operating systems. It wants the software giant to give information about its server software to competitors; it also wants it to untie Media Player, used for music and videos, from Windows, or offer alternatives alongside it.

The second issue would set an important precedent and is hardest to resolve. The Commission has so far rejected  Microsoft's offer to include rival products on CD-Roms supplied with personal computers.

Unless there is a settlement, Brussels is set to rule by the end of March. The best outcome for Mr Monti would be one in which Microsoft was fined and agreed to change its products and policies. Another option short of full-scale confrontation would be a "cease and desist" order, demanding an end to the "abuses" but putting the onus on  Microsoft as to how to comply.

It is understandable that Mr Monti, who has had court setbacks, should wish to avoid another. A Commission weakened by defeats would not serve consumers. Neither, though, would an over-cautious one. If he believes his case is strong, he should pursue it.
A more complete Snecma solution

Jean-Paul Bechat, Snecma chairman, has been preparing for partial privatisation of the state-owned French aero-engine group. So it was no surprise that he announced on Tuesday a 72 per cent rise in last year's net profits - thanks largely to lower provisions - on the day the government revived the process of floating a large minority stake.

The original sell-off, launched by the Socialists, involved a 25 per cent stake. It was interrupted by the events of September 11. Now the clouds over the aerospace industry are lifting, the centre-right government ought to be bolder and sell the lot.

Mr Bechat admitted state ownership was stifling development. The group has expanded by acquiring domestic aerospace companies, nationalising them in the process. But this strategy has come unstuck elsewhere.

Snecma looked at FiatAvio when it was for sale at the height of the Fiat crisis. Rome objected because it did not want the company nationalised by the French. It went to a US private equity firm and Italy's Finmeccanica. Both have since made clear they have no long-term interest in aero-engines. Would
Rome really give its blessing now to a deal involving a part-privatised French company?

Total privatisation would have other pluses. It would put Snecma into play to the benefit of its new shareholders. Thales has made no secret of its appetite. And General Electric, already interested in a stake to protect its links with Snecma, would hardly be indifferent.

Investors left feeling the sting

French beekeepers have forced the government to act against pesticides that they claim are killing bees. The agriculture minister yesterday placed a temporary ban on a BASF product and launched an investigation into another made by Bayer.

The issues go beyond France's borders, reflecting concern over the effects of pesticides, herbicides and genetically modified crops. Reassurances by life science multinationals are failing to convince
consumers and a growing slice of the farming community. Investors also have a right to seek clarity.

Until now, reports on the possible harmful effects of controversial products have tended to come either from pressure groups or independent government reports. The companies themselves should now be encouraged to launch more independent research and be more willing to accept they may sometimes be wrong.

At the moment, they are at best defensive and at worst arrogant. Shareholders should not wait for court cases and political storms to sting the managements of these multinationals into responding.

HD        Bolkestein acts over Microsoft 'remedies'. BY         By DANIEL DOMBEY

LP
Frits Bolkestein, Europe's single market Commissioner, has intervened in the  European Commission's case against Microsoftto ensure that a final decision is not too harsh on the software giant.

Mr Bolkestein's officials had been worried that the Commission's proposed "remedies" in the case might infringe Microsoft's intellectual property rights by forcing it to share too much of its programming code with rivals.

TD
The Microsoft case involves claims that the company illegally "leveraged" the dominance of its Windows operating system into other markets. The negotiations over how much information  Microsoft would have to disclose show that the company may be spared from having to adapt its behaviour as much as some of its enemies urged.

Mr Bolkestein's officials have been in close contact with the Commission's  competition department, headed by Mario Monti. They say such procedures are a normal part of "inter-services consultation" when a formal decision is near.

The internal talks, which are running parallel to contacts between Mr Monti and  Microsoft, show that even if the Commission rules against the software group, the "remedies" for its alleged abuses will have been subject to extensive negotiation.

The Commission has already reached a preliminary conclusion that  Microsoft has broken European competition law by refusing to give its rivals information which would allow their servers to work better with Windows-driven personal computers and by "tying" its Media Player program to the rest of Windows.

Although the company denies the charges, both sides would like a settlement, which could avoid a protracted legal fight and continuing uncertainty.

A final Commission decision could come by the end of March. One possibility is a partial settlement, in which the Commission rules against  Microsoft and imposes a fine, but agrees with the company on how it is to comply with the order.
Mr Bolkestein's officials stress that Mr Monti and Mr Bolkestein are "politically as one" on the  Microsoft
case. Delicate path, Page 28

HD      Monti treads a delicate path to censuring. BY       By DANIEL DOMBEY

Microsoft: The European Commission must tackle the sensitive issue of 'bundling', writes Daniel Dombey. It would not take a genius to guess Mario Monti'sdream solution to the  European                      Commission's long-running investigation of  Microsoft. But working out quite how to get there could be beyond the talents of the best and brightest at either the company or the Commission.

Mr Monti, Europe's  competition Commissioner, would like an outcome that resonates in Brussels and beyond. It would probably involve a  fine, but also an understanding with the company on changes to its products and policies.

TD
Such a result would show that the five-year-long investigation was not for naught. At the same time it would protect Mr Monti from a legal counter-offensive by the software giant and the risk that the Commission measures could be suspended by a court.

A deal could also be a desirable outcome for  Microsoft, which is much more concerned about the investigation's impact on its future business than it is about formal censure for monopolistic practices - embarrassing though that could be.

The fine is the least important part of the equation, although politically Mr Monti cannot be seen to let the company off without sanction. The initial sum is likely to be in the Euros 100m-Euros 200m (Dollars
126m-Dollars 251m) range, judging from official guidelines and previous cases. However, the Commission could seek to multiply this figure several times to dissuade the company from future offences.  Microsoft has a cash hoard of Dollars 52bn.

The two sides are in constant, and surprisingly amiable, negotiations. But there is little time left, as a draft Commission decision against the company inches ever closer to formal adoption. Unless there is a settlement, Brussels is expected to pronounce its verdict by late March.

The Commission has argued that  Microsoft has committed two "abuses". The first allegation is that the company has refused its rivals access to the technical information they need for their servers to work better with Windows-driven personal computers. The second is that  Microsoft has "abused its dominant position" by bundling its Media Player program with the rest of Windows.

The company denies that either practice breaks EU  competition law. It adds that the Commission's proposed remedies of forcing  Microsoft to reveal more information and "unbundle" Media Player could violate its intellectual property rights.

While the argument over "inter-operability" can boil down to disclosing more or less information, the sort of issue that is open to compromise, the question of selling Media Player separately from Windows leaves little such scope. And the techniques, which the Commission alleges are illegal "bundling", go to the heart of Microsoft's business model. Both sides are only too aware they could apply to a range of other Microsoft products as well.

Even if there is no settlement in the next few weeks, the Commission could still step away from a
full-scale confrontation by issuing a "cease and desist" order. This would allow the Commission to  fine
the company and order it to stop its "abuses" but leave room for negotiation on how  Microsoft should
comply. In May, Mr Monti will win new powers to impose "settlements", so such a scenario could boost
his negotiating clout. However, a partial settlement in March is still possible, as is a wide-ranging decision
against the company. At the moment both sides are working hard for a deal. Mr Monti would like an
outcome he will be remembered for. Bill Gates would be happy with a mere footnote to Window's long
and successful history.

HD       Bolkestein steps in on Microsoft - EUROPEAN COMMISSION. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY

Frits Bolkestein, Europe's single market Commissioner, has intervened in the  European Commission's case against Microsoft to ensure that a final decision is not too harsh on the software giant.

Mr Bolkestein's officials had been worried that the Commission's proposed "remedies" in the case might infringe Microsoft's intellectual property rights by forcing it to share too much of its programming code with rivals in the market for computer servers.

TD
The Microsoft case involves allegations that the company illegally "leveraged" the dominance of its
Windows operating system into other markets.

The negotiations over how much information  Microsoft would have to disclose show that the company may be spared from having to adapt its behaviour as much as some of its enemies have urged.

However, the Commission's proposals could go further than a settlement in 2001-2002 to a case brought against the group by the US government.

Mr Bolkestein's officials have been in close contact with the Commission's  competition department, headed by Mario Monti. They say such procedures are a normal part of "inter-services consultation" when a formal decision is near.

The internal talks, which are running parallel to contacts between Mr Monti and  Microsoft, show that even if the Commission rules against the software group, the "remedies" for its alleged abuses will have been subject to extensive negotiations.

The Commission has already reached a preliminary conclusion that  Microsoft has broken European competition law by refusing to give its rivals information which would allow their servers to work better with Windows-driven personal computers and by "tying" its Media Player program to the rest of Windows. Although the company denies the charges, both sides would like a settlement, which could avoid a protracted legal fight and continuing uncertainty.

"You can be pretty sure that Monti would not like to take a risk," said a senior Commission official. "He is not a gambler."

A final Commission decision could come by the end of March. One possibility is a partial settlement, in which the Commission rules against  Microsoft and imposes a fine, but agrees with the company on
how it is to comply with the order. Another is a "cease and desist" order, in which the Commission issues the company with an ultimatum to come up with the specifics of ending its offences.

Mr Bolkestein's officials were concerned that a violation of  Microsoft's intellectual property rights might set a worrying precedent and the decision could be challenged in court.

They stress that Mr Monti and Mr Bolkestein, who hopes to succeed to the  competition post, are
"politically as one" on the  Microsoft case.

HD      From Brussels With Love

United States, 2004 Feb 24 (NB). may be getting a late Valentine, as published reports today suggest that European regulators are intent on easing any  antitrust penalties handed down against the software giant.

, the antitrust chief and longtime  Microsoft adversary, "intends to limit any punishment leveled against Microsoft Corp. in order to avoid clashing with judges who have overturned a string of his  antitrust decisions, according to a person close to the case," Dow Jones Newswires reported today. "The European Commission still intends to fine Microsoft for past abuses -- but regulators are seeking ways to avoid demanding more proprietary code than Microsoft is willing to give. In particular, Mr. Monti wants to avert a battle over intellectual-property rights that could give judges at the European Court of First Instance enough ammunition to suspend the decision."

TD
Monti is not alone in coming to  Microsoft's aid. ", Europe's single market Commissioner, has intervened in the European Commission's case against  Microsoft to ensure that a final decision is not too harsh on the software giant," The Financial Times reported today. "Mr Bolkestein's officials had been worried that the Commission's proposed 'remedies' in the case might infringe  Microsoft's intellectual property rights by forcing it to share too much of its programming code with rivals in the market for computer
servers." The article later said that Bolkestein and Monti are working together at the same time that Monti and Microsoft are hashing out details. That means that "even if the Commission rules against the software group, the 'remedies' for the company's alleged abuses will have been subjected to extensive negotiations," the London-based newspaper said.

While the reported efforts by Monti and Bolkestein aren't aimed at giving  Microsoft a free ride, they certainly suggest a kinder, gentler approach that might leave Gates & Co. outright giddy. Not having to show its source code to competitors would be a huge win for the software company. "Under one
possibility under consideration, according to the person close to the case, Mr. Monti would find  Microsoft guilty and impose a record  fine for monopoly abuse -- but he would stop short of demanding more proprietary data than the company has already offered in recent negotiations. That would be good for Microsoft, which has argued that its rivals are trying to clone its most valuable products, including a network-management program called . The EU regulators instead want  Microsoft and its competitors, such as , to hash out the details among themselves, and to settle further disputes in Europe's national courts. Under the plan,  Microsoft's rivals would be encouraged to take Mr. Monti's finding of monopoly abuse to local judges, who can enforce EU decisions against dominant companies," Dow Jones
reported.

More on the EU's plans to let  Microsoft and its competitors choose the remedies for the case: "In order not to touch on IP rights the Commission would delegate the remedies to  Microsoft," an unnamed source told Reuters. "The Commission would probably give the obligation in the form of results to be achieved and leave it up to the party to find the appropriate means." The commissioners would still monitor how Microsoft puts in place any agreed-upon remedies, Reuters said.

The Associated Press outlined the potential ramifications for  Microsoft. "With a decision from the EU
expected as early as mid-March, the U.S. software giant has been seeking to avert what could be a
far-reaching order to change features in its dominant Windows desktop operating system and to reveal
more of its underlying code to rival manufacturers.  Microsoft has said it is continuing to work with the
European Commission toward an amicable settlement. In the case,  Microsoft is trying to avoid a

feared order to unbundle from its Windows operating systems Media Player, a multimedia player that is gaining market share at the expense of rivals led by Such an order could also complicate plans for Microsoft's next version of Windows, code-named . The future operating system is expected to incorporate an Internet search engine that would compete with "

Meanwhile, Monti made clear yesterday that he hasn't ruled out reaching a settlement with  Microsoft. He also said he has set a deadline to end talks with the software giant, though the date has not been made public, Bloomberg and other media outlets reported.

Microsoft clearly hoped to score some positive PR today when it announced a deal with that will let Windows users "sign on to secure network systems through RSA's rather than through a complex series of pass codes. RSA's SecurID, which can be the size of a credit card or a key-chain fob, generates every minute a new six-digit number that is synchronized with central security servers. Corporate computer users with SecurID have to type in a four-digit personal identification number and the fresh SecurID number in order to get access to a corporate computer network," The Wall Street Journal explained.

Reuters said the security feature would initially appeal to businesses. , vice president of marketing at RSA Security "said that corporate information technology departments would no longer have to adopt costly layers of authentication within their networks, such as separate passwords for expensing or Internet access, and could instead rely on a single user authenticated to a Windows program. Windows, which runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, can be password protected, but up to now has never been integrated with a more stringent authentication system like SecurID."

The Microsoft-RSA deal was announced today in conjunction with the annual in San Francisco. On the conference schedule today is none other than  Microsoft Chairman , who is slated to deliver the keynote address. "Gates should have plenty of fodder for his keynote address this morning.  Microsoft itself has been in the news in recent weeks over security breaches, including a new 'critical' flaw in its Internet Explorer and the theft of source code for its Windows operating system," The San Jose Mercury News reported.

Expect a slew of security announcements to come out of the RSA gathering, including anti-hacking news from . The company is showcasing its so-called , which The Mercury News said "is designed to slow the spread of worms, viruses and computer denial-of-service attacks." CNET's News.com has more details on the product and another anti-hacking product: "One service, known as virus throttling, will limit the speed at which viruses and worms can spread by reducing the number of connections an infected
computer can have to the Internet. A second service that HP intends to offer mimics medical vaccinations by placing devices within a network that will continually attack a company's computers with the digital equivalent of dead germs." The San Francisco Chronicle carried a preview piece on the conference in yesterday's edition.
Heavy-hitting backers of voice-over-IP telephone service are uniting to create a new lobbying group -- the
. Top agenda item? No government regulations! , , and are among the group's members.

"The Voice Over Internet Coalition is among the first regulatory advocacy groups for the voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) industry, which has managed so far without much professional lobbying help to avoid being subject to the thicket of state and federal telephone rules. But the has begun drafting a VoIP policy, and more than 25 states have some kind of VoIP regulations either in place or being drawn up," CNET's News.com reported.

More on the no-regulation hurdles VOIP fans face: "To date, the FCC has signaled that VoIP should be as regulation-free as possible. But there are many issues that still need to be resolved and there is concern about the impact of state regulators establishing different and opposing standards, either from each other and the federal government," InternetNews reported. "Three stand out. First, federal law enforcement agencies worry about their ability to quickly and easily wiretap VoIP calls as part of their investigations into terrorist or organized crime activities. Second, the location accuracy of 911 calls made over VoIP. Because the route packet traffic takes over the Internet or private backbone, it may be more difficult to trace. Finally, there is the Universal Service Fund. Paid for by traditional telecoms, which pass the charge onto customers, the fees subsidize phone service for low-income individuals, schools and libraries." USA Today has more on the FCC requiring VOIP providers to handle emergency 911 calls.

Meanwhile, telecom equipment makers are set to benefit from the VOIP frenzy. "During the next year or so, demand for so-called voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) equipment will rise, as AT&T, BT, France Telecom, SBC Communications, Verizon Communications and other service providers begin selling Internet phone services, , an analyst at , said Monday," CNET's News.com reported.
In a less-than-surprising development in the long-running Oracle-PeopleSoft saga, PeopleSoft is urging
its shareholders to reject Oracle's hostile takeover bid for the company. The company said yesterday that

Page 18 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
it started mailing out its proxy materials to its shareholders for the March 25 annual meeting, which urges stockholders vote for the board's "highly qualified director nominees and to reject Oracle Corporation's proposals." Read the letter.

The New York Times reported that "prospects for the bid from Oracle could take a decisive turn well before the PeopleSoft's shareholders meeting, which is scheduled for March 25. The Justice Department is expected to make a final decision by March 2 and perhaps as early as this week on whether it will
block the proposed takeover on  antitrust grounds." Two weeks ago, news reports said the Justice antitrust team has already decided to come down against the Oracle bid, though it's not clear what the department's leaders will decide.

Individual PeopleSoft shareholders aren't the only ones getting lobbied these days. "Oracle Chairman and Co-Presidents and met last week with , the No. 1 proxy advisor to fund managers, seeking a recommendation to support the deal. Shareholder Services said it would meet with PeopleSoft this week," Bloomberg said.

Oracle's hostile takeover bid of PeopleSoft will be the topic-du-jour (along with details about CEO ) when I host a Live Online Web chat on Thursday with , author of "SOFTWAR: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle." The chat begins at 12 p.m. ET, but get a jump on it now by submitting questions in advance.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 24 -- European  antitrust regulators are considering a requirement that  Microsoft
sell two versions of Windows in Europe -- one with the music- and video-playing software stripped out
-- should they find the company to be an abusive monopoly, people close to the case said Tuesday.

Regulators may also demand that  Microsoft itself propose ''within a few months of a ruling'' what computer code for Windows it should disclose to make the operating system fully compatible with programs and servers manufactured by rivals, these people said. Servers drive networks of personal computers.

TD
The European Commission is nearing a final ruling in the five-year-old case. Unless a settlement is reached in the next few weeks, the commission will find that  Microsoft abused its dominant position in operating software and will propose remedies and a  fine of at least $100 million.

The commission has completed an internal review and the proposed ruling against the company, which was written by  competition regulators in January, has emerged ''almost untouched,'' a person close to the case said.

Representatives for the commission and  Microsoft both declined to comment on possible remedies or on the state of negotiations. A  Microsoft spokesman said the company was still pursuing ''an
amicable settlement.''

Last August, the European Commission told Microsoft that its practice of bundling Media Player into Windows amounted to an abuse of the operating system's dominant position because it placed rival music and video players at a disadvantage.

The commission agreed with  Microsoft's rivals, who argue that record companies and Hollywood studios will increasingly tailor their digital products exclusively for  Microsoft's Media Player, because it will be the only player they are sure that people will have on their personal computers.

Microsoft has argued that unbundling Media Player from Windows would prevent the operating
system from working properly. It is also fears the precedent that would be set if it did agree to separate
Media Player from Windows.

A person close to the case said that offering two operating systems in Europe would give customers a choice while allowing Microsoft to keep its business model intact.

During the commission's internal review, Erkki Liikanen, the commissioner for the information society, urged Mario Monti, the commissioner for  competition, to be tougher on  Microsoft over the Media Player issue. But Frits Bolkestein, the commissioner for the internal market, warned Mr. Monti not to infringe Microsoft's intellectual property in the part of the ruling that concerns interoperability, or making the software compatible with rival programs and servers, the person close to the case said.

Page 21 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The draft decision may order  Microsoft to decide what must be disclosed about Windows to ensure interoperability.

Mr. Bolkestein warned that ordering  Microsoft to disclose code, which is protected by copyright and to a lesser extent by patents, could make the commission vulnerable to a legal challenge by the company at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Mr. Bolkestein's responsibilities include creating intellectual property protection laws for the European Union. His department and Mr. Monti's team of  competition regulators have often fought over how far rights holders should be allowed to protect their inventions.

European case law is not clear on the matter. Two cases involving the largest collector of pharmaceutical sales and prescription data in the world, IMS Health of the United States, appear to contradict each other on the question of intellectual property rights.

The European Court of Justice overturned a commission decision from 2001 ordering the company to license the way it organizes drug sales data from the German market, because it said such compulsory licensing amounted to an infringement of the intellectual property rights of IMS. But in a
separate case last year against IMS, a judge said the company might be abusing its dominant position by refusing to license the way it structures its information about the German market.

HD     EU pushes back deadline for final hearings  in Microsoft case as settlement talks continue

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European regulators have pushed back the dates next month for final hearings in the antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. as settlement talks continue, sources familiar with the case said Wednesday.

The closed-door hearings -- where the decision is presented to representatives of the 15 European Union governments -- will be held March 15 and 22 in Brussels, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The original dates were March 3 and 15.

TD
The first hearing gives national regulators a last chance to raise any doubts about the  European              Commission's case, while the second focuses on  fines and other punishments. The decision is usually adopted a day or two after the last hearing.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment. A  Microsoft spokesman said only that the company was still "working actively" with the Commission toward an amicable settlement.

It was not clear whether the delay was to accommodate last-minute negotiations or give the national representatives more time to review the Commission's extensive findings against the company. The draft ruling finds Microsoft abused its dominant position with Windows to gain market share in markets for media players and servers.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Monday that he had set a date for deciding the
5-year-old case, but that a settlement was still possible.

HD     EU pushes back deadline for final hearings  in Microsoft case as settlement talks continue

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European regulators have pushed back the dates next month for final hearings in the antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. as settlement talks continue, sources familiar with the case said Wednesday.

The closed-door hearings -- where the decision is presented to representatives of the 15 European Union governments -- will be held March 15 and 22 in Brussels, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The original dates were March 3 and 15.

TD
The first hearing gives national regulators a last chance to raise any doubts about the  European              Commission's case, while the second focuses on  fines and other punishments. The decision is usually adopted a day or two after the last hearing.
Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment.

It was not clear whether the delay was to accommodate last-minute negotiations or give the national representatives more time to review the Commission's extensive findings against the company. The draft ruling finds Microsoft abused its dominant position with Windows to gain market share in markets for media players and servers.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Monday that he had set a date for deciding the
5-year-old case, but that a settlement was still possible.

Microsoft hopes the case can be settled, according to John Connors, the company's chief financial officer.

"We are very focused on getting things settled and having a good relationship with the (European Union)," Connors said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference in New York, according to Dow Jones Newswires. "Right now, (the EU case) is the most important case for the company, shareholders and customers."

HD      SOFTWARE/COMPETITION: MONTI CONFIRMS DEADLINE SET FOR WRAPPING UP MICROSOFT INVESTIGATION

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti confirmed to journalists late on February 23 that he had set a date for taking a decision in the Microsoft anti-trust case, but would not reveal when it was. Mr Monti declined to say whether he had informed Microsoft of this deadline for wrapping up what has become a high-profile case in the media.

Mr Monti also said that he was not ruling out reaching an amicable settlement with the software giant rather than imposing a heavy  fine on the company. Speaking after a meeting of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (EMAC) in the European Parliament, Mr Monti said: "Until the moment that a decision is taken, nothing is impossible."

TD
The European Commission has been looking into alleged  abuse of dominant market position by Microsoft for almost five years, and is expected to finally wrap up the investigation under Article 81 of the EC Treaty in March, just a few months before Mr Monti steps down from his position as head of the EU's competition watchdog.

Informed sources suggest that it is in both the Commission's interest and in Microsoft's to agree on a series of mutually-acceptable remedies, although few believe that Microsoft will escape a fine altogether.

The final stages of the Commission's investigation hinge on two alleged abuses of the company's dominant position. The first allegation is that, by refusing to reveal technical details of how its software works, Microsoft has made it more difficult for competitors to develop applications that are compatible with the Windows operating system. The second allegation is that the bundling of Media Player with Windows is anti-competitive, and makes it harder for companies such as RealNetworks to find a market for their proprietary media playing software.

HD        Monti must keep his nerve on Microsoft: EURO COMMENT. BY        By BRIAN GROOM

BRIAN GROOM - The next month will tell whether the  European Commission's five-year case against Microsoft ends in compromise or in court. The stakes are high. It is crucial to keep sight of those whom competition policy serves: consumers.

Frits Bolkestein, single market commissioner, has warned against infringing Microsoft's intellectual property rights, which could invite legal challenge. Mario Monti, competition commissioner, will be similarly keen to avoid making a ruling that could be overturned by an injunction.

TD
The Commission believes  Microsoft has abused its dominance in personal computer operating systems. It wants the software giant to give information about its server software to competitors; it also wants it to untie Media Player, used for music and videos, from Windows, or offer alternatives alongside it.

The second issue would set an important precedent and is hardest to resolve. The Commission has so far rejected  Microsoft's offer to include rival products on CD-Roms supplied with personal computers.

Unless there is a settlement, Brussels is set to rule by the end of March. The best outcome for Mr Monti would be one in which Microsoft was fined and agreed to change its products and policies. Another option short of full-scale confrontation would be a "cease and desist" order, demanding an end to the "abuses" but putting the onus on  Microsoft as to how to comply.

It is understandable that Mr Monti, who has had court setbacks, should wish to avoid another. A Commission weakened by defeats would not serve consumers. Neither, though, would an over-cautious one. If he believes his case is strong, he should pursue it.

HD         Microsoft May Get Role Crafting  Remedy --- EU May Allow Company And Rivals to Negotiate
Some Antitrust Resolutions

BRUSSELS -- Regulators are considering allowing  Microsoft Corp. to negotiate remedies with its competitors as Europe's landmark  antitrust case against the software company draws to a close, a person close to the case says.
The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is still planning to  fine Microsoft
for anticompetitive conduct in a part of the case focused on the company's control over software used to
run powerful network computers, this person said. But the commission is mulling whether to let other
remedies be decided between  Microsoft and its competitors to avoid the risk that an EU-imposed
solution could be immediately blocked in court.

TD
Less clear are any possible resolutions of a second part of the EU's case focused on playing music online through Microsoft's Windows operating system.

In a sign that negotiations over the final shape of any decision are continuing, Europe's  antitrust chief, Mario Monti, said Monday that a settlement in the case is "not impossible" even though his officials already have drafted a preliminary ruling finding  Microsoft in breach of European  antitrust law. A final decision is expected by late March or early April, after which  Microsoft may ask Europe's highest appeals court for an injunction to temporarily suspend any remedies.

It is this prospect of an appeal to an increasingly assertive court that makes European regulators cautious in demanding too much proprietary data from  Microsoft in the server-software part of its case. Microsoft's rivals say they need the data to make their software compatible with  Microsoft-run computers.

European antitrust enforcers want to avoid a battle over intellectual-property rights that could give judges ammunition to suspend their decision. Regulators still are smarting from a previous case, when the European Court of First Instance in 2001 slapped an injunction on the EU that stopped regulators from forcing a company to give up valuable data. In that case, Mr. Monti was later forced to concede defeat in a major trans-Atlantic intellectual-property battle by withdrawing a ruling against U.S. pharmaceuticals-data collector IMS Health Inc. Since that setback, Mr. Monti has redoubled efforts to "bulletproof" other high-profile probes in general, including the case involving  Microsoft.

Under one scenario, the person close to the  Microsoft case said, the commission would find  Microsoft guilty, impose a "cease-and-desist" order and impose a  fine for monopoly abuse -- but would stop short of demanding specific proprietary data. That would be good for  Microsoft, which has argued that its rivals are trying to clone its most valuable products, including a network-management program called Active Directory.

Europe's trustbusters instead want  Microsoft and its competitors, including Sun Microsystems Inc., to hash out the details among themselves within a short period -- probably two months following the cease-and-desist order, according to the person close to the case. Such an agreement could pave the way for a second decision by the EU that would be binding on  Microsoft and enforceable before national courts.


Page 28 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Under that plan,  Microsoft's rivals would be encouraged to take the commission's finding of monopoly abuse to local judges, who can enforce European decisions against dominant companies. That would put the burden on  Microsoft to avoid litigation in the national courts or a renewed investigation by the EU by voluntarily yielding further information.

The commission's "idea is to lay the knife on the table and ask Microsoft to apply it themselves," said the person close to the case. But such an outcome may leave Microsoft's rivals, including Sun, unhappy because they want the commission's judgment to require more mandatory disclosures from Microsoft.

Less progress has been made during negotiations seeking to settle the second part of the EU's antitrust case that focuses on multimedia software. So far, regulators are skeptical about the company's offer to place a folder on its computer desktop to inform users of the media and video about options available on accompanying CDs. Such a deal would be less severe for  Microsoft than EU
regulators have so far suggested, and leave its Windows Media Player installed on more than 90% of all new desktop computers. The regulators say that plan doesn't give multimedia rivals, including RealNetworks Inc., a level playing field to compete against software bundled with Windows.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes on Tuesday reiterated that the company still is "working actively with the European Commission toward an amicable settlement of the case."

HD        EU could order 2 versions of Windows  in Europe

BRUSSELS:

As the European Union moves closer to finding  Microsoft to be an abusive monopoly, its  competition commissioner was considering whether to demand that it sell two versions of its Windows operating system in Europe, people close to the case said Tuesday.

TD
In order to increase the competitive standing of the company's rivals, the commissioner, Mario Monti, may order Microsoft to offer one version of Windows with its music and video playing software, Media Player, as it does at present, and another with the software stripped out and sold separately, these people said.

It may also demand that  Microsoft itself propose within a few months of a ruling what computer code for Windows it should reveal in order to make the operating system fully compatible with programs and servers manufactured by rivals, one of the sources said. Servers drive networks of PCs.

These probable remedies would come attached to a negative ruling that brands  Microsoft an abusive monopolist, unless a settlement is reached during the next month to six weeks. A negative ruling is expected to carry with it a  fine of at least $100 million

An internal consultation within the  European Commission has finished, and the proposed negative ruling drafted by the  competition department in January has emerged almost untouched, said the person, who insisted on anonymity.

According to this person, Erkki Liikanen, the EU's commissioner for information society, urged Monti to be tougher on Microsoft over the Media Player issue, while Frits Bolkestein, the commissioner for the internal market, warned Monti not to compromise  Microsoft's intellectual property in trying to resolve what is known as the interoperability issue.

Last August the commission told  Microsoft that its practice of bundling Media Player into Windows amounted to an  abuse of the operating system's dominant position because it placed rival music and video players at a disadvantage.

The commission agreed with  Microsoft's rivals, who argue that firms offering content, like record companies and Hollywood studios, will increasingly tailor their products exclusively for  Microsoft's Media Player, because it will be the only player they are sure that people will have on their PCs.

Microsoft has argued that unbundling Media Player from Windows would prevent the operating system from working properly. It is also fears a harmful precedent would be set if it did agree to separate Media Player from Windows.

Future software products, like an Internet search engine that Microsoft plans to start to compete with the popular Google engine, are premised on the bundling strategy Microsoft has employed with its most successful software products including Internet Explorer, Word and Outlook Express.

Another person close to the case said the two operating systems solution would ensure consumer choice, while allowing  Microsoft to preserve its existing business model.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission will discuss draft conclusions to its  Microsoft Corp antitrust probe with representatives of competition authorities from all 15 member states on March 15, said a source close to the case.

But the issue of the size of the  fine expected to be levied on  Microsoft will not be raised with member states until a second meeting, the source told Agence France-Presse.

TD
The first meeting had originally been scheduled for March 3 but was then postponed to allow the commission further time to formulate its conclusions, notably on the issue of intellectual property rights.

Sources told AFX News earlier this week that the commission decision will be announced at the end of March, and that EU  competition regulators will give software giant more leeway than previously expected in terms of how it resolves  antitrust violations.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 25 --  Antitrust regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union will gather here on March 15 to discuss a  European Commission antitrust ruling against Microsoft, a diplomat close to one national regulator said on Wednesday.

The commission has drafted a preliminary ruling that finds  Microsoft guilty of abusing the dominant position of its Windows operating system -- a finding that is expected to be supported by the national regulators, the diplomat said.

A second meeting will be convened within a week to discuss corrective measures to impose on Microsoft. The second gathering of the so-called advisory committee will also discuss how much to fine the company.

The commission typically makes a final ruling a few days after the second meeting. This ruling may come on March 23 or 24. The commission, which decides the timing of these meetings, declined to comment.

Microsoft violated antitrust law on two counts, according to the draft ruling. By tying its music and video player software into Windows,  Microsoft put rivals at an unfair competitive disadvantage. And by withholding information about how Windows works, the company hindered competitors in the market for server software that runs networks.

Microsoft's own server software works better with Windows on PC's than rivals' server systems do, the commission found. Mario Monti, Europe's chief  antitrust regulator, wants  Microsoft to propose what computer code in Windows should be disclosed to ensure that rival programs and servers are compatible.

To end what it says are violations, the commission wants  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows: one with Windows Media Player stripped out and sold separately, and the other with the software included, a person close to the case has said.  Microsoft still hopes to settle the case.

The European antitrust matter ''is the most important case for the company, shareholders and customers,'' Microsoft's chief financial officer, John Connors, said, according to Dow Jones.

HD        Microsoft probed by Japan's anti-trust agency. BY       BY FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTERS

Microsoft became the target of an investigation by Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog on suspicions it breached rules of fair  competition when negotiating software licences with Japanese computer makers.

Japan's Fair Trade Commission said on Thursday it suspected  Microsoft imposed inappropriate, restrictive conditions in contracts it signed with Japanese PC makers licensing them to use its latest Windows XP operating system.

TD
The agency raided the Tokyo headquarters of Microsoft's Japanese division and began on-site inspections on Thursday morning. A spokesperson for Microsoft Japan confirmed FTC officials were at the company's headquarters but had no other details.

The probe in Japan opens a new front in the anti-trust battle being waged against  Microsoft. In Europe, Microsoft is trying to settle an antit-trust lawsuit by the European Commission which made a preliminary conclusion the company violated European competition law by refusing to give rivals information that would allow their servers to work better with Windows-driven PCs. In the suit, the Commission also accuses Microsoft of illegally "tying" its Media Player program to the rest of Windows.

Unless it reaches a settlement,  Microsoft could face hundreds of millions of euros in  fines in March when the Commission is expected to make a final decision on how to penalise the company.

The remedies the Commission are proposing for  Microsoft to adapt its behaviour could go further than a settlement in 2001-2002 to a case brought against the group by the US government.

In 1998, Japan's FTC issued a notice to  Microsoft, accusing it of pushing computer makers to sell computers bundled with  Microsoft's software as a package deal.

ECB OF THE FUTURE? The secretive bank is opening up, at least about the design of its new home.

Since its inception in 1998, the European Central Bank has refused to publish voting records and minutes of meetings, a standard practice at the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England. But now ECB watchers can read online an account of a meeting held in August to determine which architect will build the bank's new headquarters. The minutes of the meeting of ECB and other officials, released as part of the bank's pledge to be more open, are quite frank about flaws of some designs.

TD
The proposal by a Finnish architect was deemed "conventional." The committee criticized a proposed leaning tower by a Danish architect because it didn't "reflect the values for which the ECB stands" and wouldn't convey the "appropriate image." The panel selected three finalists. The ECB's entire governing council and the city of Frankfurt will make a final decision on the winning design, expected later this year.

But it remains very unlikely that the ECB will publish minutes of its interest-rate discussions. The bank says that a monthly statement following meetings is all the information the public needs to understand its decisions.
NUCLEAR DISPUTE: Who will get to host the world's first large-scale nuclear-fusion reactor?

The European Parliament is up in arms over Washington's decision to back Japan instead of France -- the European Union's favorite -- as a site for the 10 billion euro project. "I wouldn't put it past the U.S. to use this as a way of punishing France for its lack of cooperation in the war on Iraq," says Eryl McNally,
a British Socialist member of the European Parliament. Rolf Linkohr, another MEP, went even further, suggesting France should "ask for the Statue of Liberty back." For its part, Washington says it favors the Japanese bid because it is technically superior.

Why did the EU back France in the first place? Critics say Spain came up with a better project, which would have been cheaper to build and would have been located in an area with no earthquake risks, unlike the French plan.

However, because of France's political influence in the EU, Paris secured the EU backing for the project, prompting Spain to withdraw its candidacy.

DEADLINE LOOMING: Romania must speed up democratic revisions to join the EU during 2007, parliament says.

On a visit to Brussels, Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase promises to unveil a "to-do list with a clear agenda". After meeting European Parliament President Pat Cox Wednesday, Mr. Nastase says "we have learned what the major concerns are."

The concerns, detailed in a parliamentary report last week, include corruption, political interference with the justice system, a lack of media freedom and police abuses. Romania is sitting out the first wave of
Page 39 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
EU expansion into Central and Eastern Europe in May, but hopes to be ready for membership by 2007, along with neighbor Bulgaria.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization also had raised concerns about Romania's democratic credentials but ultimately decided to invite Romania into the military alliance, among seven Eastern European nations joining this year.

GYPSY TROUBLES: Slovakia, due to join the EU on May 1, has mobilized its largest police deployment since the communist era to put down violent protests in Gypsy camps throughout the country. Gypsies, also known as Roma, have vandalized businesses and homes in response to a government effort to cut welfare benefits for unemployed families. Police used a water cannon to disperse a crowd in Trebisov. Roma make up about 9% of the country's 5.4 million people, with the poorest living in settlements
where there are almost no jobs.

CRUNCH TIME: European regulators have set dates for final hearings in the landmark  antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. The closed-door sessions -- for representatives of the EU's 15 national governments -- will be held March 15 and 22 in Brussels. The hearings will give EU member states the last chance to raise doubts about the  European Commission's case and to comment on  fines and other punishments. The commission originally wanted hearings on March 3 and 15. People close to the case say the commission may want more time to negotiate with  Microsoft and to give EU representatives plenty of time to review the commission's findings against the company.

HD       Final Microsoft ruling  taking shape EU may order firm to also offer stripped-down version  of

BRUSSELS:

European Union  antitrust regulators are considering a requirement that  Microsoft sell two versions of Windows in the region one with the music- and video-playing software stripped out should they find the company to be an abusive monopoly, according to people close to the case.

TD
Regulators may also demand that  Microsoft itself propose within a few months of a ruling what software code for Windows it should disclose to help its rivals make their programs and hardware fully compatible with the operating system, these people said Tuesday.

The European Commission is nearing a final ruling in the five- year-old case. Unless a settlement is reached in the next few weeks, the commission is expected to find that  Microsoft abused its dominant position in operating software and to propose remedies and a  fine of at least $100 million

Representatives for the commission and Microsoft declined to comment on possible remedies or on the state of negotiations. In August, the European Commission told Microsoft that its practice of bundling Media Player into Windows amounted to an abuse of the operating system's dominant position because it placed rival music and video players at a disadvantage.

Microsoft has argued that unbundling Media Player from Windows would prevent the operating system from working properly. It also fears the precedent that would be set if it did agree to separate Media Player from Windows.

A person close to the case said that offering two operating systems in Europe would give customers a choice while allowing Microsoft to keep its business model largely intact.

During the commission's internal review, Erkki Liikanen, commissioner for the information society, urged Mario Monti, the commissioner for  competition, to be tougher on  Microsoft over the Media Player issue. But, the person close to the case said, Frits Bolkestein, the commissioner for the internal market, warned Monti not to infringe on  Microsoft's intellectual property in the part of the ruling that concerns making the operating system compatible with rival software and computer servers.

Bolkestein warned that ordering  Microsoft to disclose software code, which is protected by copyright and to a lesser extent by patents, could make the commission vulnerable to a legal challenge.

It has been reported in the French press that the European Commission will discuss draft conclusions to its  Microsoft Corpantitrust probe with representatives of competition authorities from all 15 member states on March 15.

But the issue of the size of the  fine expected to be levied on  Microsoft will not be raised with member states until a second meeting, according to sources.

TD
The first meeting had originally been scheduled for March 3, but was postponed to allow the commission further time to formulate its conclusions, especially on the issue of intellectual property rights.
The commission decision is expected to be announced at the end of March.

It has also been suggested that the EU  competition regulators may give the software giant more leeway than previously expected in terms of how it resolves  antitrust violations.

European regulators considered forcing  Microsoft Corp. to change how it sells its Windows computer operating system around the world but decided to limit the draft order to Europe to avoid charges of overreaching, sources familiar with the case said.

The possibility was discussed just before the decision was sent electronically to the 15 European Union national  antitrust offices last Friday for final review, the sources said on condition of anonymity.

TD
Initially there was no reference to geographic scope -- an omission noticed while it was circulating this month among other branches of the EU's executive commission for discussion.

While some in Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's circle then argued for making it global, others with responsibility for trade and single-market issues warned that doing so could make the EU look hypocritical on the issue of "extraterritoriality" -- a sore subject for the United States especially.

Most recently, the EU was outraged when the United States established accounting and corporate governance rules after the Enron Corp. scandal that, among other things, established a federal oversight board for the accounting industry -- including non-U.S. firms that audit U.S.-listed companies.
EU officials accused Washington of seeking to extend its jurisdiction to Europe.

The European Commission was criticized by Bush administration officials in 2001 when it blocked a merger of two U.S. companies -- General Electric Corp. and Honeywell Inc. -- that had already been cleared in Washington. Although the deal was abandoned, GE challenged the EU's decision in European courts.

In the Microsoft case, Monti decided to limit the scope in the draft decision to Europe, believing that would still be a big enough market to have an impact on the U.S. software giant, sources said.

Spokesman Reijo Kemppinen sought yesterday to dispel reports of divisions in the 20-member commission about the  Microsoft ruling, which is expected to be issued as soon as next month unless a settlement is reached.
"There has been no fighting and no bloody noses," he said.
The draft decision finds that  Microsoft violated EU  competition law by bundling its media player into
Windows and by failing to provide competitors in the server market with enough programming code
to make their products operate as well with Windows as  Microsoft's own.

Sources said the European Commission intends to fine Microsoft and set standards for server interoperability that Microsoft will have to meet, while allowing Microsoft to work out the details of how to meet them.

HD     Anti-trust probe for Microsoft in Japan: Company's main offices  raided in Tokyo. Investigations of dominant player in software  industry spread to third continent

TOKYO

Microsoft Corp. is being investigated by Japanese authorities over its dominance in supplying software for personal computers, extending anti-trust probes into the company to a third continent.

TD
Eight officials from the Fair Trade Commission raided  Microsoft's Tokyo main offices yesterday, seeking details on its contract with computer makers, said Masashi Shinbo, a Tokyo- based spokesperson for Microsoft, whose software powers about 95 per cent of PCs.
"Our contract is legal," Shinbo said.
Authorities are investigating whether Redmond, Washington- based  Microsoft's licensing of Windows XP
software violates anti- monopoly laws.

It presents another regulatory hurdle for  Microsoft, which in 2001 settled with U.S. anti-trust authorities after a three-year probe.

The European Union accused  Microsoft of abusing its dominance to stifle  competition and is planning to make a decision next month after a five-year probe.

"Microsoft is the dominant player, and there is the fear other companies cannot break through because its programs" are ubiquitous, said Keichi Nakamura, who helps manage about $1 billion in foreign equities, including  Microsoft, at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.

Japan represents the world's third-largest market for PCs. Computer makers such as Sony Corp., NEC Corp. and Toshiba Corp. load Windows XP, available in Japan since November 2001, during production.
The software is used to run other programs, such as Internet browsers or word processors. PC sales in
Japan probably will rise 6.5 per cent this year, to 13.7 million units, market researcher IDC Japan says.

The trade commission is investigating a provision in  Microsoft's licensing terms that stipulates that computer and device makers that license  Microsoft's Windows XP and CE programs and related patents won't later sue  Microsoft or each other claiming that Windows violates their patents,  Microsoft said in a statement.

The provision was reviewed and approved by the  European Commission in 2001 and the U.S. Justice Department in the mid- 1990s,  Microsoft said. The company said it believes the provision is lawful in Japan.

"They can't get any peace," said Jane Snorek, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Asset Management in Milwaukee, which controls $110 billion in funds, including  Microsoft shares. "Every country has got something to complain about. It just goes on and on."

The Japanese government is working with Korea and China to develop a version of the Linux operating system to rival Windows.

The European Commission, the Brussels-based regulatory arm of the European Union, has accused Microsoft of illegally using Windows to control markets in operating systems for larger computers and for audio-video software.

Microsoft faces millions of euros in  fines as early as next month and the cost of court battles unless it settles with European officials on remedies.

Microsoft has said it wants a settlement similar to that reached with the U.S. Department of Justice on anti-monopoly investigations in 2001.
European officials have argued the U.S settlement was ineffective.

Microsoft Senior Vice President Will Poole said yesterday he is "optimistic" about settling with the
European Commission to end the case.

SEATTLE (AP) - In the fall of 2002,  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates stood on stage at Hollywood's Kodak

By 2010, Gates told an audience that included director James Cameron and musician LL Cool J, everything from paying bills to seeing movies "will be done on a digital basis, and the PC with its magic software will play the central role."

He then proceeded to unveil what  Microsoft considers a key part of that vision: a half-billion dollar upgrade to the Windows Media Player for music, movies and other digital content.
Eighteen months later, Gates' endeavor could be facing a big roadblock.

If Microsoft cannot settle an  antitrust case brought by European Union regulators, the company may be ordered to remove Windows Media Player as an integrated feature of the dominant Windows operating system, at least for personal computers sold in Europe.

The European Commission also could order Microsoft to include rival media players with Windows to make those products as easy for users to access as Microsoft's own music and video player.

Microsoft has said it is certain to appeal any ruling against it. Still, the European case could hinder
Microsoft's efforts to dominate an emerging and important technology market.

"There's a lot at stake here, because it's becoming increasingly evident to most everyone that the computer is becoming more of a media-centric device," said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.

Removing the media player from Windows may help level the playing field for competitors such as RealNetworks' RealOne player and Apple's QuickTime, Leigh said, while also costing  Microsoft its default advantage.

In the fierce  competition for what type of technology people use to do things like listen to music and watch movies on computers,  Microsoft's primary weapon is its ability to ensure its format is found on millions of PCs every year, said Rob Helm, director of research for independent analysts Directions on Microsoft.
Now, he said, "the European Union could throw a wrench in that."

A negative ruling also could weigh on  Microsoft's planned next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. That system, which may not be available until 2006 or later, is scheduled to incorporate even more new features, such as a built-in search engine that could compete with Google, Yahoo and other companies.

Legal battles over such features might become more likely if the EU forbade  Microsoft from tying its media player to its operating system, Helm said.

The European regulators already have prepared a draft decision that finds  Microsoft violated
competition law on two counts: by bundling its media player into Windows, and by failing to provide rivals
in the server market with enough information for their products to operate as well with Windows as
Microsoft's own applications.
In addition to the penalties regarding the media player, the company also could be asked to pay hefty
fines and to release more details on the blueprints for server software.

The EU has said it could decide the long-running case as early as this month.  Microsoft has said repeatedly it hopes to settle, but analysts believe there is only so much the company is willing to concede.

"They will not agree to a settlement that forces them to change their strategy with what they're doing with the media player," said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner Inc.

Smith believes the company may be more willing to give competitors more information about its server software, however.

Microsoft argues that extracting the media player would be technologically difficult since the programming code is intertwined with the operating system and cannot simply be plucked out without harming Windows' performance.  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said that including rival players would be complicated and might create security problems.

Although a ruling against  Microsoft may be a hindrance, most experts think  Microsoft would successfully find other ways to make its media player available, such as over the Internet.

Microsoft also would still have the advantage that its media player looks familiar to users of Windows, which runs on about 90 percent of the world's computers, Leigh noted.

Helm said the larger issue may be whether any one company can "win" the digital media marketplace -- as Microsoft has with its dominant role in Internet browsers and operating systems -- or whether consumers will continue to use various different players.

In the United States, Windows Media Player currently controls about 34 percent of the market, compared with nearly 19 percent for RealOne player and 10 percent for QuickTime player, according to January data from Nielsen/NetRatings.
Will Poole, a senior vice president at  Microsoft who has worked extensively with the Windows Media
Player, concedes that customers may never choose just one type of player.
"This is not," he said, "a winner-take-all type of market."

SUMMARY

The law provides adequate protection of property and contractual rights, including guarantees against expropriation, but institutions for enforcement are weak. This is especially apparent in commercial law, with judges demonstrating little grasp of new laws. The reform of the judicial system has yet to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, which is compromised by executive interference. The risk of foreign investors being subject to discrimination is low, but public procurement procedures have suffered from a lack of transparency that has benefited domestic companies. The adoption of new public procurement procedures and the introduction of a right of appeal in the award of public contracts will help. The legal framework of  competition policy is almost complete, but enforcement is inadequate. The risk of price
controls being re-imposed is small. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index will continue to fall as the energy sector is deregulated, restructured and privatised in 2004-05.
ANALYSIS
* Red tape is pervasive and a major impediment to business (High risk).

The bureaucracy and the difficulties of dealing with it can vary greatly between regions and sectors, but overall Romania is one of the most difficult countries in the region in which to do business without resorting to bribery. It can take from 49 to 102 days to register a new company: 83 pages of forms have to be completed (in the US it takes a day and 7 pages). It can take an excessive amount of time to secure the necessary zoning permits, property titles, licenses and utility connections. Regulations change frequently and without advance notice. These changes can add significantly to costs and make it difficult to develop effective business plans. The bureaucracy can be a significant burden for foreign investors, but it can be handled by following a few rules of thumb. It is helpful to work with a local Romanian partner to alleviate some of these problems. Investors can also be selective about where they locate: Timisoara in Transylvania has become a favoured location for foreign business and Bucharest has improved under the present City Hall regime. The mayor of Bucharest, Traian Basescu, has opened a one-stop shop for investors in City Hall: previously investors needed 13 permits, collected in person from 13 different offices, to operate in Bucharest.

* Foreign investors are disadvantaged by a lack of transparency in forthcoming major privatisations (High risk).

The state privatisation agency, APAPS, faces thousands of court challenges in disputes arising from previous privatisations. The numbers reflect the ease with which interested parties, including workers and managers as well as buyers, can take legal action. More than one hundred of these cases involve serious attempts to cancel privatisation contracts. There have been a number of recent controversial cases of cancelled privatisations involving foreign investors, as well as instances in which the process has been less than transparent. The government is under pressure from the IMF to change its overall attitude towards privatisation, and to avoid imposing conditions to preserve employment or rapidly increase investments in privatised companies. Checking commitments on employment and investment, and suing non- performing firms, has become one of the main activities of the state privatisation agency. Frequent
delays in privatisation deals and changes in the terms of privatisation in other cases, have also heightened concerns about transparency. Although the law guarantees equal treatment to domestic and foreign investors, in practice the lack of transparency of the regulatory system has often worked against
non-locals. Investors should insist that forthcoming sales be handled in a transparent way and in line with international standards.
BACKGROUND Enforceability of Contracts
Most of the legal framework of a market economy is in place in Romania. However, the institutions to implement or enforce it are either weak or have not yet been established. Romanian law thus affords adequate protection of property and contractual rights, but the legal system is unable to arbitrate effectively property rights and contractual disputes. Foreign companies often express concern about the
lack of international commercial experience of Romanian courts. Judges generally have little experience of the functioning of a market economy, international business methods or the application of new commercial laws. The weakness of the judicial system is particularly apparent with regard to commercial law. Romania's bankruptcy law contains provisions for the liquidation of bankrupt enterprises that are
consistent with Western legal standards, but the lack of qualified personnel hampers the application of law. Although it is possible to pursue administrative liquidation as an alternative to bankruptcy--thus saving the company and creditors a lengthy and costly judicial process--the lack of legal personnel means it is hard to get these cases into court and to obtain consistent judgements.

Other problems reflect the failure to determine who are the legal owners of assets--this is a particular problem with regard to land--and the continued failure to settle property-restitution claims dating from before the communist period. There are a large number of outstanding cases involving property nationalised during the communist period, with Romania having done less to resolve these claims than any other non- Soviet Eastern-bloc country. This undoubtedly causes some uncertainty, but it is of limited concern to foreign investors: since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 there have no cases of foreign assets being expropriated. The Stimulation of Direct Investment Law includes a guarantee against nationalisation and expropriation of assets, and allows investors to choose the court or arbitration body they want to settle any potential legal action.
Independence of the Judiciary

Romania has made progress in reforming its legal system in recent years, but much remains to be done to improve the independence of the judiciary. The involvement of the executive in judicial affairs continues to be a problem. For example, in March 2001 the Ministry of Justice sent a circular letter to courts asking them to pay attention to the social consequences in cases involving the restitution of nationalised houses. The Ministry of Justice also wields great influence over the Superior Council of Magistracy, which makes decisions about the transfer or removal of judges, as the former appoints one-third of Council members
and the Minister chairs its meetings. During the first half of 2001 a number of court presidents and
vice-presidents were removed from their posts without clear reasons being given. Also, the Constitutional
Court's decisions may be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the parliament, which constitutes a serious
infringement of judicial independence.

Measures have been taken by the government to improve the efficiency of the judicial system. A revised version of the Civil Procedure Code came into force in April 2001, aimed at speeding up legal proceedings and improving the enforcement of judicial decisions, with disciplinary action now a possibility where unexplained delays take place. In a separate measure, the government made it necessary for judges to publish a reasoning for all their decisions (previously this was necessary only in cases involving appeals to higher courts).
However, a few of the changes in the Civil Procedure Code have raised concern. The overburdened
Supreme Court has been given additional tasks (hearing appeals in commercially significant cases) and

Page 52 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the process of simplifying procedures has restricted greatly the right to appeal in certain cases. Also of concern is the extension of the Prosecutor- General's right to introduce extraordinary appeals against judicial decisions. This provision already existed in Romanian law but an Emergency Ordinance extends the period (from six months to one year) during which extraordinary appeals can be brought; allows extraordinary appeals to be made before all other legal avenues have been exhausted; and makes the right to introduce such appeals more discretionary (they can now be exercised against "obviously ungrounded judicial decisions", an ill-defined criterion). This is a concern as the extension of such extraordinary procedures risks undermining the principle of legal certainty.

The lack of competence of many members of the judiciary and their relatively low status is another concern. Magistrates continue to rank among the best paid public officials, but changes in the wages policy means that this preference is being eroded. Unlike other public employees, magistrates did not receive a wage adjustment in 2001 to compensate for inflation. Low wages make judges susceptible to bribery. Training for judges is improving: the initial training period has been extended to two years with effect from academic year 2001/02 and the training programmes broadened--but attention needs to be given to intensifying training in the specific fields of anti-trust and state aid legislation. Preserving the National Institute of Magistracy as the sole entry point for a career as a judge and granting it
self-governing status are important in developing an independent and professional judiciary.

Corruption is a widespread and systemic problem that undermines the legal system, the economy and public confidence in government. A study published by the World Bank in March 2001 found that corruption and bribery have become institutionalised in Romania and Transparency International ranked Romania 69 out of 90 countries in 2001 (with the 90th country being the most corrupt). Frequent changes
in legal regulations and their discretionary interpretation by public officials encourages corruption. The civil service is over-staffed and underpaid and highly susceptible to corruption, with a culture of bribe-taking being pervasive. In a recent survey, 51% of Romanian companies revealed that they frequently had to provide bribes to run their business. Reports on the funding of all political parties have indicated that expenditure (especially election expenditure) is substantially higher than declared revenue. In order to address this potential source of corruption, Romania needs to adopt a fully transparent system of party funding.

Despite a general recognition of the seriousness of the problem, and its negative impact on the business environment, measures to tackle the problem by successive governments have been limited and ineffective. A new law on the prevention and punishment of acts of corruption came into force in May
2000, designed to penalise corrupt behaviour in the private sector that distorts  competition. A special
Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Unit was set up within the Prosecutor-General's office in October
2000, with the task of leading the fight against corruption. However, it has never functioned due to a lack
of staff and equipment. Secondary legislation detailing institutional arrangements for the anti- corruption
section has not yet been adopted and as a result there has been virtually no progress in implementing the
anti-corruption law. Out of 38 posts for prosecutors, less than half are filled. The division of tasks among
the various bodies involved in tackling corruption remains unclear, and co-ordination among them needs to
be improved. Just about the only positive development in the fight against corruption was the adoption, in
April 2001, of an ordinance introducing public procurement procedures and establishing the right to appeal
against the award of public contracts.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

The foreign investment regime is liberal and foreign companies are subject to little active discrimination. The law commits Romania to equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors, provides protection against nationalisation and expropriation and guarantees the right of foreign investors to repatriate profits. Foreign investors may participate in privatisation bids and there are no limits set on the level of permitted foreign participation in commercial companies.

Although there are no specific restrictions on inward direct investment, the law is ambiguous and open-ended regarding "sensitive" sectors where prior authorisation can be imposed through "special laws." The constitution forbids the purchase of real estate by non-nationals. However, companies
established in the country, even if wholly foreign- owned, can purchase land for the purposes of business, although they are prohibited from purchasing agricultural land. In law, domestic and foreign enterprises are treated equally in terms of public procurement, but in practice bidding procedures have suffered from a
lack of transparency. Sales of state assets to foreigners have often been stymied by vested interests or become subject to political wrangling within government. The adoption, in April 2001, of an ordinance introducing public procurement procedures and establishing the right to appeal against the award of public contracts should alleviate some of these problems.

Following an agreement with the international financial institutions, discretionary incentives for foreign investors were abolished in 1999, but investors were compensated with the introduction of major tax cuts in corporate tax (reduced from 38% to 25%), VAT (reduced to 19% from a standard rate of 22%) and
Page 53 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
excise duty (revised and still at a lower level than minimum rates in the EU) at the start of 2000. However, several tax initiatives aimed at promoting investment have been introduced, and in July 2001 a law on the promotion of investments came into force. The law covers large-scale investments and grants tax exemptions and fiscal facilities for cash greenfield projects that exceed US$1m, and includes other measures to improve the business environment.

As well as the incentives for large investors, Romania's six free-trade zones all offer customs and tax incentives. These include unrestricted entry and re-export of goods, as well as exemption from customs duties and value-added tax. They also include an exemption from profit taxes for the duration of a company's operations in free-trade zones. There are also concessions made in "disadvantaged zones" (regions with high unemployment), including full restitution of import duties for depreciable goods; exemption from profit tax; exemption from any fees associated with re-zoning of agricultural land for industrial purposes; and access to a special development fund for stimulating exports, guaranteeing external credits, and financing special programmes and state-sponsored equity investments.

The most significant impediment to foreign investors is Romania's unpredictable legal and regulatory system. Excessive red tape makes any investment unnecessarily time-consuming and costly. There is now a robust framework of  competition law, which forbids price fixing,  abuse of market position and lays
down guidelines for the behaviour of monopolies. However, the lack of regulatory transparency, combined with the lack of transparency in the privatisation of state assets, continues to work against the interests of foreign investors. Some improvement can be expected given that the government is prioritising investment promotion as part of its national industrial strategy, in particular through the simplification of legal and administrative procedures. The authorities have created a new government department for relations with foreign investors, which will act as a one-stop shop for investments above US$10m.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Romania has made great progress in creating a legal framework in the area of  competition policy that is broadly aligned with the EU's aquis communautaire (the body of EU law). However, the legal framework is still incomplete and enforcement is inadequate.

After more than a decade of transition, the private sector is still under-developed and state enterprises continue to play a major role in many sectors of the economy, such as the utilities, finance and manufacturing. State support for loss-making state enterprises continues to distort the investment environment and prevents the efficient allocation of capital. A new law on state aid came into effect in January 2000, aimed at regulating and controlling the provision of state aid (in the form of direct state subsidies, debt rescheduling and favourable prices). However, implementation of the law has been slow, and the granting of preferential debt rescheduling for state-owned enterprises continues to undermine attempts to create a more competitive business environment. The existing legislation covers the basic principles of state aid control, but the field of application of the law is not comprehensive and numerous state aid measures are not notified to the  competition authorities. The national state aid monitoring authority is the  Competition Office, which operates under the authority of the Ministry of Public Finance. The investigative and decision-making body is the Competition Council, which dealt with 72 state aid cases in 2000, and has broad powers to enforce competition rules. However, the state aid authorities were not consulted systematically on all state aid measures and in some cases their opinions were not observed by the government. Romania needs to adopt the required secondary legislation on state aids (now under preparation) as a precondition for effective enforcement activity. A large number of unaligned state aid schemes remains, such as the profit tax rate of 6% on export earnings and the law on direct investment promotion. Implementation of state aid policy in sensitive areas is still at an early stage.

In the field of anti-trust law, Romania's legislation is largely in line with, and covers most of, the acquis provisions. However, further secondary legislation still needs to be adopted. The enforcement record of the Competition Council has improved. In 2000, the Council Board handled 437 cases, including two prohibition decisions concerning vertical restraints and horizontal co-operation agreements. However, the Council needs to focus its resources more effectively on cases that present the most serious distortion to competition. A more deterrent sanctioning policy is also necessary. General transparency, including improved public access to relevant documents, needs to increase.
Intellectual Property Rights

Romania has enacted legislation protecting patents, trademarks and copyrights, but the unlicensed use of intellectual property--in particular the piracy of compact discs and CD-ROMs--remains a problem due to weak enforcement. Romania fails to provide its border and other authorities sufficient legal authority, resources and tools to combat the widespread piracy of copyrighted works. This inadequate enforcement against copyright piracy led to Romania being placed on the US government's Special 301 Watch List in
2002. The  European Commission has repeatedly criticised Romania's record on safeguarding intellectual property rights, as has the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA).

Page 54 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There has been some improvement in recent years. The video piracy rate, which was once estimated at
100%, has fallen to about 60% due to more vigorous police action and the entry of legitimate businesses
into the market in 2000. Since the implementation of copyright law, the piracy rate for business software is
estimated to have declined from a high of 95% in the early 1990s. According to the Global Piracy Report of
the Business Software Alliance, a private-sector industry group supported by  Microsoft and other major
players, 70% of software in use in Romania was not licensed. In dollar terms, this amounted to an
estimated US$25.5m in lost revenue to the software makers. However, Romanian criminal courts have
concluded very few cases concerning copyright and related rights. Furthermore, the deterrence effect of
the financial penalties for non- compliance is limited because they are constantly being eroded by inflation.
A new bill under consideration by the Romanian Copyright Office (ORDA) will provide for higher  fines of
US$500-5,000, grant a sui generis right to database producers for 15 years, extend the software copyright
protection period from 50 to 70 years and introduce special regulations regarding intellectual property
rights for materials available on the Internet.
Price Controls

There is little threat of price controls being imposed. Most price controls were abolished in 1997, and the government will resist calls for their reinstatement unless there is a severe economic crisis. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index is 18%, of which 9% are energy prices. These remaining price controls create large distortions, which can be costly to the economy. Thus the decision by the previous government to cap energy prices at their August 2000 levels had a deleterious impact on enterprise sector financial discipline. In order to bring energy prices above cost recovery levels, electricity and energy prices for household consumption increased by 6% and 15% in April and July 2001, respectively. Under its agreement with the IMF, the government is committed to a series of further adjustments in energy prices in 2002-03, which are required to reduce the losses of the main
thermoelectric power producer. The deregulation, restructuring and privatisation of the energy sector is the centrepiece of the government's stand-by programme with the IMF, which aims gradually to eliminate state subsidies and improve tariff collection.

The fixed-line telephony market was liberalised on January 1st 2003, breaking the monopoly of the national operator, Romtelecom, in which the Greek company OTE has a 53% stake, after acquiring an additional 18% share in November 2002. Twenty operators (including companies from Europe, the US and Asia) and four state-owned operators, including Romania Post, are interested in entering the market. Romtelecom's monopoly position had contributed to high tariffs, low levels of penetration, and a
consequent high level of usage of mobile phones, particularly on long-distance calls, where charges were comparable with fixed-line charges. Increased  competition forced Romtelecom to reduce tariffs for
long-distance calls in early 2003, although it increased charges for local calls. Liberalisation is expected to result in a fall in tariffs of at least 30% (and perhaps up to 50%) in 23 major cities, and an increase in telephone-line density.

An Irish court is set this month to decide whether farmers violated  antitrust law by blocking the import of foreign grain. Whatever the outcome, the ruling will mark a legal milestone: the first criminal antitrust case to be tried in a country that until 1991 barely regulated  competition. And for the Irish Competition Authority, it's a sign of how much its influence has grown over the past decade.
The decision in the grain import case, scheduled to be released on March 9, exposes six farmers to  fines
of as much as Â¤3,000. The ICA investigated the case before referring it to a public prosecutor.

TD
Ten years ago, the ICA was a sleepy agency with a dozen employees, zero enforcement powers, and hardly any visibility. Its main mandate was to act as a sort of goodwill ambassador and proselytize about the competitive advantages of doing business in Ireland. Now, to hold on to that business, the ICA, under the lead of its chairman John Fingleton, has undergone a makeover. The mission: to stop  antitrust violators and assure companies that the Irish playing field remains level.

"The ICA was actually a pretty demoralized and underresourced agency . . . when John Fingleton took over," says Gerald FitzGerald, head of the European Union and  competition law practice at Dublin's McCann FitzGerald. "Since then they have recruited people with good experience and have a new budget. Things have changed for the better."

Two of those new people are veteran American  antitrust practitioners Terry Calvani and Edward Henneberry. In May 2002 the ICA tapped Calvani, a partner in Pillsbury Winthrop's Washington, D.C., office, to join the five-member ICA as director of the cartels division. Calvani brought almost 30 years of antitrust experience to the organization. Last September, Calvani was joined by Henneberry, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Howrey Simon Arnold & White and former U.S. Department of Justice antitrust prosecutor, who became the director of the ICA's mergers division.

The two American lawyers have joined the ICA at a crucial juncture. A few months after Calvani arrived, the Competition Act of 2002 went into effect. The law put the ICA in charge of overseeing mergers and gave it new criminal enforcement resources. Those powers will expand yet again in May, when national competition authorities like the ICA will begin regulating trade issues between E.U. states instead of handling only domestic matters.

"In terms of  competition law and enforcement, it's a very interesting time to be practicing in Ireland," says Helen Kelly, head of the European Community,  competition, and regulatory law group at Dublin's Matheson Ormbsy Prentice. "Clients have a heightened awareness of  competition law."

In recent months the ICA has investigated claims of uncompetitive practices in practically every sector of the Irish economy. "People would probably say that many professions need more room for entry," says FitzGerald, of McGann FitzGerald. "People would welcome the ICA undertaking these studies." While Ireland has yet to send an  antitrust violator to jail, jail time and  fines as large as Â¤4 million or 10 percent of the company's revenue are possible.

Ireland's need for a strong competition policy dates back to the booming nineties, the days of the Celtic Tiger economy. Companies like Microsoft Corporation and Intel Corporation headquartered their European operations in Dublin because of its highly educated and skilled English-speaking workforce and its corporate tax rate-the lowest in Europe. During the boom, prices spiked, and consumers became more

Page 56 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
aware of the need for  competition. Internationally, there was a general trend toward putting more focus on competition.

But upon the ICA's birth in 1991, the agency had no enforcement powers. Its main purview was to examine business agreements and determine if they violated  competition laws. Regardless of the ICA's findings, the only enforcement mechanism was private litigation between competitors.

Change came in two stages. First, in 1996, the government introduced criminal penalties for  antitrust violators and authorized the ICA to investigate them. Six years later, the  Competition Act transferred responsibility for merger control from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the ICA; toughened criminal penalties and gave the ICA its own police detectives; and shifted the ICA's role away from such administrative functions as approving business agreements.

Even before that new law took effect, chairman Fingleton began to search for experienced practitioners. When Calvani, 57, heard about the hunt for a cartels chief, he was intrigued by the opportunity to work abroad after practicing in the United States for his entire career. After serving in the eighties on the Federal Trade Commission, he spent the next 12 years at Pillsbury Winthrop, where he was involved in such high-profile deals as Chevron Corp.'s 2001 merger with Texaco Inc. and Bank of America
Corporation's 1992 acquisition of Security Pacific Corporation. With his mortgage paid and children grown, Calvani felt the security to try something new. He had traveled to Ireland on business and recognized his good timing, with the  Competition Act soon to take effect. Calvani's regard for Fingleton was a factor, too. "I thought that with his leadership, the ICA might take a level of prominence beyond which the size of the country would suggest," he says.

Since Calvani landed the job in April 2002, the ICA has brought six cartels cases before the courts, five as civil actions and one-the grain farmers case-as a criminal case. It's impossible to determine how many cartels cases the ICA has investigated, in total or during Calvani's tenure, because the ICA only makes investigations public if it refers them to the courts.

Calvani has won praise from local practitioners, who say that the cartels division has become more aggressive over the past year. Previously, says Matheson Ormsby's Kelly, the ICA would contact parties in question and request written information. Now, she says, parties must appear before the ICA under
oath. The ICA also administers "dawn raids"-unannounced 9 a.m. visits by agents of the ICA who demand access to documents. "It's just a bit more threatening-isn't itâ -when a police detective shows up to look at your office," Kelly says.

Henneberry's arrival at the ICA freed Calvani from another of his roles-as acting director of the mergers division. Henneberry was at an American Bar Association  antitrust meeting in the spring of 2003 when he heard that the ICA was seeking a permanent mergers chief. The 58-year-old Howrey partner wasn't actively looking for a new job overseas, but he had been considering a change. At the time, he was shuttling to and from Howrey's new Brussels office to handle an antitrust case for the Italian subsidiary of
a major client, H.J. Heinz Company. He had served as Heinz's lead antitrust counsel in a deal derailed on
antitrust grounds (involving Heinz's acquisition of Milnot Holding Corporation), and had played key roles
in several other deals. But the ICA looked to be a new kind of challenge for him, and he made the move
last September.

Henneberry still flies in and out of Brussels, now as the ICA's representative in the  European                    Commission's discussions to revise its merger guidelines. But it's in Ireland where Henneberry stands to make his largest mark in mergers. Since the ICA gained merger review powers in January 2003, 47 mergers have been filed with the agency. At press time 35 of the deals had been cleared, and decisions in the rest were pending. Calvani, in his role as acting mergers chief, investigated the bulk of these deals.
But Henneberry, in his first three months, investigated five mergers. "The mergers division operates very efficiently," says Kelly, of Matheson Ormsby. "It's possible to get merger clearance within a month of submission. In the past if [the Department of Enterprise] asked a question, the clock stopped."

Calvani and Henneberry are not the only foreigners to join the ICA's 40-person staff. One of the five members of the ICA, Paul Gorecki, is Canadian, and Arshad "Paku" Kahn, a case officer in the monopolies division, is from Nashville. "[Hiring foreign talent] is something that small economies like Ireland do to innovate," Fingleton says.

Although unexpected, the hirings were greeted warmly by local lawyers. "The first one [Calvani] was a surprise," says FitzGerald. "It showed that the ICA was thinking outside of the box." Alan McCarthy, a partner in the E.U. regulatory and  competition practice in Dublin's A&L Goodbody, agrees: "It didn't strike us as being strange. In terms of blue-chip experience in  antitrust matters, it might have been necessary
to look a bit farther afield."

When Calvani and Henneberry are not busy helping the ICA to shape and enforce  antitrust law, they're adjusting to life overseas. Both lawyers have family roots in Ireland, and both experienced mixed reactions from friends and colleagues when they announced their moves. "Some of my colleagues thought I had taken leave of my senses," says Calvani. Adds Henneberry: "I think people [now] are saying, 'How'd you
do thatâ ' or 'That sounds like fun.' If I had taken a similar job in D.C., it wouldn't have been a big deal. The difference is that I'm doing this in the E.U."

Henneberry and Calvani agree that while the weather is less than ideal, culture shock hasn't been a problem. "Ireland has got to be the friendliest place on earth," says Henneberry. "If you're lost, people will go out of their way to help you. But, boy, do I miss a good pizza." And even if the food requires some getting used to, the lawyers benefit by the lack of a language barrier. At least in theory. "I was on an airplane the other day," says Calvani. "And the person sitting next to me said that I had a pretty good American accent, that it was almost perfect." Calvani wasn't sure what to say. "So I told him that I went to school in the States."

HD     In EU tangle, Windows  could lose Media Player

SEATTLE (AP) - In the fall of 2002,  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates stood on stage at Hollywood's Kodak
Theater, home to the Academy Awards, and pronounced this "the digital decade."

By 2010, Gates told an audience that included director James Cameron and musician LL Cool J, everything from paying bills to seeing movies "will be done on a digital basis, and the PC with its magic software will play the central role."

TD
He then proceeded to unveil what  Microsoft considers a key part of that vision: a half-billion dollar upgrade to the Windows Media Player for music, movies and other digital content.
Eighteen months later, Gates' endeavor could be facing a big roadblock.

If Microsoft cannot settle an  antitrust case brought by European Union regulators, the company may be ordered to remove Windows Media Player as an integrated feature of the dominant Windows operating system, at least for personal computers sold in Europe.

The European Commission also could order Microsoft to include rival media players with Windows to make those products as easy for users to access as Microsoft's own music and video player.

Microsoft has said it is certain to appeal any ruling against it. Still, the European case could hinder
Microsoft's efforts to dominate an emerging and important technology market.

"There's a lot at stake here, because it's becoming increasingly evident to most everyone that the computer is becoming more of a media-centric device," said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.

Removing the media player from Windows may help level the playing field for competitors such as RealNetworks' RealOne player and Apple's QuickTime, Leigh said, while also costing  Microsoft its default advantage.

In the fierce  competition for what type of technology people use to do things like listen to music and watch movies on computers,  Microsoft's primary weapon is its ability to ensure its format is found on millions of PCs every year, said Rob Helm, director of research for independent analysts Directions on Microsoft.
Now, he said, "the European Union could throw a wrench in that."

A negative ruling also could weigh on  Microsoft's planned next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. That system, which may not be available until 2006 or later, is scheduled to incorporate even more new features, such as a built-in search engine that could compete with Google, Yahoo and other companies.

Legal battles over such features might become more likely if the EU forbade  Microsoft from tying its media player to its operating system, Helm said.

Page 59 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European regulators already have prepared a draft decision that finds  Microsoft violated
competition law on two counts: by bundling its media player into Windows, and by failing to provide rivals
in the server market with enough information for their products to operate as well with Windows as
Microsoft's own applications.
In addition to the penalties regarding the media player, the company also could be asked to pay hefty
fines and to release more details on the blueprints for server software.

The EU has said it could decide the long-running case as early as this month.  Microsoft has said repeatedly it hopes to settle, but analysts believe there is only so much the company is willing to concede.

"They will not agree to a settlement that forces them to change their strategy with what they're doing with the media player," said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner Inc.

Smith believes the company may be more willing to give competitors more information about its server software, however.

Microsoft argues that extracting the media player would be technologically difficult since the programming code is intertwined with the operating system and cannot simply be plucked out without harming Windows' performance.  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said that including rival players would be complicated and might create security problems.

Although a ruling against  Microsoft may be a hindrance, most experts think  Microsoft would successfully find other ways to make its media player available, such as over the Internet.

Microsoft also would still have the advantage that its media player looks familiar to users of Windows, which runs on about 90 percent of the world's computers, Leigh noted.

Helm said the larger issue may be whether any one company can "win" the digital media marketplace -- as Microsoft has with its dominant role in Internet browsers and operating systems -- or whether consumers will continue to use various different players.

In the United States, Windows Media Player currently controls about 34 percent of the market, compared with nearly 19 percent for RealOne player and 10 percent for QuickTime player, according to January data from Nielsen/NetRatings.
Will Poole, a senior vice president at  Microsoft who has worked extensively with the Windows Media
Player, concedes that customers may never choose just one type of player.
"This is not," he said, "a winner-take-all type of market."

HD     [ Fiscal Conservatives Fight Spending  Surge ] BY     Jamie Dettmer, INSIGHT

Fiscal Conservatives Fight Spending Surge

Fiscal conservatives on Capitol Hill and their allies in Washington-based think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute say they are frustrated about the free-spending ways of the Bush administration. Although George W. Bush announced just a handful of new, inexpensive, domestic proposals in his State of the Union speech, these conservatives insist the administration should be focusing on ways to cut spending.

TD
Cato estimates that there has been close to a 25 percent surge in spending during the last three years the fastest pace since the Johnson administration. Treasury Secretary John Snow insists the administration will get the deficit down: "You're going to see this administration deeply committed to that objective," he said.

According to Snow and other senior Bush officials their aim is to keep the growth in discretionary spending limited to less than 4 percent in the coming fiscal year. They maintain also that economic growth will help cut the deficit during the next five years.

But critics argue that the discretionary-spending pledge is a gimmick. Many programs and department budgets, such as homeland security, aren't included in the pledge and will grow by far more than 4 percent.
Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, says the president's promise to tackle the deficit, which
is approaching $500 billion this fiscal year alone, is "really unpersuasive." Conservative Republicans in the
House of Representatives have warned the White House of a potential backlash against Bush's budget
proposal unless more is done [see political notebook, p. 12].
The Dollar's Decline

The U.S. budget and trade deficits continue to weigh on the currency-exchange markets. At the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in late January, attendees concluded that, despite strong U.S. economic growth, the coming months may see the dollar fall an additional 10 to 20 percent against the euro on top of the 35 percent drop since early 2002.

As the business has emphasized before, the weak dollar does help U.S. manufacturers sell their exports in Europe, thereby helping to boost economic growth in America. But a prolonged dollar decline holds out considerable risks that could boomerang back on the U.S. economy, especially if Europe's economic recovery is stymied as a result of falling European exports to the United States.

Europe's shaky export-driven recovery likely is too fragile to take the impact of a weak dollar for long. A fall in corporate profits in Europe could lead to an increase in unemployment a spin- off that could affect U.S. export sales. The Europeans aren't the only ones overseas worried about the possibility of a prolonged period of dollar weakness. In the Middle East, the oil-exporting countries are anxious, too.
They price their oil and gas in dollars but need euros for the large quantities of imports they buy from
Europe. And the same goes for Russia.


Page 61 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There are fears also for the emerging market economies of Latin America. A weak dollar risks triggering inflation in the United States, which in turn would lead to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates. For Latin America, higher U.S. interest rates would make it harder to attract overseas investment and loans.

Currently, because of the benefit of stronger U.S. exports, the Bush administration is comfortable with the weak dollar. That could change, however, if foreign investment into the United States falters. There were fears in early fall that this was happening. But Treasury Department data released in January assuaged any immediate worries. In November, net purchases as U.S. investments by foreigners totaled $87.6 billion, compared with $27.8 billion in October, and according to anecdotal evidence December will hold up well on the foreign-investment front.

A high capital flow into the United States is needed to offset the record U.S. trade gap and keep interest rates low.
Is Tough Ruling on  Microsoft's Horizon?

Microsoft isn't out of the woods yet with its "unfair- competition" problems. The European Commission has circulated a draft preliminary ruling that finds Microsoft broke European competition law and abused its dominant position in the computer market. The draft decision has been circulated within the European Union (EU) bureaucracy, and the member states also will have to be consulted before the ruling becomes binding.
European sources say the recommended penalty is a large fine. The European case follows Microsoft's
2002 settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. The European Commission wants Microsoft to
unbundle its Media Player program from the rest of Windows and share more information with
competitors. Any adverse ruling likely would be challenged by  Microsoft at the EU's Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg.
The European Commission may propose in its final ruling the legally novel imposition of requiring
Microsoft to carry rival programs.

When the EU started investigating  Microsoft three years ago there were concerns the investigation may add to trans-Atlantic tensions over trade and trust rules. But with the success of the U.S. Justice Department's case against  Microsoft, officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe a tough ruling by the EU against  Microsoft is unlikely to prompt further friction.

Officials from Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) raided  Microsoft's Tokyo office last Thursday. The FTC was reacting to Microsoft contracts that forced original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to agree not to sue Microsoft for patent infringements.  Microsoft promptly agreed to remove the clause and the world yawned. After all - how many times have we watched this scenario played out?

In the past, the FTC had also censured  Microsoft for forcing OEMs to bundle Word, Excel and Explorer in their computers. But there is a limit to how many times you can replay the same film and expect anyone to care.

TD
It is not just Japan that is fumbling over legal remedies to Microsoft's desktop monopoly. The United States government spent over a decade chasing Microsoft with anti-climactic anti-trust suits but although the company was forced to moderate its behaviour, the monopoly is stronger now than it has ever been.

The European Commission is expected to close its own five-year investigation into  Microsoft's business practices within the next two weeks.

EU Competition Commissioner "Super" Mario Monti will probably slap the firm with a large  fine, though considering the US$53 billion in cash now swelling  Microsoft's pockets, it would take a pretty spectacular penalty to make the software giant wince.
A Japanese court will probably see the issue in a similar light.  Microsoft may end up getting a  fine
and will be compelled to moderate some of its business practices but little else will happen.

The issue of  Microsoft's monopoly status has been around since long before most of today's computer users even touched a keyboard. When I began covering technology more than a decade ago, Microsoft's anti-trust tangles over MS-DOS were already old hat.

But, while the legal remedies may look trivial, when viewed en masse, 15 years of anti-trust probes have had a significant moderating effect on the company.

Try to imagine a world in which  Microsoft had never been challenged by anti-trust authorities or forced by litigation to moderate its behaviour.

Computer vendors would be compelled to bundle Windows on every computer they sell. Windows desktops would only communicate with Windows servers. Web servers would only serve Frontpage websites.  Microsoft would not have invested in Apple or ported Office to the Mac. Time-Warner would have been bought not by AOL but by the  Microsoft Network. We would buy everything from books to air tickets from  Microsoft websites.

Java, Linux, Apache, Samba, the Symbian software on your Nokia, your MP3 collection and many of the applications we all use - from accounting packages to CD burners - would almost certainly not exist today.As with Apple's survival in the 90s, their existence has helped  Microsoft convince governments all is well in the free market.

While a few governments are actively encouraging Linux adoption, a growing number are now using open-source software as a bargaining ploy to renegotiate with Redmond. Britain's Public Accounts Committee last week estimated that the British government was saving more than Â£30 million (HK$436.13 million) a year by demanding discounts from software vendors.
Asian governments are reportedly using the threat of Linux to force even bigger concessions. Thailand's People PC project resulted in  Microsoft releasing a chopped-down Windows and Office
XP that sells for just 1,500 baht (HK$297). With the licence for Windows and Office XP costing more
than the gross national income of many countries, this is likely to be the first of many such local
Windows Lite deals.

China approaches these things differently. Having escaped censure when some government departments stopped buying foreign software last year, the mainland is expected soon to start slapping quotas on the amount of foreign software used throughout government. The mainland's software market is expected to be worth US$250 billion next year, with the majority bought by state-backed enterprises. Though lobbyists in the US are already complaining about mainland protectionism, this is a huge club for China to wield.
But simply the existence of  competition is not enough reason to be complacent.

Microsoft Windows still powers 95 per cent of the world's desktop computers and is finding its way into a growing range of environments, from phones to military hardware.

Even with  competition, by the time Longhorn finally arrives two years from now, there is little reason to expect the free market to have made a significant dent in  Microsoft's desktop monopoly.
It will take a much bigger stick than that.

HD        EU Microsoft Plan Offers Choice Of Media Player-Sources

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Instead of forcing  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to sell stripped-down versions of Windows direct to consumers, European Union regulators are likely to demand that computer hardware makers be given a choice of what multimedia software to install, sources close to the case said Tuesday.

The plan is designed to avoid consumers buying barebones operating systems. It's also designed to prevent gray-market imports of full-function Windows from flooding into Europe. Big hardware makers, like Dell Inc. (DELL), would choose which add-ons to install on top of Windows.

TD
"There would be no naked versions on the market," said one source familiar with the matter. It remained unclear late Tuesday how much code  Microsoft would be obliged to strip from some versions of Windows under the plan.
E.U.  antitrust spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment. [ 02-03-04 2122GMT ]

Microsoft still is trying to convince E.U. officials to accept an alternative remedy, known as
"must-carry." Under this scenario,  Microsoft would settle the Commission's case by allowing rivals'
media software to be added to Windows' existing structure, rather than by forcing it to remove any code
or functions.

Microsoft prefers this scenario because the company would sidestep a precedent that could trigger further attempts to strip Windows of valuable programs that may be key to potentially lucrative online markets. Avoiding such legal entanglements is important for  Microsoft as it continues to enrich Windows with next-generation digital tools, such as Web-search engines.

The case against  Microsoft in Europe looks at two distinct areas of the software giant's business - tools for viewing multimedia files, and software that runs powerful server computers on a network. In both areas, E.U. regulators say,  Microsoft is using its dominance over the PC desktop to leverage its strength in these neighboring markets.

Negotiations are reaching a critical stage. E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is preparing to make a final decision on  Microsoft's punishments after hearing from E.U. government representatives, who meet on March 15 and 22 in Brussels.

Without a settlement,  Microsoft faces a fine of around EUR200 million, according to one source close to the case. Regulators could cut that figure by half if a partial deal is reached, and eliminate it entirely with a full settlement, the source said.
Late Tuesday, Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said the company still "is working actively with the
European Commission towards an amicable settlement of this case."

Microsoft already appears to have escaped Europe's toughest penalties in the server part of the case. In that area, the Commission seems prepared to let  Microsoft and its competitors decide remedies by themselves to avoid the risk that an EU-imposed solution could be immediately blocked in court.

Now multimedia software is in the spotlight. Here, a softer approach could benefit regulators, too. Any measures agreed by Microsoft would be more likely to be applied globally and regulators have worried that any unbundling order will be ineffective otherwise. Their writ runs only as far as the E.U.'s borders.

Page 65 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Gray imports of fully functioning Windows could filter in from overseas while some consumers will opt to ignore borders altogether and download software over high-speed Internet connections.

In particular, multinationals could find it too irksome to order different operating systems for PC's in different locations, and decide to ignore the order.  Microsoft has warned that an unbundling order would compromise Windows and lead to an inferior product being sold in Europe.

The state of play in Europe mirrors developments in the U.S. case against  Microsoft about three years ago, shortly before the company successfully fought off orders to strip applications that centered on Internet browsers.

In that case, U.S. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly urged  Microsoft to reach a settlement with its rivals. The final agreement required  Microsoft to allow rival software including multimedia products to be the
default choice in Windows, rather than  Microsoft's own products.

The U.S. settlement also required that Windows not favor  Microsoft's server software over competing software.

Europe's new plan would go further than the U.S. remedy by obliging  Microsoft to ship Windows at least partly stripped of Windows Media Player. European regulators may feel emboldened to go further by recent developments in the U.S., where regulators have admitted that their attempt to rein-in Microsoft has fallen short of the mark.

Microsoft rivals also are pushing Europe to impose a tough penalty. Media software company RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) says Microsoft already produces one stripped-down version of Windows in the form of Windows Embedded, and that Microsoft could market a simplified version of the Windows operating system without Media Player.

Last month, RealNetworks showed journalists its latest music software running on top of  Microsoft's Windows Embedded system. But sources familiar with  Microsoft's thinking say that demonstration was misleading. Windows Embedded runs only one program at a time and wouldn't suit retail and business users who run multiple programs, such as email, an Internet browser, and dozens of others, simultaneously.

Time Warner completes
sale to Bronfman group

TD
Time Warner Inc. completed the sale of its Warner Music business to an investor group led by
Edgar Bronfman Jr. for about $2.6 billion (U.S.) in cash.

Time Warner agreed to sell the business in November as part of a plan to reduce debt. The New York-based company said yesterday it has an option to buy as much as 15 per cent of the business at any time in the next three years, and as much as 20 per cent under certain circumstances.

Bronfman and the investor group, which includes Thomas H. Lee Partners, Bain Capital and Providence Equity Partners, beat out a rival bid from U.K.-based EMI Group PLC. The stand-alone music company, which will be headed by Bronfman, will be the third-biggest music company and the largest independent.

Microsoft, eBay link up

Microsoft Corp. and eBay Inc. said yesterday that they would link software and Web data to make it easier for auction sellers to manage their virtual storefronts on eBay's online auction Web site.

Users will be able to use  Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet program to upload information on items for sale, track ongoing auctions and collect data.

Microsoft will also link its home page publishing program FrontPage with eBay's data services, allowing the auction seller to create Web home pages with data pulled directly from eBay.
Verizon told to test more

Verizon Communications Inc. "should do a full power load test of backup generators in all of its offices," and examine ways to improve power sources, the New York State department of public service report said in a report on last summer's blackout, North America's largest.

Wireless-phone carriers, which lost service at 30 per cent of antenna sites within 12 hours of the blackout as backup power failed, should examine other forms of energy such as fuel cells, and consider ways to ease call congestion "during emergency - unusual events," the report said.

About 346,000 land-line customers, or fewer than 5 per cent of New York phone subscribers, lost service, while wireless carriers had trouble handling the surge in calls, the state said.
Qwest goes national

Qwest Communications International Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. local phone company, yesterday launched a national wireless voice service in a move to ensure future growth.

Denver-based Qwest said it using Sprint PCS's network for the initiative. Up to now, Qwest has only offered wireless service in its region.

Also yesterday, a judge rejected a request for a mistrial for four former Qwest executives accused of plotting to help the company improperly book $34 million (U.S.) in revenue. Thomas Hall, Bryan Treadway, Grant Graham and John Walker are charged with fraud and conspiracy.
Alcatel to sell phone unit

French telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel SA plans to sell its mobile phone unit to Chinese handset maker Nanjing Panda Electronics, French newspaper La Tribune reported yesterday.
Telecom firm to cut fees

Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe's largest phone company, agreed to cut the fees it charges rivals to access its local telephone networks to settle  European Commission antitrust charges it was blocking competition in Germany.

The Bonn-based company was  fined 12.6 million euros (almost $21 million Canadian) for charging unfair fees last May. Deutsche Telekom will forgo charging fees to rivals from April 1 until Dec. 31. From Jan. 1, 2005, it will "substantially" cut the tariffs permanently. The new fees need to be approved by the German telecommunications regulator.

HD          EU Microsoft Plan Would Offer Software Choice for PC Makers

BRUSSELS -- Instead of forcing  Microsoft Corp. to sell stripped-down versions of Windows direct to consumers, European Union regulators are likely to demand that computer-hardware makers be given a choice of what multimedia software to install, people close to the case said Tuesday.

The plan is designed to avoid consumers buying bare-bones operating systems. It also is designed to prevent gray-market imports of full-function Windows from flooding into Europe. Big hardware makers, like Dell Inc., would choose which add-ons to install on top of Windows.

TD
"There would be no naked versions on the market," said one person familiar with the matter. It remained unclear late Tuesday exactly how much code  Microsoft would be obliged to strip from Windows under the plan. EU  antitrust spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment.

Microsoft still is trying to convince EU officials to accept an alternative remedy, known as
"must-carry." Under this scenario,  Microsoft would settle the case by allowing rivals' media software to
be added to Windows' existing structure, rather than by forcing it to remove any code or functions.

Microsoft prefers this scenario because the company would sidestep a precedent that could trigger further attempts to strip Windows of valuable programs that may be key to potentially lucrative online markets. Avoiding such legal entanglements is important for  Microsoft as it continues to enrich Windows with next-generation digital tools, such as Web-search engines.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes wouldn't comment on the plan, saying only that "Microsoft is working actively with the  European Commission towards an amicable settlement of this case."

The case against  Microsoft in Europe looks at two distinct areas of the software giant's business -- tools for viewing multimedia files, and software that runs powerful server computers on a network. In both areas, EU regulators say,  Microsoft is using its dominance over the PC desktop to leverage its strength in these neighboring markets.

Negotiations are reaching a critical stage. EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is preparing to make a final decision on  Microsoft's punishments after hearing from EU government representatives, who meet on March 15 and 22 in Brussels.

Without a settlement,  Microsoft faces a fine of about 200 million euros, according to one person close to the case. Regulators could cut that figure by half if a partial deal is reached and eliminate it entirely with a full settlement, the person said.

Microsoft already appears to have escaped Europe's toughest penalties in the server part of the case. In that area, the Commission seems prepared to let  Microsoft and its competitors decide remedies by themselves to avoid the risk that an EU-imposed solution could be immediately blocked in court.

Now multimedia software is in the spotlight. Here, a softer approach could benefit regulators, too. Any measures agreed to by  Microsoft would be more likely to be applied globally and regulators have worried that any unbundling order will be ineffective otherwise. Their writ runs only as far as the EU's

borders. Gray imports of fully functioning Windows could filter in from overseas while some consumers will opt to ignore borders altogether and download software over high-speed Internet connections.

In particular, multinationals could find it too irksome to order different operating systems for PCs in different locations, and decide to ignore the order.  Microsoft has warned that an unbundling order would compromise Windows and lead to an inferior product being sold in Europe.

The state of play in Europe mirrors developments in the U.S. case against  Microsoft about three years ago, shortly before the company successfully fought off orders to strip applications that centered on Internet browsers.

In that case, U.S. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly urged  Microsoft to reach a settlement with its rivals. The final agreement required Microsoft to allow rival software including multimedia products to be the default choice in Windows, rather than Microsoft's own products.

The U.S. settlement also required that Windows not favor  Microsoft's server software over competing software.

Europe's new plan would go further than the U.S. remedy by obliging  Microsoft to ship Windows at least partly stripped of Windows Media Player.

European regulators may feel emboldened to go further by recent developments in the U.S., where regulators have admitted that their attempt to rein in  Microsoft has fallen short of the mark.

Microsoft rivals also are pushing Europe to impose a tough penalty. Media software company RealNetworks Inc. says  Microsoft already produces one stripped-down version of Windows in the form of Windows Embedded, and that  Microsoft could market a simplified version of the Windows operating system without Media Player.

HD             Looking to Laggards  for Gains; Victory  Diversified's Managers Like Microsoft and IBM BY             Aaron Pressman

Paul Danes's $1.6 billion Victory Diversified Stock Fund beat all similarly managed funds during the past decade. He's betting on stocks such as  Microsoft to extend his streak.

The Victory fund rose at an annual rate of 13.4 percent in the past 10 years, ranking No. 1 among 36 large-cap growth funds tracked by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has climbed
at an 11.3 percent yearly pace in the same period.

TD
This year, Danes, 42, and his co-managers say stocks such as  Microsoft, IBM and Automatic Data
Processing will lead the market, after lagging in 2003.
"Microsoft is significantly undervalued," Danes said in a telephone interview from his office in
Cleveland.

The world's largest software maker will put its $50 billion cash hoard to use after resolving  antitrust concerns with European regulators, he said. Danes predicted that the company will increase its dividend and buy back stock -- and, he said, it will still have enough money to make acquisitions.

Microsoft is accused by the European Commission of illegally using its Windows software to control new markets in operating systems on larger computers and in audio-visual software. The company faces millions of dollars in  fines and the cost of court battles unless it settles the
five-year-old investigation.

Microsoft shares advanced 5.9 percent last year. IBM's climbed 20 percent and Automatic Data rose
0.9 percent.
The Victory fund rose 36 percent in 2003, surpassing the 28.7 percent total return of the S&P and the
27 percent gain of the average competing fund tracked by Bloomberg.

Victory's fund invests most of its assets in shares of the world's biggest companies. At the end of December, the largest holdings were General Electric, IBM, Boeing, PNC Financial Services Group and BP. In all, the fund held shares of 53 companies.

"If you look at our portfolio, you're going to recognize all the names," said Danes, who has helped run the fund for more than 10 years.
Victory Capital Management, which oversees about $50 billion of assets, is a unit of KeyCorp, the
12th-biggest U.S. bank by assets. KeyCorp hasn't been identified as a target in the investigation of
improper trading in the mutual fund industry.

The Diversified Stock Fund attracted a net of about $500 million in new investments in 2003, Danes said. The fund costs investors $11.60 for every $1,000 added, matching the industry average. Investors also pay other fees when buying shares of the fund through a broker.
Page 71 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last year, the fund's advance was buoyed by holdings in companies such as Caterpillar that benefited from the economy's 3.1 percent expansion. Caterpillar shares rose 82 percent in 2003.

Managers of the fund -- Danes; Larry Babin, 55; and Carolyn Rains, 35 -- have sold their stakes in Caterpillar, Home Depot and Texas Instruments. They also have reduced their investment in Intel after the stock more than doubled in 2003, Danes said.

General Electric is the fund's largest holding. "We don't think it's a screaming undervalued situation, but it's the kind of high-quality defensive name that we like right now," Danes said.
The fund has increased its holding of media companies. It's on both sides of Comcast's unsolicited
$54.1 billion offer for Walt Disney Co. The fund owned 2 million shares of Disney and 793,000 of
Comcast as of Dec. 31.

The fund has trimmed its position in Disney as the stock rose after Comcast made its offer, and it added to its Comcast stake after the cable company's stock declined, Danes said.

Disney has rejected the overtures from Comcast, the world's biggest cable company. Danes said he doesn't expect Comcast to increase its takeover bid.

Comcast will do well regardless of what happens with Disney, as revenue increases from newer services such as on-demand movies and telephone-calling over cable lines, he said.
The Victory fund has added to holdings in BP, Halliburton, El Paso Corp., Schlumberger and
Transocean.

Shares of Halliburton, the world's second-largest oil-field-service company, have risen 21 percent since the start of the year. Shares of Transocean, the world's largest offshore-drilling contractor, have climbed 29 percent.
The Victory fund is up 3 percent since Dec. 31, trailing the 3.8 percent return of the S&P 500.

HD       Is EU looking at yesterday's Microsoft? As the European Union considers restrictions aimed at preventing Microsoft from unfairly using its dominance in PC OSes to gain control of the market for multimedia software,  some say the war has already moved on.

LP
As the European Union considers restrictions aimed at preventing  Microsoft from unfairly using its dominance in PC operating systems to gain control of the market for multimedia software, some say the war has already moved on.

EU antitrust regulators have concluded that the software giant violated  competition rules by "tying" its media player to Windows. Now they're weighing remedies due to be announced this month that could go as far as forcing  Microsoft to offer computer makers two different versions of its operating system, one with audio and video playback features and another without them.

TD
The idea is to give consumers more choices over multimedia software on the PC. But some say that's yesterday's battle, as  Microsoft and others race for dominance in new markets, from portable music players and cell phones to TV set-top boxes and digital cinema.

"Certainly as a practical matter, given how fast  Microsoft and the market for technology move, it's very hard for the law and regulatory bodies to keep up," said Mike McGuire, an analyst with Gartner G2, a division of the Gartner research firm.

PC technologies are rapidly converging with traditional consumer electronics devices, promising to wipe out boundaries between computers, televisions, radios and even the telephone. The winners in this transformation have yet to be determined, and competitors are lining up to duke it out. For example, Microsoft faces a suddenly reinvigorated rival in digital music: Apple Computer, whose iTunes Music Store accounted for about 75 percent of all legal digital song downloads in its first year of operation.

In this fast-changing environment, the EU's  antitrust ruling could prove to be a sideshow, some analysts said. Among other things,  Microsoft is all but certain to fiercely resist significant changes in its software, raising the prospect of further delays and a possible EU defeat on appeal. That possibility could lead EU regulators to seek milder restrictions that call for less drastic measures but stand a greater chance of getting implemented now.

The EU antitrust review is the latest, but not the last, legal challenge aimed at limiting  Microsoft's power to turn its past dominance into unfair advantage in new technology markets.

The European review has worked on different lines than its American counterpart. While U.S. prosecutors focused largely on the browser market, Europeans have alleged that  Microsoft unfairly tied its multimedia software into the Windows operating system and that the company has also made it difficult for rivals' server software to work on Windows-based machines.

Regulators have done extensive investigations, including multiple interviews with many of Microsoft's competitors such as RealNetworks. In a preliminary review released last August, European Commission officials said they believed the company's actions remained problematic.

"In light of this evidence, the commission's preliminary conclusion is that  Microsoft's abuses are still ongoing," officials said.



Page 73 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Since that time, settlement negotiations have been ongoing. According to recent reports, commissioners may settle for allowing big PC makers to choose what multimedia software to install on new computers, instead of forcing  Microsoft to pull Media Player out of Windows altogether.

Microsoft has kept its comments on the issue to a minimum. "We continue to be actively engaged with the commission in hopes of coming to an amicable resolution of the matter," said company spokesman Jim Desler.

A new antitrust review may also be pending in Japan, where government investigators raided  Microsoft offices late last month. If a new examination is in fact pending, it would be the third such review of the company's practices in that country.
Yesterday's battle?

Regardless of remedies, a European ruling against  Microsoft will be undeniably painful. At the very least, the company faces a  fine in the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to reports.

But the decision may be too little, too late to have a major impact on the future direction of the digital multimedia market.

Regulators have little choice other than to focus on PC-based software, experts say--after all, they're looking specifically at how the company may have abused its operating system dominance, and can't speculate on what might happen in new technology markets.

On the media player side, at least, it's clear  Microsoft has moved its ambitions, and its fingerprints, well beyond the PC.

For years now, the company has been assiduously courting big record companies and movie studios in hopes that they would release digital content in  Microsoft's media format. This is starting to pay off. Most new online music services, barring Apple's and RealNetworks' stores, sell music in  Microsoft's format and use a variation of the Media Player.

Microsoft's relationships to Hollywood studios are improving too. The company recently announced a broad alliance with Disney, under which Disney would license  Microsoft's digital rights management tools and explore ways the companies could release content together, such as using the high-definition Windows Media format.

Microsoft's media format is now supported by dozens of MP3 players and other portable devices. The format is beginning to show up on copy-protected audio CDs around the world. And most recently, a DVD standards group gave provisional approval for  Microsoft's video compression technology to be included in the next-generation specifications for high-resolution DVD video.

All of this is a sign that the digital media industry, and  Microsoft with it, is looking well beyond the personal computer and the PC-based media player.

To be sure, analysts say, the PC remains at the core of  Microsoft's strategy. The company views Windows-based machines, such as the Media Center displayed at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as the hub of a digital media environment. For this to be entirely advantageous to Microsoft, those PCs must also be loaded with the Windows Media Player.

Already PC makers have shown that they are willing to break from  Microsoft in some cases, most notably Hewlett-Packard recently decided to make Apple's iTunes the default media player on some of its new computers. If the European Commission were to push that trend further, eliminating developers' certainty that Microsoft's media player would be installed on every PC, the market could slowly shift, some say.

"If application developers, including  Microsoft's own, could no longer be able to count on Win media being there, they might think that maybe they need to ship their own player along with their products,"
said Rob Helm, research director for Directions on  Microsoft, a research firm focusing specifically on the software company. "Then they might go to RealNetworks or someone else. That opens up a lot more competition on PC platforms."

RealNetworks itself is suing  Microsoft on antitrust grounds , alleging that the software giant has made it impossible to compete fairly in the PC media player market. But Real is focusing more and more heavily on future platforms such as mobile phones, and worries too that  Microsoft may yet use its Windows dominance to move into those fields.



Page 74 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Microsoft's illegal conduct has reduced our revenues in the PC-based software markets, and limited consumer choice," said Dave Stewart, deputy general counsel for RealNetworks. But "getting a remedy to stop PC-based conduct in digital media markets will definitely safeguard  competition on other devices."

Consumer electronics makers, however, are far less beholden to  Microsoft than their PC counterparts, meaning that  Microsoft's hold in the post-PC world could be tenuous. Manufacturers of set-top boxes and other non-PC devices aren't tied to Windows by their customers' previous experiences and have already in many cases adopted the Linux operating system as an alternative.

Nevertheless, it's hard to imagine--ruling or no ruling--that  Microsoft's presence in the post-PC world is not already assured, analysts say.

"Microsoft might have wanted more time," Gartner's McGuire said. "But they've done a pretty good job of seeding the market."

What's new:
European regulators are expected to conclude a five-year  antitrust probe of Microsoft this month. Bottom line:
The EU is seeking restrictions that would prevent  Microsoft from unfairly using the dominance of
Windows to gain control over audio and video on the PC. But the penalties may be too little, too late.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - A top European Union antitrust official said Thursday that settlement talks were continuing with  Microsoft Corp. even as the European Commission prepares to decide the
long-running case in two weeks.

"We are engaging in formal discussions and settlement discussions," Philip Lowe, the director general of the Commission's  competition department, told Dow Jones Newswires on the sidelines of a conference.

"The formal proposals will have to be put to the (EU) member states in the next fortnight and then the

European regulators have set March 15 and 22 as the dates for final reviews in Brussels, where representatives of  antitrust offices in the 15 EU countries comment on the decision and proposed penalties. The Commission usually adopts the decision a day or two after the last closed-door session.

Sources familiar with the case say the draft ruling finds the U.S. software giant abused its dominant position with Windows to gain market share in markets for multimedia players and low-end servers. It would impose a fine and order the company to stop breaking the law.

Sources say the EU wants to force  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its own Media Player to give rival companies a better shot at getting their products on consumers' desktops. It also would demand  Microsoft release more information to improve "interoperability" with Windows for rival server networks.

Taking out Media Player also could undermine  Microsoft's long-term strategy of keeping Windows on top by incorporating new functions, which it argues benefits consumers.

BRUSSELS -- European  antitrust regulators are increasing pressure on  Microsoft Corp.

Both Microsoft and its adversaries have been touring European national capitals, lobbying national antitrust authorities ahead of a meeting Monday at which those authorities are expected to give their opinion in the case.

antitrust law, and are discussing only the details of the commission's proposed punishment.

Microsoft, however, says it still is working "actively with the  European Commission towards an amicable settlement of this case," according to Tom Brookes, a company spokesman in Brussels. Another person familiar with the Redmond, Wash., company's defense played down the notion it should help devise its own punishment.

European antitrust regulators are increasing pressure on  Microsoft Corp. to come up with its own punishment in a five-year-old antitrust case, but the software company is resisting the plan, dubbed by one lawyer close to Microsoft as an offer to choose its own âmethod of execution.â

Less than two weeks before Europe's chief  antitrust authority is expected to conclude its landmark investigation, Microsoft lawyers and lobbyists are fighting a last-ditch battle to reach a settlement, thereby avoiding a fine and other punishments that might include self-inflicted pain. Both Microsoft and its adversaries have been touring European national capitals, lobbying national antitrust authorities ahead of a meeting on Monday at which those authorities are expected to give their opinion in the case.

At the same time, the  European Commission, while prepared to impose penalties, is trying to avoid ordering Microsoft to hand over commercially valuable information to its competitors, fearing a direct order could strengthen  Microsoft's hand in an eventual court appeal. So if the two can't come to a settlement first, regulators intend to ask  Microsoft to work out a mutually satisfactory punishment with regulators and rivals, and would impose a remedy only if that approach failed, according to people familiar with the commission's thinking.

Even if that approach doesn't work in the Microsoft case, lawyers say it is likely to be increasingly used by Europe regulators under a revised antitrust rulebook.

Microsoft's adversaries say European authorities are convinced  Microsoft has violated European
antitrust law, and are discussing only the details of the commission's proposed punishment.
âIt's all about the remedy and how to make it effective,â said one lawyer who represents a  Microsoft
adversary and has been meeting with national authorities.

Microsoft, however, says it still is working âactively with the  European Commission towards an amicable settlement of this case,â according to Tom Brookes, a company spokesman in Brussels.

Another person familiar with the Redmond, Wash., company's defence played down the notion it should help devise its own punishment.

âIf you're asked to choose your method of execution, the thing that's clear is that you must die as a result,â this person said. âWhy should you come up with proposals to achieve an end that you consider to be highly detrimental to your interests?â

Under the commission's plan, if  Microsoft failed to satisfy regulators by a certain deadline, the regulators would be obligated to impose a detailed remedy.

The commission declined to comment on the substance of its decision, still in draft form. People familiar with its thinking confirmed that it is prepared to make a final decision as early as March 24.

The commission accuses Microsoft of abusing its dominance of the market for operating systems for personal computers to thwart competition in two related markets: software for playing audio and video files on a PC, and software that runs more powerful computers called servers that enable different
kinds of computers to work together in a network.

The commission wants to force  Microsoft to let computer makers choose freely between installing the normal version of Windows on new PCs or installing a âliteâ Windows together with a media player from rival suppliers such as RealNetworks Inc. or Apple Computer Inc. It also wants to force  Microsoft to provide more information about the inner workings of Windows so competitors can create products that are fully compatible with Windows-based PCs and servers.

Brussels -- EUROPEAN  ANTITRUST regulators are increasing pressure on  Microsoft Corp. to come up with its own punishment in a five-year-old antitrust case, but the software company is resisting the plan, dubbed by one lawyer close to Microsoft as an offer to choose its own "method of execution."

Less than two weeks before Europe's chief  antitrust authority is expected to conclude its landmark investigation, Microsoft lawyers and lobbyists are fighting a last-ditch battle to reach a settlement, thereby avoiding a fine and other punishments that might include self-inflicted pain.

"Why should you come up with proposals to achieve an end that you consider to be highly detrimental to your interests?"

Under the commission's plan, if  Microsoft failed to satisfy regulators by a certain deadline, the regulators would be obligated to impose a detailed remedy. European regulators imposed a similar two-step remedy against another U.S. monopolist, Commercial Solvents Corp., now a part of Schering-Plough Corp., in 1972. The commission ordered Commercial Solvents, of New York, to provide a competitor with a raw material needed for the production of certain drugs used to treat tuberculosis. The commission gave the company two months to come up with "proposals for subsequent supplies." Commercial Solvents appealed, but the court upheld both the commission's findings and its right to require the company to help formulate a lasting punishment.

Several people familiar with the commission's thinking said the Commercial Solvents case is one of the precedents it intends to invoke in its final decision.

Chris Bright, a partner at law firm Shearman &Sterling in London, says such two-step solutions are likely to become more common after May 1, when newly effective EU  antitrust rules will include a specific provision for the commission to "accept commitments" from companies. "That kind of approach sounds like a pragmatic way forward," says Mr. Bright, who isn't involved in the  Microsoft case. "It allows for a more full, informed debate than if the commission just says `Do this,' and probably also reduces the risk of an appeal."

The commission declined to comment on the substance of its decision, still in draft form. People familiar with its thinking confirmed that it is prepared to make a final decision as early as March 24.

The commission accuses Microsoft of abusing its dominance of the market for operating systems for personal computers to thwart competition in two related markets: software for playing audio and video files on a PC, and software that runs more powerful computers called servers that enable different kinds of computers to work together in a network.

The commission wants to force  Microsoft to let computer makers choose freely between installing the normal version of Windows on new PCs or installing a "lite" Windows together with a media player from rival suppliers such as RealNetworks Inc. or Apple Computer Inc. It also wants to force  Microsoft to provide more information about the inner workings of Windows so competitors can create products that are fully compatible with Windows-based PCs and servers.

The kinds of details that might be worked out in the second part of a two-part decision include whether Microsoft would be able to charge competitors for providing commercially valuable information or would have to provide it free. For example, the commission is planning to spell out the nature of Microsoft's illegal activity in the server arena and sketch out a remedy, but ask  Microsoft to come up with the details within a short period, in consultation with competitors and the commission.

In theory,  Microsoft's alleged misdeeds could cost it about $3 billion in  fines because European regulators can charge companies caught abusing their dominant position up to 10% of annual global turnover for each year in which it violated EU law. In practice,  fines almost always are far lower. A remedy that forced  Microsoft to change the way it does business would have a greater impact on the company over the long run.

BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) -  Microsoft has broken European Union  antitrust law and must face sanctions, according to a draft decision expected to win endorsement on Monday from an advisory committee of the 15 EU states.

The European Commission draft requires  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers and to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, sources familiar with the case say.

TD
EU regulators have found that the world's biggest software company has refused to halt its violations. Since continuing settlement talks have produced no deal, the ruling sets out detailed plans to impose changes.

The advisory panel of national  antitrust experts is also expected to endorse a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros, but not until a second and final meeting on March 22.

The Commission has set March 24 for the decision, according to a draft agenda, the sources say. Only once it is endorsed will EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announce one of the most important rulings of his five-year tenure.

"The key to the current decision is to establish principles and not simply solutions to individual issues," said David Wood, a  competition lawyer for Howrey Simon in Brussels.

Wood noted that EU regulators had dealt with a series of  Microsoft cases during the 1990s, reaching compromises with the software giant in 1994 and 1997, but took no formal decisions.

"How many more Microsofts will there be?" he asked, saying the Commission had recognised a need to change the way the U.S. giant does business in Europe. "That's the focus of the case."
DEADLINE

The Commission intends to give  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action, the sources said.
The Commission has worked and re-worked its draft ruling to stand up to scrutiny by EU courts in
Luxembourg, to which  Microsoft is certain to appeal in the case of any adverse decision.

The company's first move would be to ask a court to suspend the Commission ruling until the case is completed, which could could take three to four years.

The EU Court of First Instance has the option of granting a suspension, denying it, or asking the parties' consent to put the case on a one-year fast track and, if both sides agree, freeze remedies in the meantime.

Microsoft acknowledges that Windows, which runs on nearly all personal computers, is dominant. The Commission will find the company abused that dominance in two areas.

Page 86 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
First,  Microsoft tried to hurt rival makers of audiovisual software by bundling its own Windows Media
Player with its ubiquitous operating system, the sources say.

The advisory committee is expected to endorse a proposal requiring  Microsoft to ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe, the sources say.

One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now. The other would have it stripped out.
The aim is to free computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audiovisual software such as
RealNetworks RealPlayer or Apple's Quicktime, the sources say.

Microsoft says Windows Media Player is an inherent part of the operating system and cannot be stripped out. RealNetworks used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be.

Second, the Commission will rule that  Microsoft has given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete with the company's products.

As a result,  Microsoft's low-level servers, which perform tasks such as printing and file handling, work better with Windows.

The advisory committee is expected to approve a remedy requiring the U.S. firm to share more of its protocols with rivals, charging a reasonable royalty. It will be left to  Microsoft to work out the precise solution, with close oversight by the Commission, the sources said.

Finally, the advisory group is expected to endorse a formal Commission finding that  Microsoft broke the law, which would set a precedent on which Brussels can rely in the future.

HD     EU to recommend sanctions in Microsoft anti-trust case. WC     487 words

ATTENTION - ADDS details ///

An anti-trust advisory panel from the European Union and its 15 member countries is to meet Monday on whether to recommend sanctions against software manufacturer  Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominant market position, sources said Sunday.

TD
The EU competition experts will meet Monday and again on March 22 on the affair. The  European        Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it will issue a final ruling on the case on March 24.

Although the advisory panel could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, the EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said in a speech a few weeks ago that he was mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of monopoly behavior.

In Microsoft's case, the sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system used on 90 percent of personal computers. The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files.
One of the main complaints against  Microsoft is that it squeezes rivals out of the market, such as
Netscape in the past for Internet browsers, or Realnetworks Inc. and Apple for media player.
According to the sources, the EU anti-trust experts could require  Microsoft to deliver a version of
Windows to computer manufacturers that does not include the media player, allowing the makers to install
the RealOne or Apple QuickTime players instead.

The commission also has been investigating allegations that  Microsoft is seeking to drive out competition in the market for low-level servers that provide email and intranet services to multiple users, and handle large filing and printing tasks.

The commission wants  Microsoft to make more of its computer code available to rivals, on payment of royalties, to enable rival server manufacturers to compete effectively.

After investigating the case for more than five years, experts in Monti's  competition department concluded in a preliminary finding last month that  Microsoft had infringed EU anti-trust rules.

Sources said the task facing the commission now is to work out with the help of the  competition authorities in the member countries what action to take against  Microsoft, bearing in mind that any sanctions could be appealed to the European Court in an action that drags on for years.

Any decision, the sources said, would probably allow  Microsoft the option of deciding which parts of its program it is prepared to give up. This compromise suggestion came from the EU commissioner for the internal market, Frits Bolkestein, who believes the EU should not take intellectual property rights away from private companies.

Monday's meeting will be consultative. Monti has said that any compromise is possible until the commission issues its final ruling on March 24. Earlier actions by the Commission against  Microsoft have ended in compromises.

One of the last stages in the European Union's five-year case against Microsoft is set to be completed on Monday, when an advisory committee of the 15 national competition authorities of the EU will comment on the  European Commission's handling of the antitrust investigation.

Although the Commission is not bound to follow the recommendation of the advisory committee, any dissent could be highly politically embarrassing for Mario Monti, the EU's  Competition Commissioner. However, early indications are that following an assiduous campaign by Mr Monti's staff, the national authorities are broadly satisfied by his draft decision against the group, which would involve forcing Microsoft to share more technical information and provide computer manufacturers with a version of Windows that did not include its Media Player programme, its audiovisual software.

TD
The Commission is also scheduled to consult the 15 member states on a  fine for Microsoft at a follow-up meeting on March 22. A Commission decision is scheduled is scheduled for March 24, although talks between the two sides continue.

On Tuesday, the  European Commission is expected to unveil its latest proposals on the statutory audit, a response both to the Sarbanes-Oaxley legislation passed in the US in the aftermath of the collapse of WorldCom and Enron, as well as to the scandal at Parmalat, the Italian dairy group which imploded in December.

The EU legislation would set out rules for the rotation of auditors, establish the creation of US-style accounting oversight boards as well as an EU-wide committee to enforce the legislation and oblige foreign as well as domestic auditors to register with EU authorities. It would make international auditing standards mandatory in the EU and would require companies to set up audit committees and to explain themselves when they decide to sack their auditors.

Also on Tuesday, the monetary affairs committee will hold its first discussion of a controversial report on the European Investment Bank - the world's largest multilateral lending agency.

Monica Ridruejo, a Spanish member of the European parliament and author of the report, is under fire for drafting a highly critical account of the EIB's lending activities, including allegations of losses incurred in venture capital operations and the use of special purpose vehicles to remove credit risk from the bank's balance sheet.

Ms Ridruejo has said that her colleagues in the economic and monetary affairs committee of the European parliament, alarmed at the tone and content of the account, asked her to withdraw her report, but she refused. As a result it is to be discussed on Tuesday, when the committee might vote to amend it or reject it outright. However, this has been disputed by Christa Randzio-Plath, chairwoman of the committee and a German Social Democrat MEP, who says Ms Ridruejo was not asked to withdraw the report.

The dispute has cast the spotlight on an institution which is not accustomed to public scrutiny. The EIB says it is accountable to its shareholders, which are the member states of the European Union, and that MEPs are not qualified to say how the EIB should be run. The bank provides an annual report on its activities to the European parliament "on a voluntary basis", according to a bank spokesman.

EU competition watchdogs met Monday with officials from EU states seeking their accord to slap sanctions on software giant  Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position, sources said.

An advisory panel of EU anti-trust experts held the meetings - to be followed by final talks next Monday - ahead of a decision by the  European Commission scheduled for March 24.

A source close to the talks said that EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti "should get the support" of member states, who rarely overturn a decision by the  European Commission.

ATTENTION - UPDATES throughout ///

The European Union agreed unanimously Monday to bring software giant  Microsoft to heel for alleged abuses of its overwhelmingly dominant position in the personal computer market, officials said.

TD
Ahead of a final verdict next week, anti-trust experts from EU member states met  European                     Commission regulators and agreed to back the EU executive's appraisal of the case.

"The members states have unanimously backed the commission's draft decision," Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti, told reporters.

Monday's talks were about what anti-trust violations  Microsoft is guilty of and what remedies it should be compelled to undertake.

A further meeting next Monday will decide what, if any,  fines Microsoft should face before the commission announces its final verdict in the five-year investigation two days later.

"Mentioning an amount (for a  fine) at this stage is totally speculative because it has not been calculated yet," Torres said.

Although the EU could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, Monti has said he is mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of  Microsoft's domination in PC software.
In Microsoft's case, sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows
Media Player from the Windows operating system, which is used on 90 percent of PCs.

The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.

The EU investigation represents the last hope for  Microsoft's rivals after the company largely settled its anti-trust problems in the United States.
One of the main complaints against  Microsoft is that it squeezes rivals out of the market, such as
Netscape in the past for Internet browsers, or RealNetworks and Apple for the media player.

The commission has also been investigating allegations that  Microsoft is seeking to drive out competition in the market for low-level servers that provide e-mail and intranet services to multiple users, and handle large filing and printing tasks.

The EU executive has backed away from a hardline stance against  Microsoft and has increasingly floated the possibility of reaching a settlement that would forestall a long and costly legal battle.

But a last-minute attempt on Sunday by both sides to reach a settlement failed, sources close to the case said.

"The likelihood of the company avoiding a fully-fledged decision by the commission is now remote," said one commission source.

Monti had previously said that Media Player must be separated from Windows or that  Microsoft must install other providers' versions alongside it.

According to the sources, the commission could now require  Microsoft to deliver a version of Windows to computer manufacturers that does not include the media player, allowing the makers to install the RealOne or Apple QuickTime players instead.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's  antitrust chief won critical backing Monday for a potentially landmark ruling against  Microsoft Corp. that sources say finds the U.S. software giant abused its Windows monopoly and demands changes in the way the company operates.

A closed-door session with representatives of the 15 EU governments -- which had been expected to run all day due to the case's complexity -- ended shortly after noon instead,  European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said.

TD
"The member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," she told reporters without elaborating. Sources familiar with the case said there were "no problems" raised and the draft is tentatively set to be adopted next week.

The endorsement bolsters the Commission's hand in dealing with  Microsoft, which is still seeking a last-minute settlement even as it pledges to carry on the fight in court.

Microsoft is seeking to avert a far-reaching order that would result in a  fine of up to US$3 billion and also force the company to change the way it sells its flagship Windows to computer-makers in Europe.

Given the size of the EU market, such an order could have global implications for  Microsoft, which argues its practice of continually adding new features to Windows benefits consumers. Rivals complain it amounts to unfair  competition.

A negative decision would be the biggest setback for Microsoft since a U.S. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving Internet browsers in 2000. Microsoft reached a settlement with the Bush administration a year later, allowing it to keep its Internet Explorer in Windows with some conditions.

Sources say the EU's draft ruling similarly finds  Microsoft abused its monopoly in computer operating software to gain share in markets for digital media players and low-end servers. But the remedies sought go beyond the U.S. deal.

The EU wants  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its Media Player to give rivals like RealNetworks Inc. a better shot at getting onto consumer desktops. It also would demand Microsoft release more basic Windows code to improve "interoperability" with competing networking software made by Sun Microsystems and others.

The backing from national governments should give EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti political cover to stick to his guns in the face of heavy lobbying from Microsoft and any complaints from Washington.
"I'm sure they want a visible record of endorsement as they go forward," said Chris Bright, an  antitrust
lawyer with Sherman & Sterling in London.
Memories are still fresh in Brussels of the firestorm of criticism from across the Atlantic after Monti blocked
General Electric Corp. from buying Honeywell Inc. in 2001.

The national  antitrust regulators reconvene next Monday to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft. The Commission is expected to adopt the decision as early as March 24 and set out a time frame -- usually a matter of months -- for compliance.

The European Court of Justice could suspend the decision pending  Microsoft's promised appeal, but such an injunction is not automatic.

Given the rapidly changing nature of the industry, the Commission is expected to argue its order would be meaningless by the time the appeal is decided, a process that can drag on for years.

But legal experts say the court could be sympathetic to  Microsoft's arguments about the erosion of proprietary rights, and note the Commission itself didn't bother to seek any interim measures as the case dragged on over the past five years.

Microsoft says it would prefer to settle the case amicably, but talks have stalled largely on the issue of
Media Player because of its implications for  Microsoft's core business strategy.

The next version of Windows, due in 2006, is expected to incorporate even more new features, such as a built-in search engine that could compete with Google, Yahoo and other companies.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's antitrust chief won critical backing Monday for a potentially landmark ruling that would force Microsoft Corp. to strip its Windows computer operating system of a lucrative component and make other changes.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's head office won unanimous backing from national antitrust regulators on Monday for a draft ruling against  Microsoft Corp. that sources say finds the U.S. software giant abused its Windows monopoly. The draft orders deep changes in the way the company operates.

"The member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," she said, without elaborating.

A Microsoft spokesman in Brussels said earlier that the company's legal team remained in daily contact with the Commission, trying to resolve the long-running case amicably.

Microsoft is seeking to avert a far-reaching order that would not only result in a  fine of up to $3 billion (2.45 billion euros), but also force the company to change the way it sells its flagship Windows to computer makers in Europe.

Monday's committee session gave governments a final opportunity to comment on the Commission's draft decision, which was sent to national capitals last month.

HD        Microsoft braces for EU verdict

BRUSSELS:

On Monday morning, the top  antitrust regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union will gather in the Centre Borschette, a bunker-like edifice a stone's throw from the headquarters of the European Commission, to discuss a draft ruling that finds  Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominant position in computer operating software.

TD
With this meeting, the clock on the closely followed five-year- long  antitrust case against Microsoft begins to run down. In less than two weeks, barring a last-minute settlement between the two sides, the commission will declare Microsoft an abusive monopolist, impose a  fine of anywhere from $100 million to $1 billion and order the company to make fundamental changes to the way it sells software in Europe.

Such a ruling would be the most significant setback for  Microsoft since it overcame its most serious legal challenge, settling a sweeping  antitrust case in the United States in 2001. And it would be the defining moment in the five-year tenure of Mario Monti, the top European  antitrust regulator, whose term ends this autumn.

The commission brought its allegations in August, accusing  Microsoft of violating European  antitrust law by abusing its dominance. After a closed hearing in the case in November, the commission circulated a ruling, never made public, that concludes the company broke the law. The hearing Monday is to get the endorsement of the national regulators. A final hearing a week from now is scheduled to decide any penalties.

Ahead of the hearing Monday,  Microsoft has lobbied national governments hard to try to get their regulators to tone down the commission's ruling. That effort is likely to have focused on Britain, Ireland and Denmark, where the company has sizable work forces.

But Microsoft's political clout is limited. The company employs 12,000 people in all of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. That is less than a quarter of the 55,000 people that General Electric employed in the European Union alone when it was trying to win regulatory approval of its planned acquisition of Honeywell International. That deal was blocked by the commission in July 2001.

GE didn't manage to win over the national regulators, so I doubt  Microsoft can, said Thomas Vinje, a competition and intellectual property lawyer in Brussels and a vocal critic of  Microsoft. His clients include the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which has played a prominent role in antitrust cases against Microsoft on both sides of the Atlantic.

Even if Microsoft does find a sympathetic audience among national regulators, they are highly unlikely to demand changes to the commission's draft ruling, said Jacques Bourgeois, a longtime  competition lawyer in the Brussels office of the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &Feld.

In my experience, I have never seen a fundamental change to a draft ruling after one of these meetings, said Bourgeois, who has no direct involvement in the  Microsoft case.

Microsoft executives declined to comment on the Monday meeting. The company has repeatedly said that it wants to reach an amicable solution with European regulators. A settlement could come at any time before the commission issues its final ruling, which could come as soon as March 24.

The biggest impact of a ruling against  Microsoft would be seen in how the company sells its music- and video-playing software, called Media Player. Instead of bundling the program into its Windows operating system, as Microsoft does at present, the  European Commission is expected to demand that the company sell two versions of Windows to manufacturers of personal computers: one with Media Player and one with it stripped out.

The commission has contended that by bundling Media Player into Windows,  Microsoft is abusing the dominance of the operating system to the detriment of competitors such as Real Networks and Apple Computer, which have their own media players.

Microsoft Windows software generated sales of $3.4 billion in Western Europe in 2002, the research firm International Data Corp. estimates.  Microsoft does not break out sales figures by region. But any fine would be calculated as a percentage, up to 10 percent, of its global sales, which were $32.29 billion in the year to June 2003

Microsoft lawyers in the past have said that any remedy imposed in Europe might be extended to all Windows programs in all regions of the world, including the United States. Yet some analysts point to recent indications that  Microsoft could tailor a version of its software for Europe.

Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst with IDC, said that  Microsoft recently introduced a version of Windows specifically for the Thai market.

Microsoft may be trying to gain expertise in building a granular version of Windows ahead of the European ruling, he said. The impact of the European ruling could be limited to Europe until the rest of the world demands something similar.

Ordering Microsoft to sell two separate versions of Windows to PC makers would restore  competition to the audio and video software market only if the version without Media Player were sold at a discount, analysts and lawyers said.

Pricing is one of the components that must be considered if the ruling is to have any effect, Kusnetzky said.

A person close to the case said the commission could not dictate the prices of the different versions. The draft ruling, however, orders  Microsoft not to do anything that would make a bundled version of
Windows more attractive to PC makers than an unbundled one, this person said.

In addition to the bundling question, the  European Commission wants to require  Microsoft to share enough of the Windows source code with rivals to allow them to design server software that works as smoothly with Windows as  Microsoft's own server software. Servers connect networks of PCs.

One of Microsoft's competitors in this market is Sun Microsystems, which complained to the  European Commission in 1998 that it was unable to compete fairly with  Microsoft because it did not have the necessary information about Windows to make its products work properly with Windows on individual PCs.

We spend millions of dollars trying to reverse-engineer Windows so as to allow our server software to work with it, said Lee Patch, Sun vice president for legal affairs. That's innovation wasted.

The commission is expected to order  Microsoft to propose what source code should be disclosed to allow rivals' software to work with Windows.

According to a person who has seen the draft ruling,  Microsoft will have to bring concrete proposals to the commission within two or three months of a ruling. The commission would then consult rivals, including Sun, to see if the information  Microsoft offers is enough to make competing server software fully interoperable with Windows.

Microsoft is more likely to agree to the commission's demands concerning this second issue. There is already a precedent. In 1984, International Business Machines ended a four-year investigation by the European Commission by agreeing to license certain interface information to competitors in Europe.

The IBM solution was a good solution for its time, Patch said. It's not far removed from what we're after, but time is running out for  Microsoft to reach a similar settlement now.

European Union (EU) antitrust regulators on Monday unanimously supported a landmark  antitrust
ruling against Microsoft Corp. over the sale of its Windows operating systems.

The draft ruling takes issue with the way the U.S. software giant sells Windows Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating systems, the  European Commission said.

TD
The draft ruling requires  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to computer makers for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would include Windows Media Player as in the current system and the other would have it removed.
The draft ruling is expected to be formally adopted next Wednesday.

The commission, the executive body of the EU, sets a  fine against Microsoft next Monday and local media reported that it could be $100 million to $1 billion.
Europe accounts for about 30% of  Microsoft's sales.

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Reuters) - EU experts gathered on Monday to discuss a landmark  antitrust ruling that could change the way  Microsoft sells audio-visual software as part of its ubiquitous Windows operating system.

As the clock ticked toward the  European Commission's final decision later this month, national antitrust experts from European Union states began an advisory meeting at 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) and were due to sit until six p.m. (1700 GMT).

TD
The Commission, which polices European  antitrust laws, was to lay out its case against the world's biggest software company point by point and seek the opinion of national experts on each.

A later meeting of the experts is expected to discuss what size of  fine to levy on Microsoft, a sum that is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of euros.

A draft decision drawn up by the Commission requires  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers and to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows
stripped of built-in audiovisual software, said sources familiar with the case.
Countries sometimes dissent on individual points but advisory committees have always endorsed the
Commission view. No one expected otherwise on Monday.

Meanwhile, settlement talks between  Microsoft and the Commission continued even at this late date, sources said.
The advisory panel will meet again on March 22 to endorse the  fine.

The Commission has set March 24 for its decision, according to a draft agenda, the sources say. Only once it is endorsed will EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announce one of the most important rulings of his five-year tenure.

The Commission plans to give  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action, the sources said.

The Commission has fine-tuned its draft ruling to stand up to scrutiny by EU courts in Luxembourg, where Microsoft is certain to appeal an adverse decision.

Unlike the United States system, where a judge makes the initial decision, in Europe the Commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal.

The company's first move would be to ask a court to suspend the Commission ruling until the case is completed, which could could take three to four years and be subject to further appeal.

The EU Court of First Instance has the option of granting a suspension, denying it, or asking the parties' consent to put the case on a one-year fast track and, if both sides agree, freeze remedies in the meantime.

EU MICROSOFT CHARGES

Microsoft acknowledges that Windows, which runs on nearly all personal computers, is dominant. The Commission draft considered by the advisory committee says the company abused that dominance in two areas, sources say.
First,  Microsoft tried to hurt rival makers of audiovisual software by bundling its own Windows Media
Player with its operating system, the sources say.

The draft requires  Microsoft ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now. The other would have it stripped out.
The aim is to free computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audiovisual software such as
RealNetworks RealPlayer or Apple Quicktime, the sources say.

Microsoft says Windows Media Player is built in and removing it would damage Windows. RealNetworks used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be safely removed.

Second, the Commission will rule that  Microsoft has given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete with the company's products.

As a result,  Microsoft's low-level servers, performing tasks such as printing and file handling, work better with Windows.

The draft decision says the U.S. firm must share more of its protocols with rivals, charging a reasonable royalty. It will be left to  Microsoft to work out the precise solution, with close oversight by the Commission, the sources said.

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Monday that an advisory committee of competition experts from EU member states had endorsed its draft action plan in its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft (MSFT.O).

"I've just been informed that the meeting is over and that the member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," said Amelia Torres, the Commission's  competition spokeswoman, at a daily news briefing.

TD
Sources have said the Commission draft decision requires  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers and to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, said sources familiar with the case.

The panel of EU experts is expected later this month to discuss a Commission recommendation for a fine that could run to hundreds of millions of euros against  Microsoft for antritrust abuses, the sources have said.

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Reuters) - European Union states on Monday unanimously threw their weight behind a landmark ruling against  Microsoft that would find it broke  antitrust law and seek changes in how it sells audiovisual software.

Microsoft also faces the prospect of a  fine expected to run into hundreds of millions of euros as part of the European Commission's sanctions against the company.  Microsoft is certain to appeal any EU decision it does not like.

TD
Microsoft shares were down 0.7 percent at $25.20 in morning trading in New York.

"I've just been informed that the meeting is over and that the member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," said Commission  competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres.
She was referring to a meeting of  competition experts from the 15 EU states, which backed
Commission recommendations on steps to take against  Microsoft.

The EU advisory committee's views are not binding but make chances of a settlement more remote with only nine days until a final decision by the full  European Commission.

The Commission draft backed by the experts requires that  Microsoft provide computer makers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, people close to the case said.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said after the meeting that the company was still working to find a settlement with the Commission.
But a competition expert saw a compromise as being tough.

"The Commission's already got the opinion of the member states that these are the right remedies. To substitute different remedies now would be very difficult," said David Wood, a  competition lawyer
with Howrey Simon in Brussels.
The EU advisory committee will meet again on March 22 to decide whether to endorse the proposed
fine, with the Commission's final ruling coming two days later.
The Commission fine-tuned the decision to stand up to scrutiny by EU courts in Luxembourg.

Microsoft acknowledges that Windows, which runs on nearly all personal computers, is dominant. The Commission draft says the company abused that dominance in two areas, sources say.
HURTING  MICROSOFT RIVALS
First,  Microsoft tried to hurt rival makers of audiovisual software by bundling its Windows Media
Player with Windows.



Page 113 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The draft requires  Microsoft ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now, the other would have it stripped out.
The aim is to free computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audiovisual software such as
RealNetworks RealPlayer or Apple Quicktime, the sources say.

Microsoft says Windows Media Player is built in and removing it would damage the operating system. RealNetworks has used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be removed.

Second, the draft says  Microsoft has given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete.

As a result,  Microsoft's low-level servers, performing tasks such as printing and file handling, work better with Windows.

The draft decision says the U.S. firm must share more of its protocols with rivals, charging a reasonable royalty. It will be left to  Microsoft to work out the precise solution, with close oversight by the Commission, the sources said.
The draft gives  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action.

Unlike the United States system, where a judge makes the initial decision, in Europe the Commission hands down a ruling and courts provide an avenue for appeal.

The company's first move would be to ask a court to suspend the Commission ruling until the case is completed, which could could take three to four years and be subject to further appeal.

The EU Court of First Instance may grant suspension, deny it, or ask the parties' consent to put the case on a one-year fast track and, if both sides agree, freeze remedies.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Top  antitrust regulators from the 15 nations in the European Union will gather Monday in the Centre Borschette in Brussels to discuss a draft ruling that finds  Microsoft (MSFT) guilty of abusing its dominance in operating software, The New York Times reported in its Monday editions.

In less than two weeks, barring a last-minute settlement, the  European Commission is expected to declare Microsoft an abusive monopolist, impose a  fine of $100 million to $1 billion and order the company to make fundamental changes to the way it sells software in Europe, the Times reports.

Microsoft officials declined to comment on the meeting. The company has repeatedly said it wants to reach an amicable solution with European regulators, and the newspaper reports that a settlement is possible any time before the commission issues its final ruling, which could come as soon as March

BRUSSELS, March 15 (Xinhua) - The  European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU), is set to impose fines of 200 million euros (about 240 million US dollars) on US software giant Microsoft for breaching EU competition laws, said an online newsletter EUobserver on Monday.

In addition to the hefty  fines, Microsoft would also be forced to offer versions of its Windows operating system without certain features, notably Windows media player, which allows users to download sound and video clips.

TD


The European Union believes that
Microsoft's practice of
including this media player with its Windows system - known as " bundling" - is an abuse of its dominant market position.
The five-year investigation into the case is due to end on 24
March unless a settlement can be reached.
It is reported that competition experts from the 15 EU member states has approved the EU proposals.
A similar case in the United States ended without fines being levied on the software company, which employs over 12,000 people in Europe.

Microsoft has broken European Union  antitrust law and must face sanctions, according to a draft decision expected to win endorsement today from an advisory committee of the 15 EU states.

The European Commission draft requires  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers and to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, sources cited by Reuters say.

TD
EU regulators have found that the world's biggest software company has refused to halt its violations. Since continuing settlement talks have produced no deal, the ruling sets out detailed plans to impose changes.

The advisory panel of national  antitrust experts is also expected to endorse a  fine of hundreds of millions of pounds, but not until a second and final meeting on March 22. The Commission has set March 24 for the decision, according to a draft agenda, the sources say. Only once it is endorsed will EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announce one of the most important rulings of his
five-year tenure.

HD     EU may recommend sanctions in Microsoft anti-trust case - sources. WC    475 words

BRUSSELS (AFX) - An anti-trust advisory panel from the European Union and its 15 member countries is to meet Monday on whether to recommend sanctions against software manufacturer  Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominant market position, sources told Agence France-Presse.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it will issue a final ruling on the case on
March 24.

TD
Although the advisory panel could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, the EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said in a speech a few weeks ago that he was mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of monopoly behavior.

In Microsoft's case, the sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system used on 90 percent of personal computers. The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files.
One of the main complaints against  Microsoft is that it squeezes rivals out of the market, such as
Netscape in the past for Internet browsers, or Realnetworks Inc and Apple for media player.
According to the sources, the EU anti-trust experts could require  Microsoft to deliver a version of
Windows to computer manufacturers that does not include the media player, allowing the makers to install
the RealOne or Apple QuickTime players instead.

The commission also has been investigating allegations that  Microsoft is seeking to drive out competition in the market for low-level servers that provide email and intranet services to multiple users, and handle large filing and printing tasks.

The commission wants  Microsoft to make more of its computer code available to rivals, on payment of royalties, to enable rival server manufacturers to compete effectively.

After investigating the case for more than five years, experts in Monti's  competition department concluded in a preliminary finding last month that  Microsoft had infringed EU anti-trust rules.

Sources said the task facing the commission now is to work out with the help of the  competition authorities in the member countries what action to take against  Microsoft, bearing in mind that any sanctions could be appealed to the European Court in an action that drags on for years.

Any decision, the sources said, would probably allow  Microsoft the option of deciding which parts of its program it is prepared to give up. This compromise suggestion came from the EU commissioner for the internal market, Frits Bolkestein, who believes the EU should not take intellectual property rights away from private companies.

Monday's meeting will be consultative. Monti has said that any compromise is possible until the commission issues its final ruling on March 24. Earlier actions by the Commission against  Microsoft have ended in compromises.

Associated Press
BRUSSELS -- The European Union defended its case against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) before national antitrust regulators Monday as it prepares to  fine the U.S. software giant for allegedly abusing its Windows monopoly and order deep changes in the way the company operates.

TD
The closed-door session with representatives of the 15 EU governments wasn't expected to produce major changes to the  European Commission's draft ruling, which could be adopted as early as next week, barring a last-minute settlement.

A Microsoft spokesman in Brussels said the company's legal team remained in daily contact with the commission, trying to resolve the long-running case amicably.

Microsoft is seeking to avert a far-reaching order that would not only result in a  fine of up to $3 billion, but also force the company to change the way it sells its flagship Windows to computer makers in Europe.

A negative decision would be the biggest setback for Microsoft since a U.S. judge found it guilty of antitrust violations involving Internet browsers in 2000. Microsoft reached a settlement with the Bush administration a year later that allowed it to keep its Internet Explorer in Windows with some
conditions.

Sources familiar with the EU case say the draft ruling similarly finds  Microsoft abused its monopoly in computer operating software to gain market share in markets for digital media players and low-end servers.

The EU wants to force  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its own Media Player to give rivals like RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) a better shot at getting onto consumer desktops. It also would demand  Microsoft release more basic code for Windows to improve "interoperability" with competing networking software made by Sun Microsystems (SUNW) and others.

Monday's committee session gives governments a final opportunity to comment on the commission's draft decision, which was sent to capitals last month.

Governments may seek to  fine-tune some points but usually go along with the broad proposal, having followed the process since the commission issued its first charge sheet against  Microsoft in July 2001.

"It's certainly very unusual, almost unknown, for the advisory committee by a big majority to disagree with the whole thing," said John Temple Lang, a former  antitrust director in the Commission.

The committee reconvenes next Monday to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft, and the commission is expected to adopt the decision as early as March 24.

Microsoft is expected to ask the European Court of Justice to suspend any negative decision pending appeal, but legal experts say such an injunction is not automatic.

Given the rapidly changing nature of the industry, the commission is expected to argue its order would be meaningless by the time the appeal is decided, a process that can drag on for years. [ 03-15-04

DAVID BROWN, anchor:

Moving right along to  Microsoft scandal version 10.-something. We've lost count.  Antitrust officials in the European Union today agreed the US-based software giant abused its monopoly power to push its Windows Media Player and other software. The EU panel recommends a multimullion euro  fine. And one other thing, a radical change in how  Microsoft does business over there. MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott reports.

TD
AMY SCOTT reporting:

The draft decision would force  Microsoft to offer European customers two versions of Windows, with and without its Media Player. In other words, to debundle its signature bundling.
Mr. ANDY GAVIL (Howard University): This is what they have really fought against for five long years. SCOTT: Andy Gavil teaches  antitrust law at Howard University.  Microsoft could still settle before the
European Commission makes its final ruling next week. But Gavil says the stakes may be too high for
Microsoft to give up.

Mr. GAVIL: To this day, no court has really specifically altered their basic business strategy, and I think that's why a settlement is unlikely.

SCOTT: The ruling would open the field to rival media software like Real Player and Apple's Quick Time. Microsoft would also have to share more of its Windows code so competitors have a fair shot at selling software that's compatible with the ubiquitous operating system. Microsoft also faces a fine of up to $3 billion. Despite all that, analyst Laura DiDio at the Yankee Group says Microsoft is big enough and nimble enough to absorb the potential damage. The company was ready for this, she says, though stockholders may not be.

Ms. LAURA DIDIO (Yankee Group): Investors are fickle partners at best, and  Microsoft will have to regroup and tell its investors how it plans to sell to these customers in the European Union.

SCOTT: DiDio says the ruling in Europe could fuel  Microsoft's ongoing legal battles in the US and the company's willingness to settle those cases. The first state class-action suit to actually go to trial got under way in Minnesota today. In that case, plaintiffs accuse  Microsoft of using its market power to overcharge almost a million customers. In New York, I'm Amy Scott for MARKETPLACE.

HD     Europe set to fine Microsoft: Antitrust regulators meeting today. Greatest effect would be evident in way firm sells its music and video-playing software

BRUSSELS

Top antitrust regulators from the 15 countries in the European Union will gather here today in the Centre Borschette, a bunker-like building a stone's throw from the headquarters of the  European Commission, to discuss a draft ruling that finds  Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominance in operating software.

TD
With this meeting, the clock on the 5-year-old  antitrust case against Microsoft begins to run down. In
less than two weeks, barring a last-minute settlement, the European Commission is expected to declare
Microsoft an abusive monopolist, impose a  fine of $133 million to $1.3 billion and order the company to
make fundamental changes to the way it sells software in Europe.

Such a ruling would be a significant setback for  Microsoft after it overcame its most serious legal challenge by settling a sweeping  antitrust case in the United States in 2001. And it would be the defining moment in the five-year tenure of Mario Monti, Europe's top  antitrust regulator, whose term ends in the fall.

Microsoft has lobbied national governments in an effort to persuade regulators to tone down the ruling of the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union.

But Microsoft's political influence is limited in Europe. The company employs 12,000 people in Europe, the Middle East and Africa - less than one-quarter of the 55,000 General Electric employed in the European Union when it was trying to win regulatory approval of its planned acquisition of Honeywell International for $60 billion. That deal was blocked by the commission in July 2001.

"GE didn't manage to win over the national regulators, so I doubt  Microsoft can," said Thomas Vinje, a competition and intellectual property lawyer in Brussels and a vocal critic of  Microsoft. His clients include the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which has played a prominent role in antitrust cases against Microsoft on both sides of the Atlantic.

Even if Microsoft does find a sympathetic audience among the national regulators, they are highly unlikely to demand changes to the commission's proposed ruling, said Jacques Bourgeois, a longtime competition lawyer in Brussels. "In my experience, I have never seen a fundamental change to a draft ruling after one of these meetings," he said. Bourgeois has no direct involvement in the  Microsoft case.

Microsoft officials declined to comment on today's meeting. The company has repeatedly said it wants to reach an amicable solution with European regulators. A settlement is possible any time before the commission issues its final ruling, which could come as soon as March 24.

The greatest effect of a ruling against  Microsoft would be evident in the way the company sells its music and video-playing software program Media Player. Instead of bundling the program into its Windows operating system as  Microsoft does now, the  European Commission is expected to demand  Microsoft

sell two versions of Windows to manufacturers of personal computers - one of them with Media Player stripped out.

The commission has contended by bundling Media Player into Windows,  Microsoft is abusing the dominance of the operating system to the detriment of competitors like RealNetworks and QuickTime.

BRUSSELS, March 14 -- On Monday, top  antitrust regulators from the 15 nations in the European Union will gather here in the Centre Borschette, a bunkerlike building a stone's throw from the headquarters of the  European Commission, to discuss a draft ruling that finds  Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominance in operating software.

With this meeting, the clock on the five-year-old  antitrust case against Microsoft begins to run down. In less than two weeks, barring a last-minute settlement, the European Commission is expected to declare Microsoft an abusive monopolist, impose a  fine of $100 million to $1 billion and order the company to make fundamental changes to the way it sells software in Europe.

Such a ruling would be a significant setback for  Microsoft after it overcame its most serious legal challenge by settling a sweeping  antitrust case in the United States in 2001. And it would be the defining moment in the five-year tenure of Mario Monti, Europe's top  antitrust regulator, whose term ends in the fall.

Microsoft has lobbied national governments in an effort to persuade regulators to tone down the ruling of the European Commission, the year-round administrative arm of the European Union.

But Microsoft's political influence is limited in Europe. The company employs 12,000 people in Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- less than a quarter of the 55,000 that General Electric employed in the European Union when it was trying to win regulatory approval of its planned acquisition of Honeywell International for $45 billion. That deal was blocked by the commission in July 2001.

''G.E. didn't manage to win over the national regulators, so I doubt  Microsoft can,'' said Thomas Vinje, a competition and intellectual property lawyer in Brussels and a vocal critic of  Microsoft. His clients include the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which has played a prominent role in antitrust cases against Microsoft on both sides of the Atlantic.

Even if Microsoft does find a sympathetic audience among the national regulators, they are highly unlikely to demand changes to the commission's proposed ruling, said Jacques Bourgeois, a longtime competition lawyer in Brussels. ''In my experience, I have never seen a fundamental change to a draft ruling after one of these meetings,'' he said. Mr. Bourgeois has no direct involvement in the  Microsoft case.

Microsoft officials declined to comment on Monday's meeting. The company has repeatedly said that it wants to reach an amicable solution with European regulators. A settlement is possible any time before the commission issues its final ruling, which could come as soon as March 24.

The greatest effect of a ruling against  Microsoft would be evident in the way the company sells its music and video-playing software program Media Player. Instead of bundling the program into its Windows operating system as  Microsoft does now, the  European Commission is expected to

Page 127 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
demand that  Microsoft sell two versions of Windows to manufacturers of personal computers -- one of them with Media Player stripped out.

The commission has contended that by bundling Media Player into Windows,  Microsoft is abusing the dominance of the operating system to the detriment of competitors like RealNetworks and QuickTime.

''Media Player is an integral part in Microsoft's longer-term strategy for Windows,'' a recent Goldman, Sachs research note said. Microsoft, it said, ''may refuse to settle, electing to challenge this in court.''

But a legal challenge, an appeal at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, would take at least three years to conclude. In the meantime, the court may turn down a request to suspend the changes ordered by the commission until after the appeal, forcing the company to alter the way it does business in Europe.

Windows software generated sales of $3.4 billion in Western Europe in 2002, nearly 30 percent of worldwide sales, according to an estimate by a research company, the International Data Corporation. (Microsoft does not break out sales figures by region.)

Microsoft lawyers have said that any legal remedy imposed on its operations in Europe might be extended to all Windows programs in all regions, including the United States. Yet some analysts point to recent indications that  Microsoft could tailor a version of its software for Europe.

Dan Kusnetzky of International Data said  Microsoft recently introduced a version of Windows specifically for the Thai market.

''Microsoft may be trying to gain expertise in building a granular version of Windows ahead of the European ruling,'' he said. ''The impact of the European ruling could be limited to Europe until the rest of the world demands something similar.''

Ordering Microsoft to sell two separate versions of Windows to PC manufacturers would restore competition to the audio and video software market only if the version without Media Player were sold at a discount, analysts and lawyers said. ''Pricing is one of the components that must be considered if the ruling is to have any effect,'' Mr. Kusnetzky said.

A person close to the case said that the commission could not dictate the prices of the different versions.

But the draft ruling orders that  Microsoft ''must not do anything which would make a bundled version of Windows more attractive to PC makers than an unbundled one,'' this person said.

In addition to the bundling question, the commission also wants to force  Microsoft to share enough Windows secret code to allow rivals to design server software that works as smoothly with Windows as Microsoft's own server software. Servers connect networks of personal computers. A Microsoft competitor in this market, Sun Microsystems, complained to the European Commission in 1998 that it was unable to compete fairly with  Microsoft because it did not have the necessary information about Windows to make its products work properly with Windows on individual computers.

''We spend millions of dollars trying to reverse-engineer Windows so as to allow our server software to work with it,'' said Lee Patch, Sun's vice president for legal affairs.

The commission is expected to order  Microsoft to propose what computer code information should be disclosed to allow rivals' software to work with Windows. The settlement with the Justice Department also has a software licensing provision, although some competitors have complained that  Microsoft's conditions are prohibitive.

According to a person who has seen the draft ruling,  Microsoft would have to report back to the commission with concrete proposals within two or three months. The regulator would then consult competitors including Sun to see if the information  Microsoft offered was enough to make rival server software interoperable with Windows.

Microsoft is more likely to agree to the commission's demands concerning this second matter, and there is already a precedent. In 1984, I.B.M. ended a four-year investigation by the  European              Commission by agreeing to license certain interface information to competitors in Europe. ''The I.B.M. solution was a good solution for its time,'' Mr. Patch of Sun Microsystems said. ''It's not far removed from what we're after, but time is running out for  Microsoft to reach a similar settlement now.''

DAVID BROWN, anchor:

Moving right along to  Microsoft scandal version 10.-something. We've lost count.  Antitrust officials in the European Union today agreed the US-based software giant abused its monopoly power to push its Windows Media Player and other software. The EU panel recommends a multimullion euro  fine. And one other thing, a radical change in how  Microsoft does business over there. MARKETPLACE's Amy Scott reports.

TD
AMY SCOTT reporting:

The draft decision would force  Microsoft to offer European customers two versions of Windows, with and without its Media Player. In other words, to debundle its signature bundling.
Mr. ANDY GAVIL (Howard University): This is what they have really fought against for five long years. SCOTT: Andy Gavil teaches  antitrust law at Howard University.  Microsoft could still settle before the
European Commission makes its final ruling next week. But Gavil says the stakes may be too high for
Microsoft to give up.

Mr. GAVIL: To this day, no court has really specifically altered their basic business strategy, and I think that's why a settlement is unlikely.

SCOTT: The ruling would open the field to rival media software like Real Player and Apple's Quick Time. Microsoft would also have to share more of its Windows code so competitors have a fair shot at selling software that's compatible with the ubiquitous operating system. Microsoft also faces a fine of up to $3 billion. Despite all that, analyst Laura DiDio at the Yankee Group says Microsoft is big enough and nimble enough to absorb the potential damage.

Ms. LAURA DIDIO (Yankee Group): Investors are fickle partners at best, and  Microsoft will have to regroup and tell its investors how it plans to sell to these customers in the European Union.

SCOTT: DiDio says the ruling in Europe could fuel  Microsoft's ongoing legal battles in the US and the company's willingness to settle those cases.

BRUSSELS -  Microsoft Corp. has broken European Union  antitrust law and must face sanctions, according to a draft decision expected to win endorsement today from an advisory committee of the
15 EU states.

The European Commission draft requires  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers and to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, sources familiar with the case say.

TD
EU regulators have found that the world's biggest software company has refused to halt its violations. Since continuing settlement talks have produced no deal, the ruling sets out detailed plans to impose changes.

The advisory panel of national  antitrust experts is also expected to endorse a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros, but not until a second and final meeting on March 22.

The commission has set March 24 for the decision, according to a draft agenda, the sources say. Only once it is endorsed will EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announce one of the most important rulings of his five-year tenure.

"The key to the current decision is to establish principles and not simply solutions to individual issues," said David Wood, a  competition lawyer for Howrey Simon in Brussels.

Mr. Wood noted that EU regulators had dealt with a series of  Microsoft cases during the 1990s, reaching compromises with the software giant in 1994 and 1997, but took no formal decisions.

"How many more Microsofts will there be?" he asked, saying the commission had recognized a need to change the way the U.S. giant does business in Europe. "That's the focus of the case."

The commission intends to give  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action, the sources said.
The Commission has worked and re-worked its draft ruling to stand up to scrutiny by EU courts in
Luxembourg, to which  Microsoft is certain to appeal in the case of any adverse decision.

The company's first move would be to ask a court to suspend the commission ruling until the case is completed, which could take three to four years.

The EU Court of First Instance has the option of granting a suspension, denying it, or asking the parties' consent to put the case on a one-year fast track and, if both sides agree, freeze remedies in the meantime.  Microsoft acknowledges that Windows, which runs on nearly all personal computers, is dominant. The commission will find the company abused that dominance in two areas.

Page 131 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
First,  Microsoft tried to hurt rival makers of audiovisual software by bundling its own Windows Media
Player with its ubiquitous operating system, the sources say.

The advisory committee is expected to endorse a proposal requiring  Microsoft to ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe, the sources say.

One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now. The other would have it stripped out.
The aim is to free computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audiovisual software such as
RealNetworks RealPlayer or Apple's Quicktime, the sources say.

Microsoft says Windows Media Player is an inherent part of the operating system and cannot be stripped out. RealNetworks used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be.

Second, the Commission will rule that  Microsoft has given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete with the company's products.

As a result,  Microsoft's low-level servers, which perform tasks such as printing and file handling, work better with Windows.

HD         EU states back Brussels' stance on Microsoft. BY         BY DANIEL DOMBEY IN BRUSSELS

The European Union's 15 member states on Monday backed the  European Commission's case against Microsoft's alleged abuse of its Windows monopoly, making a Commission decision against the software giant even more likely.

Several big member states led by Britain and Germany, specifically called for the Brussels watchdog to rule against Microsoft rather than reach a last-minute deal, say people following the closed-door meeting.

TD
"The member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," said a spokeswoman for Mario Monti,  competition commissioner.

However, one other person following the case said some countries were concerned that a Brussels decision would apply only to the EU and other European states. By contrast, a possible deal with Microsoft might apply worldwide, at least in part.

Brussels argues Microsoft has unfairly leveraged its dominance over personal computer operating systems into other markets, such as those for servers and for media player programs.

It is due to rule on the case by March 24, when it plans to demand that  Microsoft share more information with rivals and give computer manufacturers a choice of versions of Windows with and without its Media Player program.

Brussels also wants to impose a  fine understood to be in the E100m-E200m ($122.3m-$244.7m) range, although some lawyers think it could be more. The  fine is set to be discussed by member states on March 22.

Monday's consultations with national  competition bodies are non-binding, but could have made life difficult for Mr Monti if they had not backed his approach. By contrast, the national authorities' support for Mr Monti now means it would be hard for him to reach a deal that differs substantially with his draft decision.

"Given the broad support for the Commission proceedings among the member states, we certainly hope the Commission will issue a decision imposing an effective remedy," said Dave Stewart, deputy legal counsel at RealNetworks, one of  Microsoft's chief foes in the case.

Microsoft, which argues that other companies have limited rights to its intellectual property and that Media Player is an integral part of Windows, says it is working closely with Brussels to reach a deal. Talks continued throughout the weekend.

But time is running out for a deal, particularly because it would be difficult for Mr Monti to agree a settlement with  Microsoft if member states back a  fine, as they may do next Monday.

HD     EU set to rule Microsoft a monopoly ; Declaring  software  giant anti-competitive could force changes in Windows

LONDON -- Europe's antitrust watchdogs bared their teeth Monday, unanimously approving a draft ruling that would force Microsoft Corp. to make major changes in its software and its business practices. The vote by representatives of 15 European Union governments clears the way -- unless ongoing talks
produce a last- minute settlement -- for the  European Commission to declare next week that the world's largest software company is an abusive monopolist.

Sound familiar? The finding is very similar to those of U.S. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in 1999, when the Department of Justice sued  Microsoft for antitrust violations involving its Internet browser.

TD
The draft ruling prepared by EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is expected to require  Microsoft
to provide computer makers with two versions of Windows -- one like current versions that has its
Windows Media Player for music and video built in, and another one that doesn't.

That would free computer makers to sell versions of Windows, which runs 90 percent of the world's personal computers, that include RealNetworks Inc.'s RealPlayer or other rival audio-visual software.

The ruling also is likely to require  Microsoft to share proprietary information with rivals so that they can design server software that works with Windows just as well as  Microsoft's own.

The EU antitrust regulators are scheduled to meet Monday for a final day of talks, which reportedly will focus on the size of a fine against Microsoft, which could be anywhere from $100 million to $3 billion. Then, the European Commission is to meet March 24 to issue the final ruling.

Such a ruling could affect  Microsoft's bottom line: The company sold $3.4 billion of its Windows software in Western Europe in 2002, almost a third of worldwide sales.

But a Microsoft spokesman said Monday's decision was fully expected, and that the company would continue trying to negotiate a settlement with the EU.

The venue and the circumstances of the European case are different from the U.S. battle, but  Microsoft's argument is the same.

It has argued that playing audio and video -- like surfing the Web in the previous case -- has been an integral part of the Windows operating system and should remain integrated with the software.
If no settlement is reached,  Microsoft has the option of appealing the ruling to the European Court of First
Instance in Luxembourg and asking that any sanctions be suspended pending the appeal, which could
take years to resolve.

Microsoft won an appeal in the United States that rescinded Jackson's initial plan to break up the company.

"It's very clear that the liability case against  Microsoft is very solid and strong, and so it's not surprising that the member states agreed with the commission," said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association in Washington, a trade group representing many of  Microsoft's rivals.


Page 136 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Black said he thinks  Microsoft's dealings with  antitrust regulators will continue long after a final ruling is issued in the European case.

"Microsoft has never changed its anti-competitive behavior, and I don't believe even this European ruling will change the company's attitude," he said. "I expect the United States and Japan, and even the EU, to all come across more reasons in the future to proceed against  Microsoft."
In recent months,  Microsoft and PC makers have been pushing new "media center" PCs based on
Windows Media Player that are designed to serve as home entertainment hubs.

Forcing Microsoft to strip its media player from some versions of its Windows operating system could put a major crimp in the company's growth plans, said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on  Microsoft, an independent research company in Kirkland, Wash.

"The media center PC obviously doesn't make much sense if you can't use it to play digital media," he said.

Microsoft surely would find a way to work around the EU requirement, probably by providing customers with free downloads of Windows Media Player or CDs containing the software, Rosoff said.
"It's just going to be a little added hassle for European consumers," he said.

Th head of US software giant  Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, held talks with EU  competition chief Mario Monti on Tuesday aimed at reaching a last-ditch compromise in a long-running anti-trust probe, a source said.

TD
The Microsoft chief executive met Monti in Brussels a week ahead of an expected ruling by the commission over its probe into alleged abuses of his company's overwhelmingly dominant position in the personal computer market.
Ballmer's unannounced trip to Brussels came a day after anti-trust experts from EU member states met
European Commission regulators and agreed to back the EU executive's appraisal of the case.

Monday's talks were about what anti-trust violations  Microsoft is guilty of and what remedies it should be compelled to undertake.

A further meeting next Monday will decide what, if any,  fines Microsoft should face before the commission announces its final verdict in the five-year investigation two days later.

Although the EU could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, Monti has said he is mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of  Microsoft's domination in PC software.
In Microsoft's case, sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows
Media Player from the Windows operating system, which is used on 90 percent of PCs.

The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.

The EU investigation represents the last hope for  Microsoft's rivals after the company largely settled its anti-trust problems in the United States.

US software giant  Microsoft and the European Commission are to continue negotiations in Brussels aimed at reaching a last-ditch compromise in a long-running anti-trust probe, a commission spokeswoman said Tuesday.

TD
Talks between  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti ended Tuesday without a settlement of the anti-trust case against the software giant, commission spokeswoman Emilia Torres said.
"The talks are over for today and negotiations are ongoing," Torres told reporters.

The Microsoft chief executive met Monti in Brussels a week ahead of an expected ruling by the commission over its probe into alleged abuses of his company's overwhelmingly dominant position in the personal computer market.
Ballmer's unannounced trip to Brussels came a day after anti-trust experts from EU member states met
European Commission regulators and agreed to back the EU executive's appraisal of the case.

Monday's talks were about what anti-trust violations  Microsoft is guilty of and what remedies it should be compelled to undertake.

A further meeting next Monday will decide what, if any,  fines Microsoft should face before the commission announces its final verdict in the five-year investigation two days later.

Although the EU could recommend  fines totalling hundreds of millions of euros, Monti has said he is mostly interested in market remedies to redress the distorting effects of  Microsoft's domination in PC software.
In Microsoft's case, sources said, this could take the form of a requirement that it detach the Windows
Media Player from the Windows operating system, which is used on 90 percent of PCs.

The media player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.

The EU investigation represents the last hope for  Microsoft's rivals after the company largely settled its anti-trust problems in the United States.
One of the main complaints against  Microsoft is that it squeezes rivals out of the market, such as
Netscape in the past for Internet browsers, or RealNetworks and Apple for the media player.

The commission has also been investigating allegations that  Microsoft is seeking to drive out competition in the market for low-level servers that provide e-mail and intranet services to multiple users, and handle large filing and printing tasks.

The EU executive has backed away from a hardline stance against  Microsoft and has increasingly floated the possibility of reaching a settlement that would forestall a long and costly legal battle.

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stock futures were holding higher Tuesday, but off overnight peaks as European stocks drifted little changed amid much weaker-than-expected German investor sentiment in March. Markets are expected to adopt a more definitive tone after the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. No one thinks the Fed is going to raise interest rates, but economists will be watching the FOMC's tortured language for any hints of future policy actions. The announcement is scheduled for about 2:15 p.m. Eastern. Economists pushed back their forecast of any Fed rate hike into late this year or early next year after the disappointing February unemployment report. The weak U.S. jobs report contributed to the unexpected drop in March Zew reading of German institutional investor sentiment. More M&A surfaced overnight after a busy deal-day Monday. BancWest said early Tuesday it will acquire Community First Bankshares in a cash deal valued at $1.2 billion.

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stock futures were holding higher Tuesday, heading for a better start in New York as Lehman Brothers and 3M cheered on profits growth. Lehman Brothers opened the Wall Street banks' quarter with first-quarter net income rise to $670 million, or $2.21 per share, compared with $301 million,
or $1.15 per share in the year-ago period. A survey of analysts by Thomson First Call forecasted earnings of $1.62 for Lehman Brothers Dow industrials futures were up 53 points at about 8:30 a.m. Eastern to
10,150, with the trend little impacted by a surprise decline in the construction of new U.S. houses in February. The futures were lifting European markets in a choppy day of trade. Spanish stocks were also around 1. 5 percent higher. Markets are expected to adopt a more definitive tone after the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.

Brussels, 15/03/2004 (Agence Europe) - "The Member States have ruled unanimously on the draft Microsoft decision", said Amelia Torres on Monday. The spokesperson to Commissioner Monti was referring to the meeting behind closed doors of the consultative committee of experts from the Member States, which met that same morning. A final meeting is planned for 22 March, and the final decision is expected for 24 March. The  European Commission is therefore preparing to penalise the American group for abusing its dominant position. All that remains to be settled, at the time of writing, is the sum of the fine. On learning of the result of the meeting, British Liberal MEP Chris Huhne welcomed the decision the Commission is preparing to return: "Everybody who was worried about keeping markets competitive only need to applaud the Commission's political courage, attacking the world software giant", he said.

Terrorism tops EU agenda after Madrid blasts
BRUSSELS - The European Union may appoint a special anti-terrorism tsar in the wake of last week's
Madrid bombings, top EU officials said on Monday.

Proposals for tougher EU action in response to Thursday's train blasts - killing 200 people and wounding 1,500 - are being floated amid fears that the Madrid attacks are a sign that Islamic militants are now targeting Europe.

Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, whose country holds the EU presidency, said the bloc should consider appointing a security coordinator to boost cooperation between EU bodies and streamline the fight against terrorism.

The plans are likely to be debated at an emergency meeting of EU interior and justice ministers on Friday before a summit of European leaders on March 25-26, where terrorism is likely to overshadow scheduled talks on economic reforms.

Europe-wide rail, metro alert after Madrid blasts

PARIS - From the Atlantic to the Urals, rail and metro networks were on high alert on Monday in a bid to avoid a repeat of last week's Madrid carnage, but police warned they faced a mammoth task protecting millions of passengers.
French police carried out luggage spot checks at mainline stations while in Britain, plainclothes
anti-terrorist officers patrolled the London underground network after the Madrid train bombs that killed
200 people and wounded 1,500.
"I just accept that travelling on the tube at the moment is like playing a game of roulette," said London
Underground passenger James Blomfield.

Britain was America's staunchest ally in the war in Iraq, and police say it is only a matter of time before al Qaeda launches an attack there.

The United States has deployed extra police on trains and at stations following the Madrid blasts. Italy and Poland, which backed the Iraq war, have urged travellers to be vigilant.

EU sets urgent anti-terror talks after Spain bombs

BRUSSELS - European Union justice and home affairs ministers will hold emergency
counter-terrorism talks in Brussels on Friday in reaction to the devastating bomb attacks in Madrid, the
Irish EU presidency said on Monday.

Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said he would ask EU leaders next week to make a political commitment invoking the solidarity clause in a stalled EU constitution that requires all states to provide mutual assistance in response to such threats.

Germany requested the special ministerial session, less than a week before a March 25-26 summit set to be dominated by the fight against terrorism, amid fears that Islamic militants may target other European cities.

EU backs Commission antitrust plan vs Microsoft

BRUSSELS - European Union states on Monday unanimously threw their weight behind a landmark ruling against Microsoft that would find it broke  antitrust law and seek changes in how it sells audiovisual software.

Microsoft also faces the prospect of a  fine expected to run into hundreds of millions of euros as part of the European Commission's sanctions against the company.  Microsoft is certain to appeal any EU decision it does not like.

Cut EU funds for bloc's reform laggards-Belgian PM

BRUSSELS - Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt suggested on Monday that EU countries which fail to reach the bloc's goals on boosting competitiveness should be punished by having their access to European Union funds cut.

The bloc has been struggling to meet its so-called Lisbon goals, set at a summit in the Portuguese capital in 2000, to make its economy the world's most competitive by 2010. The steps involve structural reforms as well as other measures.

"If we...want to create more long-term jobs, more unskilled ...jobs and hold on to an affordable system of solidarity, then we will have to opt for a different, more determined and at the same time more coercive approach," Verhofstadt said in the text of a speech.

"Can a member state which itself continues to invest too few of its national resources in scientific research, come first in line when the time comes to distribute resources from EU research and development programmes?" he added.

EU urges democracy in "linchpin" Kazakhstan

ALMATY - Europe views Kazakhstan as a linchpin in relations with post-Soviet Central Asia, but the oil-rich state must ensure the ties are not strained by corruption or democratic flaws, a top EU official said on Monday.

European Union External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten, the Commission's most senior figure to visit Central Asia since 1996, lauded Kazakhstan's economic progress but called for political and media freedoms to be respected.
"We have had, and I hope will continue to have a good and comprehensive relationship with
Kazakhstan," Patten told a news conference in Almaty at the start of his tour of Central Asia.
"I very much hope this relationship won't be overshadowed by concerns about the electoral process,
by concerns about the treatment of the opposition, by concerns about the treatment of the media or by
concerns about corruption."

Spain Socialist win shifts EU balance away from UK




Page 146 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BRUSSELS - The surprise election victory of Spain's opposition Socialists will alter the balance of power in Europe, robbing pro-U.S. supporters of the Iraq war led by Britain of a key ally, EU diplomats said on Monday.

The result may make other European countries recalculate their involvement in Iraq, and open the way for early compromise on a stalled EU constitution, blocked by outgoing conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to defend Spain's voting power.

Aznar radically changed Spanish foreign policy in his eight years in power, aligning Madrid with London and Washington in contrast to his Socialist predecessor, Felipe Gonzalez, who had mostly sailed in the slipstream of the Franco-German alliance.

"This is going be a major change for the foreign policy of the Union," a senior Brussels official said. "The axis of Blair-Berlusconi-Aznar is gone. It's a chance to recover more unity in Europe."

Green groups urge EU to heed Arctic's plight

BRUSSELS - The European Union must urge Russia to meet global commitments in reducing global warming if the Artic region is to be saved from destruction, environmentalists said on Monday.

The polar region, stretching across northern parts of Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, is rich in resources but its native Inuit population is under threat from melting ice caps.

Russia has yet to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to curb greenhouse gas emissions. After the United States withdrew in 2000, Russia can effectively stop the treaty coming into force.

"Climate change is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as in the rest of the world," Svein Tveitdal, a senior official at the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) told a news conference, asking the EU to maintain its diplomatic efforts.

'Old Europe' seen quietly rooting for Kerry

BERLIN - John Kerry refuses to reveal the identities of foreign leaders he says are hoping he beats George W. Bush, but the list of admirers may include "old Europe" leaders alienated by the U.S. president's policies.

Even though no European leader has gone on record endorsing Kerry over Bush in the U.S. presidential election, analysts say many Western governments and their citizens are rooting from the sidelines for Kerry with unaccustomed zeal.

"You can probably find a lot of top people in governments across Europe very much hoping Kerry will win," said Peter Loesche, a political scientist at Goettingen University. "Bush isn't at all liked in Germany or many places in Europe."

European seen heading IMF,vision needed-IMF source

LONDON - Europe looks likely to keep the top job at the International Monetary Fund which has opened up with the departure of Horst Koehler but the process should be more transparent, an IMF source said on Monday.

African finance ministers and central bank governors last week called for the IMF to open the selection of its next head to all its members instead of sticking to an unwritten rule of picking a European. But they look likely to be disappointed.

"It seems to be that it will be a European but it would be better if the process would be more transparent," the source told Reuters.

SHANGHAI - EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said on Monday that the yuan's peg to the U.S. dollar must go eventually, but the need to scrap it was not urgent.
Lamy also said China's immense demand for raw materials had begun to hurt European industry. Beijing's yuan policy "will have to change, but it will take some time. And we're  fine with it," Europe's
top trade official told business executives in Shanghai, reiterating a longstanding position.
"I don't think it's an urgent problem yet."

Spain's Zapatero aims to revive French, German ties

MADRID - Spain's incoming leader Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said on Monday his government would try to restore "magnificent" ties with France and Germany, after relations were strained by Spain's pro-American stance on Iraq.

"My government, from day one, will try and I hope will succeed in restoring magnificent relations with France, with Germany and with all the countries of the European Union," Zapatero told a news conference.

Spain's Socialists spectacularly ousted Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party in elections on Sunday, a result widely seen as punishment for Aznar's unswerving support for Washington over Iraq - to which suspected al Qaeda train bombings in Madrid last week drew fresh attention.

Spain govt change may help EU constitution-France

PARIS - Spain's change of government could help the European Union resolve differences holding up approval of its planned constitution, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on Monday.

Villepin said the constitution, which has been blocked by stiff opposition from Spain and Poland to its system of voting rights, should be the top issue for Spain's prime minister elect Jose Luis Rodriquez Zapatero.

France and Spain clashed often within the EU, including over Iraq where Madrid backed Washington while Paris led the anti-war camp. French leaders had a thinly disguised scorn for outgoing prime minister Jose Maria Aznar's pro-American leanings.

"We must seize every chance to make Europe advance," Villepin said. "I think we have the chance to try to resolve this constitutional question more quickly. It's vital.

MICROSOFT could be facing a fine of several billion dollars after European Union member states unanimously threw their weight behind a landmark ruling against the US computer giant that could also force it to change how it sells its software in the future. After a closed-door session with representatives of the 15 EU governments yesterday the ruling essentially decided that the US giant had abused its Windows monopoly. European Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said states had "unanimously backed its draft decision" and given the size of the EU market, such an order could have serious implications for Microsoft, not least a  fine of up to US $3 billion (GBP 1.66 billion), according to industry sources. The Commission has long been concerned about the dominance of  Microsoft's Windows operating system.

TD
The current case argues that this dominance has prevented rival packages of multimedia software gaining a foothold in Europe, and also that Microsoft has given too little information about how Windows works. The EU case firstly argued that Microsoft tried to hurt rival makers of audiovisual software by bundling its Windows Media Player with Windows. The draft decision requires  Microsoft to ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe. One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now, the other would have it stripped out. The aim is to free computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audiovisual software such as RealNetworks, RealPlayer or Apple Quicktime, industry sources said. Microsoft says Windows Media Player is built in and removing it would damage the operating system. However, RealNetworks has used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be removed. Second, the draft decision said Microsoft had given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete and as a result, Microsoft's low-level servers, performing tasks such as printing and file handling, work better with Windows. The draft decision said the US firm must share more of its protocols with rivals, charging a reasonable royalty. It will be left to Microsoft to work out the precise solution, with close oversight by the Commission. The 15 national antitrust regulators reconvene next Monday to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft. The Commission is expected to adopt the decision as early as 24
March and set out a time frame for compliance.

ATA GOES TO LaGUARDIA: ATA Airlines said it will offer nonstop service from St.
Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport to New York-LaGuardia once a day beginning May 1.
Beginning June 1, ATA also will offer seasonal service to San Juan, Puerto Rico three times a week.
Pricing for the LaGuardia flight will begin at $78.14 one way, according to ATA.com.

FACTORY OUTPUT UP IN FEBRUARY: Big industry production rose by 0.7 percent in February. The increase in output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities came after a 0.8 percent jump in activity in January, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Last month's industrial production performance was better than the 0.4 percent increase that some economists were forecasting. Gains were widespread in February, with production rising for automotive products, home electronics, business equipment, machinery, food products and chemicals.

DIGITAL LIGHTWAVE ADDS DIRECTOR: Digital Lightwave has filled a key vacancy on its board of directors, putting the company back in compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. The troubled Clearwater maker of fiber-optic testing equipment said Monday that it had appointed Jeffrey S. Chisholm as both a board director and audit committee chairman. Nasdaq requires that a listed company's audit committee be composed solely of outside directors. The company has been out of compliance since the end of 2003, when management professor William F. Hamilton resigned from the board and as audit committee chairman. Chisholm, an independent consultant since 2001 and chairman of Dexit Inc., specializes in corporate turnarounds and brand building.

EU READIES  MICROSOFT RULING: The European Union's  antitrust chief won critical backing Monday for a ruling that would force  Microsoft Corp. to strip its Windows computer operating system of a lucrative component and make other changes. A closed-door session with representatives of the 15
EU governments ended with unanimous backing of the European Commission's draft decision, said commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres. The draft, which would fine Microsoft up to $3-billion and force the company to strip Media Player from its flagship operating system in Europe, is tentatively set to be adopted next week.

NORTHWEST PILOTS CUT SOME: Union leaders for Northwest Airlines pilots have voted to cut pilot labor costs by $200-million a year through 2006, or about half what the airline sought from the union. Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association International for Northwest voted unanimously Sunday to recommend the deal to its 6,300 NWA pilots. The details of the proposal will be made public after they are presented to rank-and-file pilots, who would then be given a chance to respond. Northwest officials had no comment.

GASOLINE CONSUMPTION RISES: Despite record high gasoline prices, U.S. motorists continue to increase consumption and, with supplies tight, that is helping to keep fuel costs propped up. The Energy Department reported Monday that gasoline demand has been roughly 3.7 percent higher than last year. At the same time, gasoline supplies are 1.2 percent below year-ago levels at 220.4-million barrels. Average daily gasoline consumption for the month ended March 5 was about 8.9-million barrels, up from
8.5-million barrels a year earlier.

The long-running battle between the  European commission and Microsoft entered its closing stages yesterday as member states backed Brussels' proposals to stop the software group abusing its dominant market position.

The commission's report, understood to run to 300 pages, comes after a five-year investigation into Microsoft's practices. The EC has the power to  fine Microsoft up to 10% of its global turnover, which could run into billions of euros. Most observers expect a penalty of several hundred million euros.

TD
The report was endorsed yesterday by a committee of  competition experts from the 15 member states. They will meet again to approve the final  fine on March 22, two days before the report is expected to be made public.
EU competition experts said the next week would be fraught with activity.

"This has been a long-running saga," said Mike Pullen, a partner at law firm DLA and a specialist in EU competition law. "But it is not too late for what is sometimes called a last cigarette deal - there is still time for a deal to be struck."

The investigation has centred on two issues: the bundling of  Microsoft's audiovisual software with its successful Windows operating system to the exclusion of competing players; and the difficulties faced by rival firms in developing server software that can communicate with Windows-based machines.

Microsoft had offered to include other players, such as Apple's QuickTime and Real Networks' RealPlayer, on a CD-rom included with copies of Windows, but the commission is understood to have demanded that the company separate Windows Media Player from the operating system entirely.
PC manufacturers selling machines with copies of Windows will be able to choose whether to include
Windows Media Player on the computers they ship to the public or pick a rival's software.

Microsoft has maintained throughout the investigation that unbundling Media Player would degrade Windows' performance, and the commission's ruling on this point is likely to prove unpopular with the company.

The report also calls on  Microsoft to grant its rivals greater access to the code that makes up Windows so they can create software for servers which have to work under the operating system. Microsoft will be allowed to charge a fee for this access.

Legal sources believe Microsoft will appeal against any  fine levied, which is likely to lead to further delays.

EUROPEAN Union states have unanimously thrown their weight behind alandmark ruling against Microsoft that would find it broke  antitrust law and seek changes in how it sells audiovisual software.

Microsoft also faces the prospect of a  fine expected to run into hundreds of millions of euro as part of the  European Commission's sanctions against the company.

TD
Microsoft is certain to appeal any EU decision it does not like.

Microsoft shares were down 0.79pc at $25.18 in closing trade in New York last night.

"I've just been informed that the meeting is over and that the member states haveunanimously backed the Commission's draft decision," said Commission competitionspokeswoman Amelia Torres.
She was referring to a meeting of  competition experts from the 15 EU states, which backed
Commission recommendations on steps to take against  Microsoft.

The EU advisory committee's views are not binding but make chances of a settlement more remote with only nine days until a final decision by the full  European Commission.

The Commission draft backed by the experts requires that  Microsoft provide computermakers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audiovisual software, people close to the case said.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said after the meeting that the company was stillworking to find a settlement with the Commission.
But a competition expert saw a compromise as being tough.

"The Commission's already got the opinion of the member states that these are the rightremedies.
"To substitute different remedies now would be very difficult," said David Wood, a  competition
lawyer with Howrey Simon in Brussels.

BRUSSELS:

Antitrust regulators from across Europe are united behind Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, and his draft decision in the five-year-long  Microsoft antitrust case, the European Commission said Monday.

TD
Barring an eleventh-hour settlement, the commission is now cleared to rule that  Microsoft is an abusive monopolist as soon as March 24, and is expected to order the company to change the way it sells its software in Europe, people familiar with the draft ruling say.

A hearing with regulatory officials from the 15 EU countries ended around midday Monday after a brief discussion of Monti's proposal, said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission.
The member states unanimously backed the commission's draft decision, she said.

All that remains is for Monti and his senior officials to determine the size of the  fine to impose on the company. The commission can  fine a company up to a maximum of 10 percent of its global annual sales, or in Microsoft's case around $3 billion. People close to the case said the  fine could be anywhere between 100 million, or $122.2 million, and 1 billion.
The national regulators are to meet in person or by conference call Monday to discuss the proposed
fine.

Two days later, Monti and his 19 fellow European commissioners may make the final decision. That decision can be delayed if the commission determines that postponement will facilitate a settlement.

Microsoft said Monday that it was still in daily contact with the commission in the hope of settling the case. Microsoft's spokesman in Brussels, Tom Brookes, declined to comment on the unanimous support for Monti's draft decision.

The draft ruling officially remains secret, but in the past two weeks the essential elements an overall verdict against the company and the main remedies for the alleged  antitrust abuses have been widely leaked.

The commission is expected to demand that  Microsoft sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers of personal computers: one with the Media Player embedded as it is now, and the other with the Media Player stripped out.

This is to restore  competition in the audio- and video-playing software market, where companies like RealNetworks and Apple Computer suffer a disadvantage by not being present on all computers that run on Windows, according to the commission.
In addition, the commission is expected to order the company to reveal enough of the hidden code in
Windows to rivals that they can design software that works smoothly with the operating system. This
Page 155 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
second remedy is designed to restore  competition in the market for server software. Servers link personal computers into networks.

Microsoft denies that Media Player's position within Windows has prevented rivals from competing.

But competitors argue that developers of such content as film and music will increasingly ignore alternative players because they can be certain that Media Player is present on all PCs running Windows. Windows runs on more than 95 percent of PCs in the world.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission scored a preliminary victory against  Microsoft Corp. as regulators from European Union member nations backed plans to punish the software company for violating European  antitrust law.

The support clears the way for the commission, the EU's chief  antitrust authority, to impose a  fine and other sanctions against  Microsoft on March 24, more than five years after it began investigating the company's business practices. Barring a settlement, the decision would prohibit  Microsoft from forcing computer makers in Europe to use its Windows Media Player audiovisual software and force  Microsoft to give other companies more information on how its flagship Windows software works. The first
remedy probably would apply only to Europe, while the second could result in improved compatibility between Windows-based and non-Windows-based computers world-wide.

TD
Representatives from  antitrust authorities of each of the EU's 15 members "have unanimously backed the commission's draft decision," said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission. The opinion of the national authorities isn't binding but provides moral support for the commission following earlier indications that some EU authorities were unsure the commission's decision would hold up in court. The member-states' unanimous backing deprives  Microsoft of an opportunity to argue in an appeal that the commission ignored such warnings.

Microsoft said it remains committed to reaching a settlement with the commission. "Settlement discussions are continuing, and we're working with the commission toward an amicable solution to this case," said Tom Brookes, a spokesman in Brussels for the Redmond, Wash., software maker.

The commission was encouraged to push for a finding against  Microsoft by the tone of yesterday's closed-door meeting, which was expected to last all day but ended after three hours. Several member-states "insisted on the value of a decision" as opposed to a settlement and said the
commission's draft decision "could have been tougher," according to a person close to the proceedings. Late last year, some regulators privately expressed reservations about the commission's findings, but those reservations appeared to have been resolved in the commission's draft decision.

The commission has been pressuring Microsoft to work out with EU regulators and rivals some of the details of its own punishment, but Microsoft has resisted.

The panel of EU regulators will reconvene March 22 to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft. The commission is expected to make its final decision March 24.  Microsoft is expected to ask the European Court of Justice to suspend any negative decision pending an appeal, but legal experts say such an injunction isn't automatic.

European Union member nations endorsed proposed EU penalties in a draft decision finding that
Microsoft broke antitrust laws. The penalties include:

-- Letting computer makers sell PCs equipped with a version of Microsoft Windows in which Windows Media Player has been replaced by alternative software for playing digital music and videos.

-- Providing competitors and others more detailed information on Windows to stimulate competition in the market for related software products.

-- Imposing a yet-to-be-determined fine on Microsoft, expected to be in the hundreds of millions of euros.

European Union (EU)  antitrust regulators' unanimous support Monday of a landmark antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. over the sale of its Windows operating systems may mean Microsoft will be fined for hundreds of millions of euro.

TD
The draft ruling takes issue with the way the U.S. software giant sells Windows Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating systems, said the  European Commission (EC), the 15-nation EU's executive body.

"All 15 unanimously back the commission's draft decision, so a final decision will be taken next week," spokeswomen for Concurrence Amelia Torres told journalists.

The draft ruling requires  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to computer makers for installation in computers sold in Europe.

One version would include Windows Media Player as in the current system and the other would have it removed.
The draft ruling is expected to be formally adopted March 24.
The commission sets a  fine against Microsoft on March 22 and local media reported that it could be
$100 million to $1 billion.
Europe accounts for about 30% of  Microsoft's sales.

At present, people who use  Microsoft are automatically offered a Media player. The commission alleges that  Microsoft abuses its power to dominate the software market.

EC Commissioner for Concurrence Mario Monti tried in the last several months to reach an agreement with  Microsoft but the negotiations were unsuccessful.

-Koizumi aims to cut subsidies by 1 tril. yen in FY 2005
TOKYO - Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi plans to keep the scale of a cut in state subsidies in fiscal
2005 unchanged at 1 trillion yen from fiscal 2004, government sources said.

The move is designed to demonstrate the prime minister's initiative by setting a numerical target in promoting three-part fiscal and tax reforms aimed at making local governments more independent financially.
-Bush, Spain's new leader confirm antiterrorism cooperation
WASHINGTON - U.S. President George W. Bush on Monday congratulated Spain's prime
minister-elect, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and the two leaders agreed to cooperate in the fight
against terrorism, the White House said.

"Both leaders said they look forward to working together particularly on shared commitment to fighting terrorism," White House spokesman Scot McClellan told reporters.
-Antiterrorism commissioner eyed in wake of Madrid bombing

BRUSSELS - In the aftermath of Thursday's bomb attacks in Madrid which killed 200 people and wounded some 1,500 others,  European Commission (EC) President Romano Prodi on Monday suggested the creation of a commissioner of terrorism in the future.

"We have to discuss thoroughly the entire strategy and we will do it at the summit next week," Prodi said in connection with an interview he gave to the Italian newspaper La Stampa in which he made the suggestion.
- Microsoft's fine may run in hundreds of mill. euro

BRUSSELS - European Union (EU)  antitrust regulators' unanimous support Monday of a landmark antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. over the sale of its Windows operating systems may mean Microsoft will be fined for hundreds of millions of euro.

The draft ruling takes issue with the way the U.S. software giant sells Windows Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating systems, said the  European Commission (EC), the 15-nation EU's executive body.
-2 key Cambodian parties mend rift, eye to mull new gov't

PHNOM PENH - Cambodia's two main political parties, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and FUNCINPEC, agreed Monday to end the nearly eight-month deadlock and set up a task force to discuss the formation of a new government.
But an unanswered question is whether FUNCINPEC shares some of its government positions with
its alliance partner, the Sam Rainsy Party, and if the CPP accepts the Sam Rainsy Party as a partner,
lawmakers and party officials said.

HD           Microsoft sees tough sanctions in Europe. BY          By Steve Pain Deputy Business Editor.

EU member states have unanimously backed plans to impose tough sanctions on  Microsoft. The European Commission yesterday confirmed that all 15 national antitrust regulators had supported a draft ruling against Microsoft which could not only result in a huge fine but also force the US behemoth to change the way it sells its Windows software to manufacturers in Europe.

EC spokeswoman Amelia Torres said that following a closed-door session in Brussels with representatives of EU governments, the member states had 'unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision'.

TD
The draft ruling, which would a mean a  fine running into hundreds of millions of pounds, could be adopted as early as next week - barring a last-minute settlement.

A Microsoft spokesman said its legal team remained in daily contact with the Commission, trying to resolve the long-running case amicably.
But a negative decision would be the biggest setback for  Microsoft since a US judge found it guilty of
antitrust violations involving Internet browsers in 2000.

Microsoft reached a settlement with the Bush administration a year later that allowed it to keep its
Internet Explorer in Windows, but with some conditions.

Sources familiar with the EU case say the draft ruling similarly finds that  Microsoft abused its monopoly in computer operating software to gain share in markets for digital media players and low-end servers.
The EU wants to force  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its own Media
Player, giving rivals like RealNetworks a better shot at getting onto consumer desktops.

It could also demand that  Microsoft release more basic code for Windows to improve 'interoperability' with competing networking software made by Sun Microsystems and others.

Microsoft, which is trying to overcome critical flaws in Windows, says Windows Media Player is built in and removing it would damage the operating system.
RealNetworks used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be safely removed. The Commission has set March 24 for its decision, sources said.
Only once it is endorsed will EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announce one of the most important rulings of his five-year tenure. However, the Commission plans to give  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action, sources added.

The endorsement bolsters the commission's hand in dealing with  Microsoft, which is still seeking a last-minute settlement even though it pledges to carry on the fight in court.

Microsoft hopes to avert a far-reaching order that would result in a  fine of up to $3 billion (U.S.) and also force the company to change the way it sells its flagship Windows to computer-makers in Europe.

Given the size of the EU market, such an order could have global implications for  Microsoft, which argues that its practice of continually adding new features to Windows benefits consumers. Rivals complain it amounts to unfair  competition.

The backing from national governments should give EU competition commissioner Mario Monti political cover to stick to his guns in the face of heavy lobbying from Microsoft and any complaints from Washington.

The national  antitrust regulators reconvene next Monday to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft. The commission is expected to adopt the decision as early as March 24 and set out a time frame - usually a matter of months - for compliance.

The European Court of Justice could suspend the decision pending  Microsoft's promised appeal, but such an injunction is not automatic.

SEATTLE -- An advisory panel to the  European Commission, as expected Monday, unanimously approved punishing Microsoft for abusing its near monopoly of desktop PC software.

The move sets up a formal ruling, expected next week. Barring a settlement, the commission is widely expected to order Microsoft to change the way video and audio can be played on new Windows desktop PCs. It might also fine the company hundreds of millions of dollars.

TD
But whatever penalty Europe imposes might be too little too late, industry experts say, because Microsoft is well on its way to assuming a larger presence in the fast-changing market for delivering digital content to consumers. Europe's impending sanctions will do little to slow that momentum, industry experts say.

Last August, the commission presented  Microsoft with two choices: supply two versions of Windows, one with its media player included, one without, or sell Windows only with competing media players also tied in, under a so-called must-carry provision.

Microsoft now supplies PC makers the Windows operating system bundled with Windows Media Player for about $50 a copy. A version stripped of the media player might cost $45. But forced to make a choice, PC makers might well discover consumers prefer Windows as is.

"It might well turn out that the bundled version is what consumers want, and  Microsoft will have suffered no loss of business," says Ernest Gellhorn,  antitrust law professor at George Mason University.

Still,  Microsoft would have to dismantle hooks deep within Windows that launch its media player automatically, for instance, when a user wants to view a video clip. Distributing a stripped- down version of Windows would clearly hamper  Microsoft's plans to further extend bundling across all its products, says analyst Matt Rosoff of research firm Directions on  Microsoft.
By comparison, the must-carry provision allows Windows Media Player to stay bundled, though
Microsoft would be required to install rival RealNetworks' media player, and perhaps others.
"Must-carry levels the playing field without hampering  Microsoft's core strategy very much," says
Rosoff.

Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler declined comment except to say the company "hopes for an amicable resolution" in Europe.

Microsoft is pursuing alliances to embed Windows Media technology into cutting-edge services such as music downloading and TV programming that play back on PCs, TV sets or portable devices. It's even seeking to make Windows Media the format for the next generation of DVDs that can play back high-definition video movies.

"Whatever happens,  Microsoft won't be hurt that much because no one else is trying to supply a breadth of tools to develop and deliver digital media," says Michael Wolf, media analyst at In-Stat/ MDR.

HD           EU Likely to Order Microsoft to Unbundle; Putting  Media Player in Operating  System Said to

European regulators moved closer yesterday to forcing  Microsoft Corp. to offer two versions of its dominant Windows operating system -- one with media-playing software and one without -- to satisfy antitrust charges.

Although a final order will not be issued for at least a week, the 15 European Union representatives unanimously approved findings that  Microsoft broke EU competition laws. The broad contours of sanctions proposed by its  antitrust enforcers also were approved, although details are still being finalized.

TD
The vote is a blow to  Microsoft, whose representatives have been actively lobbying EU members for months, hoping to avert a ruling that would force the company to change the architecture of its operating system. The sanctions, likely to include  fines, would be the harshest imposed on the software giant, which has been fighting legal battles for several years on both sides of the Atlantic.

The company has argued that the media player is so tightly integrated into Windows that removing it would be impossible without degrading the operating system. Moreover, it has vowed to appeal any judgment that impinges on its right to design its software as it sees fit.

But the competition bureau of the  European Commission, the EU's administrative arm, determined last year that Microsoft's decision to bundle its Windows Media Player into the ubiquitous operating system stifled competition from rivals.

The company has long pursued a strategy of incorporating new applications into its operating system, despite antitrust concerns.

According to sources involved in the case,  Microsoft would be required to give computer manufacturers a choice of a version of Windows with its media player, or one without. Computer makers would be free to strike deals with other media-player makers, such as RealNetworks Inc. and Apple Computer Corp., which could provide an incentive to use the version of Windows without Microsoft's player.

The requirement apparently would not apply to operating-system software sold in stores, the sources said.

The vote yesterday "was the last chance [for  Microsoft] to derail the case" brought by European antitrust chief Mario Monti, said Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based attorney for the Computer & Communications Industry Association. The Washington trade group has pushed antitrust authorities on three continents for a crackdown on what it considers unlawful monopoly conduct by Microsoft.

The company could still settle, as it did in late 2001 with the U.S. Department of Justice on similar charges. Company spokesman Jim Desler said  Microsoft continues to try to reach an amicable settlement with Monti's team.

The company also faces a  fine by the EU that could total $3 billion, although people familiar with the case predict the figure will be considerably lower. And it is likely to be required to make more of its software code available to rival vendors of server systems -- which power networks of computers -- to ensure that their software will operate properly with Windows.

Sources said that the unbundling requirement would apply only to Windows sold in Europe, creating different regulations from those in the United States. And they said  Microsoft would not be required to offer the version of Windows without the media player at a lower price.
This might lessen the incentive for computer makers to use that version, some analysts said.

"If there's no price difference, I find it hard to see why anyone would go for the version that didn't include the media player," said David Smith, a senior analyst at the market research firm Gartner Inc. The sanctions "will cause [Microsoft] some headaches, but it's not going to be a big deal."

The problem for EU regulators, sources said, was that since basic versions of rival media players are offered for free, it was impossible to assign a value to the Windows Media Player that could then be subtracted from the cost of the operating system.

Smith added that he has long been skeptical of  Microsoft's claims that it cannot remove the media player from the rest of the operating systems.
Investors displayed little concern yesterday, with the stock off 22 cents a share, or 0.87 percent, to
$25.16, on a day when the major U.S. stock indexes were hit hard.
Jeffrey M. Shohet, a San Diego  antitrust attorney, said it is questionable whether this ruling will deter
Microsoft from its bundling strategy.

"This is a major battleground for  Microsoft, and they won't give it up easily," he said. "They see it as very strategic and critical for the dominance of their operating system."

But Edward Black, who heads the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said the EU is sending a signal that bundling is "highly presumptive to be illegal," and the company would be in future legal jeopardy if it pursues the strategy.

In some respects, the unbundling requirement mirrors those sought by the attorneys general of several U.S. states, who considered the settlement with the Justice Department to be insufficient.

The states wanted  Microsoft to be compelled to create a modular version of Windows that would allow several programs, including the media player and the Internet Explorer Web browser, to be removable.

This was the only way, the states argued, that  Microsoft would be constrained in its ability to monopolize the computing world by bundling an ongoing array of new programs into Windows, used in roughly 95 percent of all personal computers.

The Justice Department settlement requires only that  Microsoft allow computer makers to hide access to certain programs, but not remove them.

Last summer, a federal judge approved the federal deal and turned aside the states' push for stiffer sanctions. One state, Massachusetts, has appealed that ruling to federal court, and a ruling is pending.

EU members are scheduled to meet again next Monday to finalize sanctions, and Monti has announced he wants to issue a final ruling by March 24.

HD     EU members back Microsoft draft ruling: 15 countries support tough anti-trust stance. Software behemoth  still seeks settlement to avoid order that would include  fine of $15 billion U.S.

BRUSSELS

The European Union's anti-trust chief won critical backing yesterday for a potentially landmark ruling against Microsoft Corp. that sources say finds the U.S. software giant has abused its Windows monopoly.

TD
It also demands changes in the way the company operates, the sources said.

A closed-door session with representatives of the 15 EU governments - which had been expected to run all day due to the case's complexity - ended shortly after noon instead,  European Commission spokesperson Amelia Torres said.

"The member states have unanimously backed the commission's draft decision," she told reporters without elaborating. Sources familiar with the case said there were "no problems" raised and the draft is tentatively set to be adopted next week.

The endorsement bolsters the commission's hand in dealing with  Microsoft, which is still seeking a last-minute settlement even as it pledges to carry on the fight in court.

Microsoft hopes to avert a far-reaching order that would result in a  fine of up to $3 billion U.S. and also force the company to change the way it sells its flagship Windows operating system to computer-makers in Europe.

Given the size of the EU market, such an order could have global implications for  Microsoft, which argues that its practice of continually adding new features to Windows benefits consumers. Rivals complain it amounts to unfair  competition.

A negative decision would be the biggest setback for Microsoft since a U.S. judge found it guilty of anti-trust violations involving Internet browsers in 2000. Microsoft reached a settlement with the Bush administration a year later, allowing it to keep its Internet Explorer in Windows with some conditions.

Sources said the EU's draft ruling also finds  Microsoft abused its monopoly in computer-operating software to gain share in markets for digital media players and low-end servers. But the remedies sought go beyond the U.S. deal.

The EU wants  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its Media Player to give rivals like RealNetworks Inc. a better shot at getting onto consumer desktops.

It also would demand that  Microsoft make public more basic Windows code to improve "inter-operability" with competing networking software made by Sun Microsystems and others.

The backing from national governments should give EU competition commissioner Mario Monti political cover to stick to his guns in the face of heavy lobbying from Microsoft and any complaints from Washington.

"I'm sure they want a visible record of endorsement as they go forward," said Chris Bright, an anti-trust lawyer with Sherman & Sterling in London.

The national anti-trust regulators reconvene next Monday to consider the size of the  fine against Microsoft. The Commission is expected to adopt the decision as early as March 24 and set out a time frame - usually a matter of months - for compliance.

Also yesterday,  Microsoft, which has settled consumer anti-trust litigation in 10 American states for $1.55 billion U.S., went to trial for the first time in a suit involving customer allegations of anti-competitive behavior.

Consumers in Minnesota are seeking as much as $425 million, almost one-third of the amount  Microsoft has paid to settle the claims in other states. The  Microsoft customers in Minnesota allege they paid higher prices than they should have as a result of the monopoly the firm has on its Windows system.

Microsoft plans to have chairperson Bill Gates and CEO Steven Ballmer testify at the trial in Minneapolis.

HD        Antitrust Tide Turns Against  Microsoft

United States, 2004 Mar 16 (NB). The reviews are in on the latest developments in the never-ending
antitrust saga, and the 's decision to go for tough penalties doesn't look good for Gates and Co.

"The fact that the EU has stood up to  Microsoft and is seeking a fairly strong remedy and possibly heavy fines will have an indeterminate but significant impact on future  antitrust proceedings in the U.S.," , a professor at in Los Angeles, told The Seattle Times.

TD
"It's unlikely  Microsoft is going to get out of it now,"  antitrust lawyer of 's London office told The Los
Angeles Times.

The EU member nations' unanimous backing of a get-tough approach to  Microsoft sets the stage for a potentially massive  fine. "All that remains is for [], the European Union's commissioner for  competition, and his senior officials to determine the size of the  fine to impose on the company. The commission can fine a company as much as 10 percent of its global annual sales, in  Microsoft's case around $3 billion. People close to the case said the  fine might range from 100 million euros to a billion euros -- $123 million to $1.23 billion at current exchange rates," The New York Times reported. The Los Angeles Times said "penalties, likely to include substantial  fines, would be the harshest so far faced by  Microsoft, which has defended its business practices for years against  antitrust litigation brought by competitors, customers and governments."

The Washington Post noted the EU decision to approve a draft set of penalties "is a blow to  Microsoft, whose representatives have been actively lobbying EU members for months, hoping to avert a ruling that would force the company to change the architecture of its operating system. The sanctions, likely to include fines, would be the harshest imposed on the software giant, which has been fighting legal battles for several years on both sides of the Atlantic."

More from The New York Times on what the EU has in the cards: European regulators are "also expected to order the company to disclose enough Windows code to rivals so they can design software that works smoothly with Windows. That provision is intended to restore  competition in the market for server software. Servers link personal computers into networks. The provision concerning Media Player is considered the harder of the two to settle because it questions an essential part of  Microsoft's business model that has allowed it to develop highly successful programs like the word-processing package Word and the Outlook e-mail program." According to The Wall Street Journal, "The first remedy probably would apply only to Europe, while the second could result in improved compatibility between Windows-based and non-Windows-based computers world-wide."

The San Jose Mercury News reported that "[i]f the draft decision is adopted next week, the  European     Commission could do something no other government has done so far: limit  Microsoft's ability to
bundle new technologies with its ubiquitous Windows operating system. Tying key technologies to Windows, such as the Web browser and media-player software, to Windows has been a fundamental business strategy for  Microsoft. Limiting that ability could undermine  Microsoft's chances of dominating nascent markets in the future."

But don't expect  Microsoft to change its ways. San Diego-based  antitrust attorney "said it is questionable whether this ruling will deter  Microsoft from its bundling strategy," The Washington Post


Page 178 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
reported. "This is a major battleground for  Microsoft, and they won't give it up easily," Shohet said. "They see it as very strategic and critical for the dominance of their operating system."

Nonetheless, it likely that  Microsoft rivals would gain if the EU forces  Microsoft to unbundle its media software. "It will immediately restore some  competition and encourage makers of media players and other software that works with Windows to go out and develop products," law professor told The San Jose Mercury News. "Software developers are inhibited from investing time and energy to create such products because of fear that Windows will absorb them and destroy them," he said.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is dealing with yet another lawsuit alleging that the company is overcharging for its products.

"The Minnesota plaintiffs are seeking $425 million. It is the first case of its kind to reach a trial against Microsoft. The company has spent more than $1 billion to settle similar claims by consumers in California and other states," The Los Angeles Times reported. The St. Paul Pioneer Press said "Monday was the first time such charges were leveled in a state court on behalf of consumers. Attorneys for seven Minnesota plaintiffs began a day-long process of unveiling what they said were never-before-seen documents, many from past and present Microsoft officers, including company chairman , that showed how the company viewed its competition."

The Associated Press also noted the case is the "first class-action,  antitrust trial in a state court opened against the software giant. The case, being heard by a jury in Hennepin County District Court, involves alleged overcharging for Windows and the company's Word and Excel programs. The outcome could affect nearly 1 million individuals and businesses. The plaintiffs are seeking damages between $283 million and $425 million for alleged overcharges on about 9.7 million  Microsoft software licenses issued in Minnesota from 1994 to 2001."

The Minneapolis Star Tribune explained that the "plaintiffs claim  Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior reduced competition and allowed it to charge higher prices than it otherwise could. In an interview, a Microsoft attorney called the company's dealings with other companies irrelevant to the plaintiffs' claims that it overcharged consumers."

It's no secret that  Microsoft sees open-source software like as a major threat to its business, so it's interesting to see how a program launched to counter Linux appears to be paying off for Redmond. The company's "shared source" initiative, lets "industry partners, corporate customers and researchers peek at and sometimes tweak the code in the company's software," crossed the 1 million subscriber mark yesterday, The New York Times reported in an article published on The International Herald Tribune Web site. "On Monday,  Microsoft was due to announce that its shared-source initiative had one million
licensed participants, from lone software developers to large corporations. The milestone, said , manager of the shared-source initiative at  Microsoft, shows that the company has responded to the demands of
its customers."

Reuters reported that the bulk of the "shared source participants have had relatively unrestricted access to , Microsoft's software for devices such as cell phones and handheld computers. Access to the Windows operating system for personal computers and servers, which drives the bulk of sales at Microsoft, is more restricted."
hasn't been on  Microsoft's best-friend list lately, and don't expect the two companies to be too
buddy-buddy down the road. HP may sell Linux-based personal computers in Asia, Reuters and Dow
Jones Newswires reported. Reuters called the plan "a potential blow to dominant operating system
provider Microsoft Corp. A launch would make California-based HP, which currently sells  Microsoft's
Windows-based personal computers, the first major PC maker to offer PCs that run on the competing
Linux operating system, a spokesman for HP's Japanese unit said."

Dow Jones Newswires said "HP's move may prompt other PC makers to follow suit. As Linux is an open-source operating system, prices of Linux PCs are expected to be lower than those of Windows PCs. That would further fuel already-intense price  competition in the global PC market."

Two ex-Microsoft executives have formed a video-game company called . and , who hailed from Microsoft's graphics group, "expect to unveil their first-person role-playing game, called 'Grafan,' at the E3 game convention in Los Angeles in May," The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported, noting the game is targeted for  Microsoft-based PCs. Go figure.

In yet another display of the clout the recording industry has with lawmakers and law enforcement, the attorneys general of a number of states are considering whether to go after makers of file-sharing software as part of the larger effort to thwart illegal fileswapping, The Los Angeles Times reported. The report is based on a letter allegedly written by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the text of which says: "Over the coming months, we will begin focusing more attention on the risks P2P software
Page 179 of 188 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
programs pose to consumers in our states. "The letter, which was disseminated by a trade group that represents file-sharing software firms such as and , warns that the states' top law enforcement officers have set their cross hairs on the purveyors of peer-to-peer programs. Outlined in the letter are concerns that the software companies have not done enough to curtail the unauthorized distribution of movies, music, software, video games and pornography."

CNET's News.com said "Lockyer spokesman did not directly confirm or deny the authorship of the document, which was apparently leaked to file-swapping companies last week. Lockyer and other state attorneys general are gathering in Washington, D.C., this week for their spring meeting. But Dresslar acknowledged that his boss is investigating peer-to-peer networks."

So who's behind the letter? , senior vice president for state legislative affairs at the , according to the New York Times. "Mr. Stevenson acknowledged that he had worked on the letter, but called it 'a work in progress' and said that his association was simply doing what such groups do: raising their concerns with lawmakers and trying to work with them," the newspaper said. The MPAA, of course, is a close ally of the RIAA on Internet piracy matters.
As officials work to crack down on illegal file-swapping, more companies are getting involved in the
pay-for-play legal downloading craze. now has plans to offer its customers a service to burn CDs in its
stores. Just like its coffee, the service won't be cheap. "Patrons will be able to walk up to a counter and
use a flat, touch-screen computer display to browse through a collection of about 150,000 tracks. They
will be charged $6.99 for the first five songs and $1 for every individual track after that. Included in the
price: a labeled CD and jewel case. By comparison, popular online digital music services like , or the
offer between 300,000 and a half-million tracks, which sell for 99 cents each or $10 for a full album," The
Associated Press reported.

Speaking if iTunes, said yesterday it had sold more than 50 million songs through the service. "In the online music marketplace, iTunes store's closest competitor, Napster, has sold only about 5 million downloads -- though that does not include Napster's streaming music subscription service. And Apple's
50 million-song tally does not include songs and Apple are giving away in their promotion together. Customers are now downloading at a rate of 2.5 million songs a week, or about 130 million a year," The San Jose Mercury News said.

BRUSSELS, March 15 -- European  antitrust regulators are united behind Mario Monti, their top antitrust official, on his proposed finding that Microsoft has abused its dominant position in the software market, the European Commission said Monday.

Barring an 11th-hour settlement, the commission, the year-round administrative arm of the European Union, will rule as soon as March 24 that  Microsoft is an abusive monopolist and will order the company to change the way it sells its software in its 15 member nations.

TD
A meeting of national regulators broke up around midday on Monday after a brief discussion of the ruling, a commission spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said. ''The member states unanimously backed the commission's draft decision,'' she said.

All that remains is for Mr. Monti, the European Union's commissioner for  competition, and his senior officials to determine the size of the  fine to impose on the company. The commission can  fine a company as much as 10 percent of its global annual sales, in  Microsoft's case around $3 billion. People close to the case said the  fine might range from 100 million euros to a billion euros -- $123 million to $1.23 billion at current exchange rates.

The national regulators are expected to meet or conduct a conference call next Monday to discuss the proposed fine. Two days later, Mr. Monti and the 19 other European commissioners may make a final decision. This can be delayed if the commission thinks that a settlement is within reach.

Microsoft said it was in daily contact with regulators in the hope of settling the case. Its spokesman in Brussels, Tom Brookes, declined to comment on Monday's unanimous show of hands in favor of Mr. Monti's proposed ruling.

The essential elements of the proposal, though officially secret, have been widely leaked in the last two weeks. The commission is expected to demand that  Microsoft sell two versions of its Windows operating system to personal computer makers, one with the Media Player function embedded as it is now and the other with Media Player stripped out.

It is also expected to order the company to disclose enough Windows code to rivals so they can design software that works smoothly with Windows. That provision is intended to restore  competition in the market for server software. Servers link personal computers into networks.

The provision concerning Media Player is considered the harder of the two to settle because it questions an essential part of  Microsoft's business model that has allowed it to develop highly successful programs like the word-processing package Word and the Outlook e-mail program.

The company argues that Media Player cannot be stripped from Windows because the operating system would not work properly without it.

Competition lawyers in Brussels speculate that  Microsoft may agree to settle only the part of the case that concerns interoperability, while choosing to appeal a ruling against the bundling of Media Player to the European courts.

BRUSSELS -- European Union member governments Monday unanimously endorsed plans to require Microsoft to sell two different versions of its Windows operating system in Europe, one of which would be without the software that plays music and videos.

At a meeting in Brussels, EU national representatives gave their full backing to compel the software giant to provide both versions of Windows for the European market.

The plans have been devised by the European Commission--the EU's executive body--which is completing its five-year investigation into Microsoft's alleged illegal bundling of the Windows Media Player software into its Windows operating system. "The member states have unanimously backed the commission's draft decision," a commission spokeswoman said.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti is due March 24 to formally announce the EC's 2demands, but commission insiders said the decision could be taken in principle Wednesday. A separate meeting of EU competition advisers is due to meet Monday to decide on a  fine, which officials say could be as much as 200 [euro] million ($245.4 million).

The commission decision sides with  Microsoft's rivals, who said the bundling of Media Player onto Windows meant that consumers, record companies and movie studies ignored other music and video software providers such as Real-Networks' RealOne Player and Apple's QuickTime.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said in a statement that the company still hoped to reach a deal before Monti's decision. "Microsoft continues to work actively with the  European Commission toward an amicable settlement of this case," he said.

Microsoft has suggested that a deal might be in the commission's interest as it would limit the likelihood of a lengthy and possibly embarrassing appeals process in the EU courts. But the commission said it is confident that the court would not suspend any decision while the appeal takes place, thus forcing Microsoft to comply immediately.

HD    EC moves closer to landmark  ruling  on Microsoft. BY     GARETH MACKIE Business Editor.

THE European Commission has moved closer to a landmark decision against Micro-soft after member states backed its plan to force the software giant to change the way it sells audio-visual software as part of Windows.  Microsoft also faces the prospect of a  fine, expected to run into hundreds of millions of
pounds, as part of the Commission's sanctions against the company. A  Microsoft spokesman in Brussels said the company's legal team remained in daily contact with the Commission, trying to resolve the
long-running case amicably. The firm, chaired by Bill Gates, is seeking to avert an order that would not only result in a fine of up to GBP 1.7 billion but also force the company to change the way it sells its Windows to computer makers.

TD
Amelia Torres, the Commission's  competition spokeswoman, said: "The meeting is over and the member states have unanimously backed the Commission's draft decision." She was referring to a meeting of competition experts from the 15 EU states, which approved the Commission's draft decision to require Microsoft to share proprietary information with rival server makers. Sources said the draft also requires
the United States company to provide computer manufacturers with a second version of Windows stripped of built-in audio-visual software. As the clock ticks towards a final Commission decision on March 24, the Microsoft spokesman said settlement was still a possibility. "We continue to work actively with the Commission towards a settlement," he said after the EU panel meeting. But David Wood, a  competition lawyer with Howrey Simon in Brussels, said a compromise deal could be tough to secure. He said: "The Commission's already got the opinion of the member states that these are the right remedies. To
substitute different remedies now would be very difficult." EU advisory committee members will meet again on March 22 to decide whether to endorse the proposed  fine, with the Commission's final ruling coming
two days later. The draft favoured by the 15 member states gives  Microsoft a deadline to get its house in order or face additional action, sources said.  Microsoft acknowledges that Windows, which runs on nearly all personal computers, dominates the market. The draft decision requires  Microsoft to ship two versions of Windows to computer makers, which account for most sales of the operating system, for installation in computers sold in Europe. One version would have  Microsoft Windows Media Player tied in as it is now, while the other would have it stripped out. The aim is to enable computer makers to sell Windows bundled with rival audio-visual software such as RealNetworks RealPlayer or Apple Quicktime, sources said. Microsoft has argued that Windows Media Player is built in and removing it would damage the operating system. RealNetworks has used demonstrations at an EU hearing to argue it can be removed. The draft also says Microsoft has given rival makers of low-level servers too little information to compete. The draft decision says the firm must share more of its protocols with rivals, charging a reasonable royalty.
