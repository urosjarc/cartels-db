BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Community on Wednesday fined three chemical concerns a total $66.2 million for running a cartel in the Western European market for soda ash.

The action includes the largest EC anti-trust fine ever imposed - $41.4 million against Solvay, Belgium's largest chemical company. Solvay called the fine "utterly unreasonable" and said it would appeal.

TD
The EC Commission also fined Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC $23.5 million and
Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH, a unit of BASF AG of Germany, $1.38 million.

The commission said the companies had an agreement by which ICI would not sell soda ash on the continent if Solvay and Chemische Fabrik Kalk stayed out of Britain.

The commission said Solvay and ICI had fixed the market so that companies looking for secondary sources of soda ash ended up buying from the cartel anyway.

Soda ash is used in the chemical industry as a neutralizing agent. It also accounts for up to 60 percent of the raw material costs of glass making.

It is so widely used the commission said the cartel's effect "is ultimately felt by millions of consumers."

The fine is the second blow to Solvay in the three months. In October, the EC withdrew all anti-dumping duties on soda ash imports from the  American Natural Soda Ash Corp.

Analysts say the end of the duties may hit Solvay's earnings severely. Soda ash and its derivatives represent 10 percent of Solvay's total sales.

ICI and Solvay of Belgium have been fined more than #33 million between them by the  European        Commission for breaking competition rules.

TD
The two companies were given the biggest penalties ever handed out by the EC after being found guilty of rigging the market for soda ash, the key ingredient of glass, in a cartel that Brussels described as "abusive behaviour ultimately felt by millions of consumers".
ICI was fined #12.07 million and Solvay #21 million, almost three times more than any previous EC
fine.

ICI said it was "shocked" by the decision, insisted it was innocent and said it would appeal. The commission had no evidence of a cartel and had "failed to understand" the economics involved, according to ICI.

"Not only have the commission, on their own admission, no direct evidence of any express agreement between Solvay and ICI to continue to operate a cartel in practice, but also they have ignored the positive documentary evidence in ICI's favour which makes clear that ICI has operated quite independently of Solvay and the other CWE (Continental Western Europe) soda ash producers," ICI said.

The severity of the fines shows a growing frustration at the way ICI and Solvay have not been deterred by softer penalties. Together they have been fined eight times in the past five years for breaking EC competition rules.

"The level of the fines reflects the seriousness of the case and the determination of the commission to ensure that industrial companies do not continue to flout the competition rules in a way which undermines the creation of a single market," the 17 EC commissioners said in a statement after taking the decision yesterday.

Soda ash accounts for up to 60 per cent of the raw material costs of glass making; the commission thus maintained that the cartel had considerable side-effects on the motor and construction industries.

After several dawn raids on their premises in March 1989, the two biggest firms in the European soda ash market were accused of continuing a deal, dating back 130 years, whereby they have kept off each other's territory, dividing the market to ensure they were never in direct competition.

Solvay stayed out of the United Kingdom and Ireland, where ICI holds 92 per cent; ICI left Solvay to maintain its 70 per cent grip over much of western Europe.

The commission accused them of meeting regularly to fix the market, despite the formal renunciation of their cartel when Britain joined the Community in 1973.

The German company, Chemische Fabrik Kalk, was fined #710,000 while three others Rhone-Poulenc of France, Akzo of The Netherlands and Matthes und Weber of Germany have been let off the hook. But the most serious infringement by ICI and Solvay of competition rules, says the EC, was a
"top-slice" rebate used to maintain customer loyalty.

ICI and Solvay would give discounts of up to 50 per cent on one-fifth of a customer's purchases if he agreed to buy the remaining bulk of his soda ash needs from them. EC officials said this kept soda ash prices above market value. In some cases Solvay had paid clients to buy the extra 20-odd per cent, officials alleged.

In addition, the commission has blocked an attempt by six American soda producers to use their existing export cartel,  ANSAC, to break into the European market.

Brussels refused to waive the EC's competition rules for  ANSAC, despite the Americans' claims that they could never counter the weight of ICI and Solvay unless they were allowed to act jointly. The overall idea was "to liberalise the entire market in one go", rather than allow a battle between European and American groups, one Brussels official said.

Yesterday's decision followed pressure from Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, amid lobbying by the chemicals industry.

Commission refuses to exempt an American cartel of soda ash from the ban on understandings.
BRUSSELS, 20/12/1990 (AGENCE EUROPE) - As EUROPE published in yesterday's bulletin, page 13,
the European Commission has imposed fines which are without precedence upon Solvay (30 Mecus) and
ICI (17 Mecus) for infringement of the Community competition rules. Details of these infringements, which
were noted during surprise checks in March 1989 on a series of producers are as follows:

TD
Non-competition arrangement between Solvay and ICI which have shared the soda ash market. Solvay remains outside the British and Irish market and ICI outside the continental market.

The Commission recalls that the soda ash market has been historically dominated by cartels. In the 30's, it was divided between Solvay, ICI, IG Farben and American producers and in 1945 Solvay and ICI had confirmed their non-competition policy in an ultra-secret document called "Page 1000" (that the Commission surveyors discovered in Norwich, in the ICI Soda Ash Products factory). Although after the United Kingdom's entry into the Community, this agreement was formally abandoned, the Commission notes that in fact two producers have continued to operate in the same way, that is, never as competitors. They must now pay this infringement by fines totalling 7 Mecus each.

The setting up of a two-tier price system, in which consumers paid the market price for most of their soda ash purchases, and reduced and secret prices for the remainder of their needs. Thus, Solvay and ICI have discouraged buyers (who normally go to another supplier than their main supplier for additional requirements in order to counteract the domination of the latter) from buying soda ash elsewhere than from them. The second price offered by the two firms was virtually half the official price. For this infringement of Article 86, Solvay is to pay 20 Mecus, and ICI 10.

The Solvay-Chemische Fabrik Kalk agreement through which the two firms share the German market. Here, Solvay is to pay a fine of 3 Mecus, and GFK one million.

Also, the European Commission has decided to refuse an exemption under Article 85(3) for the export cartel "American  Natural Soda Ash Corporation" (ANSAC). The six American producers affirm that only by combining their effort did they have a chance to sell in Europe but the Commission does not see why, further to its decision concerning Solvay and ICI, these producers which are all of considerable size could not henceforth enter into the European market independently.
Solvay announces appeal to the Court of Justice, ICI disputes the sentence

Solvay has released a communique to express its astonishment at the fact that the Commission did not at all take into account the "serious" arguments put forward by the defence, and to announce its decision to make appeal before the Court of Justice. The level of the fine is considered by the company as "most unreasonable". The reason for which Solvay has not sought to conquer the British market for soda ash lies in the prohibitive cost of transport.

ICI for his part affirms that there was no agreement between companies and that the Commission decision is founded on unfounded presumptions. Furthermore, there has been no complaint filed with the Commission.
