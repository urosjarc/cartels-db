BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission is likely to fine companies it believes are involved in a bathroom fixtures cartel towards the end of June, people familiar with the case said.

Grohe in Germany, Dutch company Sphinx BV Koninklijke and American Standard are some of the companies involved in the decision, according to one person familiar with the case. Overall, some 15 participants from western Europe are likely to be implicated in the  cartel, another person said.

TD
The Commission sent formal cartel charges to the companies in 2007, accusing them of allegedly fixing prices for bathroom fixtures. The products included ceramic sanitary ware, taps and  fittings, and shower enclosures.

Before making a final decision, the Commission needs to have two advisory meetings with national competition authorities to agree on which companies participated in the  cartel, and then to decide on the level of  fines that will be levied on the companies. According to people familiar with the case, the first meeting took place Tuesday. Once the two meetings are completed, a decision on  fines usually follows within days.

The European economic crisis has delayed the decision making, as the Commission has struggled to find an appropriate level of  fines. It must balance its wish to impose stiff penalties, but without driving the companies out of business. Meanwhile, many of the companies have fallen back on a seldom-used legal argument, claiming "inability to pay," meaning they cannot afford the usual high  fines without serious damage to their businesses.

Usually if a company is found guilty of an antitrust offense, it can be  fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue. In this case, however, the  fines are likely to be much lower, people familiar with the case said.

HD       EU to cut antitrust fines in upcoming cartel cases

* The number of companies who can't pay  fines rising
* EC does not want to push companies into bankruptcy

TD
BRUSSELS, June 16 (Reuters) - EU regulators are set to reduce  fines in several upcoming antitrust cases after a spate of financially-strapped companies said they could not pay their penalties due to the credit crisis.

The number of companies saying they were unable to pay and seeking lower  fines has risen significantly in recent years, European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia and Budget Commissioner
Janusz Lewandowski wrote in a note dated June 12.

While EU regulators did not provide detailed numbers, antitrust lawyers said about 20 applicants could be currently looking to lower their  fines.

The EU note said the  European Commission had no desire to impose  fines that would push competitive companies, especially small to medium-sized or one-product firms, into bankruptcy.

"Fines of applicants meeting the inability to pay conditions will, as a matter of principle, be reduced in upcoming cases to a level that the company will be considered to be able to pay at the time of the decision without seriously jeopardising its economic viability," the note said. Almunia is currently considering several cartel cases, one involving 19 companies in the  bathroom fittings industry and another affecting 22 companies in the airline sector, where several of the companies have cited a liquidity squeeze due to the crisis or where hefty  fines would drive them out of business, antitrust lawyers said.

While there is no legal requirement for the Commission to consider a company's financial situation when setting  fines, a provision in the fining guidelines allows companies to resort to this plea under strict conditions.

The note said the antitrust chief would take a broader interpretation of the fining rules and economic context for pending cases, including making companies aware of this option in the Commission's statement of objections or charge sheet. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Sharon Lindores)

* Geberit, Roca also named in EU charge sheet
* Lower fines for some cash-strapped firms due to crisis (Adds European Commission no comment, background) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Reuters) - EU regulators will  fine what they allege to be a  price-fixing cartel in the bathroom fittings industry next week, with lower penalties for some crisis-hit firms, six people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The companies charged with anti-competitive behaviour include American Standard, Finland's Sanitec, German companies Villeroy Boch , Grohe, Hansgrohe, Duravit and Geberit, and Spain's Roca, the people said.

Some of the manufacturers will receive lower  fines after pleading financial difficulties due to the credit crisis, the people said.
"A decision (to  fine the companies) will come next Wednesday," one person said.
The European Commission declined to comment. The 27-country European Union's antitrust
watchdog, which can fine firms up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaching EU rules, has levied more
than 10 billion euros ($12.4 billion) in  fines since 2004.

Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a note last week that regulators would reduce penalties for companies unable to pay due to the credit crisis rather than push small to medium-sized or one-product companies into bankruptcy.
The Commission had listed 26 manufacturers in a charge sheet that it sent to the companies in March
2007, another person said.

The charges followed raids on manufacturers and importers of  bathroom fittings in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in November 2004.
Some of the companies charged make ceramics, others taps and some shower screens. (Editing by

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of auto-parts and braking-systems manufacturer Wabco
Holdings Inc. (WBC) climbed Friday as a resolution grew near for the three years of uncertainty tied
to a potential  fine from the European Commission.

The European Union's regulatory body has been expected to levy its  fines against a cartel of bathroom-fixture manufacturers by the end of June, and according to some press reports, as soon as next week. Wabco's former parent, the now defunct American Standard Cos., is one of the
dozen or more companies that was charged in March 2007 for alleged price fixing on bathroom  
fixtures.

TD
When Wabco was spun off from American Standard in July 2007, it agreed to be responsible for any of the  fines against American Standard and its Bath and Kitchen company. In its annual federal filings, Wabco has listed the  fine as a risk factor and said it may not be able to pay "any significant  fine imposed."

Despite concerns over the size of the  fine, analysts said investors are relieved the situation appears to be nearing a close.

Shares of Wabco, which manufacturers control and braking systems for trucks and other automobiles, were up 7.1% to $34.93 in recent trading on heavier than average volume.
A representative for the company wasn't immediately available Friday.

Sterne Agee analyst Ben Elias wrote in a note last month that any  fine or resolution would be a net positive for Wabco, saying the  fine could be based on a variety of factors including Wabco's own health.

Usually if a company is found guilty of an antitrust offense, it can be  fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide revenue. In this case, however, the  fines are likely to be much lower, people familiar with the case told Dow Jones Newswires last month.
"We no longer believe that the EC is intent on fining the companies as much as possible," Elias
said. "[Wabco] will benefit from...the resolution on the Bath and Kitchen  price-fixing fine, which will
remove the ever-present overhang that clouds normal operations."

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Tuesday said it has sent formal antitrust charges to nine European companies, on suspicion they have participated in a window mounting cartel.

Window mountings are mechanical parts that allow the opening and closing of a window and attach it to its frame.

TD
The commission is concerned that the nine companies may have artificially increased the sales prices for these  fixtures in Europe.

The most commonly used type of mountings in Europe is the tilt and turn mechanism, allowing a full or partial opening of the window in different positions with one handle.

If found guilty, the commission can  fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover. Usually the severity of the  fine depends on the length of the  cartel, and the level of cooperation from the companies.

Financially stressed companies which are unable to pay  cartel or other antitrust  fines will be given reduced penalties in order to limit bankruptcies, Joaquin Almunia, the EU's new top competition watchdog, told EU lawmakers on Tuesday.

"I am not here to deliberately put companies out of business," Mr Almunia told the economic and monetary committee in the European Parliament. But the commissioner said he believed such cases would "remain exceptional".

TD
The comments follow months of pressure on the  European Commission. Lawyers for companies accused of antitrust abuses have argued that in the difficult economic climate Brussels should soften its increasingly tough approach to  fines.

They also come as EU competition officials prepare to hand down  fines, possibly running to hundreds of millions of euros, to companies active in the  bathroom fittings industry on Wednesday.

Here, an alleged  cartel has been under investigation since 2004, when commission officials raided manufacturers and importers in five countries - Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.

Formal charges were issued three years later - with France also added as an affected country - and the products involved were said to be taps and  fittings, ceramic sanitaryware and shower enclosures.

Several dozen companies were believed to be involved in the probe, including well-known names such as American Standard and Grohe, and much smaller manufacturers.

But the pressure on commission officials to reduce  fines has become particularly intense in this industry because of its now-straitened circumstances.

The commission does have some provisions to deal with "inability to pay," but in the past had generally interpreted these very strictly and been unwilling to give parties involved in illegal conduct any significant leeway. In addition, commission officials have pointed out,  fines are capped at a maximum of 10 per
cent of a company's annual turnover.

But Mr Almunia has been reconsidering the commission's overall approach in recent weeks. Competition officials have also already modified the way in which they assess a company's financial situation - putting more weight on solvency and liquidity than on capitalisation and profitability, for example - according a leaked information note, written earlier this month.

For this reason - and in light of the commissioner's comments to the parliamentary committee on Tuesday - the announcement in the  bathroom fittings cartel, due to be made on Wednesday, will be closely-scruntinised as participants in other alleged cartels seek to understand Brussels' policy on "inability to pay".

Separately, EU officials said on Tuesday that formal charges had been sent to participants in another alleged cartel - this time, involving mountings for windows and window-doors. The commission said it believed nine European producers may have colluded in increasing prices for these products in Europe.

It stressed, as usual, that the sending of formal charges did not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. Companies alleged to have been involved can request an oral hearing if they wish.

HD              EU Sends Cartel Charges To 9 Window Mounting Companies

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission Tuesday said it has sent formal antitrust charges to nine European companies, on suspicion they have participated in a window mounting cartel.

Window mountings are mechanical parts that allow the opening and closing of a window and attach it to its frame.

TD
The commission is concerned that the nine companies may have artificially increased the sales prices for these  fixtures in Europe.

The most commonly used type of mountings in Europe is the tilt and turn mechanism, allowing a full or partial opening of the window in different positions with one handle.

If found guilty, the commission can  fine the companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover. Usually the severity of the  fine depends on the length of the  cartel, and the level of cooperation from the companies.

Don't rush on austerity: Carney

TD
TORONTO - Governments around the world must not rush to tighten their belts at the same time and need to strike the right balance between austerity and ensuring growth, Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday.

In an interview with Reuters Insider, Carney aligned himself with Washington in cautioning that the global recovery is too fragile right now for fiscal deficits to be tackled immediately.

``They don't need to rush too quickly,'' Carney said ahead of a summit this weekend of Group of 20 countries where leaders are due to discuss the best way forward for the world economy.

``It's a question of getting the balance right. Nobody should be looking to balance their budget next year. The economy is too weak,'' he said.
Congressmen seek to delay pipeline approval
WASHINGTON - A group of U.S. representatives have asked the Secretary of State not to approve a
TransCanada Corp. oilsands pipeline until the fuel's effect on greenhouse gas emissions is studied.

At least 49 House Democrats signed the letter to Hillary Clinton, asking for the study before the State Department issues its presidential permit for the project. The pipeline, which would stretch from oilsands formations in Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast, needs the permit because it crosses the U.S. border.

The Keystone XL pipeline expansion would add 500,000 barrels a day of crude oil capacity to the system, which Calgary-based TransCanada estimates will cost $12 billion US in total. The
3,185-kilometre project extends the company's existing Keystone pipeline, which runs through Canada to the central U.S. and begins operating this year.
Sun Life growth comes with `talent' hired from AIG, Lincoln
TORONTO - Sun Life Financial Inc., whose sales of variable annuities in the U.S. jumped last year,
said growth was spurred in part by salespeople it hired from bailed-out rivals like Lincoln National Corp.

``We were able to pick off some of their talent,'' Steve Deschenes, general manager of Sun Life's U.S. annuities business, said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. The financial crisis of 2008 ``was a great opportunity.''

Sun Life hired 50 variable annuity wholesalers, who co-ordinate and promote distribution, in the last year and a half, said Alexi Maravel, a Sun Life spokesman. In that time period, the number of Sun Life wholesalers rose to 84 from around 80, he said.
Vestas lands turbine contract with Capital Power

CALGARY - Vestas Wind Systems will supply Capital Power Corp. with up to 287 wind turbines for a series of power projects awaiting approvals in British Columbia and Ontario, Capital Power said on Wednesday.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.

Denmark's Vestas will supply and maintain a total of 517 megawatts of turbine power for Capital Power's $455-million Quality Wind Project in British Columbia, and for its $340 million in projects in Ontario at Port Dover and Nanticoke, and at the Knightsbridge II development, Capital Power said.

The projects are expected to proceed after receiving provincial environmental and regulatory approvals.
Canada Lithium shares, warrants trade on TSX Thursday

MONTREAL - Canada Lithium Corp., developing the $150-million lithium carbonate mine 60 kilometres north of Val d'Or, said Wednesday its common shares and warrants will begin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Thursday under the symbol CLQ.
Trading in the shares and warrants on the TSX Venture Exchange will cease.

"Moving up to the senior board will give us better visibility in the investing community as we move through the definitive feasibility study for the Quebec Lithium Project," said chief executive Peter Secker.
The full feasibility study will be completed in the first quarter next year. UNITED STATES
Fed keeps rate pledge

WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve officials retained a pledge to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low for an ``extended period'' and signalled that European indebtedness may harm American growth.

``The economic recovery is proceeding'' and ``the labour market is improving gradually,'' the Fed's Open Market Committee said in a statement in Washington. Still, ``financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad.''

The central bank, at a two-day meeting, left the overnight interbank lending rate target unchanged in a range of zero to 0.25 per cent, where it's been since December 2008. High unemployment, low inflation and stable price expectations ``are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period,'' the Fed said, repeating language from every policy meeting since March 2009.
Sales of U.S. new homes plunge

WASHINGTON - Purchases of U.S. new homes fell in May to the lowest level on record after a tax credit expired, showing the market remains dependent on government support.

Sales collapsed an unprecedented 33 per cent from April to an annual pace of 300,000, less than the median estimate of economists and the fewest in data going back to 1963, figures from the Commerce Department showed Wednesday. Demand in prior months was revised down.

The report added to signs of weakness in the economy, including a decline in retail sales and a slowdown in private job growth.
Insurance sales decline for 12th straight quarter

WASHINGTON - U.S. property and casualty insurance sales dropped for the 12th straight quarter as employers scaled back coverage with the jobless rate near a quarter-century high.

Policy sales fell 1.3 per cent to $105.1 billion US in the three months ended March 31, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America said Wednesday in a statement. Until the slump began three years ago, quarterly sales had fallen only twice since 1987.

Manufacturers and builders have cut purchases of workers' compensation coverage while individuals pinched by the economic slump have reduced spending, weighing on sales at insurers including American International Group Inc., Travelers Cos. and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.


Page 17 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The jobless rate was 9.7 per cent in each of the first three months of this year, compared with less than
9 per cent in the same period in 2009.
US bankruptcies fall; restructuring pros scramble

NEW YORK - U.S. corporate bankruptcies have fallen by more than half this year as loosening credit markets and an improving economy have brightened the outlook for beleaguered companies - and brought stress to restructuring professionals.

In the first six months of this year, 50 publicly traded companies filed for Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy in U.S. courts. That's down from 118 a year earlier, according to BankruptcyData.com.

"There are a lot of hungry bankruptcy professionals, restructuring firms and financial advisers," said Mark Jacobs, a partner at Pryor Cashman LLP who specializes in this area. "Everyone out there is trolling for new business."
GM reportedly preparing IPO plan
DETROIT - General Motors Co. is preparing for an initial public offering that would sell 20 per cent of
the Treasury's stake in the automaker and reduce the U.S. to a minority owner, said two people familiar
with the plan.

The aim is to sell a fifth of the government's 304 million shares, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing private discussions. That would reduce the Treasury Department's stake to less than 50 per cent from 61 per cent now. Final decisions on which owners will sell how many shares haven't been made and may change, the people said.
Massey Energy sues agency after blast kills 29

NEW YORK - Massey Energy Co, the owner of a West Virginia mine where an April explosion killed 29 miners, has sued a federal agency for failing to approve ventilation systems it said would have protected miners.

The lawsuit by six Massey affiliates against the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration and three officials was filed Tuesday in the federal district court in Washington, D.C.

Massey said the MSHA had violated its constitutional due process rights by arbitrarily refusing to approve its mine ventilation plans, including the use of scrubbers to remove harmful coal dust that can lead to black lung disease.

The MSHA has previously said it decided to restrict Massey's use of scrubbers in mines because the equipment was not working as well as it should.

Canada's G20 fiscal tightening targets a minimum

BRUSSELS - Fiscal consolidation targets for G20 countries proposed by Canada are less ambitious than those of the European Union, and a number of advanced G20 countries should make a bigger effort, an EU diplomat said.

Canada proposes that the world's 20 biggest developed and developing economies agree at a summit in Toronto later this week to halve budget deficits by 2013 and stabilize or start reducing debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.

"We are wary of these targets. We are more ambitious than that," an EU diplomat involved in the preparation of the G20 summit said. "This is a minimum, a number of advanced economies should go further than that."
He would not specify which G20 countries should make a bigger effort. Standard Life combines business units in U.K., Europe, Canada
EDINBURGH - Standard Life PLC, Scotland's biggest insurer, will combine its business divisions in the
U.K., Europe, Canada and Asia as part of chief executive David Nish's plans to boost pension sales.

The insurer is merging its sales, marketing and distribution divisions in those countries and regions, Edinburgh-based Standard Life said Wednesday in an e-mailed statement. Paul Matthews, currently managing director of distribution, will head up the newly created unit in the U.K.

Page 18 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nish, who succeeded Sandy Crombie as chief executive on Jan. 1, is reorganizing the firm's internal operations as he focuses on managing more Britons' pension assets rather than on selling traditional products such as life insurance and investment bonds.
BHP, Rio shares pare losses

LONDON - BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group pared losses in London trading after Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who has proposed a new profits tax on mining companies, said he faces a leadership challenge on Thursday.

Rio closed down 1.6 per cent to 3,390 pence, having earlier slumped 2.8 per cent. BHP, the world's biggest mining company, was down 1.9 per cent to 1,951 pence at the close, recouping some of its 2.5 per cent decline. Both stocks jumped after Rudd told reporters in Canberra that he faced a challenge from deputy Julia Gillard at a ballot on Thursday, then sank when he said he expected to win.

Rudd has faced criticism from mining companies including Melbourne-based BHP, London-based Rio and Xstrata PLC over the plan to impose a 40 per cent levy on mining profits from 2012.
Companies fined in EU bathroom cartel

BRUSSELS - Ideal Standard, Villeroy & Boch AG, Sanitec Oyj and 14 other bathroom fittings companies were fined a total of 622 million euros ($793 million Cdn) by the European Commission for colluding on prices for toilets, tubs and taps.

Ideal Standard, owned by U.S. private equity company Bain Capital LLC, received the single biggest fine of 326 million euros the commission said in an e-mailed statement. Villeroy & Boch was  fined 71 million euros.

``It was a really well organized  cartel,'' Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, said in Brussels on Wednesday. ``I can think of no better illustration for the need for strong competition enforcement.''
Zimbabwe to start selling diamond stockpiles

TEL AVIV - Zimbabwe plans to begin selling diamond stockpiles from its Marange fields immediately, whether this week's meeting of regulators of the trade gives the go ahead or not, the country's mining minister said.
Civil society groups have urged the Kimberley Process (KP) certification scheme to suspend ties with
Zimbabwe because of human rights abuses in its Marange fields.

"I would like to take this opportunity to advise that Zimbabwe will be immediately exporting its diamond stockpiles because we are KP-compliant and we need the money to drive the economy forward," Minister of Mines and Mining Development Obert Moses Mpofu told a meeting on Wednesday of some
70 members of the Kimberley Process.

While the meeting was due to end on Wednesday evening, Boaz Hirsch, the 2010 KP chairman, said delegates have not been able to reach a consensus on Zimbabwe and were continuing to meet.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 17 bathroom equipment makers a total of EUR622 million for fixing prices in Europe for 12 years.

The cartel covered everyday bathroom items such as sinks, baths, taps, and  fittings, and controlled prices by coordination across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands between the years 1992 to 2004.

The companies found guilty of participating in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Ideal Standard, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch (VIB3.XE) and Zucchetti.

Masco received full immunity from  fines as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the commission said.

A further five companies had their  fines reduced because of their inability to pay due to the economic downturn.

Although the commission has been known for its high  cartel fines, it was willing to reduce the amounts in this case "as the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 17 bathroom equipment makers a total of EUR622 million for fixing prices in Europe for 12 years.

The cartel covered everyday bathroom items such as sinks, baths, taps, and  fittings, and controlled prices by coordination across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands between the years 1992 to 2004.

Ideal Standard, which sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics faces the highest portion of the  fine at EUR326 million. However it is the U.S. company Wabco Holding (WBC), which was spun off from the American Standard Co. in 2007, that is liable for the  fine, which it will pay using its existing cash balance and available credit lines, the company said.

Other companies found guilty of participating in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch (VIB3.XE) and Zucchetti. Vileroy & Boch has to pay the second highest  fine at EUR72 million.

Masco received full immunity from  fines as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the commission said.

A further five companies had their  fines reduced because of their inability to pay due to the economic downturn.

Although the commission has been known for its high  cartel fines, it was willing to reduce the amounts in this case "as the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

In total 10 companies had asked the commission for leniency on the  fines due to their difficult financial situation, but the commission only granted the reduction in five of the cases. Declining to name the companies Almunia said "they don't want to show that they have been considered as beneficiaries of this request."

The overall decision on who could qualify for  fine reductions was taken based on several factors. The commission looks at annual financial statements, including the provisional one for the current year, ratios that look at profitability and solvency as well as the company's relationship with its banks and shareholders, Almunia said. Based on the circumstances of this case, "we believe that this  fine is excessive," said Wabco's CEO Jacques Esculier. The company has strong grounds to appeal the  fine although it is still waiting to see the full judgment before deciding, Esculier added.

Earlier Wednesday, the commission  fined 17 bathroom equipment makers a total of EUR622 million for fixing prices for sinks, baths, taps, and fittings across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands between 1992 and 2004.

"The original charges [against Geberit] were not maintained by the  EU Commission. Geberit had constantly stressed that these charges are completely unfounded," Geberit said in a statement.

Ideal Standard, which sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics faces the highest portion of the fine at EUR326 million. However it is the U.S. company Wabco Holding (WBC), which was spun off from the American Standard Co. in 2007, that is liable for the  fine, which it will pay using its existing cash balance and available credit lines, the company said.

Other companies found guilty of participating in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch AG (VIB3.XE) and Zucchetti. Vileroy & Boch has to pay the second-highest  fine at EUR72 million.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined 17 bathroom equipment makers a total of EUR622 million for fixing prices in Europe for 12 years.

The cartel covered everyday bathroom items such as sinks, baths, taps, and  fittings, and controlled prices by coordination across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands between the years 1992 to 2004.

Ideal Standard, which used to be part of the American Standard Companies, faces the highest portion of the fine at EUR326 million. However it is the U.S. company Wabco Holding (WBC), which was spun off from the American Standard Co. in 2007, that is liable for the  fine, which it will pay using its existing
cash balance and available credit lines, the company said.

Other companies found guilty of participating in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch (VIB3.XE) and Zucchetti. Vileroy & Boch has to pay the second highest  fine at EUR72 million.

Masco received full immunity from  fines as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the commission said.

A further five companies had their  fines reduced because of their inability to pay due to the economic downturn.

Although the commission has been known for its high  cartel fines, it was willing to reduce the amounts in this case "as the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

In a further sign of unusual clemency to the companies involved in the cartel, the commission reduced the duration of the  cartel by 7-years, which brought down the total fines to the companies.

"It shows the commission wants to help industry hardest hit by the economic crisis, without making a big song and dance about reducing fines," said one Brussels based lawyer specialising in cartels. Not all firms would qualify for lower fines due to bancruptcy fears, but this way the whole industry can benefit from leniency, the lawyer added.

In total 10 companies had asked the commission for leniency on the  fines due to their difficult financial situation, but the commission only granted the reduction in five of the cases. Declining to name the companies Almunia said "they don't want to show that they have been considered as beneficiaries of this request."

The overall decision on who could qualify for  fine reductions was taken based on several factors. The commission looks at annual financial statements, including the provisional one for the current year, ratios that look at profitability and solvency as well as the company's relationship with its banks and shareholders, Almunia said. Based on the circumstances of this case, "we believe that this  fine is
Page 25 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
excessive," said Wabco's CEO Jacques Esculier. The company has strong grounds to appeal the  fine
although it is still waiting to see the full judgment before deciding, Esculier added.

(Adds Ideal Standard, Wabco comments) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators  fined 17 bathroom fittings companies a total of 622 million euros ($835 million) on Wednesday for fixing prices, with five receiving lower penalties because of the economic crisis.

The European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, said the companies operated a cartel between 1992 and 2004 in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands.

Ideal Standard International Group, which makes and sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics and other products in Latin America, received the biggest  fine at 326 million euros -- a sum reduced by 30 percent for cooperating with the regulator.

The company said it did not have to pay the  fine as it has an indemnity arrangement with U.S. auto safety system supplier Wabco Holdings Inc and other third parties. Wabco said it would see a financial impact from the  fine. [ID:nWNAB0492]

The other companies in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch and Zucchetti.

Masco, a U.S. company whose main subsidiaries are Hansgrohe and Hueppe, received immunity as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the Commission said.

"The cartel will have harmed businesses such as builders and plumbers and, ultimately, a large number of families," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. He said the Commission had not softened its fining policy despite the reduced penalties.

"We consider a positive reaction to an inability-to-pay request as an exception, not a rule," Almunia told a news conference.

The 27-country European Union's antitrust watchdog, which can  fine firms up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaching EU rules, has levied more than 10 billion euros in penalties since 2004.

Grohe, Europe's largest single-brand sanitary  fittings maker, said in a statement that the  fine would negatively impact its investment decisions and it was reviewing its legal options. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Dale Hudson and David Cowell)

BANGALORE, June 23 (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Wabco Holdings said a 326 million euros ($400 million) fine European Union antitrust regulators levied against entities representing its former parent for fixing prices will hurt its second-quarter and 2010 earnings.
European Union antitrust regulators  fined 17 companies in the  bathroom fittings industry a total of
622 million euros ($835 million) on Wednesday for fixing prices, with lower penalties for five crisis-hit
firms. [ID:nLDE65M1D3]

The impact of the  fine is expected to hurt the company's second quarter earnings by $6.06 a share, and 2010 earnings by 1 cent a share, Wabco said in a filing with U.S. regulators.

"It finally eliminates an overhang that has existed since the company has been public, clearing the way for buybacks," said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Stephen Tusa in a note.

Wabco was spun off from American Standard Cos Inc, now known as Trane Inc, in 2007. As per Wabco's agreement, it is obliged to indemnify American Standard and related entities involved in the investigation against any  fine, Wabco said.

The fine was on Ideal Standard International Holding SARL. Ideal acquired in November 2007 the European Bath and Kitchen division of American Standard, including European legal entities that were formerly units of American Standard Europe BVBA, and has continued the relevant business.

Wabco termed the  fine "excessive" but said it can pay up using its existing cash balances and available credit lines.
The company had cash and cash equivalents of $346 million at the end of March 31.

Wabco said it had "strong" grounds to appeal, and was waiting for the full text of the commission's judgement.

It has never manufactured or marketed any of the products that are the subject of this investigation, and no one from the company had any involvement with the matter, Wabco said..

U.S. building products maker Masco Corp , whose main subsidiaries are Hansgrohe and Hueppe, received immunity as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the European                   Commission said.

Masco said it had discovered and stopped certain units from participating in "anticompetitive business practices" in the  bathroom faucet and shower enclosure industries in certain countries in Europe. [nWNAB0538]

The European Commission fined 17 bathroom equipment manufacturers a total of 622 million euros
(764 million dollars) on Wednesday for running a price-fixing cartel, with a US company hit hardest.

"These 17 companies fixed prices for baths, sinks, taps and other  bathroom fittings for 12 years in six countries covering 240 million people," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

TD
"The cartel will have harmed businesses such as builders and plumbers and, ultimately, a large number of families," he added.
The cartel covered ceramics such as sinks, baths, taps, and  fittings.

US maker Ideal Standard was handed a 326-million euro  fine. The second-biggest  fine, 71.5 million euros, was slapped on Germany's Villeroy & Boch while there were  fines of over 50 million euros for Finnish Sanitec and Grohe, another German maker.

The latter company released a statement saying it was studying the decision and "considering its legal options."

"Those alleged actions took place at a time when Grohe was owned by a different group of shareholders from those that acquired the company in July 2004," Grohe said in its statement.

"Whilst Grohe has made provisions, the size of the  fine will likely negatively impact anticipated investment decisions," it added.
The cartel operated between 1992-2004 in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the
Netherlands.

Some of those  fines, including Ideal's, were significantly reduced thanks to the company's cooperation with the EU watchdog's investigations.
Fellow US maker Masco, whose main subsidiaries are Hansgrohe and Huppe, got full immunity and no
fine for its role as whistle-blower in the  cartel.

Other fines were reduced because of the offending companies' "likely inability to pay the  fine given their financial situation," the commission said.

"The objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties," said Almunia.

According to the EU probe coordination between the companies took place during meetings of national trade associations in Germany and the other countries involved as well as via bilateral contacts.

In recent years the commission has launched a very active war against cartels operating in Europe, with the size of  fines rising.
Almunia, at a press conference in Brussels, promised that would continue.

Brussels - The  European Commission imposed a multi-million  fine on a cartel of producers of bathroom equipment. Due to suspicion of illegal price arrangement the authorities in Brussels imposed a total fine of EUR 622 million (USD 763 million) on 17 producers.
Among these companies there are also two Austrian producers: Artweger will have to pay a EUR
2.8-million fine and Duscholux will have to pay EUR 1.7 million. The highest  fine (EUR 326 million) was
imposed on the American producer Ideal Standard.

HD     Wabco plans to review $400M fine assessed by European Commission against former parent company

NEW YORK (AP) - Auto parts maker Wabco Holdings Inc. on Wednesday said the  European                   Commission has assessed a fine of 326 million euros ($400 million) against its defunct former parent company and that company's former operations in Europe.

The fine stems from an investigation of alleged  price fixing  before 2004 by a number of European bathroom fixtures and fittings companies, including those that were part of the European operations of Wabco's former parent, American Standard Companies Inc.

TD
Wabco, which is based in Piscataway, N.J., agreed in 2007 to be responsible for  fines against American Standard and related companies, even though it never made any of the products related to the investigation. Wabco has been waiting for a decision on the  fine ever since.

Wabco said it can pay the  fine using its existing cash balances and its available credit lines, but it called the fine "excessive."

"We also believe that we have strong grounds to appeal, although we are waiting for the full text of the Commission's decision before we confirm whether to appeal. Importantly, the Commission's decision lifts a lot of uncertainty for Wabco and we can now more than ever address the growth opportunities that are available for our company."
Wabco said it will host a conference call on Friday to further discuss the  fine.

HD         European bathroom fittings cartel fined €622m

Seventeen  bathroom fittings companies, ranging from US-based multinationals to small Italian speciality manufacturers, were hit by  fines totalling €622m ($761m) on Wednesday for their part in one of the largest longest-running cartels to surface in Europe recently.

But more than one-third of the members of the cartel will have their fines reduced - either because of their co-operation with the European Commission, Europe's top competition watchdog, or because full penalties could have pushed them close to bankruptcy.

TD
EU competition officials have been bombarded with requests for milder treatment because of the
current economic climate. The fact that five of the 10 companies that made such pleas in the  bathroom
fittings case won reductions will be scrutinised by lawyers.

On Wednesday, the EU's new competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, rejected suggestions he was taking a softer line on antitrust penalties than his predecessor Neelie Kroes. "I'm not conciliatory at all ... I'm very tough on cartels," he insisted.

Stephen Kinsella, partner at law firm Sidley Austin, said: "Reductions [because of inability to pay] aren't unprecedented and there's no real change in the rules. But it's a much clearer invitation from the commission that if you've got a very good case, make it."

But lawyers say the case will be perceived as a signal from Europe's regulator that it is open to persuasion.

Two other well-known companies - Germany's Grohe and Ideal Standard, which acquired parts of the US American Standard conglomerate in a break-up three years ago - saw their  fines reduced by 30 per cent in return for co-operation and will be  fined €54.8m and €326.1m respectively.

The bathroom fittings cartel, which was organised through hundreds of trade association meetings, ran for 12 years, from 1992 to 2004, and covered six countries in continental Europe.

The whistle was eventually blown by Masco, the US building products group, which gets immunity from any penalty as a result.

The Commission did not identify which companies got reductions but said that for three companies these reductions were by 50 per cent, and that for a further two, by 25 per cent.

Officials also said two unnamed companies first thought to be involved had had the allegations against them dropped, and that the period of the  cartel had been narrowed. Commission officials originally thought it began in 1985.

Companies involved can appeal against the  fines to the European courts in Luxembourg; they could also face private damages actions from customers.

(Adds Ideal Standard, Wabco comments) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 23 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators  fined 17 bathroom fittings companies a total of
622 million euros ($835 million) on Wednesday for fixing prices, with five receiving lower penalties
because of the economic crisis.

The European Commission, the European Union's competition watchdog, said the companies operated a cartel between 1992 and 2004 in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands.

Ideal Standard International Group, which makes and sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics and other products in Latin America, received the biggest  fine at 326 million euros -- a sum reduced by 30 percent for cooperating with the regulator.

The company said it did not have to pay the  fine as it has an indemnity arrangement with U.S. auto safety system supplier Wabco Holdings Inc and other third parties. Wabco said it would see a financial impact from the  fine. [ID:nWNAB0492]

The other companies in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch and Zucchetti.

Masco, a U.S. company whose main subsidiaries are Hansgrohe and Hueppe, received immunity as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the Commission said.

"The cartel will have harmed businesses such as builders and plumbers and, ultimately, a large number of families," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. He said the Commission had not softened its fining policy despite the reduced penalties.

"We consider a positive reaction to an inability-to-pay request as an exception, not a rule," Almunia told a news conference.

The 27-country European Union's antitrust watchdog, which can  fine firms up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaching EU rules, has levied more than 10 billion euros in penalties since 2004.

Grohe, Europe's largest single-brand sanitary  fittings maker, said in a statement that the  fine would negatively impact its investment decisions and it was reviewing its legal options. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Dale Hudson and David Cowell)

(ADPnews) - Jun 23, 2010 - Swiss sanitary systems maker Geberit (VTX:GEBN) said today the
European Commission (EC) closed a cartel investigation against it without imposing a  fine.

The investigation started in 2004 and targeted various manufacturers in the sanitary industry for participating in illegal price agreements and exchanging sensitive data. The commission imposed a fine totalling EUR 622 million (USD 764m) on 17 of the investigated companies.

TD
According to the EC, the fined companies have been co-ordinating with each other the prices of wash basins, bath tubs and fittings in six EU countries for 12 years.

The biggest  fine of EUR 326 million was imposed on Ideal Standard. The  fines of five companies were reduced because of the financial difficulties they are in.

BRUSSELS—The  European Commission on Wednesday fined 17 bathroom-equipment makers a total of €622 million ($763.5 million) for fixing prices in Europe for 12 years.

The cartel covered everyday bathroom items such as sinks, baths, taps, and  fittings, and controlled prices by coordination across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands between the years 1992 to 2004.

TD
Ideal Standard, which sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics, faces the highest portion of the fine—€326 million. However, it is U.S.-based Wabco Holding, which was spun off from the American Standard Co. in 2007, that is liable for the  fine. Wabco will pay using its existing cash balance and available credit lines, the company said.

"We believe that this  fine is excessive," Wabco's Chief Executive Jacques Esculier said. He said that the company has strong grounds to appeal the  fine although it is still waiting to see the full judgment before deciding.

Other companies found guilty of participating in the  cartel include Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch and Zucchetti. Villeroy & Boch has to pay €72 million—the second-highest  fine.

Masco received full immunity from  fines as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel, the commission said.

Another five companies had their  fines reduced because of their inability to pay due to the economic downturn.

Although the commission has been known for its high  cartel fines, it was willing to reduce the amounts in this case "as the objective of anticartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Ten companies had asked the commission for leniency on the  fines due to their difficult financial situation, but the commission only granted the reduction in five of the cases. Mr. Almunia declined to name the companies, saying that "they don't want to show that they have been considered as beneficiaries of this request."

The overall decision on who could qualify for  fine reductions was taken based on several factors. The commission looks at annual financial statements, including the provisional one for the current year, ratios that look at profitability and solvency as well as the company's relationship with its banks and shareholders, Mr. Almunia said.
Corrections & Amplifications:

An earlier version of this article misstated Wabco's relationship with Ideal Standard in the third paragraph.

BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission on Wednesday fined 17 bathroom equipment producers, including Ideal Standard of the United States, a total of 622 million euros (762 million U.S. dollars) for a  price fixing cartel.

"These 17 companies fixed prices for baths, sinks, taps and other  bathroom fittings for 12 years in six countries covering 240 million people. The  cartel will have harmed businesses such as builders and plumbers and, ultimately, a large number of families," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's vice president and competition commissioner.

TD
The commission decision showed that between 1992 and 2004, the 17 companies coordinated the sales price for bathroom fixtures and fittings in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands.

The coordination took place during meetings of 13 national trade associations in the six EU countries and in bilateral contacts. It consisted of fixing price increases, minimum prices, and rebates, and exchanging sensitive business information.

Ideal Standard was hit with the largest bulk of the  fines. It had to pay 326 million euros (400 million U.S. dollars), nearly half of the total.

However, the  fines of five companies were reduced because of their likely inability to pay the  fine given their financial situation.

"As the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties, the commission reduced the  fines on five companies to a level they could afford," Almunia said.

The EU's antitrust chief said on Tuesday that the financial and economic crisis has caused more and more companies unable to afford hefty antitrust  fines.

The commission has been a rigorous guardian of the EU's competition rules, under which a company may be fined as much as 10 percent of its yearly global turnover for each year when it was involved in the cartel.

Brussels, 23/06/2010 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 23 June, the European Commission fined 17 bathroom equipment manufacturers a total of €622,250,783 for a price fixing  cartel covering six EU countries. The 12 year cartel covered ceramics such as sinks, baths, taps, and fittings. Masco received full immunity from fines under the Commission's Leniency Programme, as it was the first to provide information about the cartel. The fines of five undertakings were reduced because of their likely inability to pay the  fine given their financial situation. The Commission decision shows that between 1992 and
2004, 17 companies coordinated the sales price for  bathroom fixtures and fittings in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands.

TD
The coordination took place during meetings of 13 national trade associations in Germany (over 100 meetings), Austria (over 80), Italy (65), and also Belgium, France and The Netherlands, and in bilateral contacts.

It consisted of fixing price increases, minimum prices, and rebates, and exchanging sensitive business information. Six of the companies  fined are German (Dornbracht, Duravit, Grohe, Hansa, Kludi and Villeroy &Boch), five Italian (Cisal, Mamoli, RAF, Teorema and Zucchetti), two Austrian (Artweger and Duscholux), two from the US (Ideal Standard and Masco), one Spanish (Roca) and one Swiss (Sanitec).

The Commission comments that the practices are very serious infringements of the EU competition rules and prohibited by Article 101 of the EU Treaty. In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the affected sales of the companies involved, the very serious nature of the infringement and its long duration.

"These 17 companies fixed prices for baths, sinks, taps and other  bathroom fittings for 12 years in six countries covering 240 million people. The  cartel will have harmed businesses such as builders and plumbers and, ultimately, a large number of families. However, as the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate the fall of companies in financial difficulties, the Commission reduced the  fines on five companies to a level they could afford. Companies should be in no doubt that the Commission will continue its fight on cartels and the level of  fines will continue to be such that it should dissuade them
from engaging in illegal behaviour in the first place,” said Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice President and Competition Commissioner.

The Commission reduced the  fines of two companies (Grohe and Ideal Standard) by 30% because they cooperated during the investigation. It cut three companies' fines by 50% and two by 25% due their inability to pay given their current finances. In setting the fines, which range from €326.1 million (Ideal Standard) to €253,600 (Mamoli), the Commission took account of each company's sales, the seriousness of the price-fixing and the duration of the practices in question.

The European Commission announced, on 23 June, that it was ordering 17 bathroom equipment manufacturers to pay total fines of €622,250,783 for participating in a price-fixing cartel covering six EU countries. The 17 groups represent 70 enterprises. Well-known names appear in the list - Ideal Standard, Kludi, Villeroy & Boch, Grohe and Duscholux, among others.
VERY SERIOUS INFRINGEMENT

TD
The cartel was in place for 12 years, from 1992 to 2004, and covered ceramics, such as sinks, baths, taps and fittings. The parties set the arrangements through trade associations, fixing price increases, minimum prices and rebates, and exchanging sensitive business information. "The practices are very serious infringements of EU competition rules and are prohibited by Article 101 of the EU Treaty," explained the Commission. France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands were covered by the cartel, which was "extremely well organised [...] and concerned 240 million people". The  cartel "harmed businesses, such as builders and plumbers," commented Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
The US firm American Standard has to pay the largest  fine (€326 million), followed by Germany's Villeroy
& Boch (€71.5 mn) and Finland's Sanitec (€57.7 mn). The American firm Masco obtained full immunity
under the Commission's leniency programme because it was the first to provide information about the
cartel, while the  fines for another US firm, Ideal Standard, and for Germany's Grohe were reduced by
30% for their cooperation in providing proof. The commissioner reiterated his determination to combat
relentlessly such breaches of competition law in Europe: "Companies should be in no doubt that the
Commission will continue its fight against cartels and that the level of  fines will continue to be such that it
should dissuade them from engaging in illegal behaviour in the first place".

"I am very hard on companies that infringe competition law, and not at all conciliatory," he assured. Almunia even encouraged the firms that were victims of the  cartel to seek compensation for injury in the member states where group actions are possible. He added that the possibility of harmonising group legal actions in the EU is still under discussion.
REDUCTION OF  FINES

"Since the objective of anti-cartel enforcement is not to precipitate companies into financial difficulties, the Commission reduced the fines on five companies to a level they could afford," noted Commissioner Almunia. The executive assessed cases based on actual difficulties being experienced as reflected in the companies' annual balance sheets, financial statements, provisional current year statements, solvency ratios and profitability. The use of these objective criteria ensured equal treatment to the firms that requested arrangements, while preserving the dissuasive nature of EU competition rules. Out of ten requests, only five companies were given a reduction because they would probably have been unable to pay the full  fine given their financial situation. Three companies obtained a 50% reduction and two a 25% cut.

DREAMWORKS
Studio to Produce Film

TD
Featuring Troll Dolls

DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. plans to make a feature film starring Good Luck Troll dolls, one of the biggest toy crazes of the 1960s.

The film studio, which produces exclusively family fare, reached an agreement with Dam Things of Denmark, the family business that produced the dolls designed by Danish woodcarver Thomas Dam based on characters from Scandinavian folklore.

The trolls, with unique faces and shocks of colorful hair, were first sold in the early 1960s and experienced a resurgence in the 1990s. Several competitors have sold copies of the original trolls.
"My father would have been very happy to know that his troll has found its dream partner in
DreamWorks Animation," said Niels Dam, owner of the family business.

DreamWorks Animation produced "How To Train Your Dragon" this past spring and the movie franchises for "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Madagascar."

Brother-sister writing team Adam Wilson and Melanie Wilson LaBracio, who wrote "Evergone" and "The Impossible Adventures of Phineas Roone," will write the troll screenplay, and Dannie Festa of Festa Entertainment will executive produce the film.

--- CARMAX
Car Seller's Earnings Surge
On Used-Vehicle Financing

CarMax Inc.'s profit nearly quadrupled on an improvement at its financing operations as used-vehicle sales climbed.
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, CarMax shares rose $1.89 to $21.94.

The 9% same-store-sales increase "reflected the benefit of a continuing gradual rebound in customer traffic, as well as the easy year-over-year comparison," the company said.

For the quarter ended May 31, CarMax reported earnings of $101.1 million, or 44 cents a share, up from $28.7 million, or 13 cents, a year earlier. The most-recent quarter included a three-cent benefit because of the finance arm's loan-loss position, while the year-earlier quarter included a net reduction


Page 51 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of nine cents because of increased funding costs and other finance arm-related adjustments that were partially offset by a litigation settlement.

Revenue jumped 23% to $2.26 billion. Gross margin fell to 14.7% from 15.1% even as the average selling price on a used vehicle rose 8.9% to $17,964.
The company's auto-finance business swung to a profit of $57.5 million from a year-earlier loss of
$21.6 million.

IDEAL STANDARD

Bathroom Supplier Faces EU

Fines Over Price Fixing

The European Commission on Wednesday fined 17 bathroom-equipment makers a total of 622 million euros ($764.4 million) for fixing prices in Europe for 12 years.

The cartel covered everyday bathroom items such as sinks, taps and  fittings and controlled prices by coordination across Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands between the years
1992 to 2004.

Ideal Standard, which sells American Standard  bathroom ceramics, faces the highest portion of the fine -- 326 million euros. However, it is U.S.-based Wabco Holding, which was spun off from the American Standard Co. in 2007, that is liable for the  fine. Wabco will pay using its existing cash balance and available credit lines, the company said.

"We believe that this  fine is excessive," Wabco Chief Executive Jacques Esculier said. He said that the company has strong grounds to appeal the  fine although it is still waiting to see the full judgment before deciding.

Ghosn's Compensation
Put at $9.8 Million

Nissan Motor Co. President Carlos Ghosn said Wednesday that he received 890 million yen ($9.8 million) in compensation in the fiscal year ended in March, making him the highest-paid executive at a listed Japanese company, according to publicly disclosed information.

This is the first time the car maker has released the top executive's compensation figure, as the Financial Services Agency's new rules require that publicly traded companies in Japan disclose the compensation of executives receiving 100 million yen or more.

The amount compares with the roughly 816.5 million yen that Sony Corp. Chief Executive Howard Stringer received in a combination of 410 million yen in salary and bonuses, and 406.5 million yen in stock options during the just-ended business year. Nissan declined to break down Mr. Ghosn's compensation.

The pay of Messrs. Stringer and Ghosn, two foreign heads of major Japanese companies, is being closely watched, as compensation levels for Japanese executives are usually much less than for their U.S. and European counterparts.

CVS CAREMARK Connecticut Investigates

Drugstore Actions in State
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal announced an investigation of what his office called
CVS Caremark Corp.'s "threat to terminate" a discount prescription program for customers in the state.

Mr. Blumenthal's office said Wednesday that he has subpoenaed CVS Caremark, demanding that the company explain why providing generic-drug discounts to Connecticut's Medicaid program would result in the termination of the company's Health Savings Pass program state-wide.

With the Health Savings Pass, consumers pay $10 a year for access to deeply discounted 90-day supplies of generic drugs. A new state law requires pharmacies to charge Medicaid the lowest drug price they offer consumers, and the state says that obligates CVS to provide the discount to Medicaid customers, too. CVS disagreed and responded by threatening to end the program in Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal's office said.

CVS Caremark's spokesman, Michael DeAngelis, said in an e-mailed statement that Connecticut's pricing demand "would alter the intent of this program and make it economically unfeasible to continue." He added that the program is voluntary and isn't required by law.

Seventeen  bathroom fittings companies, ranging from US-based multinationals to small Italian speciality manufacturers, were yesterday hit by  fines totalling €622m ($761m) for running one of the longest and largest cartels to surface in Europe recently.

But more than one-third of the members of the cartel will have their fines reduced - either because of their co-operation with the European Commission, Europe's top competition watchdog, or because full penalties could have pushed them close to bankruptcy.

EU competition officials have been bombarded with requests for milder treatment because of the current economic climate.

Two well-known companies - Germany's Grohe and Ideal Standard, which acquired parts of the US American Standard conglomerate in a break-up three years ago - saw their  fines reduced by 30 per cent in return for co-operation and will be  fined €54.8m and €326.1m respectively.
The cartel, which was organised through trade association meetings, ran for 12 years, from 1992 to
2004, and covered six countries in continental Europe. Nikki Tait, Brussels

Seventeen  bathroom fittings companies, ranging from US-based multinationals to small Italian speciality manufacturers, were yesterday hit by  fines totalling €622m ($761m) for running one of the longest and largest cartels to surface in Europe recently.

TD
But more than one-third of the members of the cartel will have their fines reduced - either because of their co-operation with the European Commission, Europe's top competition watchdog, or because full penalties could have pushed them close to bankruptcy.

EU competition officials have been bombarded with requests for milder treatment because of the current economic climate. The fact that five out of the 10 companies which made such pleas in the  bathroom   fittings case won reductions will be scrutinised by lawyers.

Yesterday, the EU's new competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, rejected suggestions he was taking a softer line on anti-trust penalties than his predecessor Neelie Kroes. "I'm not conciliatory at all . .
. I'm very tough on cartels," he insisted.

"Reductions [because of inability to pay] aren't unprecedented and there's no real change in the rules. But it's a much clearer invitation from the Commission that if you've got a very good case, make it," said Stephen Kinsella, partner at law firm Sidley Austin.

But lawyers say the case will be perceived as a signal from Europe's regulator that it is open to persuasion.

Two other well-known companies - Germany's Grohe and Ideal Standard, which acquired parts of the US American Standard conglomerate in a break-up three years ago - saw their  fines reduced by 30 per cent in return for co-operation and will be  fined €54.8m and €326.1m respectively.

The bathroom fittings cartel, which was organised through hundreds of trade association meetings, ran for 12 years, from 1992 to 2004, and covered six countries in continental Europe.

The whistle was eventually blown by Masco, the US building products group, which gets immunity from any penalty as a result.

The Commission did not identify which companies got reductions but said that for three companies these reductions were by 50 per cent, and that for a further two, by 25 per cent.

Officials also said two unnamed companies first thought to be involved had had the allegations against them dropped, and that the period of the  cartel had been narrowed. Commission officials originally thought it began in 1985.

German sanitary ware and crockery producer Villeroy & Boch and 16 other sector companies have to pay a total of EUR 622 million in  fines after the  European Commission found them guilty of  price fixing.

Villeroy & Boch itself was imposed with a  fine of EUR 71.5 million, which is nearly as much as the market capitalisation of its preference shares.

Upon the news on Wednesday the German company's shares dropped more than 30%.
The European Commission has fined the companies because they had formed a  bathroom equipment
cartel in the years 1994 to 2004.

HD         Brussels flushes  out bathroom cartel with ¤622m fines

Ideal Standard, Villeroy & Boch and 15 other  bathroom manufacturers have been  fined a combined
¤622 million by the  European Commission for running a cartel to fix the price of toilets.

Ideal Standard, which is owned by Bain Capital, the American private equity group, received the highest fine of ¤326 million (£268 million) for its role in what the Commission called "a well-organised cartel" that artificially inflated prices in six European countries for twelve years. Villeroy & Boch, the German bathroom and crockery maker, was fined ¤71 million for its role in the  cartel, which also affected the prices of baths, taps and basins.

TD
The Commission said that the manufacturers had fixed prices at more than 200 meetings during trade conferences between 1992 and 2004, harming "builders, plumbers and ultimately a large number of families in Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands".

Villeroy & Boch said that the  fine was "not justified" and it would appeal. Ideal Standard, whose  fine was reduced by 30 per cent for co-operating with the Commission, said the penalty was "excessive" and that it had strong grounds for appeal. Masco, an American company that owns the bathroom makers Hansgrohe and Hueppe, was given immunity after it blew the whistle on the cartel.

Ten of the companies requested reduced  fines on the ground of financial hardship and five received discounts. The Commission said that it had honoured a request from companies not to reveal which had pleaded financial difficulties.

Joaquín Almunia, the Competition Commissioner, denied the discounts were a sign of a softer policy on fines.He said the reductions were an exception, not a rule, adding: "Our objective with the enforcement of competition rules is not to increase the number of bankruptcies in our economy."
Adam Collinson, a partner at Eversheds, the law firm, said the  fines were evidence of the
Commission's "continuing hard line approach in detecting and pursuing  cartel conduct", but included "a
degree of pragmatism in response to companies' submissions".Ideal Standard said that it has strong
grounds for appeal

R. M. DE RITUERTO
Spanish company Roca is among 17  bathroom fixture manufacturers  fined a total of €

TD
622 million by the  European Commission's anti-trust watchdog for  price-fixing on Wednesday.

Roca was ordered to pay €38.7 million for being part of a 12-year-long  cartel that spanned six countries within the European Union and included some of the biggest names in the industry, such as German firms Duravit, Villeroy & Boch AG and Grohe AG.

Roca vowed to appeal its  fine to the General Court of the European Union within the coming weeks. "Roca cannot accept the penalties that the  European Commission has imposed and completely rejects the charge made against it and strongly disagrees with the disproportionate  fine," the company said in a statement.

The company's €38.7-million  fine stems from its Austrian and French subsidiaries, which the commission has conceded had only limited involvement in the  cartel as their turnover is less than 3.5 percent of the total sales of all the companies targeted, Roca said.

The cartel stretched from 1992 to 2004, as the 17 companies coordinated prices for sinks, faucets, baths and other  fixtures in six countries.
The companies orchestrated the  cartel through meetings of 13 national trade associations mainly in
Germany, Austria and Italy, as well as some groups in Belgium France and the Netherlands.

Shapewear promises to help burn calories too
TORONTO - Don't do a workout, wear it!

TD
It's just the thing for the lazy to leverage what activity they do manage into a real calorie-burning experience: ShaToBu is shapewear that will help the wearer burn up to 30,000 extra calories a year.

And no extra effort is required for this, or at least not much - according to Mayfair Tech Inc., the shapewear (we used to call them girdles and corsets) use a seamless, resistance-band technology designed by a Canadian chiropractor to make you burn 12 per cent more calories during natural movements than your regular clothes.
The Montreal-based manufacturers promise that ShaToBu is made with ``all-day comfort in mind,''
and won't bind at the waist or leg bands, and won't roll, cut or bulge, and the fabric breathes and stays
dry. And it's been tested by researchers who say that with regular, 12-hour-a-day use, a woman could
burn up to 30,000 extra calories a year.

So, do the math - shapewear whose purpose is to make the wearer look better when it's on, will also make the wearer look better when it's off. What's not to love?
ShaToBu is now available in select Bay stores, and goes into wider distribution this fall. Aeroflot improves cuisine to shed Soviet-era image
MOSCOW - Poor Aeroflot.

Russia's biggest airline has a lot of negative perceptions to overcome - that it's not safe, or that it's not stylish.
But Aeroflot is working to overcome that Soviet-era image, starting with its menu.

``Aeroflot still breeds this misconception which is rooted in the Soviet era when everyone thought that Aeroflot equals bad quality,'' says chief executive Vitaly Savelyev. ``Now it's a totally different company, and in terms of on- board service we are not a step behind world leaders in the segment.''

Aeroflot now changes its on-board menu every four months, and has offered items from oat and pumpernickel rolls to braised short ribs and smoked salmon. Cabin crew have been sent to Mil-Com Aerospace Group in Singapore for training - Savelyev says Aeroflot considers Singapore Airlines as a benchmark for service.

Before training Aeroflot attendants, Mil-Com instructors flew as observers on Aeroflot routes, where they found a lack of communication between flight attendants and passengers, Savelyev said.
``They were not too attentive,'' he said. ``We are rectifying this.'' Source: Bloomberg

ZURICH - It's good to know that the economic recovery is trickling up.

There are now nearly as many millionaires as there were before the global economic downturn, and for the first time ever there as many millionaires in Asia as there are in Europe, according to a report by Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch & Co.
Well, yay! That's so exciting. Good for you Asia!

Their money's been growing too, according to the survey: the wealth of the 10 million people globally with more than $1 million to invest rose 18.9 per cent to $39 trillion US in 2009, down from the $40.7 trillion held by 10.1 million in 2007, but way head of the $32.8 trillion they had in 2008.

The number of millionaires in the Asia-Pacific region rose 26 per cent to three million and their assets grew 31 per cent to $9.7 trillion last year. North America's numbers grew by 16.6 per cent to 3.1
million millionaires (of whom 2.87 are from the U.S.) with assets of $10.7 trillion, and Europe's wealthy increased their numbers by 13 per cent to three million with assets of $9.5 trillion.

Ideal Standard, Villeroy  Fined on EU bathroom cartel
BRUSSELS - The European Commission has pulled the plug on a  cartel involving 17
bathroom-fittings companies accused of price-fixing.

And it's taken a plunger to their pockets, fining them a total of 622 million euros ($796 million Cdn) for colluding on prices for toilets, taps and tubs.

Ideal Standard received the biggest single  fine, 326 million euros, while Villeroy & Boch was  fined 71 million euros.

The companies should have seen the swirly coming - the commission started looking into wrongdoing six years ago, raiding the offices of  bathroom products makers in five European countries back in
2004. Three years ago it sent official objections to a number of companies.

The price-fixing meetings took place at trade association conferences, with more than 200 meetings occurring between 1992 and 2004, the commission said.

HD               Wabco Boosts  2010 Expectations As Vehicle Production Rebounds

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Wabco Holdings Inc. (WBC) boosted its 2010 expectations as worldwide demand for the electronic braking systems maker continues to pick up.

TD
Vehicle production has been picking up in many parts of the world following a woeful 2009. Wabco swung to the black and handily topped estimates in its latest quarter amid a recovery for auto-parts makers.

But the  European Commission dealt the company a setback Wednesday, fining entities of the former American Standard as part of a  price-fixing scheme involving bathroom fixtures. Wabco, spun off from American Standard in 2007, is liable for the American Standard fine and will have to pay EUR326 million ($402 million). Wabco will use existing cash and credit lines to fund it.

Excluding the  fine, the company on Friday said it now expects earnings of $1.75 to $2.05 a share on sales growth of 30% to 35% on a local-currency basis. In early May, it boosted expectations to
$1.40 to $1.80 and 23% to 28%, respectively. Including the  fine, Wabco will post a loss for 2010.

"Most of the markets that we serve around the world are developing more favorably than we saw two months ago," Chairman and Chief Executive Jacques Esculier said Friday.

Wabco's shares closed Thursday at $33.63 and were inactive premarket. The stock is up 30% this year.

OPERATOR: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the WABCO June 25 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. (Operator Instructions).

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today, Mr. Mike Thompson, Vice President of Car Systems and Corporate Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

TD
MIKE THOMPSON, VP-CAR SYSTEMS AND CORP RELATIONS, WABCO HOLDINGS INC.: Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call today that we have arranged to discuss the outcome of an  European Commission fine, to provide you with an update on our global markets and full year outlook, and to address any related questions you might have on these topics.
With us this morning is Jacques Esculier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Uli Michel, our
Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin I would like to remind you of a few things. First, this call, webcast and presentation that we are using this morning are available on our website, webco-auto.com, under the heading WABCO June 25 conference call. A replay of this call will be available through July 25.

Second, as shown on chart 2 the presentation, certain forward-looking statements that we will make today are based on management's good-faith expectations and belief concerning future developments. As you know, actual results may differ materially from these expectations as a result of many factors, examples of which can be found in our Company's Form 10K and quarterly report.

Lastly, some of our remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are attached as an
appendix to this presentation and to our press release from this morning, both of which are posted on our website.
I will now turn the call over Jacques Esculier.

JACQUES ESCULIER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, WABCO HOLDINGS INC.: Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining this exceptional conference which should be the last platform where the fine from the European commission will be discussed and I would, therefore, say it is almost, for all of us, a celebration.

So the purpose of the call is twofold. Turning to page 3. First, we are going to discuss the final outcome of this lengthy investigation by the  European Commission. And second, we are going to provide you with an update on the evolution of our markets and you will see the favorable impact it will drive on our 2010
full-year guidance.

However, we will not today be in a position to provide you with detailed information on Q2 results. We are still in the middle of or at the tail end of June, which is one of the large months for revenues at WABCO so we are not capable of providing you with, again, the Q2 results and would not be able to provide you the details supporting the forecast on margin either. And that will be, obviously, the purpose of our usual quarterly update on results that is scheduled for this quarter on July 28.
Turning to page 4, a couple of days ago, the European Commission finally decided on the level of the
fine related to this  price-fixing cartel involving 17 companies in bathroom equipment and that was

Page 63 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
initiated back in the year 2004. I will tell you that from our perspective it was like giving birth to an elephant after a gestation of six years, or three times what it usually takes for elephants.
And I must admit the baby is not very pretty. But I want to remind you that WABCO is in no case the father. Indeed, as already stated several times, no WABCO employee has ever been involved in these alleged
infringements. We inherited this liability from American Standard, related to its Bath and Kitchen division.
The fine was allocated to WABCO as part of the restructuring of the group back in the year 2007, when we
were spun off.

The calculation of the  fine is complex and takes into account several factors, including the gravity of infringement, its duration, and leniency for cooperation. It also should in any case not be larger than 10% of the parent company's revenues the year prior to the issuance of the  fine minus the leniency factor.

Now, on June 23, the Commission announced a  fine of EUR326 million or $400 million at current exchange rate for the former American Standard group of companies and this would have to be paid by WABCO. Apparently, the calculation of the  fine drove to a much higher level, but was capped at 10% of Trane's 2009 revenues decrease by a 30% leniency factor.
We believe that this  fine is excessive and that we should have solid reasons to launch an appeal which
can take two to four years. In the meantime, WABCO will pay this  fine using existing cash and credit lines,
as Uli will share with you in a moment.

But this closes this painful period of time of uncertainty and even though we do not like the amount, we welcome this long-delayed decision.

Turning to slide 5. As already mentioned, we have an opportunity to appeal and we believe to have ample grounds to do so. Among others, I would say that the Commission seems to have overstated the importance and the efficiency of what they call a  cartel.

We do not believe that ultimately end customers were really penalized by involved practices. We were also surprised that the Commission would not provide us with more leniency given that American Standard was the first company to provide precious information related to the ceramics business.

Finally, the Commission has decided to retroactively apply the new and much more severe guidelines released in 2006, which we believe breaches fundamental principles of law. The cost of appeal is estimated at below $1 million and the final decision on this appeal would be taken in the next days or next weeks, after the receipt of the full documents from the Commission.

We will now drive you through the timeline of payments, the liquidity update, as well as our initial view of the resulting capital structure. Uli?

ULI MICHEL, CFO, WABCO HOLDINGS INC.: Thanks again, Jacques. Good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining our call to allow us to discuss the EC  fine and provide an update on our business and guidance. As Jacques mentioned, I will go through an overview of the timeline related to the  fine and update you on our liquidity position and capital structure.

Chart 6 outlines the sequence of events related to the  European Commission fine. As you can see, the clock will start ticking with the receipt of the formal full tax decision, which we expect to receive within the next week. The payment to the Commission is not due until 90 days thereafter. However, our indemnification and cooperation agreement with Trane requires us to pay the amount into an escrow account 30 days before. From there, it will be released to the Commission when due.

The deadline for the appeal is two months and 10 days after receipt of the formal decision. By then, it has to be filed with the General Court in Luxembourg.

The first level of appeal should take two to four years and it is probably the one with the highest chances of success. Should our request be denied, though, we still have a second level of appeal with the European Court of Justice, which could take us another two to four years.

The last appeal can be made to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The grounds, which would allow an appeal in Strasbourg, are limited though. For now, we are prepared to fund the escrow account and decide on the appeal by September.

Turning to chart 7, I will walk you through the various components that make up our liquidity and, ultimately, what our liquidity position looks like after funding the  fine. I've denominated all the amounts on the slide in both US dollars and euros, using a foreign exchange rate of EUR1 equaling $1.2275.


Page 64 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The first three gray-shaded boxes contain balances and data as you know it from our Q1 10Q. In the fourth blue shaded box, we have summarized the Q1 liquidity position, added the estimated development in Q2 and deducted the amount of the  fine which then shows you the remaining liquidity.
Starting with our cash position as of March 31, we had a total cash balance of $346 million, $297 million or
EUR242 million, of which were deposited in euro-denominated bank accounts in Europe, largely at
short-term deposits. The remaining $49 million represent cash balances around the globe of also readily
available funds. This structure mitigates the exchange exposure associated with the  fine and keeps the
cash concentrated and readily available to pay the  fine.

We can now move to our $800 million credit agreement. As we have disclosed, and also told you on previous calls, this facility is restricted by EBITDA covenants, which essentially allows us indebtedness of three times trailing four quarters EBITDA -- indebtedness and adjusted EBITDA, both as defined in our credit agreement.

At the end of the first quarter, we had total permitted indebtedness under this covenant of $426 million. In essence, a trailing four quarters of adjusted EBITDA of $142 million, multiplied by the factor of 3. Our existing indebtedness at March 31 was $166 million, which when deducted from our total permitted indebtedness translated into the remaining amount available under the credit agreement of $260 million.

We expect continued improvement in our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement throughout the remainder of 2010, as we continue to deliver strong operating performance results. The biggest improvement will be in Q2. In the trailing four-quarter covenant calculations, we will be dropping last year's weakest quarter and be heading a much stronger Q2 2010.
As a reminder, Q2 2009 had adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million. And last quarter, i.e., Q1 2010, we reported
US$56.1 million. This should give you a good sense.

Moving on to the third component of our liquidity position, we have $62 million of proceeds from the sale of accounts receivables under our asset securitization program executed in April. It should also be noted that funding under this program is not considered indebtedness under our credit agreement and does, therefore, not reduce the available funding under the credit agreement.

Now, looking to our expected liquidity position as of Q2, you can see that we had total liquidity available to us in the amount of $668 million at the end of the first quarter. We expect EBITDA improvement and free cash flow to increase our overall liquidity position to the tune of $150 million in Q2. This would result in about $818 million of available liquidity prior to funding the EC  fine.

So even after taking into account the funding of the  fine, we will still have approximately $418 million of additional liquidity available to us. And as expressed before, we do expect this amount to increase further in the coming quarters.

In summary, this should give you confidence that under our existing credit agreements, we are very well-positioned and have ample amount of liquidity left after payment of the  fine in order to fund our continued operations and future growth of the Company.

Turning to chart 8, let's now look at our capital structure, subsequent to the EC  fine. In terms of funding the fine we expect to use EUR230 million or $282 million of our cash balance plus an additional drawdown of EUR96 million or $118 million from our credit facility. After payment of the  fine, we will have a foundation
for our capital structure that will remain very solid.

Our bank debt will be in the range of $285 million. And the funding of our asset securitization program around $65 million. We will have ample room under our bank covenant with regard to our debt and interest expense ratios.

Once we incorporate our other liabilities, such as unfunded pensions, remaining streamlining payments and indemnification obligations, we feel that our leverage remains at very sound levels. Based on our expected debt levels after payment of the EC  fine, we will not need to raise additional funds nor do we
need to refinance our existing favorable $800 million credit facility in the near term. It will only expire in May
2012.

We do believe that taking into consideration factors such as the strong condition of our balance sheet, our ability to generate cash, as well as the elimination of the prolonged uncertainty related to the EC  fine provides WABCO a platform to tap into a wide array of both capital raisings and re-financing instruments if and when opportune. This will naturally include the opportunity to spread the maturity profile of our funding sources.

In our opinion, the overall environment, the operating costs provide us prudent leverage ratios and, we believe, our debt levels are appropriate and allow for the necessary flexibility.
Now I will turn it back to Jacques who will discuss our global market and updated guidance. Jacques? JACQUES ESCULIER: Thanks, Uli. Just turning to page 9, we are providing you with an update on the way
we see the market dynamics during the remainder of the year. Starting with Europe, that sees a pretty nice
upgrade in the forecast of the production increase versus 2009.
First of all, I would like to start by saying that our order book related to European manufacturers of truck
and bus has increased steadily since the beginning of the year. But more specifically since the last time we
talked two months ago, it had gone up, up to 22%.

Also, we have finally kind of reconciled all the data for 2009, realizing that the inventory impact of having built inventory last year that they had -- within 2008, early 2009, that we had to [melt] down during the last
12 months has actually impacted the production level in 2009 by 30%. We had said last time 20 to 25. Actually it's up to 30%.

We are right now at the conclusion that 72,000 trucks were pulled from inventory in 2009. And again, total production was 240, so calculation drives to a 30% impact.

And we still believe that there will be an increase in demand both from domestic as well as export markets that will drive another additional 10% of production. So altogether, we are actually upgrading our forecast for European production from 30% we achieved back in May to 40% now.

Looking at North America, actually, we don't see too much of a change. There is still a very strong recovery in freight demand. The fleet is aging, but we think that the strong growth in demand will probably start showing up in the last quarter in 2010 or in the early part of 2011. And we keep seeing an increase year over year of 10% production in 2010.
Moving to China, actually we are realizing that the production of trucks in China, in the second quarter of
2010, could actually be even higher than what we had experienced in the first quarter. I remind you, we
had some 390,000 trucks, record level for truck and bus built, and we anticipate that it could reach actually
over 400,000 trucks in Q2.

The demand for trucks is obviously still very strong domestically. And we still anticipate though, that in the second half of the year, there will be a certain slowdown in the number of trucks built which, overall, for the year drives a forecast of 20% increase versus 2009 in the overall truck and bus production for China. And, again, it's great because two months ago we shared with you a forecast of only 10%.

India, we just have to actually slightly lower our expectation. At the end of the fourth quarter of last year, at the very beginning of the year, we had anticipated a 20% growth year over year, we had brought that up to
50% because the first quarter was very upbeat. The way we look at it right now, we would decrease it slightly to 40% overall for the year, which is still a very impressive and strong number.

Turning to page 10, and looking at Japan/Korea. Again, this is a market where Q2 seems to confirm actually a slightly stronger recovery than anticipated a couple of months ago. And we would upgrade our forecast for that region to 30% versus the 25% that we had shared with you in May.

Same thing with Brazil. We are adding 5% because the second quarter was particularly strong. It's actually, we think that Brazil we have built close to 60,000 trucks versus 51,000 in the first quarter. So we have great forecast for the whole year at 35% versus 30%.

We still think that aftermarket will produce a solid 15% increase year over year. And we have a nice upgrade on the trailer forecast, which was anticipated two months ago to grow by 25%, upgrading it to 40% for the year 2010, again as of today.

Turning to page 11, this leads us to one more time to review our guidance. Before we enter into the numbers, I would like to point out the fact that there is a severe change in the overall exchange rate euro to US dollars. The previous guidance was based on an exchange rate of $1.37 and this one is based on a more updated exchange rate of $1.28 for the year.

So, whereas we had anticipated a year-over-year sales increase of 23% to 28% two months ago, we have upgraded this bracket to 30 to 35% with an operating -- with a performance at the operating margin level also upgraded from 6.5% to 8.5% bracket to an 8% to 9% bracket, leading to a performance EPS upgrade from $1.40 to $1.80 to $1.75 to $2.05 per share. And we consistently remain with the free cash flow conversion of objective of 80% to 90%, as we are excluding obviously streamlining and separation interest. So overall, a pretty healthy update in our forecast for our 2010 financial results.

Page 66 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Then turning to the last page, in conclusion, I would say that, first, we have finally closed this chapter involving the European Commission and this long-delayed decision. [Now if] the largest uncertainty that we had inherited from American Standard, and meanwhile, we continue to see most of our markets around the world developing increasingly favorably and this means that we have even better conditions today to perform and now we can more -- we more than ever can unleash the real and full power of our business.
So this closes our presentation. Thank you. And they will now turn to the Q&A session. Operator. OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Robert Kosowsky of Sidoti & Company.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY, ANALYST, SIDOTI & COMPANY: Good morning, guys. Just one first clarification question. Did you say this  fine came in at the 10% of Trane's 2009 revenue?
JACQUES ESCULIER: Yes.

ROBERT KOSOWSKY: And then can you talk about the history of, I guess, the -- some successes that have gone through the appeals process? And have you looked at the history and what kind of reductions have occurred historically?

JACQUES ESCULIER: First of all, it is a high  fine overall and we think that, again, the Commission could have applied a larger leniency factor. But it doesn't seem overall that the leniency factors were as strong and as large as they have historically been.

For example, the second company that provided support and provided information to the Commission only got 30% as well. Usually they get -- historically, have gotten 50%.

Now to be fair, answering kind of going back to your first question, the cap of the  fine that kind of -- you know, at the end identified the level that we would have to pay was calculated based on Trane revenues only. Obviously, a couple of years ago it could have been -- it should have been calculated on the entire consolidated American Standard revenue base. And one could have considered that the Commission could have revealed the American Standard's revenues at the end of 2009, as well, and could have then applied an even more aggressive level of  fine.

So I think, overall, we have to try, and obviously, again, we'll do what is appropriate to do to challenge that level. But I think we have been successful, at least, to get that cap of 10% calculated on a fair basis including only revenues from Trane.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Okay. And is this  fine going to be tax-deductible, do you think? JACQUES ESCULIER: Ulrich?
ULI MICHEL: Well. We will take the position as a deduction on the tax return of the legal entity that will indemnify. But I said this before, that we do have a significant net operating loss carryforward already in this legal entity which are covered with valuation reserve. So you do not see a benefit on our -- in our P&L on the expense of the  fine.

ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Okay. And then just one question about the actual business. Can you describe what you would be looking for in acquisitions, what size of companies you would be looking for now that the fine is past you and the, I guess, experience that the management team has in terms of acquisition integrations?

JACQUES ESCULIER: Well, as part of the normal growth strategies that we continuously update and upgrade on, there are smaller bolt-on tactical acquisitions that are in the pipeline currently. A couple of them we missed because we couldn't, obviously, invest and acquire companies prior to being free of this liability.

Now we are going to be, obviously, free to do what seems to be in the best interest of the Company and, certainly, the shareholders. I would say that right now what we are contemplating is more of a smaller size, nothing really transformational.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Thank you and congratulations on getting this past you. OPERATOR: David Leiker of Robert W. Baird.
KEITH SCHICKER, ANALYST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & COMPANY, INC.: Good morning, it is Keith Schicker on the line for David. If we look at priorities with your free cash flow now that the  fine is behind you, we just spoke about acquisitions, but can you talk about how share repurchases and dividends fit into that bucket? I mean, do you have a priority? Do you think you can be better off reinvesting the cash in your business in terms of growth? How do you think about those three things?
Page 67 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JACQUES ESCULIER: Well, I will first say and go back to what Uli said, we believe fundamentally that we have an adequate capital structure right now to support the growth that we see ahead of us, as well as to take a fairly prudent position, which I think is appropriate today, given the uncertainty that we still see in the overall economic recovery across the world. So I think at that time, we do not want to aggressively return cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.

That is obviously a reflection that we will have to further drive. We are going to have to discuss it with our Board probably in October and, obviously, we are going to revise our position systematically as things evolve, whether for the better or for worse in the overall economy. Uli, do you want to make any further comment?

ULI MICHEL: No, I think what we said is we want to keep some flexibility. And I think you said it all, Jacques.

JACQUES ESCULIER: Yes. No, I think when you look at the leverage ratios and discussing it with some bankers, for a company of our size it seems to be a fairly good, strong, solid position to be in, at this point. And I don't think it would be reasonable to stretch the leverage excessively.

We think about the number of companies that had to raise equity in the last month. And obviously we certainly want to stay away from these, particularly when you are [ready we think] to just kind of pay your bills.

KEITH SCHICKER: And then when you look at the demand increase in Europe, you mentioned both domestic and export demand. Is one of those factors stronger than the other?

And then, also, it doesn't appear based on what you are saying today that the issues with the sovereign debt in Greece are having any impact. Can you just give us your thoughts on that and then the domestic versus export demand?

JACQUES ESCULIER: It seems that there is probably a little bit more weight of the export versus domestic demand that built this 10% that we have forecasted overall for the number of trucks in demand, 2010
versus '09. You know, the latest update for the May registration in Western Europe actually came out today, which shows a fairly flat level versus April.

And concerning debts, this idea that it should be slowly improving but at a fairly low level, you know, a fairly low rate. And I think we could expect some increase, but not dramatic increase.

Now, you look at the order book of the German manufactures -- which is the only number we really have access to on a regular basis -- you look at their orders for domestic usage, which is Germany, for them it's German. You look at the last two months, it went up 10 to 15%. Now that is only reflective of demand in Germany. But at least it shows that an important country like Germany has seen an increase of 10 to 15% in the last couple of months, which really departs from the logic that we have seen since the beginning of
2008, where demand for domestic trucks in Germany was basically flat.
So the exports for those manufacturers has increased actually even more strongly. Now exports for them
is, again, not exports out of Europe, it is exports outside of Germany. So it covers other Western European
countries.

But you look at Germany, you look at this strong increase in exports to the rest of Europe and, obviously, to countries outside of Europe, I think it kind of supports the fact that, at least, this financial crisis or financial situation with the state debt in Europe has not severely impacted demand.
KEITH SCHICKER: That's all I had. Thank you very much.
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Martin Sankey of Neuberger Berman.

MARTIN SANKEY, ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN, LLC: My question has to do with the fiscal 2010 guidance. Could you, perhaps, disaggregate for us the impact of stronger fundamental business versus the decline of the euro within the guidance?

ULI MICHEL: Yes, I think if you look at it, the best place is -- if you just look at our guidance and equal exchange rate. If you looked at the slides last time, we told you it was going to be up 23 to 28% and that is always at equal exchange rates.

So now we are up 30 to 35% at equal exchange rates. So we have added 7% and this is the fundamental growth. Right?

Then there is, of course, the decline on the exchange rate when you translate our sales. So last time, the average for the year came out at $1.37. Now we have $1.28 which is the combination of basically five
Page 68 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
months of actuals and then the remaining (sic) of the year, we forecasted I think at $1.227 which is very close to the current rate.

I think this should give you a good idea of what's FX and what is underlying growth. And then if you look into Jacques's pages on the different regions, you can see the weight of each region.

JACQUES ESCULIER: We rightfully the exchange rate dropping euro versus dollar meaning that it has a certain positive impact on the market.

Right. And what we said is, and what I think I shared with you during our last meeting is that, at this point, we don't think in dollars, the euro moving against all other currencies has an impact at the bottom. It has an impact at the top of about 60% of whatever move we see in the currency exchange rate.

So I leave it up to you to figure out given the -- what Uli just presented to you -- 37 to 28, $1.37 to $1.28 -- to kind of look at what the impact will be on the margin level.
MARTIN SANKEY: And the same output applied for performance EPS as well?

ULI MICHEL: Yes, because it is fall-through obviously. But I would tell you, hopefully, that what we said on performance EPS is that at the end, we will not be -- if the euro weakens or strengthens to all currencies, it doesn't hurt us much at (multiple speakers). At the earnings-per-share. So there is an offset between the two.

JACQUES ESCULIER: So yes, but I would say obviously a strong portion of this increase is obviously driven by a fairly significant upgrade of the top line as well. Which is, again, clean of any foreign exchange. As we said, the percentage is obviously to same exchange rate.

MARTIN SANKEY: Right. Okay. Could you go through with us the accounting for the  fine? I presume it will be accrued against second-quarter earnings?

JACQUES ESCULIER: Yes, we will accrue it in the second quarter. It will be other non-operating expense and it will stay or we would call it another liability at this point. It will not be an accrual. We know the amount. We know when it is due and then in the third quarter we will pay it.

MARTIN SANKEY: Right. And since the  fine is not tax-deductible and I see that in the reconciliation, you are going to (multiple speakers).

JACQUES ESCULIER: Just to be clear, what we said is we will claim it as a deduction on our tax return, but since we already have net operating loss carryforwards in this legal entity, against we have a valuation allowance, we cannot record another benefit from it in our P&L.
So that is why you don't see anything. It hits the P&L as if it were not tax-deductible.

MARTIN SANKEY: Okay, so my point is that a $400 million charge against earnings translates to a $400 million reduction in shareholder equity. And so at least from a published financial statement point of view, the Company is -- will have a debt to capital ratio somewhat of approximately 50% or so. Which, I agree, is solid, but is that a constrict -- do you view that as a constraint upon the Company's ability to repurchase shares at some point?

JACQUES ESCULIER: I think this is one of the ratios rating agencies and people who lend us money would look at, but for me this is not the most decisive. I mean, you know, the equity also contains at the end goodwill and so on. It is one of the factors that are taken into consideration, but I don't think it's a very limiting one.
At least I hadn't, you know as we had discussed with bankers and so on and the potential impact of the
fine before, it was never brought up to me as a real big constraining factor, the fact that the  fine will reduce
our book, book equity.
MARTIN SANKEY: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Ted Wheeler of Buckingham Research.

TED WHEELER, ANALYST, BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH GROUP: I wondered if you could just add a little color to the commentary on the aftermarket? You mentioned May results in Europe, or April/May in Europe. I'm just wondering if there has been any movement? I know you didn't change your guidance, but I guess I want a little more color on just what is happening in the aftermarket?

JACQUES ESCULIER: Again, we don't want to go into detail of Q2. The only thing I can tell you is what we have seen so far in Q2 is just kind of supporting our view of the world as of the beginning of Q2 and doesn't
Page 69 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
change our forecast for the year. So that's the only thing I can tell you. I don't think -- we don't see anything dramatically better or dramatically worse.
TED WHEELER: Yes. First quarter was north of 20%, I think, right? In gross.

JACQUES ESCULIER: It was 27%, but when you are taking out the impact of India, that had not been consolidated yet by Q2 2009, it was 19%.

ULI MICHEL: And in June we started consolidating India. So from June forward we lose this or that - the comps are less favorable year over year.
Ted Wheeler. And thus, the 15 includes the brief period of India in there, right? ULI MICHEL: Yes.
TED WHEELER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Kosowsky.

ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Two other questions. First, do you plan on working through August, like through the usual vacation shutdowns?

JACQUES ESCULIER: You know we are a global company, so vacations mean something in our fiscal year, but not for other regions in the world. And it doesn't mean the same thing for all facilities. I would tell you that Hannover, for example, more people are on vacation in July than they are in August. Overall, we are not shutting down sites, you know, at all this year.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Whereas in a normal year, historically, would you have shut down a site or two? JACQUES ESCULIER: I don't think -- last year, I think last year we may actually (multiple speakers) for a
week. No, we -- otherwise we never do. Because people stagger vacations usually in Europe. Otherwise,
beaches would be a little too crowded.

So overall, there are more people on vacation in July probably in Hannover, in Germany, there are more people on vacations in August, in France or other countries. So but overall they are always -- you know, people, we have people staying at home to keep running the business given the fact that, in addition, in [parlance] some of our customers are shutting their doors.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Then, just back of the envelope math, it seems like your incremental margins in
2010 are going to be somewhere in the 30% range which is higher than what you had mentioned
previously in a low 20, like about 23%. So if my math is right, I guess, is that true? And secondly, what
does that tell us about 2011 and '12 incremental margins?

JACQUES ESCULIER: Number one, when we had shared with you the 23%, it was under the assumption that we would be south of 20% in terms of growth. So now we have upgraded the growth expectations to above 30%. And that has definitely a favorable impact on incremental margin.

And last, during the last call, when we had this last update, the last update on this incremental growth, we had mentioned about 25% of incremental margin and we're 23%, 28% growth now. We add 5% or you know, kind of 7%. So it will put it even further to -- further closer to 30%, for sure.

Now what we have said is, obviously, you remember we had this $24 million of OpEx cost that we had to reinstate, which we had to add about $10 million of incremental AIP, because we will probably perform better than expected and the bonus for people will be higher than normal. And then we had added a few million dollars of additional investments which today kind of comes between $5 million to $10 million.

So all that is part of this incremental margin. That would lead to expect that if we would reproduce this type of growth next year, we should definitely be solidly north of 30%.
ROBERT KOSOWSKY: Thank you very much.
OPERATOR: We have no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference back to
Jacques Esculier for any further remarks.

JACQUES ESCULIER: Thank you again for joining us with short notice today and I certainly look forward to our next interface on the 20th of July for the Q2 final results. Thanks and have a good day. Bye-bye.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great weekend. Thank you.

German sanitary ware and crockery producer Villeroy & Boch said it will take action against the  European
Commission which has decided to  fine the company for  price fixing.
Almut Haehner-Ural, spokeswoman for Villeroy & Boch, told news agency DPA on Thursday that the  fine
was not justified.

TD
Villeroy & Boch has to pay EUR 71.5 million, as it was accused of fixing prices of  bathroom equipment in the years 1994 to 2004 with 16 other companies.
The total amount of the  fine the European Commission has imposed on all 17 companies stands at
EUR 622 million.

Regulation - The European Commission has pulled the plug on a  cartel involving 17 bathroomfi ttings companies accused of price-fixing.
And it's taken a plunger to their pockets, fining them a total of 622 million euros ($796 million Cdn)
for colluding on prices for toilets, taps and tubs.

TD
Ideal Standard received the biggest single  fine, 326 million euros, while Villeroy & Boch was  fined
71 million euros.

The companies should have seen the swirly coming --the commission started looking into wrongdoing six years ago, raiding the offices of  bathroom products makers in five European countries back in 2004.
Three years ago it sent official objections to a number of companies.

The price-fixing meetings took place at trade association conferences, with more than 200 meetings occurring between 1992 and 2004, the commission said.

(Adds ArcelorMittal shares, lawyer comment) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators will this week  fine steel companies, including world leader ArcelorMittal , for operating a  cartel, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.

In October 2008, the  European Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, charged several companies with illegally fixing prices. The unidentified companies make wire rods used in prestressing steel for constructing balconies and foundation piles.

"The prestressed steel  cartel (fining) decision will be on Wednesday," one person familiar with the process said.

ArcelorMittal said in February 2009 the  European Commission had investigated three of its units and two former units for possible anti-competitive behaviour.
ArcelorMittal declined to comment on Monday.
The company has said it will indemnify the current owners of Emesa and Galycas, which it sold in
2004, from any possible  fine. ArcelorMittal shares were up 2.5 percent by 1506 GMT, outperforming a
1.9 percent rise in the Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources index <.SXPP>.

The EU executive's so-called statement of objections or charge sheet listed around 40 companies, with many of them based in Italy, Spain and Austria, the second person said.

The Commission, which can  fine companies up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaching EU rules, is expected to reduce the penalties for crisis-hit companies.

Antitrust lawyers say the regulator needs to strike a balance between promoting competition and punishing offenders.

"If the endgame is all about increased competition, it would be perverse to levy a  fine of such magnitude that it would result in market exit and greater market consolidation," said Peter Alexiadis, a partner at Gibson Dunn.

"Having said that, would anyone be surprised if that argument were to be more often cited -- and better received -- at a time of serious economic recession?" he said.

Last week, the watchdog cut  fines by between 25 percent to 50 percent for five companies charged in a bathroom fittings cartel because of their financial difficulties. (Editing by Luke Baker and David Cowell)

HD      Commission fines 17 bathroom fittings manufacturers and refines its inability to pay policy
BY       SJ Berwin's EU & Competition Team

The European Commission (the "Commission") continues to take a strong stance against
anti-competitive practices fining seventeen companies within the  bathroom fittings market a total of
€622 million. The  cartel operated for 12 years (between 1992 and 2004), across six EU countries:
Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France and The Netherlands, affecting businesses, such as builders
and plumbers, as well as consumers.

The Commission found the seventeen companies (Artweger, Cisal, Dornbracht, Duravit, Duscholux, Grohe, Hansa, Ideal Standard, Kludi, Mamoli, Masco, Roca, RAF, Sanitec, Teorema, Villeroy & Boch, and Zucchetti) had participated in anti-competitive practices by fixing prices and rebates and exchanging
sensitive information in the market for baths, sinks, taps and other  bathroom fittings. There were over a hundred different  price fixing  discussions which took place at trade association meetings within the countries concerned, as well as through bilateral contracts.

TD
The Commission found the practices were in breach of Article 101 of the TFEU and has imposed maximum fines of 10% of annual worldwide turnover on several companies. The highest individual  fine was imposed on Ideal Standard of €326 million. The high  fines reflect in particular the extensive 12 year duration of the  cartel.   Masco, a U.S company, received full immunity in return for "blowing the whistle" on the cartel under the Commission's leniency policy.

At the same time however, the Commission acknowledges that some companies within this sector are in financial difficulties. The Commission states that it has 'refined' its policy on inability to pay claims and that imposing a  fine that would provoke a company's bankruptcy is not in line with its competition policy - given it would eliminate a player from the market place.

In this case, the Commission received ten inability to pay requests however only five of these were successful (three companies received a 50% reduction and two a reduction of 30%). The companies that received a reduction were not named in order to keep their financial problems confidential. Competition Commissioner Almunia added that reductions are only granted in the most exceptional circumstances following a detailed company specific financial assessment.  The Commission will for example, look at
the company's financial statements (including current and future year projections) as well as its profitability, solvency and liquidity.

The Commission has stressed that its assessment of the requests for inability to pay reductions has been objective and even handed, although whether this will be sufficient to fend off potential appeals to the European Courts on unequal treatment grounds from those companies who did not receive a reduction remains to be seen.

HD      EU/UK Competition Law Newsletter,  July 2010 - EU Cartel Fines; Ability to Pay Becomes Highly
Relevant
BY       Matthew Hall WC      1,052 words PD       7 July 2010

On June 23, 2010, the  European Commission recognized that even its flagship policy (the fight against cartels) must take into account the financial crisis. In adopting a decision fining 17  bathroom equipment manufacturers a total of EUR 622 million for a 12-year  cartel covering six EU countries, the Commission took into account that five of the companies were financially in "very bad shape already," and accordingly reduced the levels of their  fines to "a level they should be able to pay." This approach is referred to in the Commission's 2006 guidelines on  fines, but only now has it become of real practical relevance.

TD
Of the 17 companies, 10 claimed they would be unable to pay, but the Commission found that only half of these claims were justified. This required a case-by-case analysis of financial statements and projections, profitability, solvency and liquidity, as well as the relations between the companies and their banks and shareholders, and "the social and economic context of each company" (which would appear to leave a wide discretion). The justification for reductions in  fines, where appropriate, is that pushing a company into bankruptcy would inevitably reduce competition.
A further illustration of the new importance of this ability-to-pay analysis was provided by the June 30,
2010, decision of the Commission in which it  fined 17 producers of prestressing steel a total of more than
EUR 518 million. Three of the  fines were reduced by inability-to-pay arguments, albeit a further 10
companies had these applications denied. Also of importance in this decision was the finding that two
companies did not fulfill their obligations to cooperate as leniency applicants, and therefore did not
receive any reduction in their  fines.

European Commission Commitments Procedure Approved by European Court of Justice

In a judgment described by the Commission as "very important," on June 29, 2010, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the Commission's use of commitments to settle competition law investigations.

The case arose out of the Commission's 2006 decision to accept De Beers' (the world's largest rough diamond producer) offer of commitments to progressively phase out by 2009 purchases of rough diamonds from Alrosa (the world's second largest rough diamond producer). This ended an investigation of De Beers under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position in the EU).

The essence of the ECJ's judgment is that the commitments procedure is voluntary and accordingly cannot be compared with a case in which the Commission imposes remedies on a party: "undertakings which offer commitments consciously accept that the concessions they make may go beyond what the Commission could itself impose on them in a decision adopted by it." It had not been shown that the commitments manifestly went beyond what was necessary to address the concerns expressed by the Commission.

The Commission will be relieved by this judgment, as it has been making very wide use of the commitments procedure to settle cases, and it has become an important tool in its armory.
UK Directors Face Further Compliance Challenges

On June 29, 2010, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published revised guidance on director disqualification orders in competition law cases, signaling its intent to use these sanctions to deter

anticompetitive activity. In a statement, the OFT said, "[the] guidance should be taken as a clear message that we will actively seek disqualification of directors found to have engaged in anti-competitive behavior or who ought have known it was going on" (emphasis added). The intention is to increase the incentives on UK directors to take responsibility for competition law compliance by their companies.

The guidance sets out how and when the OFT and certain UK sectoral regulators will take action to disqualify directors where they uncover evidence a director was responsible for, or ought to have known of, competition law breaches at a company. The nature of the breach is relevant and action is "more likely . . . in cases involving more serious breaches" (which principally means cartels).

Under the UK Company Directors Disqualification Act, a director can be disqualified from acting as a director for up to 15 years if his company is involved in a breach of competition law and the court considers that he is unfit to be concerned in the management of a company as a result.

It can be noted that the OFT's specific powers to seek a disqualification order for infringements of competition law have never been used. The three individuals convicted in June 2008 of the UK  cartel offence for their involvement in the marine hose  cartel were disqualified from acting as directors under the general powers available to UK courts in relation to directors who have committed a criminal offence.

Although concerning anticorruption, it is further interesting to note that the new UK Bribery Act 2010 has also increased the compliance difficulties faced by directors of UK companies. That act (which has a wide extraterritorial scope) includes a strict liability offence with unlimited  fines for commercial organizations of failing to prevent bribery being committed. It is a defense for the company to show that it has put in place "adequate procedures" (which is undefined but will no doubt include competition law-type compliance programs) designed to prevent persons associated with the company from undertaking corrupt activities.

These developments provide further illustrations, as if they were needed, of the ever-increasing importance of compliance programs and training covering competition law and corruption issues in the UK.

HD      Reduction of Fines - Economic recession - Not at the Commission - Cartel fines cross €1.4 billion at the end of June 2010

Originally published 6 July 2010
Keywords: EU competition law, cartels, ITP applications,

TD
The financial crisis has not too surprisingly increased the number of applications claiming inability to pay ("ITP") the  fines imposed by the European Commission ("Commission"). Firms reeling from the effects of the downturn in the market find it difficult to pay for breaches of EU competition law. Condemning cartels engaged in by some of the  bathroom equipment manufacturers and prestressing steel producers, the Commission adopted  fines but allowed some of the ITP applications by granting reductions in  fines. However the difficulty involved in satisfying the criteria for upholding such claims of ITP and the high
fines imposed are a reminder to companies that cutting corners is not an option even during a financial crisis.

The EU's Fining Guidelines of 2006 contain only a single paragraph relating to ITP applications. It states that such a relief would be granted only on the basis of objective evidence that would prove that imposition of the  fine would irretrievably jeopardise the economic viability of the undertaking after taking into account its specific social and economic context.

In the bathroom equipment manufacturers  cartel dated 23 June 2010 there were seventeen companies involved and ten ITP applications had been submitted. In view of their difficult financial situations the fines relating to three companies were reduced by 50% and  fines relating to two were reduced by 25%. Seventeen producers were  fined in the prestressing steel producers  cartel decision dated 30 June 2010
and the Commission had received 13 ITP applications. The Commission granted reductions of 25%, 50%
and 75% respectively to three companies.

Although the Commission has not published a revised guideline in relation to its fining policy, in the press release accompanying the decisions (the non-confidential version of which has not been published) it has attempted to provide some clarity as to the evidence that would be considered when assessing ITP applications. In addition to the social and economic context of individual companies involved it would inter alia include evidence relating to:
Financial statements for recent years;
Provisional current year statements and future projections;
Financial ratios that measure a company's solidity, profitability, solvency and liquidity; Relations with banks and shareholders;
Claims of significant loss of value of the company's assets were it to be liquidated as a result of the  fine.

In a recent speech, the European Commissioner for Competition Joaquín Almunia has assured that the Commission would not want to provoke a company's bankruptcy and that claims of ITP would be carefully assessed. He has also made it clear the substantial  fines are necessary to preserve the deterrence aspect of the  fines.

In France, on 19 January 2010, the Paris Court of Appeal reduced a €575 million  fine imposed by the French Competition Authority on steel companies involved in  cartel activities (some being also involved in the EU pre-stressing steel case) to less than €72 million (approximately). One of the grounds for grant of reduction was that the Authority had failed to consider the major effect that the economic crisis had on the steel industry. In the UK too, the position regarding claims of ITP is under review, with a number of appeals pending before the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The appeals have been launched against the decision of the OFT in September 2009 levying  fines totalling £129.2 million for bid-rigging in the construction sector.

If there was any doubt that Commissioner Joaquín Almunia may be more lenient than his predecessor, it has been dispelled with  cartel fines crossing €1.4 billion at the half year mark when the total  fines imposed in 2009 was €1.6 billion. As to ITP applications at the time of an economic crisis it seems that the Commissioner might agree with the following statement of Neelie Kroes, Former Commissioner for Competition:

"If we were to encourage cartelists and others at this point we would be guaranteeing disaster... No-one wins – today's softness is tomorrow's nightmare."

HD      Competition Bill Introduced in Hong Kong

On July 2, 2010, after several years of drafting and public consultation, Hong Kong unveiled its draft competition bill. The bill, which will be introduced in the legislature on July 14, 2010, would prohibit anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices, as well as any abuse of a "significant" market position that has the purpose or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in Hong Kong. The proposed legislation also creates a competition commission to investigate complaints and bring public enforcement proceedings, as well as a competition tribunal to adjudicate cases. As currently drafted, the bill does not include comprehensive merger procedures, though there is a merger rule that would apply only to licensees in the telecommunications industry. If enacted, the legislation would be implemented in 2012.
Federal Agencies Continue Focusing on Competition in Agriculture Markets

TD
On June 25, 2010, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Agriculture held their third joint public workshop on competition and regulation in the agriculture sector. This workshop focused on issues in the dairy industry. Earlier workshops concentrated on grain farming and hog production, and the poultry industry. Two additional workshops are scheduled for this year.

On June 18, 2010, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced proposed changes to the Packers and Stockyards Act, which regulates the livestock and poultry industries. Under the new regulations, which were published June 22, 2010, a meat producer would no longer be required to prove harm to competition when bringing a claim about anticompetitive conduct, and limitations would be placed on poultry growing arrangements, swine production contracts, and how meatpackers obtain cattle on the open market. Public comments on the proposed rules will be accepted through Aug. 23, 2010.

European Commission Reduces Cartel Fines Citing Economic Conditions

The European Commission has recently taken into account that current economic conditions may significantly limit a company's ability to pay a cartel fine. On June 23, 2010, the commission reduced the fines of five companies that had participated in a bathroom equipment manufacturers  cartel to "a level they should be able to pay," after acknowledging that the companies were financially in "very bad shape already." On June 30, 2010, the commission reduced the  fines of three companies that participated in a prestressing steel producers  cartel based on their inability-to-pay arguments. Additional information is available in our July 2010 EU/UK Competition Law Newsletter.
