BERLIN (AP) - The European  Commission intends to  fine the German subsidiary of General Motors
Corp, Adam  Opel AG, for illegal sales practices, a newspaper reported.

The Hamburg-based Financial Times Deutschland, in a report to appear Wednesday, said the  fine would be levied Wednesday, although the amount was not yet clear.

TD
Based on evidence collected during three raids in 1996, the  commission determined that  Opel's Dutch subsidiary, the Dutch importer of Adam  Opel AG, and GM worked together to prevent foreign customers from buying cars in the Netherlands to take back to their home country, the report said.
Because automakers price their cars differently in individual countries, the cost in the Netherlands for a
new Opel can be as much as 20 percent less than in neighboring Germany. While the companies frown on
cross-border purchases, trying to stop them would violate European Union free trade rules.
In July, the European Court of Justice on July 6 let stand a penalty of 90 million euros (dlrs 77.4 million) on
German carmaker Volkswagen for forcing its Italian dealers not to sell to foreigners looking for a lower
price than they could get at home.
It was the largest  fine the European  Commission had ever imposed on a company. Volkswagen filed an appeal this week, the Financial Times Deutschland said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union  fined the Dutch importer of General Motors Corp.'s  Opel cars 43 million euros (dlrs 36.5 million) Wednesday for telling its dealers not to sell to foreigners from countries where Opels cost more than in the Netherlands.

"The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits" of the EU single market, the European  Commission said in statement.

TD
The Commission said an investigation, begun in 1996, on the strength of consumer complaints found "Opel Nederland had, from September, 1996, onwards, developed and pursued a strategy ... to restrict or to prevent dealers from selling cars to customers" in other EU nations.

Opel Nederland BV told its dealers, especially those in border areas, not to sell to foreigners shopping for a better deal than they can get at home.

The dealers were told their sales quotas applied only to sales in the Netherlands.  Opel Nederland ran several marketing campaigns between October, 1996, and January, 1998. Each "contained a provision that bonus payments would be refused if dealers carried out sales to ... consumers from abroad. Such bonus payments generally represent an important portion of a dealer's profit," the  Commission said.

It added the right to do some cross-border bargain hunting was "one of the most fundamental objectives" of the 15-nation EU.

Carmakers price their products differently in individual countries. In the Netherlands an  Opel can be 20 percent cheaper than in Germany.
The investigation into the sales practices of  Opel Nederland was not a one-off event.

In 1998, the European  Commission fined German carmaker Volkswagen 90 million euros (dlrs 77.4 million) for restricting car sales in Italy.
The EU currently is investigating the marketing practices of DaimlerChrysler AG, Peugeot, Renault and
Citroen.
The Opel probe began after the European  Commission received complaints from Germans living near the
Dutch border who could not buy an  Opel in the Netherlands.

Currently, car sales are exempt from the full weight of EU fair competition rules to safeguard some exclusive distribution contracts, provided strict conditions are fulfilled.

The Commission is to issue a report by the end of this year on whether the exemption should be retained or not

An Opel spokeswoman declined to immediately comment on the decision, but said the company would issue a statement later.
The Commission is carrying out a similar investigation into the sales practices of DaimlerChysler AG. A
decision in that case is not expected until late this year, officials said.

OPEL was fined GBP 26 million by the European  Commission today for preventing buyers from Britain and other high-price countries from snapping up cheap new cars in Holland.

The fine is the second hefty penalty against a car maker for impeding the single European market - Volkswagen was fined a record GBP 62m in 1998, which was reduced on appeal to GBP 55 million. As in the Volkswagen case, today's  fine against Opel Holland followed complaints from consumers that they were being blocked from ordering cars freely anywhere they chose in the European Union.

TD
Car buyers who wish to buy an  Opel in Britain, where they are sold under the Vauxhall badge, can expect to pay considerably more than in Holland.
Before-tax car prices in Holland are also substantially lower than in Germany and France.

Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of fair competition, described  Opel's offence as "grave" and said: "The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single market. This decision [to  fine Opel] is therefore a clear signal that competition policy serves consumers' interests."
Obstructed

Exports of new cars from Opel dealers in Holland - notably those in the Dutch border areas - had been obstructed deliberately, the commission investigation found.

A number of dealers were given direct instructions by  Opel district managers in Holland to stop all export sales, said the  commission. The dealers were told that the number of cars they were expected to sell as part of their dealer contracts should above all be sold within Holland.

From October 1996 until January 1998, the  commission explained, Opel in Holland "operated a large number of sales campaigns which each contained a provision that bonus payments would be refused if dealers carried out sales to consumers from abroad".

Such tactics violated EU laws which ban any agreements affecting trade between member states and which effectively distort competition in the European single market, the  commission statement said.

A 1995 regulation on car distribution bans manufacturers and importers from restricting consumers buying cars in the member state of their choice.

The European  Commission is expected today to  fine Adam Opel, the main European subsidiary of
General Motors of the US, for breaching EU rules on car prices and sales practices.

The Commission's move is the latest decision in a long-running investigation into car distribution practices following numerous complaints from consumers about high-priced cars, particularly in the UK.

TD
Consumers say car buyers are victims of an elaborate price-fixing cartel operated by leading manufacturers. The  Commission said it got more complaints about car pricing than anything else.

The Commission is expected to claim  Opel's Dutch subsidiary had infringed EU single market rules by refusing to sell cars to buyers from outside the Netherlands.

Opel said EU rules covering new car sales meant it did not have to sell cars to unauthorised dealers who planned to resell them in other parts of the EU. The company also indicated that it was likely to appeal against any  fine imposed by Brussels.

The EU's antitrust regulator imposed a  fine on Volkswagen of Euros 102m ( #63m) in a similar case where the group was found to have stopped non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy.

Last year Commission officials raided Peugeot's Paris headquarters as well as administrative offices in the Netherlands and Germany, investigating similar complaints.

Mario Monti, EU competition commissioner, is critical of the way the car industry's controversial "block exemption" works. This exempts carmakers from usual EU competition rules and allows them to operate tied dealerships. The  Commission will decide at the end of next year whether to renew this exemption.

Mr Monti said earlier this year that the carmakers had little respect for the "highway code" (block exemption) which he described as "very generous", to them. "Such misconduct will of course also play a role in the evaluation exercise now under way," he said.

The commission has five carmakers under investigation including Adam  Opel. The others are Volkswagen - where the  Commission opened a second investigation, DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot and Renault of France. Prices differ by 40 per cent on some cars between the most expensive markets and the cheapest in the EU.

General Motors Corp.'s Adam  Opel AG unit faces a fine from the European Commission for violating European antitrust law, people close to the commission said. The commission has accused Opel's Dutch operating unit of seeking to prevent cross-border sales of new cars within the
15-nation European Union, an infringement against EU competition rules.

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European
Commission on Wednesday:
- - - -

TD
ANNOUNCEMENTS

Spokesman Jonathan Faull said there would be a VIP Corner with European Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in the Charlemagne building at 1930/1730 GMT on Wednesday.

On Thursday, there will be a technical briefing at 1130/0930 GMT on "new risks at work in the EU" by the director of the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, Hans-Horst Konkolewsky.

At 1215/1015 GMT on Thursday, European Enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen will give a news conference on innovation in the knowledge-based economy. - - - -
COMPETITION-STATE AID

Spokesman Michael Tscherny said the  Commission had on Wednesday concluded its review of regional aid in EU member states with the approval of the aid maps for Italy and Belgium.
- - - -
ENERGY-PROTESTS

Spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  Commission was satisfied with the response from Swedish authorities about what action they were taking in response to port blockades by hauliers protesting high fuel prices.
Responding to a request for information, Sweden had told the  Commission police were enforcing the
Swedish law against blocking highways, Todd said.
- - - -
ANTITRUST-AUTOS-GM

Tscherny said the  Commission had on Wednesday decided to  fine General Motors Corp's Dutch subsidiary Opel Nederland BV 43 million euros for obstructing exports of new cars to consumers from other European Union states.
- - - -
ENERGY-TAXATION-STATE AID

In reply to a question, spokesman Gilles Gantelet said the  Commission had asked four EU countries to say exactly what aid they were giving to help their industries cope with high fuel prices to see if they were breaking EU law.

Page 18 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Under the state aid rules the  Commission has written to Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands
to ask them for information about the content of any aid they may have given over the past few days in
the transport sector," Gantelet said.

"The deadline (for replies) is one month - once we have received the information we can see whether or not it is compatible with state aid (rules)," he continued.

Following street protests that brought many parts of Europe to a standstill, a number of governments used a variety of measures, mostly aimed at reducing fuel tax for industries such as road haulage, farming and fishing, to ease the impact of spiralling oil costs.

The Commission, the European Union's executive body, has already warned the bloc's 15 national governments that it would take legal action against countries breaking strict EU rules on state aid.

In response to another question, Gantelet said the  Commission stood by its proposal to set minimum levels of tax that each EU government would have to apply on a wide range of energy products, which some have dubbed an "eco-tax".

The proposal has failed to get the unanimous backing of EU governments which would be required to make it law.

"The eco-tax proposal is still on the table," Gantelet said. "But you have to look at the political advisability, whether or not it should be adopted over the next few weeks. But that does not call into question the fundamental principle."
- - - - OILSTOCKS
Asked whether the fuel crisis in Europe had eaten into the European Union's strategic fuel stocks, Gantelet said the 15 EU countries had not dipped below the minimum oil stocks they are legally required to keep under EU law.

"Stocks remain low - they haven't gone up recently - but under Community (EU) legislation they are not in a catastrophic situation where we would have write to the countries," he said.

Under EU law, each country must hold contingency crude and oil product stocks equivalent to 90 days of national daily consumption.

Gantelet added that in the  Commission's view, "stocks should be used in part in the case of isolated crises - a break in the supply chain for example, something which does not persist over time," adding that "this current situation does not require us to take from stock."

OPEL was fined #26 million by the European  Commission today for preventing buyers from Britain and other high-price countries from snapping up cheap new cars in Holland.

The fine is the second hefty penalty against a car maker for impeding the single European market - Volkswagen was fined a record #62m in 1998, which was reduced on appeal to #55 million. As in the Volkswagen case, today's  fine against Opel Holland followed complaints from consumers that they were being blocked from ordering cars freely anywhere they chose in the European Union.

TD
Car buyers who wish to buy an  Opel in Britain, where they are sold under the Vauxhall badge, can expect to pay considerably more than in Holland.
Before-tax car prices in Holland are also substantially lower than in Germany and France.

Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of fair competition, described  Opel's offence as "grave" and said: "The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single market. This decision [to  fine Opel] is therefore a clear signal that competition policy serves consumers' interests."
Obstructed

Exports of new cars from Opel dealers in Holland - notably those in the Dutch border areas - had been obstructed deliberately, the commission investigation found.

A number of dealers were given direct instructions by  Opel district managers in Holland to stop all export sales, said the  commission. The dealers were told that the number of cars they were expected to sell
as part of their dealer contracts should above all be sold within Holland.

From October 1996 until January 1998, the  commission explained, Opel in Holland "operated a large number of sales campaigns which each contained a provision that bonus payments would be refused if dealers carried out sales to consumers from abroad".

Such tactics violated EU laws which ban any agreements affecting trade between member states and which effectively distort competition in the European single market, the  commission statement said.

A 1995 regulation on car distribution bans manufacturers and importers from restricting consumers buying cars in the member state of their choice.

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (AFP) - The European  Commission said Wednesday it has  fined US automaker General Motors' Dutch unit  Opel Nederland for obstructing exports of new cars direct to customers in other EU member states.
The 43 million euro (36 million dollars)  fine covered the period between September 1996 and January
1998, the  Commission said.

TD
The Commission had fined German automaker Volkswagen 102 million euros in January 1998 for the same reason.
"The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single
market. The adoption of this decision is therefore a clear signal that competition policy serves consumers'
interests," competition commissioner Mario Monti said.

"The commission is determined to intervene" in cases which "jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market," Monti said. "Such measures constitute a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely."

BRUSSELS (AP) _ The European Union  fined the Dutch importer of General Motors Corp.'s  Opel cars the equivalent of $36.5 million US on Wednesday for telling its dealers not to sell to foreigners from countries where Opels cost more than in the Netherlands.
``The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits'' of the EU
single market, the European  Commission said in statement.

TD
The commission said a four-year investigation found  Opel Nederland had since September 1996 restricted or prevented dealers from selling cars to customers in other EU nations.

Opel Nederland BV told its dealers, especially those in border areas, not to sell to foreigners shopping for a better deal than they could get at home.

The dealers were told their sales quotas applied only to sales in the Netherlands.  Opel Nederland ran several campaigns between October 1996 and January 1998 that specified that bonus payments would be refused if dealers sold cars to consumers from abroad.
``Such bonus payments generally represent an important portion of a dealer's profit,'' the
commission said.

It added the right of consumers to do cross-border bargain hunting was ``one of the most fundamental objectives'' of the 15-nation EU.
Carmakers price their products differently in individual countries. In the Netherlands an  Opel can be
20 per cent cheaper than in Germany.

In 1998, the European  Commission fined German carmaker Volkswagen $77.4 million US for restricting car sales in Italy.
The EU currently is investigating the marketing practices of DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot, Renault and
Citroen.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European  Commission said on Wednesday that it has  fined Opel Nederland NV, the Dutch import unit of General Motors Corp's (GM)  Opel brand, the sum of EUR43 million for obstructing exports of new cars to consumers in other member states.

"The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single market," the  Commission said in statement.

TD
The Commission statement said that car prices in the Netherlands are "generally substantially lower" than in other member states such as Germany, France and the U.K.

The Commission carried out inspections in Dec. 1996 on the basis of complaints from consumers wishing to buy cars in the Netherlands at cheaper prices.

"These inspections...prove that due to high export demand from customers from other member states, Opel Nederland had, from Sept. 1996 onwards, developed and pursued a strategy ... to restrict or to prevent dealers from selling cars to customers... from abroad," it said.

Opel Nederland district managers instructed a number of exporting dealers to stop all export sales, the
Commission said, adding that the dealers in question were mostly located in border areas.
Dealers had also been told that their sales quota was only to be sold within the Netherlands.

Finally,  Opel Nederland operated a sales campaign from Oct. 1996 to Jan. 1998, but bonus payments were refused if dealers carried out sales to foreign buyers.
These measures are all illegal under E.U. regulations, the  Commission said.

The Commission said that, in setting the  fine, it took into account the fact that  Opel should have known it was violating E.U. regulations.

In addition, the illegal measures prevented consumers from taking advantage of the single market which is "one of the most fundamental objectives of the Community."

The Commission noted that car distribution in Europe is currently exempt from the full application of European competition rules in order to allow exclusive distribution contracts, "provided that certain conditions are fulfilled."

The Commission is due to report on whether the exclusive distribution system should be extended by the end of 2000.

The Commission said that it took into account the duration and severity of  Opel's illegal actions in setting the fine.

An Opel spokeswoman declined to comment on the decision but said the company will issue a statement later today.

A Commission spokesman said that the  Commission is carrying out a similar investigation into alleged violations of single market rules by DaimlerChrysler (DCX). However, a decision on this case isn't likely before the end of the year, he said.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- German car manufacturer  Opel said Wednesday it is "very disappointed" with the  fine levied on Opel Nederland NV by the European Union  Commission.

The Commission earlier Wednesday said it has  fined Opel Nederland EUR43 million for obstructing exports of new cars to consumers in other member states.

"Opel Nederland is very disappointed that the  Commission has chosen to impose a  fine in this matter. We will need time to assess the decision before we can comment further," the group said in a statement.

Opel is a unit of U.S. car manufacturer General Motors Corp (GM).

Aims to Beef Up
Investor Relations

DaimlerChrysler has appointed Elizabeth Wade, a partner in London investor-relations consultancy Makinson Cowell, to head its global investor-relations team, a move aimed in part at rekindling interest among U.S. investors who have been largely responsible for the 35% decline in the German auto maker's share price over the past 52 weeks. The company is also planning to tweak its broader communications strategy, people close to the situation said. One of the top priorities for Ms. Wade, 42 years old, will be to reach out to U.S. investors, whose combined holdings in DaimlerChrysler have dropped to 21%, compared with 44% of the company when the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler was completed in November 1998.
Separately, DaimlerChrysler said it switched production of the right-hand-drive model of the
Mercedes-Benz C Class car to South Africa from Germany, as it opened a 1.4 billion rand ($192 million)
plant. Chairman Jurgen Schrempp said the move reflects a long-term commitment to South Africa. The
plant will produce 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles a year.
Mediobanca Fiscal-Year Net Rises 39%

Italy's Mediobanca reported earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30 rose 39% to 545.9 billion lire ($240.7 million), boosted by a 32% rise in  commission income as it rides the wave of Italy's booming investment-banking business. The bank's 400 billion lire in commissions easily offset a 14% drop in interest income. Despite speculation that the Milan merchant bank -- following the death in June of its honorary chairman, Enrico Cuccia -- would reshuffle its top management, Mediobanca's board made no move at its meeting yesterday. The board will take up the issue again before the Oct. 28 shareholders meeting. Meanwhile, insurer Swiss Life said it acquired a 2.1% stake in Mediobanca as an investment. Italian insurer Fondiaria, controlled by Mediobanca, this summer said it had acquired a 10% stake in Swiss Life.
GM's Opel Faces Antitrust  Fine by EU

The European  Commission will today announce its decision to  fine Adam Opel, the Germany-based unit of General Motors, for breaking European Union antitrust law, people close to the  commission said. The  commission has accused Opel's Dutch operating unit of seeking to prevent cross-border sales of new cars within the EU's 15-nation market. Although required by law to sell to customers shopping for bargains outside their country of residence, auto makers say such sales diminish loyalty to local dealers. Opel declined to comment. In a similar case, Volkswagen on Monday said it will appeal a
90 million euro ($76.8 million)  fine, levied against the German auto maker by the European Court of
Justice in July, for seeking to prevent non-Italians from buying cars in Italy between 1993 and 1996.

Russian Privatization Sale Marks Change

The first Russian privatization sale since Vladimir Putin became president has provided hope that the days when the country's choicest industrial assets were sold off at bargain-basement prices in rigged auctions may be drawing to a close. The carefully watched government-run tender for an 85% stake in Onako, Russia's 11th-biggest oil producer, was won by Yevrotek, a small oil-trading company linked to Tyumen Oil, or TNK. Yevrotek paid $1.08 billion for the stake, more than twice the $425 million starting price. It narrowly beat a $1 billion bid from Profit House, a consortium representing two of Russia's biggest oil companies, Yukos and Sibneft, and Stroitransgas, a closely held firm that builds pipelines for Russian state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom.
French Banks  Fined for Alleged Collusion

In the biggest antitrust  fine ever levied in France, nine French banks were  fined a total of 1.1 billion francs ($143 million) for allegedly colluding to restrict competition in mortgage renegotiations when interest rates fell sharply in the early 1990s. The nine include six major banks -- Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Lyonnais, Caisse d'Epargne, Credit Mutuel and Banque Nationale de Paris, now BNP Paribas -- as well as three regional units of Credit Agricole, Caisse d'Epargne and Credit Mutuel. Many of the banks disputed they had been involved in any organized collusion, and most indicated they plan to appeal the decision.
BRIEFLY:

-- French hotel company Accor confirmed that it is in talks with British hotel-to-catering group Granada Compass, which is planning to sell its hotel division. A report in Britain's Guardian newpaper on the talks sent Accor shares down 4.9% in Paris on concerns about how the French firm would finance such a
deal. Granada Compass shares shot up 7.5% in London.
--- ASIA/PACIFIC
Oil Prices Are Mixed Blessing for Jakarta

Rising oil prices have helped prop up Indonesia's battered economy, producing a windfall for Asia's largest oil exporter through record export earnings and higher tax revenue. Oil and gas contribute about
20% of Indonesia's annual export earnings, and Singapore brokerage firm G.K. Goh estimates each $1 rise in crude-oil prices yields about $350 million in additional revenue for Indonesia. Those
foreign-exchange inflows should help keep Indonesian interest rates down and provide badly needed support for the country's currency. But Jakarta officials aren't celebrating because higher oil prices increase pressure to proceed with a long-awaited, but deeply unpopular, rise in fuel prices subsidized and controlled by the state.
Japan Supplementary Budget Expected

Japan's government is expected to announce today a supplementary budget aimed at stoking economic recovery. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy chief, Shizuka Kamei, said it will include about 3.9 trillion yen ($36.5 billion) in direct fiscal stimulus such as public-works outlays. The package is smaller than those in recent years, reflecting worries about Japan's spiraling budget deficit.
Hitachi to Spin Off Fiber-Optic Unit

Japan's Hitachi said it will spin off its fiber-optic-components unit this month. The unit will be called OpNext Japan and will be a subsidiary of OpNext, a new U.S. company in which Clarity Group will invest as much as $450 million. Clarity is a partnership of Los Angeles private-equity firm Clarity Partners and Japanese trading company Marubeni. Hitachi said the moves will strengthen its fiber-optic unit.
BRIEFLY:

-- Asia Pulp & Paper, as expected, said it plans to restructure its huge debt by exchanging some of its bonds for a combination of cash and new, longer-dated bonds. It filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission proposing a partial exchange of four series of notes with a face value of $3.2 billion.

-- Philippine magnate Lucio Tan backed out of a plan to buy the Philippine government's 30% shareholding in Philippine National Bank, upsetting Manila's privatization program and throwing doubt on its loan agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Moody's Downgrades Peru Brady Bonds

Moody's Investors Service said it downgraded its rating on Peru's Brady bonds to B1 from Ba3, saying the action reflects missed interest payments that were due Sept 7. The move is the latest blow to the government of President Alberto Fujimori, who on Saturday said he would call new presidential elections in which he won't run. Moody's made no mention of the political crisis in announcing the downgrade.
Peru missed an $80 million Brady bond coupon payment on Sept. 7 because of a legal dispute with U.S. hedge fund Elliott Associates. Under a U.S. court ruling, more than half of the Peruvian payment could
be seized to pay Elliott. "The Peruvian government has indicated its desire to honor its Brady obligations in full before the 30-day grace period, which expires on Oct. 7," Moody's said. "The ratings outlook for Peru's Brady bonds will remain uncertain, at least until this issue is resolved."
Aetna to Sell Stakes to BBVA-Bancomer

U.S. insurer Aetna said its international unit agreed to sell its 49% interest in three Mexican joint ventures to Grupo Financiero BBVA-Bancomer for $693 million. After the sale, BBVA-Bancomer and its affiliates will own 100% of insurer Seguros Bancomer, pension concern Pensiones Bancomer and pension-fund manager Afore Bancomer. Aetna this summer agreed to sell most of its international and financial-services businesses to ING Group of the Netherlands. It said the sale of the Mexican stakes, in the works before the ING deal, doesn't change the amount of consideration in the ING deal. Aetna said the sale is subject to Mexican regulatory approval.
BRIEFLY:

-- Canadian manufacturers' shipments in July fell 1.3% from the month before to 44.33 billion Canadian dollars (US$29.79 billion), but new orders increased 4.2% to C$47.13 billion, Statistics Canada said.

-- Canadian oil and natural-gas company Talisman Energy said it purchased two natural-gas systems in western Canada from TransCanada PipeLines for 145 million Canadian dollars (US$97.4 million).

-- Mexico's finance minister, Jose Angel Gurria, said the departing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo will meet or beat all of the country's macroeconomic goals this year. He told Mexico's Congress the economy will grow between 6% and 7% this year, after 7.8% first-half growth in gross domestic product.

CALL FOR ACTION TO HALT EURO'S FALL

Michael Mussa, the economic counsellor of the International Monetary Fund, said on Tuesday that the weakness of the euro would, unless reversed soon, risk a destabilising correction against the dollar later. He said that the major industrial nations should intervene in the currency markets. The Japanese finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said that Japan was ready to participate in joint action, but the US is thought to have little interest in any intervention. The euro fell below $0.85 for the first time on Tuesday.

BROWN UNDER ATTACK ON TWO FRONTS

The Conservatives demanded the resignation of British finace minister Gordon Brown after accusations that he had misled the public over the donation of 1 million stg to the Labour Party in 1997. A new book entitled 'Servants of the People', by Andrew Rawnsley, says that Brown knew more about the donations that he claimed to know and that he told a radio interviewer that he had not known about the donation, despite having been briefed about it by Tony Blair. Colleagues also continued to criticise his handling of the fuel crisis. The prime minister issued a statement saying that there was no question of Brown standing down.
OFTEL REGRETS SLOW REACTION TO DISPUTE OVER 'UNBUNDLING'.

Oftel, the telecom regulator, said it should have taken earlier action to break the deadlock between BT and rival broadband services. The director general of Oftel, David Edmonds, said 'If I plead guilty to anything, it is that we might have stuck our oar in sooner'. Oftel has intervened to allocate the local exchanges that were chosen for 'unbundling', but there has been criticism that the exchanges are in areas of low population where demand is lower. Colt Telecom added to criticism, saying that the regulator in Germany has been tougher than Oftel.
BANKS UNVEIL CHANGES TO CODE OF CONDUCT

The UK's largest banks and building societies announced changes to their code of conduct aimed at making it easier to switch between financial service providers. The move is said by some observers to be designed to see off potential government intervention in the retail financial services market. It follows complaints by consumer groups that delays in transferring customer details and balances were hindering competition in the market. The code was created by the British Bankers' Association and the Association for Payment Clearing Services.
EU EXPECTED TO  FINE OPEL OVER SALES PRACTICES

General Motors' main European subsidiary, Adam  Opel, is expected to be fined by the European Commission for breach of EU rules on the sale and pricing of cars. The Commission is expected to claim that the company's Dutch subsidiary refused to sell cars to buyers from outside the Netherlands.
The company said that it would appeal against any  fines imposed by Brussels. The  Commission has five car manufacturers under investigation, the others being Volkswagen , DaimlerChrysler , Peugeot and Renault .
BA SHARE PRICE FALL ADDS TO UNCERTAINTY OVER KLM

Page 32 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Shares in British Airways fell to 294p before recovering to 302p at the close of trading. The fall in the price added to uncertainty over its proposed merger with KLM . The talks are in their fourth month and are expected to finish in early October. There is scepticism about the value of the deal. Airline analyst Andrew Light said: 'The combined market capitalisation of the two groups is back where it was before the rumours of the deal started, so the market is giving little value to the transaction.'.
BP AND RWE MULL TIE-UP IN GERMANY

BP Amoco and German utility RWE are in talks about a combination of their petrol station and refining businesses. Such a deal would create Germany's second largest petrol chain, behind Aral, consisting of
2,662 stations. The potential deal is to be discussed at a meeting of the RWE supervisory board on Friday. However, BP sources stressed that a deal was not imminent. The possible deal highlights the pressure on medium-sized oil companies to combine with larger companies like BP. It would allow RWE to focus on its core electricity and related businesses.
REDBUS COLLECTS FUNDS FOR 'INTERNET HOTELS'

Redbus Interhouse announced plans to raise 82 million stg to support expansion after strong demand at its Paris and London centres. The company is to raise new funds in a placing and open offer. The money raised would be used to open at least 12 more Internet hotels. Results for the quarter to June 30 showed a loss of 4.7 million stg on turnover of 391,000 stg. However the company says that these figures do not properly demonstrate its prospects, as turnover in August alone was 800,000 stg. The shares closed up six percent at 311p.
OXFORD GLYCOSCIENCES TO SEEK LISTING ON NASDAQ

Oxford GlycoSciences , the biotechnology company, announced plans to float on the Nasdaq either this year or in 2001 as it unveiled technology alliances with PE Biosystems Group and Packard BioScience and announced its results for the first half of the year. Revenues were 4.5 million stg, compared to 4.4 million stg for the same period in 1999. Pre-tax losses widened from 4.53 million stg to 7.27 million stg. The company said that the Nasdaq listing would give it the means to acquire technology as well as bringing liquidity to the stock. It has not yet been decided whether to seek fresh funds from the US listing. The company intends to file its Gaucher's Disease product, Vevesca, with US regulators by the end of
2001. The shares fell 15p to 20.45 stg.
ONLINE BONUS FOR TAYLOR & FRANCIS

Taylor & Francis reported its interim figures for the six months to June 30, on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits rose 22 percent from 3 million stg to 3.6 million stg on turnover up 19 percent to 50.7 million stg. Chief executive Anthony Selvey said that the company was increasingly focused on the Internet; turnover in the journals division increased 29 percent to 23.4 million stg, benefiting from its popular online article alerting service. Operating margins improved from 15.9 percent to 16.5 percent due to economies of scale achieved by recent acquisitions. The shares rose 2.5p to 612.5p.

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The European  Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined General Motors Corp's Dutch subsidiary  Opel Nederland BV 43 million euros ($36.35 million) for obstructing exports of new cars to consumers from other European Union states.
It said the company had prevented these consumers from buying Opels in the Netherlands between
September 1996 and January 1998.

"The Commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

"Such measures constitute a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely," Monti added.

The Commission last April sent  Opel a legal warning over practices it alleged were designed to discourage foreign consumers from buying  Opel cars in the Netherlands, where they are cheaper than in other European markets.

The Commission in 1998 fined Volkswagen AG 102 million euros for stopping non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy. It later reduced the  fine to 90 million euros on appeal.
The Commission is also investigating sales and pricing policies at DaimlerChrysler AG, Peugeot and
Renault SA.

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The European  Commission is set later on Wednesday to  fine Adam Opel, General Motors Corp.'s European subsidiary, for breaking European Union rules on car sales practices, according to an EU source.
"We are set to make a ruling today on  Opel following earlier raids on their premises," the source said.

TD
Last year, the  Commission, the antitrust watchdog for the 15-nation European Union, sent  Opel a legal warning over practices it alleged were designed to discourage foreign consumers from buying Opel cars in the Netherlands, where they are cheaper than in other European markets.

The Commission had fined Volkswagen AG 102 million euros ($87.18 million) for stopping non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy. It later reduced the  fine to 90 million euros on appeal.
The Commission is also investigating sales and pricing policies at DaimlerChrysler AG , Peugeot and
Renault SA .

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The European Union  fined General Motors Corp's Dutch subsidiary Opel Nederland BV 43 million euros ($36.4 million) on Wednesday for obstructing car exports to consumers from other European Union states.
Announcing the fifth-highest fine ever imposed on an individual company for breaking EU antitrust
rules, the European Commission said Opel had "developed and pursued a strategy" to prevent foreign
car buyers from buying Opels in the Netherlands between September 1996 and January 1998.

TD
"The Commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

"Such measures constitute a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely," Monti added.

The Commission said Opel Nederland had operated sales campaigns including threats to refuse bonus payments to dealers which sold cars to consumers from outside the Netherlands. Such bonuses represent an important part of a dealer's profit margin.

The fine follows the  Commission's decision in January 1998 to  fine Volkswagen AG 102 million euros for stopping non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy. The European Court of First Instance later reduced that  fine to 90 million euros on appeal.
Volkswagen said on Monday it had launched a further appeal against the  fine.
The Commission said the fine was smaller in the latest case because the infringement lasted for about
17 months, compared to three years in the VW case.
The Commission is also investigating sales and pricing policies at DaimlerChrysler AG, Peugeot and
Renault SA.
It said 43 million euros represent 4.39 percent of  Opel Nederland's turnover in 1999, or 3.97 percent of
GM Nederland's turnover, or just 0.2 percent of GM Corp's turnover in western Europe.
APPEAL POSSIBLE

Opel must pay the  fine within three months, unless it decides to launch an appeal in the European
Court of First Instance, in which case it will be lodged in a blocked account pending the court's ruling.

Opel Nederland declined to say if it intended to appeal against the decision.

"Opel Nederland is very disappointed that the  Commission has chosen to impose a  fine in this matter," a spokesman said. "We need more time to access the decision before we can comment any further."



Page 38 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission last April sent  Opel a legal warning alleging it was breaking EU laws, and held a public hearing in September 1999 to hear its arguments.

Officials said on Wednesday the  Commission was still receiving a large number of complaints from consumers across Europe, especially in Britain and Germany, where cars are more expensive than in the Netherlands.

Although car distribution has a special exemption from normal EU competition rules, EU law guarantees consumers the right to buy new cars in the country of their choice.
The car industry's so-called "block exemption" from competition rules expires in October 2002 and
Monti has already hinted strongly he will force major changes to current arrangements after that.
He is due to report on the functioning of the system by the end of this year. ($1=1.183 Euro).

COMMISSION IMPOSES HEAVY  FINE ON MANUFACTURER  OPEL NEDERLAND BV FOR OBSTRUCTION TO EXPORTS OF NEW CARS FROM NETHERLANDS TOWARDS OTHER MEMBER STATES.

TD
Brussels, 20/09/2000 (Agence Europe) - The European  Commission imposed a fine of EUR 43 million on Opel Nederland BV, Dutch importer of automotive vehicles under brand  Opel. It reproaches it for having obstructed, between September 1996 and January 1998, exports of new cars for final customers living in other Member States such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The inspection carried out by the Commission had started in December 1996 on the basis of complaints made by clients wanting to acquire cars a lower prices in the Netherlands. It became clear that  Opel Nederland had concluded and followed, since September 1996, a three point strategy aimed a obstructing or preventing the activities of its dealers with regard to car sales to clients from abroad, including final consumers. The instructions given directly by the regional Directors repressible in  Opel Nederland to a certain number of export dealers, and the future undertakings made by a number of these dealers stipulating that they had ceased all export sales, indicate that Opel Nederland was in fact looking to noticeably reduce the exports. Nearly all the dealers in questions are located in border regions, where export activities play a traditionally import part. The dealers had, furthermore, been informed that the cars where to be sold as a priority in the Netherlands. Moreover, between October 1996 and January 1998,  Opel Nederland had launched several sales campaigns stipulating that the bonuses would be refused to dealers selling their goods to final consumers residing abroad (which form a significant part of their profit).

All of these measure are contrary to the provisions of Article 81 o 1 of the EC Treaty banning any agreement between companies susceptible a affecting trade between Member States and being an obstacle to free competition in a single market. The (EC) regulation No 1475/95 of the  Commission guarantees, for its part, to European consumers the possibility of buying a new car there where it is most advantageous for them. By deciding on the  fine, the Commission feels that the measures adopted by Opel Nederland where aimed at preventing consumers from benefiting from the single market as guaranteed by the said document. It also felt that the Dutch importer was aware of the inadequacy of its behaviour and Community competition regulations.

This case is comparable to that of Volkswagen, sanctioned in January 1998 for a similar attitude and which has just appealed (see, among others, yesterday's EUROPE, p.15). it must be noted that the Commission's DG Competition continues to receive complaints from consumer, mostly German, the latest formal proceeding having been opened against DaimlerChrysler. The  Commission intends to fight with firmness against this kind of practice which "forms a very serious infringement of Community competition regulations as they as an obstacle to the proper functioning of the single market".

The European  Commission on Wednesday imposed a E43m ($37m)  fine on Opel Nederland, a subsidiary of General Motors, the US car company, for preventing customers from abroad buying cars in the Netherlands.

Mario Monti, the European Union's competition commissioner, said the case was a "very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely".

TD
The Opel fine is not as big as the record E102m  fine imposed on Volkswagen in January 1998 for not allowing non-Italian customers to buy cars at its dealers in Italy. But the  Commission said this did not indicate a more lenient approach - it took into consideration the length of time the company had infringed the single market rules and its co-operation during the investigation.
The EU regulator said  Opel had obstructed exports of new cars to consumers from outside the
Netherlands between September 1996 and January 1998.

The investigation followed dawn raids on  Opel's Dutch headquarters and two dealers in the Netherlands in December 1996. The  Commission has had hundreds of complaints from consumers about their inability to buy cheaper cars abroad - notably from German and UK buyers.

"The Commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings [companies] jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market," said Mr Monti, stressing that the right to buy products more cheaply in another member country was one of the main benefits of the single market.

Consumer organisations have alleged that car companies are running an elaborate cartel to maintain high prices in some countries such as the UK.
A Commission spokesman said there was another formal investigation under way into
DaimlerChrysler's sales strategy in several EU countries, but this was unlikely to be concluded this year.

He also said officials were examining material gathered in dawn raids on Peugeot and Renault, indicating similar sales practices. The court of justice upheld the  Commission's case against Volkswagen, but on appeal reduced the  fine to E90m.
* Nissan warned on Wednesday that the strength of sterling and the cost base at its UK plant near
Sunderland in the north-east meant it might not be competitive to assemble the new Micra in Britain.

Officials said that both Nissan's existing Barcelona plant in Spain and Renault's plant in Flins, France, were better placed to build the Micra at a profit.

General Motors Corp.'s  Opel Nederland BV unit was fined 43 million euros ($36.6-million U.S.) for seeking to inhibit cross-border commerce. The European Commission's antitrust department said the Dutch importer of GM's  Opel brand cars sought to impede sales of cars from the Netherlands to citizens from other countries in the 15-nation European Union. The  commission is drafting new rules to govern auto distribution and has signalled that it may cut ties between auto makers and dealers because of rampant complaints of industry misconduct.

Opel was fined #26 million by the Brussels  Commission yesterday for preventing buyers from Britain and other high-price countries from snapping up cheap new cars in Holland.
The fine is the second hefty penalty against a car maker for impeding the single European market: In
1998, Volkswagen was  fined a record #62 million, which was reduced on appeal to #55 million.

TD
As in the Volkswagen case, the  fine against Opel Holland followed complaints from consumers that they were being blocked from ordering cars freely anywhere they chose in the EU.

Car buyers who wish to buy an  Opel in Britain, where they are sold under the Vauxhall badge, can expect to pay considerably more than in Holland. Before-tax car prices in Holland are also substantially lower than in Germany and France.

Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of fair competition, described  Opel's offence as 'grave' and said: 'The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single market. This decision to  fine Opel is therefore a clear signal that competition policy serves consumers' interests.

'The Commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market. Such measures constitute a serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely.'

But exports of new cars from Opel dealers in Holland - notably those in the Dutch border areas - had been obstructed deliberately, the Commission investigation found.

A number of dealers were given direct instructions by  Opel district managers in Holland to stop all export sales, the  Commission said. The dealers were told that the number of cars they were expected to sell as part of their contracts should above all be sold within Holland.

From October,1996, until January,1998, the  Commission said, Opel in Holland 'operated a large number of sales campaigns which each contained a provision that bonus payments would be refused if dealers carried out sales to consumers from abroad. Such bonus payments generally represent an important portion of a dealer's profit from the sale of new cars.'

Such tactics violated EU laws which ban any agreements affecting trade between member states and which effectively distort competition in the European single market, the  Commission statement said.

A 1995 regulation on car distribution networks bans manufacturers and importers from restricting 'either directly or indirectly the freedom of final consumers authorised intermediaries or dealers of their own distribution network from buying new motor vehicles in the member state of their choice.'

The scale of the  fine against Opel Holland reflected the fact that the measures taken by the company were designed to prevent consumers benefiting from the single market and that the Dutch arm of  Opel should have known it was acting against EU competition rules, the  Commission said.


Page 47 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Opel case, coupled with the Volkswagen case, will affect the  Commission's decision on whether to renew special rules enjoyed by car makers for marketing in Europe.

Manufacturers may market cars through official dealerships only. They have so far argued successfully that a supermarket-style selling system with all brands under one roof would not be good for consumers who require specialist service and after-sales care.

But the so-called 'Block Exemption' expires in October 2002 and consumer groups say it should not be renewed because, they claim, car manufacturers have used it to fix prices in different markets and to block motorists from shopping around anywhere in Europe where identical models are the cheapest.
The Commission is to present a report on the future of the system by the end of this year.

HD        Opel fined #28m by EC.

Opel was yesterday fined #28m by the European  Commission for deliberately preventing customers from Britain and other European countries from buying cheap new cars in the Netherlands.

The fine is the fifth highest ever imposed on an individual company for breaking EU anti-trust rules and is a sign that Brussels is getting tough with car makers who try to stop cross-border sales. The EC is in the process of investigating DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot and Renault for similar reasons. Volkswagen was
fined a record #62m in 1998 which was reduced on appeal to #55m.

TD
Prices in the Netherlands are substantially lower than those in countries such as Britain, France and Germany. In Britain Opels are sold under the Vauxhall badge and are considerably more expensive than in the Netherlands. The EC yesterday disclosed that  Opel Nederland, a subsidiary of General Motors, had deliberately `developed and pursued a strategy' to restrict sales to anyone living outside Holland. It decided to investigate after receiving a number of complaints from German consumers. EU anti-trust commissioner Mario Monti said: `Such measures constitute a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely.

Opel stopped cross-border sales by threatening to withhold bonus payments from dealers who sold to non-Dutch customers between 1996 and 1998, a powerful weapon to ensure that they fell into line. Such bonuses represent an important element of a dealer's profit margin.

Dealers close to the border were particularly affected after they witnessed a huge demand for cars from other European buyers.
The EC gathered evidence against  Opel in a series of high profile inspections and raids in the
Netherlands.
It opted for a smaller  fine because the infringement had continued for just 17 months compared to
Volkswagen's three years.

Opel has three months to pay the  fine and can appeal. A company spokesman said yesterday it was disappointed with the ruling and would look into the matter thoroughly. imiacomplaints.

Liffe Chief Pitches

TD
Nonmerger Proposal
To London Exchange

The head of the London International Financial Futures & Options Exchange, or Liffe, rejected suggestions that it should merge with the London Stock Exchange. But the derivatives market's chairman, Brian Williamson, proposed another deal that he said would accomplish everything that a merger would -- without the headaches. He said the LSE, which is trying to fend off a hostile bid from
Sweden's OM Gruppen, should adopt the GBP 60 million ($85 million) trading system developed by Liffe. If accepted, the proposal would give the LSE instant access to trading desks world-wide; it has been installed on nearly 300 trading floors in 20 countries. Trades on the LSE and Liffe could also be offset against each other through the London Clearing House, which would reduce dealing costs for securities firms.

Mr. Williamson said the deal would avoid many of the regulatory, strategy and personnel headaches that thwarted the LSE's plan to create a pan-European bourse called iX with Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse. An LSE spokesman said the bourse had no comment on the Liffe offer.
Usinor's Outlook Clouds First-Half Profit

French steelmaker Usinor posted higher-than-expected first-half profit, but its shares fell 3.4% in Paris trading after Usinor warned that a second-half slowdown would continue into next year's first quarter. First-half earnings more than doubled to 490 million euros ($416.9 million) from 213 million euros, above analysts' forecasts of 180 million to 230 million euros. Revenue rose 14% to 8.11 billion euros. Usinor attributed its strong first-half results to the weak euro, favorable conditions and cost cutting. But Chief Executive Francis Mer said Usinor expects a slowdown as seasonal effects are magnified by plans to reduce output by 150,000 tons, or 4% of annual output, to cut inventories.
EU Fines GM's Opel for Impeding Sales

The European  Commission's antitrust department  fined the Dutch unit of General Motors' Adam Opel subsidiary 43 million euros ($36.6 million) for seeking to inhibit cross-border commerce. It said Opel Nederland deliberately sought to impede sales of cars from the Netherlands to citizens of other European Union countries. An  Opel Nederland spokesman said it was "disappointed" by the decision and would study it before deciding whether to mount a court challenge.
EU Officials Seek to Stanch Fuel Protests
European Union transport ministers met to seek ways to prevent a repeat of fuel-tax protests by
European truckers, farmers and other workers, which continued in some EU countries yesterday. The

officials considered asking the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production and bickered over the differences in gasoline taxes across the 15-nation EU. The ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, also said they are prepared to call for efforts to improve cargo transport by rail and to seek harmonization of fuel taxes. France, which now holds the EU presidency, drew criticism for promising tax relief to truckers who blocked highways and cities early this month to protest high fuel prices. French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius announced yesterday that the government would implement on Oct. 1 a complex stabilization mechanism that should lower pump prices slightly and cost the government about three billion francs ($389 million) annually. The French protests inspired similar blockades in other EU nations, some of which also gave tax relief. The European  Commission has started an inquiry into whether such measures violate EU antisubsidy rules.

India to Ask World Bank for Loan Increase

India's finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, will ask the World Bank to increase its loan commitment to India to about $4 billion a year to help develop the country's infrastructure, the government said. The World Bank reduced the level of loans to India after New Delhi carried out nuclear-weapons tests in May
1998. Mr. Sinha will discuss the issue with World Bank President James Wolfensohn. The bank has set an annual limit of $3 billion in loans to India for the three years beginning in 2001. But New Delhi wants the limit raised to $4 billion.
Thailand's TPI Proposes Restructuring

After three years of rancorous negotiations with creditors, Thailand's biggest corporate debtor, Thai Petrochemical Industry, announced a plan to restructure $3.7 billion in loans -- a development that would remove a huge chunk of bad debt from the books of Thai banks. The proposal, drawn up by TPI's
court-appointed planner, Effective Planners, would allow creditors to swap almost $800 million in outstanding interest and financial guarantees for 75% of TPI's expanded equity, over a restructuring schedule that runs until the end of 2004. The proposed reorganization won't settle all of TPI's debt by
2004.
Kia Motors Unveils Buyback Program

South Korea's Kia Motors said it will buy back 80 million of the company's shares and cancel them afterwards in an effort to boost the auto maker's stock price. The buyback will be formally authorized in a board meeting scheduled Nov. 4. Kia said the 80 million shares represent 18% of its total 450 million shares and as much as 60% of shares on the market. The auto maker expects its share price to rise by
40% to 50% as the result of the buyback.

Canada's Trade Surplus Narrowed in July

Canada's trade surplus in July narrowed to 4.19 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.83 billion), after reaching a record C$5.12 billion in June, Statistics Canada said. The July surplus shrank mainly because of a
4.5% fall in exports of automotive products. Exports of communications equipment also dropped 12.8% in July, while energy exports slipped 7.3%. For the year's first seven months, the country's cumulative trade surplus totaled C$28.9 billion, up 56% from a year earlier.
Peru's Fujimori, Opposition Still at Odds

Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and opposition leaders remained at an impasse over the terms of transition from Mr. Fujimori's decade-long rule. Following a scandal involving a video in which Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief was seen bribing a Peruvian congressman, Mr. Fujimori called for new elections next March, followed by the inauguration of a new government in July. The opposition, led by Alejandro Toledo, an economist who finished second to Mr. Fujimori in elections in May, wants Mr. Fujimori to immediately yield power to an interim government that would call elections sooner. Meanwhile, mystery still surrounded the whereabouts of Vladimiro Montesinos, the former intelligence chief in the video who precipitated Mr. Fujimori's decision to step down. But diplomats said they felt that Mr. Montesinos was no longer exercising control over Peru's powerful intelligence service and posed no threat to the country's stability. A senior U.S. official said: "We feel that the government recognized that
it's incumbent upon them to be serious" [about prosecuting Mr. Montesinos]. We have certainly conveyed to the government that we hope and expect that the investigation will be serious."
Brazil to Lower Long-Term Interest Rate
The Brazilian government said it will cut the country's long-term interest rate by 0.50 percentage point to
9.75%. The measure is effective during the fourth quarter of 2000. Brazil's Development Bank, or Bndes,
uses the long-term rate as a reference in its credit operations. The long-term rate is based on a
12-month inflation projection and perceptions of Brazil's credit risk. The drop in the long-term rate follows
expectations that inflation will fall in coming months because Brazil's risk premium remains unchanged at
5.25%.

-- Credit-rating agency Fitch revised its outlook on Argentina to negative from stable and said a ratings downgrade could follow if economic growth doesn't pick up.

Energy/transport

LUXEMBOURG - Disagreements over tax policy prevented European Union transport ministers agreeing a common front on tackling problems caused by soaring oil prices in a marathon meeting that ended early on Thursday.
- - - - Energy/State aid
BRUSSELS - The European  Commission has asked four EU countries to say exactly what aid they are giving to help their industries cope with high fuel prices to see if they are breaking EU law, a spokesman said on Wednesday. The four countries concerned are Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands.
- - - - Energy/Stocks
BRUSSELS - The fuel crisis in Europe has not eaten into the European Union's strategic fuel stocks, an EU spokesman said on Wednesday. Gilles Gantelet, a spokesman at the EU's executive  Commission, said the 15 EU countries had not dipped below the minimum oil stocks they are required to keep under EU law.
- - - - Energy/Sweden
STOCKHOLM - Swedish truckers scaled back their diesel price protests at two of Sweden's main ports on Wednesday, but the main blockade at Gothenburg remained in place, port spokesmen said.
- - - - Austria
VIENNA - The Austrian government, bruised by a seven-month boycott by its EU partners after the far right entered government, said on Wednesday it would be more assertive in standing up for its rights. "We will not sacrifice Austrian interests to anyone who thinks they can tell us from Berlin or Paris or Brussels or anywhere else what should happen," conservative Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel told parliament.

Enlargement/Hungary

Page 53 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BUDAPEST - European Union (EU) accession talks are likely to step up in the coming months, Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said on Wednesday after meeting several top European Commission officials and foreign ministers.
- - - - Enlargement/Baltics
HANOVER - German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on Wednesday there was a chance that all three Baltic states could join the European Union together. "Much speaks in favour of that," he told reporters after talks with his counterparts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
- - - - Enlargement/Cyprus/Turkey
STRASBOURG - Cyprus took its case against Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights on
Wednesday and accused Ankara of of ethnic cleansing in the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state.
- - - - Enlargement/Poland
WARSAW - Poland unveiled a report on Wednesday seeking to calm fears in the European Union that its enlargement would swamp western Europe with cheap labour and that farm subsidies for new member states would break the EU budget.
- - - - Competition
BRUSSELS - The European  Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined General Motors Corp's Dutch subsidiary Opel Nederland BV 43 million euros for obstructing exports of new cars to consumers from other European Union states.
- - - - G7/Euro
FRANKFURT - Rich nations meeting in Prague on Saturday will confront the weakness of the euro but analysts see little hope of a stern statement signalling intervention to repair its woes. Euro depreciation will dominate the bi-annual Group of Seven meeting, together with the high price of oil, G7 sources say.
- - - - G7/Energy
PARIS - France plans to raise concerns over oil prices at the weekend meeting of G7 finance ministers, and expects a "dialogue" with the OPEC producers group to follow, Finance Minister Laurent Fabius said on Wednesday.
- - - -
Foreign/North Korea

SEOUL - North Korea on Thursday said it has proposed opening diplomatic relations with member nations of the European Union, as the secretive Stalinist state moves to end its long Cold War isolation. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun had recently sent a letter officially proposing ties to the foreign ministers of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and the external relations commissioner of the European Commission.
- - - -
Trade/Latin America

BRUSSELS - European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy begins a trip to three Latin American countries on Thursday amid rumblings of discontent in the region over the slow pace of trade negotiations with the EU. Over the next week, Lamy will visit Uruguay, Argentina and Chile - three of the five Latin American nations with which the EU is negotiating free-trade agreements.

Opel fined GBP26million A GBP26MILLION  fine was slapped on Opel by the European  Commission yesterday for preventing drivers from shopping around for the best deal on its cars. The EC found that Opel in the Netherlands had deliberately stopped motorists from outside the country buying cars there between 1996 and 1998.

Car prices before tax in the Netherlands are much lower than in Britain and other EU member states. Under EU law, citizens have the right to shop in any of the 15 member states. But  Opel told its dealers to sell only to people within the Netherlands and refused to pay bonuses if garages sold to buyers from abroad.

HD   Brussels Commission fines carmaker - Opel ban on cheap cars costs #26m. WC   486 words

Opel was fined #26m by the Brussels  Commission yesterday for preventing buyers from Britain and other high-price countries from snapping up cheap new cars in Holland.

The fine is the second hefty penalty against a carmaker for impeding the single European market - Volkswagen was fined a record #62m in 1998, which was reduced on appeal to #55m.

TD
As in the Volkswagen case, yesterday's  fine on Opel Holland followed complaints from consumers that they were being blocked from ordering cars freely anywhere they chose in the European Union.

Car buyers who wish to buy an  Opel in Britain, where they are sold under the Vauxhall badge, can expect to pay considerably more than in Holland.
Before-tax car prices in Holland are also substantially lower than in Germany and France.

Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of fair competition, described  Opel's offence as "grave" and said: "The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits of the single market.
This decision (to  fine Opel) is therefore a clear signal that competition policy serves consumers' interests. "The commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise
the proper functioning of the single market.

Such measures constitute a serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely."

But exports of new cars from Opel dealers in Holland - notably those in the Dutch border areas - had been obstructed deliberately, the commission investigation found.

A number of dealers were given direct instructions by  Opel district managers in Holland to stop all export sales, said the  commission.

The dealers were told that the number of cars they were expected to sell as part of their dealer contracts should above all be sold within Holland.

From October 1996 until January 1998, the  commission said, Opel in Holland "operated a large number of sales campaigns which each contained a provision that bonus payments would be refused if dealers carried out sales to consumers from abroad. Such bonus payments generally represent an important portion of a dealer's profit from the sale of new cars".

Such tactics violated EU laws which banned any agreements affecting trade between member states and which effectively distorted competition in the European single market, the  commission statement said.

A 1995 regulation on car distribution networks bans manufacturers and importers from restricting "either directly or indirectly the freedom of final consumers' authorised intermediaries or dealers of their own distribution network from buying new motor vehicles in the member state of their choice".

The scale of the  fine against Opel Holland reflected the fact that the measures taken by the company were designed to prevent consumers benefiting from the single market and also the fact that the Dutch arm of Opel should have known it was acting against EU competition rules, said the  commission.

VAUXHALL'S sister company in Holland has been  fined Pounds 26million for illegally blocking sales of cheap cars to foreign buyers.

Opel was found guilty of telling its Dutch dealers not to sell the vehicles to foreigners in breach of EU
competition law on the free market.

TD
The company instructed its dealers, especially those in border areas, not to sell to consumers from outside Holland who were shopping for a better deal than they could get at home.
The dealers were told that bonus payments would be refused if they sold cars to foreigners.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said yesterday: 'The  commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market. Such measures constitute a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely.' A Consumers' Association spokesman said last night: 'This confirms our view that consumers are being ripped off by illegal actions abroad.' An EU survey published in July showed that new cars in Britain cost up to twice what they do on the Continent.
The EU has been mounting a series of investigations into alleged price-fixing by a number of car firms. In 1998, Volkswagen was  fined a record Pounds 62million for impeding the single European market.
The penalty was later reduced on appeal to Pounds 55million.

Opel like Vauxhall, part of the American General Motors corporation last night declined to comment.

HD           Opel handed #26m EU fine - General Motors. BY          By David Lister.

THE European  Commission yesterday imposed a 43 million ( #26 million)  fine on a Dutch subsidiary of General Motors for deliberately stopping the sale of cars to British customers seeking bargain prices on the Continent.

Mario Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner, said that  Opel Nederland had systematically attempted to block the sale of  Opel cars to customers outside of The Netherlands during a 17-month period from September 1996 to January 1998.

TD
Announcing the  fine, which follows an even higher penalty against Germany's Volkswagen, Signor Monti said that the actions taken by  Opel Nederland were "a very serious infringement of European competition rules and must be dealt with severely".

He added: "The right to buy products cheaper in other EU member states is one of the main benefits of the single market. The  Commission is determined to intervene in cases where measures taken by undertakings jeopardise the proper functioning of the single market."

Yesterday's  fine follows a detailed investigation launched in December 1996, when EU anti-trust inspectors raided the offices of  Opel Nederland and a Dutch  Opel dealer. The inquiry established that Opel Nederland had followed a three-pronged strategy of limiting export sales, including giving direct instructions to exporters on the Dutch border and refusing bonus payments to dealers if they sold to overseas customers.

The measures meant British consumers were unable to take advantage of low prices in The Netherlands. The  Commission said customers in other member states, such as Gerrmany and France, where cars are typically more expensive than in The Netherlands, were also likely to have suffered.

BRUSSELS: The European  Commission is set later on Wednesday to  fine Adam Opel, General Motors Corp.'s European subsidiary, for breaking European Union rules on car sales practices, according to an EU source.
"We are set to make a ruling today on  Opel following earlier raids on their premises," the source said.

TD
Last year, the  Commission, the antitrust watchdog for the 15-nation European Union, sent  Opel a legal warning over practices it alleged were designed to discourage foreign consumers from buying Opel cars in the Netherlands, where they are cheaper than in other European markets.

The Commission had fined Volkswagen AG 102 million euros ($87.18 million) for stopping non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy. It later reduced the  fine to 90 million euros on appeal.
The Commission is also investigating sales and pricing policies at DaimlerChrysler AG, Peugeot and
Renault SA. (Reuters).

BRUSSELS -- The European Union  fined the Dutch importer of General Motors Corp.'s  Opel cars the equivalent of $36.5 million US on Wednesday for telling its dealers not to sell to foreigners from countries where Opels cost more than in the Netherlands.
"The right to buy products cheaper in other member states is one of the main benefits" of the EU
single market, the European  Commission said in statement.

TD
The commission said a four-year investigation found  Opel Nederland had since September 1996 restricted or prevented dealers from selling cars to customers in other EU nations.

Opel Nederland BV told its dealers, especially those in border areas, not to sell to foreigners shopping for a better deal than they could get at home.

The dealers were told their sales quotas applied only to sales in the Netherlands.  Opel Nederland ran several campaigns between October 1996 and January 1998 that specified that bonus payments would be refused if dealers sold cars to consumers from abroad.
"Such bonus payments generally represent an important portion of a dealer's profit," the
commission said.

It added the right of consumers to do cross-border bargain hunting was "one of the most fundamental objectives" of the 15-nation EU.
Carmakers price their products differently in individual countries. In the Netherlands an  Opel can be
20 per cent cheaper than in Germany.

In 1998, the European  Commission fined German carmaker Volkswagen $77.4 million US for restricting car sales in Italy.
The EU currently is investigating the marketing practices of DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot, Renault and
Citroen.

HD   VOLKSWAGEN APPEALS AGAINST EU COURT'S EURO 90 MILLION FINE. WC   532 words
PD    23 September 2000
SN    European Report
SC    EURREP
LA    English
CY    (c) 2000 European Report.

LP
German car maker Volkswagen AG has announced that it is appealing against the European Court of First Instance's ruling to uphold a  fine imposed on it by the European  Commission in January 1998 for restricting parallel imports. The car-maker had two months from 18 July to lodge an appeal against the new, slightly-lower  fine of Euro 90 million set by the EU Court of First Instance in its ruling upholding the
Commission's decision to  fine VW for hindering the purchase of vehicles in Italy by non-Italian consumers
(see European Report Number 2515).

TD
This much-publicised case concerns a  Commission Decision of 28 January 1998 in which Volkswagen, together with its subsidiaries Audi AG and Autogerma S.p.A., were accused of infringing Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty on restrictive business practices (now Article 81 of the Amsterdam Treaty). The  Commission charged the German car manufacturer with concluding agreements with the Italian dealers in the exclusive distribution network in order to prevent or restrict sales to end users from other Member States acting
either in person or through an agent and to authorised dealers in the distribution network established in other Member States. Volkswagen was required to stop the practice immediately and pay a  fine of ECU
102 million. But it claimed to the EU Court that the  Commission Decision should be cancelled outright, or at least the  fine reduced as it was "over-estimated". The Court of First Instance Judges at least had initially accepted the latter request. While fervently supporting the  Commission's Decision, the Court concluded though that "although motor manufacturers may protect their networks, that does not authorise them to adopt measures which tend to partition the market". The Court reduced the  fine imposed on VW because it found that the infringement had lasted only three years (from 1993 to 1996) and the  Commission did not properly prove that the infringement continued after that period.

The original ECU 102 million  fine was equivalent to 10% of Volkswagen's profits in the territories affected. The Commission's case against VW focused on the years 1993 to 1995, when a drop in the value of the Lira made cars sold in Italy a bargain to importers in Northern Europe. Although in 1995 alone some
19,000 Volkswagens were sold in Italy to customers hailing from Germany and Austria, the  Commission said it was flooded with complaints by potential foreign customers. Volkswagen acknowledged that there may have been instances when dealers were pressured to not sell to citizens of different nations, but the company stressed there was no systematic bias.

-Other European car makers, including DaimlerChrysler AG, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Adam  Opel AG, have faced similar allegations that they attempted to prevent dealers from selling cars to non-domestic buyers. Indeed,  Opel Nederland has just been  fined Euro 43 million for having obstructed exports of new cars to motorists from other EU Member States from late 1996 to early 1998 (see separate article). Such practices are regarded as an effort to maintain price differences among EU countries, something which goes against EU competition rules.-.

OPEL is considering this weekend whether to appeal against the European  Commission's decision to
fine it #25.8million for preventing British consumers from buying cheaper cars in the Netherlands.

The fine followed complaints that  Opel, a sister company of the UK's Vauxhall, broke EU laws on free trade by withholding bonus payments from Dutch dealers who sold cars to people from Britain and other European countries.

TD
EC investigators swooped on Dutch dealers and found that between October 1996 and January 1998, they ran sales campaigns which denied them bonuses if they sold to consumers outside the Netherlands. Two years ago Volkswagen was  fined a record #62million for a similar offence over a three-year period. It was reduced on appeal to #55million.

Opel Nederland's fine is the fifth highest imposed on a company for breaking EU anti-trust rules and signals that Brussels may be getting tougher with car makers. The EC is also investigating Daimler Chrysler, Peugeot and Renault.

Car prices have dropped significantly since the EU began investigations, according to the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

The Competition  Commission investigated the cost of cars and in March reported that, on average, British cars were overpriced by 10-11 per cent or about #1,100. It found the UK was the dearest place in Europe for 70 out of 73 models.
However, UK car prices are still higher than in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe. Around
60,000 Britons bought cars from abroad last year, 20,000 more than in 1998. A host of Internet-based
car dealers have sprung up to exploit the price gap, notably Virgincars which buys 80 per cent of its
vehicles from European dealers and claims to offer savings up to #4,000 on some models. But
consumers may have to wait six to 12 months for deliveries.

Manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes responded by cutting UK prices while others have improved car specifications and financing deals. An independent study published last month found that car prices had dropped 7 per cent this year.

The SMMT claims UK dealers now match much more closely Internet offers.  Opel Nederland, like the UK's Vauxhall, is owned by US car giant General Motors. Vauxhall's response to increased competition was a website selling a"dotcom range" backed by test drives from its dealers.

"Prices of our dotcom range are as good, if not better, than the cost of importing through some of our competitors," says David Crundwell, Vauxhall's business affairs manager.Car makers have a block exemption under the Treaty of Rome so they can sell their products only through authorised dealers. It expires in 2002.

Opel fined E43m
BRUSSELS - The European  Commission has fined General Motors Corp.'s Dutch subsidiary  Opel
Nederland BV E43 million for obstructing sales of cars to consumers from other EU countries.

TD
In 1998, the Commission fined VW E102 million for stopping non-Italian consumers from buying its cars in Italy. The fine was later cut to E90 million on appeal.
The Commission is also investigating DaimlerChrysler, Peugeot and Renault. EC truck approval
The European  Commission has approved Volvo's acquisition of Renault's heavy-truck business - but with several conditions.

Volvo will have to sell its remaining 46 percent stake in Swedish rival Scania within three years. Volvo is discussing the divestiture with Volkswagen, which already owns 18.7 percent of Scania.

Meanwhile, Renault will have to withdraw from its joint venture with Finnish truckmaker Sisu. Renault will also have two years to dissolve Irisbus, its joint venture with Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicle division. But Renault is reluctant to sell its 50 percent share to Iveco and would prefer to merge it with Volvo's bus business.

Freightliner layoffs
FRANKFURT - DaimlerChrysler will lay off 20 percent of its work force at its Freightliner subsidiary in the
US after a decline in the US truck market. The cuts will affect about 3,800 people.

Dieter Zetsche, D/C management board member responsible for truck operations, said: "To maintain profitability and adjust to the shrinking market we will cut down Freightliner production." He was speaking at the commercial truck show here last week. Freightliner is the largest heavy-truck maker in the USA.

Despite faltering US sales, Zetsche said his unit's 2000 sales should still be around 1999's E26.7 billion. Sales will be slightly below last year's 550,000 units.

Punto boosts Fiat
TURIN - Fiat Auto reported an operating profit of E64 million in January-June 2000 compared with a loss
of E257 million in the year-ago period. Success of the second-generation Punto and the new Lancia Lybra
contributed.

Parent Fiat SpA's consolidated operating profit grew to E475 million from E163 million in the first half. Group revenues increased 26.4 percent to E29.8 billion.

THE European  Commission will this week unveil plans to strengthen its cartel-busting arm, including new powers for Brussels antitrust inspectors to search private homes and to subject company directors to detailed interrogations.

The plans, which constitute the most significant overhaul of the European Union's fight against cartels for nearly 30 years, are expected to be revealed by Mario Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner, on Wednesday.

The initiative will also remove the need for all deals to be notified to Brussels - a costly process and a waste of the  Commission's limited resources at a time when it is having to deal with a wave of complicated, Internet-related deals.

In a speech earlier this month, Signor Monti gave a clear signal of what to expect from the proposals, which build on a White Paper drawn up last year by Karel Van Miert, his predecessor. "It is essential that the  Commission be given the power to search private homes," Signor Monti told an audience in Stockholm, adding that antitrust inspectors should also be able to ask a broad range of questions during company raids.

At present they are able to ask questions specifically relating only to material or information found on such visits.

The plans come just days after Brussels underlined its get-tough approach to cartels by levying a #26 million fine against Opel's Dutch subsidiary for restricting car sales to bargain-hunters from the UK and other parts of Europe.
