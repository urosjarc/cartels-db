BRUSSELS, Dec 22, Reuter - The European Commission condemned on Tuesday  Ford New Holland for barring its dealers from importing or exporting tractors, arguing that the ban limited consumer choice.

The Commission said in a statement (IP(92)1075) that the ban was part of a detailed system set up by Ford to prevent so-called parallel trade in its  tractors.

TD
It said that when  Ford found a dealer involved in such business it would threaten that if it happened again it would carry out an array of measures ranging from cancellation of the dealership to reduced discounts and delayed delivery.

The Commission said the restrictions contravened Article 85 of the Rome Treaty, and it therefore ordered Ford to end the practice immediately.

BRUSSELS, 24/12/1992 (AGENCE  EUROPE) - In the context of its investigation of hindrances to parallel trade in tractors (see decision regarding the British market in  EUROPE of 5 March, p. 9), the Commission noted a "clear infringement" of the ban on agreements (Art. 85.1 of the EC Treaty) by For New Holland (FNH), which it has just condemned by a formal decision. It is demanding that  Ford take the necessary steps to guarantee total freedom for its clients to buy products anywhere in the Community and its dealers
to sell to any EC client, regardless of nationality.

TD
Ford's arrangements with its dealers are the cause of this infringement, because in relations between FNH and its distributors there is a ban on importing and exporting  tractors and a number of other provisions meant to prevent parallel trade.  Ford has established a "tracking" system so that it can identify parallel imports and their sources through information contained in vehicle registry documents. Once this double identification is made,  Ford had informed the dealer involved that this type of trade was undesirable and threatened to or imposed sanctions on them (cancellation of the dealership, delayed delivery of the tractor for export, charged higher prices, etc.).

Plans by Fiat and Hitachi to create a joint venture to develop, manufacture and sell hydraulic excavators have been cleared by the  European Commission, it was announced on December 22. The companies' plans involve the transfer of all Fiat's current production to a new joint enterprise that will manufacture for Western Europe, the Mediterranean basin and Africa. However, both parties have undertaken to accept orders from EC-based purchasers of Hitachi's own products. The  Commission said that although the venture will lead to exclusive parts contracts with Fiat's subsidiary, Iveco, and with Hitachi, these appeared to be "reasonably necessary" to its operation.

TD
At the same time, the  Commission announced it has ordered UK tractor manufacturer Ford New Holland to change its dealership arrangements, which it said were anti-competitive. The Commission said that the arrangement aimed to prevent parallel trade in  tractors by sanctioning dealers (for example, through cancelling their dealership, delaying delivery, charging higher prices, etc.) identified by  Ford as carrying out such imports. It said such arrangements were a "clear infringement" of Article 85(1) and told  Ford to refrain from such action in the future.
