BRUSSELS, May 17 (Reuters) - Ten memory chip makers including Samsung Electronics, Infineon and Hynix Semiconductor are expected to face EU  fines this week on charges of illegally fixing prices, two people familiar with the situation said on Monday. This will be the first decision under the  European       Commission's new settlement procedure introduced in July 2008 in which companies admit taking part in a cartel in return for a 10 percent cut in  fines.

The other companies set to be  fined are Micron Technology, Elpida Memory Inc, NEC Electronics Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp, Mitsubishi Electric and Nanya Technology.

TD
Samsung Electronics and Hynix are the world's largest and second-largest memory chip makers respectively.
"A decision on  fines is expected on Wednesday," one of the people said.

The second person said the total  fine may be up to 300 million  euros ($381 million) and could have been higher without the settlement procedure.

The Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, has championed the new procedure as a more effective method to deter violations and a speedier decision-making process. The EU executive can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaking EU laws.

Infineon said last December the Commission had opened formal proceedings against it on suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in the European market for DRAM chips, used in personal computers, printers, mobile phones and game consoles.

* Micron tip off  Commission on cartel, will not be  fined
* 10 percent cut in  fines under new EU settlement procedure (Adds European Commission no comment, shares, details) By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, May 17 (Reuters) - Nine memory chip makers, including Samsung Electronics, Infineon and Hynix Semiconductor, are set to be  fined by EU regulators this week on charges of illegally fixing prices.

Three people with direct knowledge of the matter said the  fines will be the first case under the European Commission's new settlement procedure introduced in July 2008 in which companies admit taking part in a cartel in return for a 10 percent cut in  fines.
Other companies set to be  fined are Elpida Memory Inc, NEC Electronics Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba
Corp, Mitsubishi Electric and Nanya Technology.

Micron Technology received immunity for blowing the whistle on the  cartel and will not be fined for its involvement, one of the two people said. This was confirmed by another source with direct knowledge of the matter.

Samsung Electronics and Hynix are the world's largest and second-largest memory chip makers respectively.
"A decision on  fines is expected on Wednesday," one of the sources said.

They said the total  fine may be up to 300 million  euros ($381 million) and could have been higher without the settlement procedure.

The Commission declined to comment. Competition  Commission Joaquin Almunia will hold a press conference on the issue on Wednesday at 1015 GMT, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Infineon shares gave up some early gains and were trading 0.97 percent higher at 5.09  euros by 1508
GMT. Samsung ended 3.2 percent lower and Hynix closed 5.8 percent lower.

South Korean and U.S. antitrust regulators ended their investigation of the flash memory industry last year, saying there was no evidence of a pricing  cartel.

The Commission, the EU antitrust watchdog, has championed the new procedure as a more effective method to deter violations and a speedier decision-making process. The EU executive can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaking EU laws.

HD        Brussels poised to settle chip cartel case

LP
Europe's competition authorities are this week expected to announce that they have settled their first
cartel case under a controversial "fast track" procedure introduced almost two years ago.

The case is understood to involve a group of up to 10 computer memory chip manufacturers, and a settlement - which has long been rumoured in Brussels' legal circles - is expected to be announced on Wednesday.

TD
It will be closely-watched because of the debate over the European Commission's new settlement system which allows companies suspected of price-fixing to receive a 10 per cent reduction in their fines in return for admitting guilt.

But both lawyers and industry lobbyists have argued that the  fine reduction is too small and an inadequate incentive to settle cases unless evidence is particularly compelling or there is a particular reason for companies to seek to put the matter behind them.

Although EU competition officials in Brussels are understood to have considered using the settlement procedure in a number of instances since this was announced in July 2008, it has taken almost two years to finally secure a deal.

The case in question involves a number of players in the  European market for dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips, which are used in sectors such as computing and telecoms.

Infineon, one of the companies involved in this market, said in a US filing last year that it had received a request for information from the European Commission in connection with alleged anti-competitive practices in the  European market for D-Ram products in April 2003. It added that the authorities in Brussels had opened formal proceedings in February 2009.
A similar probe in the US in 2007 resulted in four companies, including Samsung Electronics, being
fined $731m.

The European penalties, even before the settlement "reduction", are not thought likely to be as large but could run into the hundreds of millions of  euros.

0541 GMT [Dow Jones] Impending  European Commission fine for Hynix Semiconductor (000660.SE) related to memory  price-fixing charges will have limited impact, analysts say. Memory maker said earlier Tuesday received notice from EC that fine amount to be announced Wednesday, following Reuters
report Hynix and eight other firms to be fined as much as EUR300 million. "This isn't why the shares are falling today," says Meritz Securities analyst Lee Sun-tae; estimates firm will pay around KRW100
billion-KRW200 billion in  fines, but notes  fines will be in installments. Shinhan Investment analyst Jin Sung-hye says Hynix set aside around KRW100 billion in provisions for possible  fine as case has been ongoing for some time; company declined to comment about provisioning. Hynix shares down 5.6% at KRW23,650 as market worries that Samsung Electronics' (005930.SE) massive 2010 capex plan could lead to oversupply problems, diminished market share for Hynix.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could fall to 16,750, according to charts.

TD
The Sensex has to move above its short-term resistance at 17,050 to indicate a reversal of the short-term downtrend.

But as long as the index trades below major resistance at 17,330, there would be a strong case for a test of major support at 16,630.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could fall to its short-term support at 5,035.

The Nifty has to move past minor resistance at 5,195 to reinstate a short-term bullish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,950.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks edged up Monday, led by consumer stocks such as Kraft Foods and Procter & Gamble. But continued concerns about the  euro zone sent investors away from industrial companies dependent on global growth, including Caterpillar, along with energy and materials stocks.


Page 15 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Dow's gains were led by its consumer-related components, with Kraft Foods up 1.7% and Procter & Gamble 1.3% higher.

American Express was also strong with a gain of 1.4%. A regulatory filing showed the credit-card company's U.S. borrowers at least a month behind in their card payments declined to 3.1% in April from
3.3% in March.

The Dow's decliners were led by its components with heavier reliance on international demand. Alcoa slipped 2.1%, while Caterpillar dropped 1.7%. Exxon Mobil was also weak, off 0.5%, as crude-oil futures tumbled.

The declines across energy, industrials and materials reflected investors' lingering concerns about the economy despite a string of recent economic reports with numbers showing improvement.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Tuesday, with bargain hunters inspired by the mild gains on
Wall Street Monday.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and New Zealand's NZX-50 were all up while
South Korea's Kospi Composite was down. DJIA futures were 11 points higher in screen trade.

In Tokyo, technology stocks bounced, with demand buoyed by the  euro's bounce off lows against the yen Monday.
Sony was up 0.6%, after falling 4.5% Monday, while Nikon was 1.9% higher and Olympus added 1.3%. South Korean stocks were weighed down by foreign investors' selling.
Hynix was down 3.6% and LG Display lost 3.9% after rival Samsung Electronics on Monday announced a record investment plan, as part of its plan to take a bigger lead in the market for memory chips and components used to make flat-panel televisions.


FOREX
The euro was at $1.2375 against the dollar, from $1.2392 in late New York trade Monday, and at
Y114.47 against the yen, from Y114.64. The dollar was at Y92.48 from Y92.49.


METALS
Copper Monday plunged to a three-month low on the London Metal Exchange due to ongoing concerns about the outlook for the  euro zone. The other metals also traded down to multi-month lows.

Investors still want gold as a refuge amid  European debt worries, but the metal ended near flat around record highs Monday as much of that "safe-haven" premium has already been priced in.
Spot gold was at $1,225.90 per troy ounce, up $1.80 from late New York trade Monday.


OIL SUMMARY
June Nymex crude oil futures were up 52 cents at $70.60 per barrel on Globex, after it settled Monday at
$70.08 per barrel, its lowest settlement since December.

HD         EU To Settle Memory Chip Cartel Case Wednesday - Sources

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The worlds largest memory chip makers are expected to settle their  cartel charges with the  European Commission Wednesday, facing lower  cartel fines as a result, according to people familiar with the case.

South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE), the world's second-largest memory chip maker by revenue, said Tuesday that it has been informed by the  commission that the company will be  fined for price fixing  Wednesday.

TD
The settlement is over the commission's six-year investigation into global  price fixing  of the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, commonly used in personal computers.

Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE), Hynix  Semiconductor (000660.SE) and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), are some of the largest chip manufacturers in the world, which have managed to
negotiate reduced  fines in return for pleading guilty to the charges.

Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd.(6501.TO), Toshiba Corp.(6502.TO), and Nanya Technology (2408.TW), are also expected to be part of the settlement agreement,
according to one person.

U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology (MU), blew the whistle on the  price fixing  and will therefore escape all fines.

The combined fine the companies are facing could be between EUR250 million to EUR500 million said one person.

This will be the first  cartel settlement from the commission, which launched the procedure in 2009, hoping to reduce the number of appeals it faces for cartel decisions.
The companies have already settled the case in the U.S., which means that admitting to guilt in  Europe
won't leave them vulnerable to additional legal challenges, such as class action suits.

Infineon Technologies, pleaded guilty in the U.S. already in 2004 agreeing to pay a $160 million  fine, Korean Hynix Semiconductors and Samsung Electronics both pleaded guilty in 2005 paying $185 million and $300 million to settle the case, respectively.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: U.S. stocks are unlikely to make much headway at Tuesday's open with some key economic data in focus and despite rising  European markets.

"We expect things to calm down a bit as long as we don't get any bad news," said James Hughes at CMC Markets in London. Rising oil prices are expected to help, he said, although currency movements are still expected to dominate direction.

TD
Housing starts data before the open could lift sentiment, Hughes said, although "any figures below expectations could give us a big move - it doesn't take much to give us a big move right now."
Producer prices data for April are also due for release Tuesday.

At 1048 GMT, S&P 500 futures were up 5.65 points at 1140.15, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 8.75 points at 1922.25 and Dow industrial futures were up 14 points at 10,637.

EUROPEAN MARKETS:  European stocks are pushing higher midday, with the  Euro Stoxx 50 index trading 1.8% higher at 2681.82. Utilities, banks and basic resources are all posting strong gains. RWE is up 1.4%, Societe Generale up 4.6% and Kazakhmys up 3%. Elsewhere, Deutsche Boerse is 1.5%
higher after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to neutral from sell. Traders are looking to the U.S. producer price index and housing starts data for further direction.

London's FTSE 100 is up 1% at 5314.07, extending gains as mining stocks and utilities advance; Kazakhmys is up 2.3% and United Utilities up 3.6%. ICAP is 4.5% higher after the stock was upgraded to buy from hold by Panmure Gordon, while British Land is up 2.7% after well-received results. Bucking the trend, however, Prudential is down 1.7% following the release of the terms of its rights issue, as many market participants think it intends to pay too much for AIA.

Bunds and gilts are lower. At 1025 GMT, June bunds were down 0.03 at 126.57, while June gilts were down 0.23 at 117.70.

A slightly more positive tone has returned to foreign-exchange markets in  European trading hours, with the euro stabilizing, while safe-haven currencies like the yen have edged lower. At 1025 GMT, the
dollar was up at Y92.80, the  euro was up at $1.2425 and the pound was flat at $1.4470.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The world's largest memory chip makers are expected to settle their  cartel charges with the  European Commission Wednesday, facing lower  cartel fines as a result, according to people familiar with the case.

The pending settlement is over the commission's six-year investigation into global  price fixing  of the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, commonly used in personal computers.

South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE), the world's second-largest memory chip maker by revenue, said Tuesday that it has been informed by the  commission that the company will be  fined for price fixing  Wednesday.

But the fees are likely to be lower than in a regular  cartel case, due to the companies having pleaded guilty to the  commission's antitrust charges.

In addition to Hynix, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) and Germany's Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE) have managed to negotiate reduced  fines in return for pleading guilty to the charges, according to one of the people familiar with the case.

Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd.(6501.TO), Toshiba Corp.(6502.TO), and Taiwan's Nanya Technology (2408.TW), are also expected to be part of the settlement agreement, according to one person.

U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology (MU), blew the whistle on the  price fixing  and will therefore escape all fines.

The combined fine the companies are facing could be between EUR250 million to EUR500 million said one person.
This would be the first  cartel settlement reached by the commission, which launched the procedure in
2009, hoping to reduce the number of appeals it faces for cartel decisions.
The companies have already settled the case in the U.S., which means that admitting to guilt in  Europe
won't leave them vulnerable to additional legal challenges, such as class action suits.

Infineon Technologies, pleaded guilty in the U.S. already in 2004 agreeing to pay a $160 million  fine, and Hynix Semiconductors and Samsung Electronics both pleaded guilty in 2005 paying $185 million and $300 million to settle the case, respectively.

Officials at Elpida, Hitachi and Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723.TO)--the merged entity between NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology--said that they are aware that the  European authorities have been investigating them on  cartel charges. Elpida's spokesman said that the company has heard that the E.U.'s decision may come Wednesday but had no further details.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
SEOUL -(Dow Jones)- South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE), the world's
second-largest memory chip maker by revenue, said Tuesday that it has received notice from the
European Commission that it is facing a  fine for price-fixing charges and that the amount of the  fine
will be announced Wednesday.

A Hynix spokeswoman said the company has no further details at this time, including which other companies are involved.

European investigators had been looking into allegations for several years that the world's biggest computer memory chip companies colluded over prices and output. The U.S. authorities conducted similar investigation and ended up fining companies like Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), Hynix and Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE).

Reuters earlier cited unnamed sources as saying that Samsung, Hynix and seven other memory chip makers are expected to face  fines from the European Union this week on charges of illegally fixing prices. One of the unnamed sources said the total fine could be up to EUR300 million.

Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker by revenue, said it hasn't been contacted by the European Commission about the matter and declined to comment further.

The Reuters report said the other seven firms to be  fined are Infineon, Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Electric (6503.TO) and Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

Officials at Elpida, Hitachi and Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723.TO)--the merged entity between NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology-said that they are aware that the  European authorities have been investigating them on  cartel charges. Elpida's spokesman said that the company has heard that the E.U.'s decision may come Wednesday but had no further details.

Toshiba and Mitsubishi declined to comment, while Infineon and Nanya couldn't be immediately reached for comment.

Germany-based semiconductor manufacturer Infineon and eight other chipset manufacturers have reached an agreement with the European Commission about a fine for illegal price fixing,  according to the Financial Times Deutschland citing sources from Brussels. The nine manufacturers have accepted fines with a total value of EUR 300 million, while US-based manufacturer Micron will have to pay nothing as they unveiled the  cartel. The price fixing cartel was for the  DRAM storage chips and the other accused companies are Samsung Electronics, Hynix, Micron Technology , Elpida, NEC , Hitachi , Mitsubishi Electric , Toshiba and Nanya.

HD           Chip Makers to Settle EU Cartel Charges

BRUSSELS—The world's largest memory-chip makers are expected to settle their  cartel charges with the European Commission Wednesday, facing lower  cartel fines as a result, according to people familiar with the case.

The pending settlement is over the commission's six-year investigation into global  price fixing  of the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, commonly used in personal computers.

TD
South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc., the world's second-largest memory-chip maker by revenue, said Tuesday that it has been informed by the  commission that the company will be  fined for price   fixing  Wednesday.

But the fees are likely to be lower than in a regular  cartel case, due to the companies having pleaded guilty to the  commission's antitrust charges.

In addition to Hynix, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.and Germany's Infineon Technologies AG have managed to negotiate reduced  fines in return for pleading guilty to the charges, according to one of the people familiar with the case.

Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc., NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., and Taiwan's Nanya Technology, are also expected to be part of the settlement agreement, according to one person.
U.S. chip maker Micron Technology, blew the whistle on the  price fixing  and will therefore escape all
fines.
The combined fine the companies are facing could be between €250 million and €500 million
(between $309.6 million and $619.2 million), said one person.

This will be the first  cartel settlement from the commission, which launched the procedure in 2009, hoping to reduce the number of appeals it faces for cartel decisions.
The companies have already settled the case in the U.S., which means that admitting to guilt in
Europe won't leave them vulnerable to additional legal challenges, such as class action suits.

Infineon Technologies pleaded guilty in the U.S. already in 2004, agreeing to pay a $160 million  fine, and Hynix Semiconductors and Samsung Electronics both pleaded guilty in 2005, paying $185 million and $300 million to settle the case, respectively.

Officials at Elpida, Hitachi and Renesas Electronics Corp.—the merged entity between NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology—said that they are aware that the  European authorities have been investigating them on  cartel charges. Elpida's spokesman said that the company has heard that the EU's decision may come Wednesday but had no further details.

The other companies involved are Micron Technology Inc. (MU), Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Electric (6503.TO) and Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korean memory chip maker Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE) said
Tuesday that it has received notice from the European Commission that it is facing a  fine for
price-fixing charges and that the amount of the fine will be announced Wednesday.

A Hynix spokeswoman said the company has no further details at this time, including which other companies are involved.

Reuters earlier cited unnamed sources as saying that Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), Hynix and seven other memory chip makers are expected to face  fines from the European Union this week on charges of illegally fixing prices. One of the unnamed sources said the total fine could be up to EUR300 million.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE), the world's
second-largest memory chip maker by revenue, said Tuesday that it has received notice from the
European Commission that it is facing a  fine for price-fixing charges and that the amount of the  fine
will be announced Wednesday.

A Hynix spokeswoman said the company has no further details at this time, including which other companies are involved.

European investigators had been looking into allegations for several years that the world's biggest computer memory chip companies colluded over prices and output. The U.S. authorities conducted similar investigation and ended up fining companies like Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), Hynix and Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE).

Reuters earlier cited unnamed sources as saying that Samsung, Hynix and seven other memory chip makers are expected to face  fines from the European Union this week on charges of illegally fixing prices. One of the unnamed sources said the total fine could be up to EUR300 million.

Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker by revenue, said it hasn't been contacted by the European Commission about the matter and declined to comment further.

The Reuters report said the other seven firms to be  fined are Infineon, Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Electric (6503.TO) and Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

Officials at Elpida, Hitachi and Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723.TO)--the merged entity between NEC Electronics and Renesas Technology-said that they are aware that the  European authorities have been investigating them on  cartel charges. Elpida's spokesman said that the company has heard that the E.U.'s decision may come Wednesday but had no further details.

Toshiba and Mitsubishi declined to comment, while Infineon and Nanya couldn't be immediately reached for comment.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could fall to 16,750, according to charts.

TD
The Sensex has to move above its short-term resistance at 17,050 to indicate a reversal of the short-term downtrend.

But as long as the index trades below major resistance at 17,330, there would be a strong case for a test of major support at 16,630.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could fall to its short-term support at 5,035.

The Nifty has to move past minor resistance at 5,195 to reinstate a short-term bullish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,950.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks edged up Monday, led by consumer stocks such as Kraft Foods and Procter & Gamble. But continued concerns about the  euro zone sent investors away from industrial companies dependent on global growth, including Caterpillar, along with energy and materials stocks.


Page 52 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Dow's gains were led by its consumer-related components, with Kraft Foods up 1.7% and Procter & Gamble 1.3% higher.

American Express was also strong with a gain of 1.4%. A regulatory filing showed the credit-card company's U.S. borrowers at least a month behind in their card payments declined to 3.1% in April from
3.3% in March.

The Dow's decliners were led by its components with heavier reliance on international demand. Alcoa slipped 2.1%, while Caterpillar dropped 1.7%. Exxon Mobil was also weak, off 0.5%, as crude-oil futures tumbled.

The declines across energy, industrials and materials reflected investors' lingering concerns about the economy despite a string of recent economic reports with numbers showing improvement.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Tuesday, with bargain hunters inspired by the mild gains on
Wall Street Monday.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and New Zealand's NZX-50 were all up while
South Korea's Kospi Composite was down. DJIA futures were 11 points higher in screen trade.

In Tokyo, technology stocks bounced, with demand buoyed by the  euro's bounce off lows against the yen Monday.
Sony was up 0.6%, after falling 4.5% Monday, while Nikon was 1.9% higher and Olympus added 1.3%. South Korean stocks were weighed down by foreign investors' selling.
Hynix was down 3.6% and LG Display lost 3.9% after rival Samsung Electronics on Monday announced a record investment plan, as part of its plan to take a bigger lead in the market for memory chips and components used to make flat-panel televisions.


FOREX
The euro was at $1.2375 against the dollar, from $1.2392 in late New York trade Monday, and at
Y114.47 against the yen, from Y114.64. The dollar was at Y92.48 from Y92.49.


METALS
Copper Monday plunged to a three-month low on the London Metal Exchange due to ongoing concerns about the outlook for the  euro zone. The other metals also traded down to multi-month lows.

Investors still want gold as a refuge amid  European debt worries, but the metal ended near flat around record highs Monday as much of that "safe-haven" premium has already been priced in.
Spot gold was at $1,225.90 per troy ounce, up $1.80 from late New York trade Monday.


OIL SUMMARY
June Nymex crude oil futures were up 52 cents at $70.60 per barrel on Globex, after it settled Monday at
$70.08 per barrel, its lowest settlement since December.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could fall to 16,750, according to charts.

TD
The Sensex has to move above its short-term resistance at 17,050 to indicate a reversal of the short-term downtrend.

But as long as the index trades below major resistance at 17,330, there would be a strong case for a test of major support at 16,630.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could fall to its short-term support at 5,035.

The Nifty has to move past minor resistance at 5,195 to reinstate a short-term bullish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,950.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks edged up Monday, led by consumer stocks such as Kraft Foods and Procter & Gamble. But continued concerns about the  euro zone sent investors away from industrial companies dependent on global growth, including Caterpillar, along with energy and materials stocks.


Page 75 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Dow's gains were led by its consumer-related components, with Kraft Foods up 1.7% and Procter & Gamble 1.3% higher.

American Express was also strong with a gain of 1.4%. A regulatory filing showed the credit-card company's U.S. borrowers at least a month behind in their card payments declined to 3.1% in April from
3.3% in March.

The Dow's decliners were led by its components with heavier reliance on international demand. Alcoa slipped 2.1%, while Caterpillar dropped 1.7%. Exxon Mobil was also weak, off 0.5%, as crude-oil futures tumbled.

The declines across energy, industrials and materials reflected investors' lingering concerns about the economy despite a string of recent economic reports with numbers showing improvement.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian stock markets were mostly higher Tuesday, with bargain hunters inspired by the mild gains on
Wall Street Monday.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and New Zealand's NZX-50 were all up while

(ADPnews) - May 18, 2010 - German chipmaker Infineon (ETR:IFXA) and eight other firms have agreed to pay fines to settle charges of illegally fixing prices, Financial Times Deutschland reported on Tuesday, citing informed sources.
The settlement with the  European Commission might be officially announced this week, perhaps on
Wednesday, the report said.

TD
The companies involved in the affair will pay a combined  fine of EUR 300 million (USD 372m). Micron
(NASDAQ:MU) will be spared a penalty because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

Infineon has acknowledged fixing  DRAM memory chip prices with Samsung Electronics (SEO:005935), Hynix (SEO:000660), Micron, Elpida (TYO:6665), NEC (TYO:6701), (Hitachi:TYO:4217), Mitsubishi Electric (TYO:6503), Toshiba (TYO:6502) and Nanya (TPE:2408).
Samsung Electronics is the world's largest maker of memory chips, followed by Hynix.

This is the first case under the new procedure introduced by the  Commission in 2008, which allows up to 10% reduction in  fines if a company admits breaking the law.

BRUSSELS, May 19 (Xinhua) — The European Commission on Wednesday adopted its first settlement decision in a  cartel case and fined 10companies a total of 331 million  euros (406 million U.S. dollars) for controlling the price of computer memory chips.

The 10 companies _ Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya, which produce Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips for computers, manipulated the market via sharing secret information from July 1998 until June 2002, the  Commission said in a statement.

TD
However, Micron was not  fined since it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. The Commission also took account of other players for their cooperation in the investigation and granted different reductions for them.

Among the 10 companies, Samsung took the highest  fine of 145.7 million  euros (178.8 million dollars), compared with other firms, which were levied from 1.8 million (2.2 million dollars) to 56 million  euros (68.7 million dollars).
The fines took into account the sales of the companies involved in the  European Economic Area
(EEA), the serious nature of the infringement and its geographical scope,the statement said.
"This first settlement decision is another milestone in the  Commission's anti-cartel enforcement,” said
Joaquin Almunia,  Commission Vice President and Competition Commissioner.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the  Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," he said.

The EU Commission fined the world's biggest memory chip makers, including Samsung, Infineon and
Toshiba, a total of 331 million  euros (403 million dollars) on Wednesday for operating a  cartel.
The biggest  fine, of 145 million  euros, was handed down to South Korea's Samsung Electronics.

Germany's Infineon Technologies was  fined 56.7 million euros while South Korea's Hynix

Others fined for being part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, NEC Electronics and Elpida Memory as well as Taiwan's Nanya.
US chip maker Micron Technology blew the whistle on the  price fixing cartel and therefore escaped a
fine.

The European Commission said the overall fines had been reduced by 10 percent after the companies acknowledged their involvement in the  cartel.

Some of the individual companies involved also had their  fines reduced by up to 45 percent, in the case of Infineon, for cooperating with the long-running investigation and for what the  commission said were "mitigating circumstances."
Samsung's  fine was reduced by 18 percent.
It was the first time such a settlement has been reached in a  cartel case.
"The companies concerned have acknowledged that they coordinated prices," said EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The actions of the  cartel forced computer makers and others to push up the costs of finished products to consumers, he said.

The cartel was first busted in the United States in 2005 for  price-fixing of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, widely used in computers and other electronics.

In November 2005, Samsung pleaded guilty in the US to participating in the conspiracy and agreed to pay a 300-million-dollar fine, the second largest criminal antitrust  fine in American history.
The case marked the shift of  price-fixing into the technological age.
Six senior Samsumg executives also received prison terms in the US as a result of the case. pvh/rt/bmm

The EU Commission fined the world's biggest memory chip makers, including Samsung, Infineon and
Toshiba, a total of 331 million  euros (403 million dollars) on Wednesday for operating a  cartel.

The biggest  fine, of 145 million  euros, was handed down to South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world's top computer memory chip maker, for its part in the  cartel which shared confidential information and coordinated prices.

TD
Germany's Infineon Technologies was  fined 56.7 million euros while South Korea's Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. will have to pay 51.5 million  euros.

Others fined for being part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, NEC Electronics and Elpida Memory as well as Taiwan's Nanya.
US chip maker Micron Technology blew the whistle on the  price fixing cartel and therefore escaped a
fine.

The European Commission said the overall fines had been reduced by 10 percent after the companies acknowledged their involvement in the  cartel.

Some of the individual companies involved also had their  fines reduced by up to 45 percent, in the case of Infineon, for cooperating with the long-running investigation and for what the  commission said were "mitigating circumstances."

Infineon was the only  European company involved, but all the members of the  cartel which operated from 1998-2002 sold their products in  Europe.
Samsung's  fine was reduced by 18 percent.
It was the first time such a settlement has been reached in a  cartel case.
"The companies concerned have acknowledged that they coordinated prices," said EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"This first settlement decision is another milestone in the  Commission's anti-cartel enforcement. By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," he said.
As the procedure is applied to new cases it is expected to speed up investigations significantly, the EU
commissioner added, as it would offer a simplified procedure.

The actions of the  cartel forced computer makers and others to push up the costs of finished products to consumers, he said.

The cartel was first busted in the United States in 2005 for  price-fixing of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, widely used in computers and other electronics.

In November 2005, Samsung pleaded guilty in the US to participating in the conspiracy and agreed to pay a 300-million-dollar fine in what was the second largest criminal antitrust  fine in American history.
The case marked the shift of  price-fixing into the technological age.
Six senior Samsumg executives also received prison terms in the US as a result of the case. pvh/rt/hd

BRUSSELS (AP) - The  European Union fined 10 producers of memory chips, including Samsung, a combined euro331 million ($403 million) on Wednesday for colluding in a  price-fixing cartel.

The EU Commission said that the companies, mostly non-European, rigged the market between 1998 and 2002 by sharing secret information which allowed them to set prices and quotations for Dynamic Random Access Memory chips in  Europe.

TD
Samsung of South Korea received the biggest  fine of euro145 million ($177 million). Germany's Infineon was fined euro56 million and Hynix euro51 million. Micron escaped a  fine because it brought the case to the European Commission.

The case was the first time companies accused of  price-fixing cooperated with the EU  Commission to reach an agreement. The companies received a 10 percent reduction in  fines because it reduced the costs and time of the investigation.

"This first settlement decision is another milestone in the Commission's anti-cartel enforcement," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "The Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels."

Almunia said there were several more such settlements in the pipeline but refused to elaborate. He insisted that the use of settlements did not soften the  Commission's stance on the illegal practice.
"We are not compromising on cartels," he told reporters. "We will continue to be clearly against cartels." Over the past decade, the EU  Commission has struck across the globe to impose massive fines on
multinationals which fix prices. In 2008 France's Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA had to pay euro896
million in a car glass cartel case where fines totaled  euro1.38 billion. The sectors are as diverse as the
fines, ranging from elevators to vitamins to paraffin and beer.
In the microchip case, Almunia said the companies set up a network of contacts to set the price for
DRAMs they sold to big personal computer or server producers in  Europe.

Seven years after the cartel, the companies involved started discussing the case with the  Commission, seeking a settlement. The Commission agreed with the settlement after the companies "clearly and unequivocally acknowledged their respective liability," the  Commission said in a statement.

LP
A group of nine chipmakers agreed to pay a  fine of 331.2 million ($403.5 million) to settle a  price-fixing case brought by European Union antitrust regulators, making it the first-ever settlement in a charge of cartellisation.

The cartel operated between 1 July 1998, and 15 June 2002, and " involved a network of contacts and sharing of secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, through which they coordinated the price levels and quotations for  DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory), sold to major PC or server original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the EEA.  DRAMs is a common model for "dynamic" semiconductor memories for personal computers (PCs), servers and workstations, said the Commission in a statement.

TD
The biggest  fine was levied on the market leader in chips, South Korea's Samsung with 145.7 million, followed by Germany's Infineon with 145.7 million.

Others involved in the  price fixing  were Hynix Semiconductor, Elpida Memory, NEC Electronics, Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric and Nanya Technology, while Micron of the US, escaped paying any fine since it first reported the  cartel to the European Commission in 2002.

"This first settlement decision is another milestone in the  Commission's anti-cartel enforcement. By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels. As the procedure is applied to new cases it is expected to speed up investigations significantly, said Commission vice president and Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
Since all companies agreed to the settlement, they were  fined 10 per cent less, Samasung saved
about 20 per cent less  fine and Infineon about 50 per cent, partly because of agreeing to the settlement
and partly because of other leniency arrangements.

Hynix was fined 51.5 million, Toshiba 17.6 million, Mitsubishi 16.6 million, Nanya 1.8 million, NEC 10.3 million and jointly with Elpida and Hitachi got a 8.5 million and another joint one with Hitachi of 2.1 million.

In its first out-of-court settlement in a  cartel case, the European Union has fined computer memory manufacturers that it said artificially fixed prices for computer memory.
Ten computer chip manufacturers will pay  fines totaling 331 million  euros ($409 million) as part of a
European Union legal settlement for conspiring to fix the prices of memory chips.

TD
The European Commission said the companies coordinated prices and quotes for Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, chips sold to  European computer makers from July 1998 to June 2002. DRAM chips are used to store data in personal computers and video games.

The Commission alleged that the firms, including Germany's Infineon as well as Micron, Hynix, Samsung, Elpida, Hitachi, NEC, Nanya, Mitsubishi and Toshiba, had formed a  cartel and formally charged them in early 2009. US-based Micron had confessed to the practice first, triggering the investigation and winning immunity from prosecution for themselves. Six of the companies that had cooperated with the investigation were rewarded with a 10 percent reduction in their  fines.
Samsung paid the largest  fine, 145.7 million  euros. The other  fines ranged from 1.8 million to 56 million
euros.
This is the first time the  Commission has used an out-of-court settlement to deal with a  cartel.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a statement. "The next settlement cases will take... no more than six months, in some cases less. This will allow us to concentrate our resources on more  cartel cases in the future."

Earlier Wednesday, the commission fined the world's largest memory chip makers a total of EUR331 million for operating a cartel, in its first settlement deal.

The largest  fine in the cartel went to South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) at EUR145 million. South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE) will have to pay EUR51.5 million.

Other companies  fined as part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd. (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.TO) and Taiwan's Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

U.S. chip maker Micron Technology (MU) blew the whistle on the  cartel and has escaped sanction as a result.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The world's largest computer memory chip makers were Wednesday  fined a total of EUR331 million by the  European Commission for admitting they operated a  cartel in the commission's first settlement deal.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.'s (005930.SE) EUR145.7 million  fine was the highest in the cartel. Germany's Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE) faces a EUR56.7 million  fine, while South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE) will have to pay EUR51.5 million.

Other companies  fined as part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Corp. (6701.TO), Hitachi Ltd. (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Electric. (6503.TO) and Taiwan's Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

U.S. chip maker Micron Technology (MU) blew the whistle on the  price fixing  and as a result escapes all fines.
All fines were cut by 10% because the companies admitted the  cartel charges, the  commission said. The settlement discussions in the Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D-Ram, cartel started
February 2009 after the companies said they were ready to discuss a possible settlement.

As part of the process all companies have formally acknowledged their respective liability in the case, which means they can't later appeal the  commission's decision.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The cartel operated between 1998 and 2002. During that time, the companies shared secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, which allowed them to coordinate the price levels for D-Ram, sold to major computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Dell Inc. (DELL) in Europe, the commission said.

Almunia said the settlement shortened the  commission's decision procedure and the lessons learnt in the process will speed up "several more settlement cases in the pipeline," to no more than six months, and sometimes less.

Goetz Drauz, a partner at Howrey which represented one of the companies in the  cartel, said companies which went through the  commission's settlement process have more to gain than just the
10% reduction in fines. Participating in a settlement means companies can, to some extent, influence the commission's opinion on the timing of the  cartel and affected turnover, which in turn can substantially reduce final  fines, Drauz said.

Samsung said it accepts the  commission's findings and would ensure its future operations meet antitrust scrutiny.

"Samsung has established a compliance team that will develop guidelines for improving systems and employee training," it said in a statement.

Infineon said the  fine won't affect its fiscal 2010 result, as the company had "made provisions." Hitachi and NEC also said the  fine would have no impact on their earnings.

Toshiba said it decided to settle to avoid the "expenses, inconvenience and distraction resulting from further protracted litigation."
Elpida said it would follow the decision.

Mitsubishi Electric said it would decide what to do after thoroughly looking into the  commission's notification.

Shares of the nation's major PC memory chipmakers plunged by more than 4 percent this year on growing concern that industry leader Samsung Electronics Co's record capital expenditures this year could jeopardize an anticipated supply constraint in the second half.

Share prices of Nanya Technology Corp, the nation's top maker of PC memory chips, or  DRAM, tumbled 4.19 percent to NT$25.15, rebounding from a 5.33 percent decline in the middle of trading yesterday.

TD
"People are just terrified by Samsung's [announcement]," Nanya Technology spokesman Pai Pei-lin said. "We don't think it will have any impact [on the supply-demand situation] this year, as it will take between one and two years to complete construction of a new factory."

With a limited increase in new supply, the Taoyuan-based chipmaker expected an explosive growth in company revenues and net profits in the second half of this year, boosted by corporate and consumer demand for PC replacements.

Samsung said on Monday it intends to spend a total of 18 trillion won (US$15.84 billion) in capital spending this year, of which 9 trillion won would be spent on memory business and 5 trillion won on LCD business, the company said in a statement on its Web site.

Shares of the nation's major  DRAM players Powerchip Semiconductor Corp, ProMOS Technologies Inc and Intoera Memories Inc, a joint venture between Nanya Technology and US memory giant Micron Technology Inc, dropped 4.73 percent, 5.83 percent and 5.42 percent to close at NT$4.43, NT$1.94 and NT$19.20 respectively.
The benchmark TAIEX was down 0.18 percent yesterday.

Nanya shares were also shaken by reports that the Taiwanese chipmaker would be among the 10 global memory chip companies, including Samsung and Hynix  Semiconductor Inc, facing  fines totaling US$381 million for  price-fixing, with a ruling expected to be announced today following a nearly two-year probe by the Competition  Commission, the European anti-trust watchdog.
"We do not have any information about the expected ruling from the EU," Pai said.

Samsung's increase in capital spending exacerbated rising concerns that weakening demand could cause a pileup of excess inventory, which sent Taiwan's LCD panel shares down yesterday.

Chimei Innolux Corp shares dropped 6.46 percent after the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported yesterday that the panel maker was cutting prices to clear excess inventory during the
slack second quarter.

However, Chimei Innolux, the nation's biggest LCD panel maker, denied the report and said it had kept inventory at normal levels.

(ADPnews) - May 19, 2010 - The blue-chip DAX index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ended the trading day at 5,988.67 points, down 2.72% or 167.26 points from the previous close.
The stock markets were rattled today as Germany's financial watchdog BaFin banned the "naked"
short-selling of shares in the country's major financial institutions and  eurozone government bonds. The
ban, caused by the extreme volatility of the  eurozone government bonds, is valid from May 19, 2010
until March 31, 2011. Investors are wandering what other regulations might follow and prefer to proceed
with caution and cash in, traders said.

DAX futures went down 2.41% to 5,963.
During today's session, the index touched a high of 6,124.81 and a low of 5,972.17 points.

There were only losers today. In deepest red closed carmaker BMW (ETR:BMW) which fell 6.68% to EUR 37. Ex-dividend day sent the stock downhill today, but that was not all of it. The company said it would recall 122,000 motorcycles worldwide due to a glitch in the brake systems. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch downgraded the recommendation on the stock to "underperform" from "neutral" while keeping he EUR 35 share price target. According to analyst Harald Hendrikse, investors fail to see promising prospects for the recovery of the  European car market all the way to the end of 2011.
Second worst-performer was  semiconductor maker Infineon (ETR:IFX), which lost 6.35% to EUR
4.732. The EU  commission imposed on Wednesday a  cartel fine on the German company and nine
other firms over illegal price rigging. According to information acquired by news agency Reuters, Infineon
will have to pay EUR 56.7 million from a total of EUR 331 million in  fines.

Carmaker Daimler (ETR:DAI) followed, slipping 4.09% to EUR 40.20. The German giant will have to provide the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with an account of possible glitches in the airbag systems of the Mercedes passenger vehicles, a Mercedes spokesman said today. NHTSA currently investigated a number of cases involving malfunction of the airbag control lights.

Shares worth EUR 5.138 billion changed hands on Wednesday. The most actively traded stock was Siemens (ETR:SIE) accounting for EUR 587.3 million of the total trading volume. Its shares ended the day 2.75% down to EUR 74.35 on Xetra.

BRUSSELS, May 19 (Reuters) - Nine memory chip makers, including world leader Samsung Electronics, were  fined a total 331 million  euros ($411 million) by EU regulators on Wednesday for illegally fixing prices.

The EU antitrust watchdog levied its biggest penalty of 145.73 million  euros against Samsung, while Infineon was  fined 56.70 million and Hynix  Semiconductor 51.47 million for a  cartel of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chip makers that operated from July 1998 to June 2002.

The other companies in the  cartel were Hitachi Ltd, which received a  fine of 20.41 million  euros, Toshiba Corp 17.64 million, Mitsubishi Electric 16.61 million and Nanya Technology 1.80 million.

Elpida Memory Inc was  fined 8.50 million euros jointly with NEC Corp and Hitachi, while NEC Corp took a 2.12 million euro hit jointly with Hitachi during their joint venture period. NEC got a separate
20.41 million euro fine.
Micron Technology received immunity and no  fine for blowing the whistle on the  cartel in 2002. Samsung Electronics and Hynix are the world's largest and second-largest memory chip makers
respectively.  DRAM chips are used in personal computers, printers, mobile phones and game
consoles.

The case is the first under a European Commission settlement procedure introduced in July 2008 in which companies admit taking part in a cartel in return for a 10 percent cut in  fines.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the  Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The Commission has championed the new procedure as a more effective method to deter violations and speed up the decision-making process. It can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaking EU laws.

CHARTING THE SENSEX
The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share Sensitive Index could rise to 16,475, according to charts.

TD
Though there is a possibility of a minor counter-trend rally, the short-term trend remains bearish. The Sensex has to move above major resistance at 16,740 to indicate a reversal of the short-term downtrend.
Minor support for the index is at 16,365, a breach of which would trigger a fall to major support at
16,150.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could rise to its short-term resistance at 4,935.

The Nifty has to move past major resistance at 4,990 to suggest a reversal of the bearish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,875.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, led by such industrial companies such as Caterpillar, Boeing and 3M as investors worried that the weak  euro could hurt the profits of companies that do business in the  euro zone. The declines wiped out the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's gain for the year.


Page 108 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Caterpillar was the Dow's worst performer with a drop of 2.8%. Boeing fell 2.2% and 3M slipped 1.1%.

The Dow's financial stocks rose as the Senate prepared to vote on whether to end the debate on legislation overhauling U.S. financial regulation.

After the market closed, the motion to cut off debate fell short of the 60 votes needed. Bank of America ended up 2.3%, while J.P. Morgan advanced 0.9%.
Hewlett-Packard was also strong, with a gain of 0.5%. The company's fiscal second quarter profit grew
28% on higher worldwide sales and profit growth in its core personal-computer business.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian shares were mixed Thursday, with bargain hunters entering some markets after sharp declines recently. In Tokyo, Resona Holdings surged on a report that it planned to begin repaying a 2003 Y2 trillion public fund infusion.
Confidence picked up a little as Wall Street's losses Wednesday were relatively mild.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average and South Korea's Kospi Composite were down while Australia's
S&P/ASX 200 was up and New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were
35 points higher in screen trade.

In Tokyo market, investors were taking a neutral stance to gross domestic product data released before the market opened, said Yumi Nishimura, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets deputy general manager.

Real GDP increased 4.9% on an annualized pace in the January-March period, marking the fourth straight quarter of gain. That was the fastest economic growth since April-June of 2009, but missed the annualized 5.9% growth expected by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
Automakers were weak with Toyota Motor down 2.0% and Honda Motor 1.7% lower.

Resona Holdings surged 6.7% as investors cheered a Nikkei report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the bank was negotiating with the government to begin repaying Y2 trillion in public funds.

In Seoul, brokerages were weak with Daewoo Securities down 0.5% but auto makers rose on bargain-hunting with Kia Motors up 1.5%.


FOREX
The euro was at $1.2382 from $1.2391 in late New York trade Wednesday, and at Y113.53 from
Y113.41. The dollar was at Y91.69 from Y91.54.


METALS
Worries about  euro-zone economies sent platinum and palladium to near-two-month lows but failed to support gold as a safe haven. The yellow metal dipped as investors felt less need for a refuge with market talk that  European officials will step in to support the  euro. Initial refuge-buying after Germany's ban on some bearish bets also wore off.
Base metals on the London Metal Exchange traded lower Wednesday as depressed sentiment from
Europe weighed on equities and commodities.
Spot gold was at $1.193.70 per troy ounce, up $2.20 from late New York trade Wednesday.


OIL SUMMARY
June Nymex crude oil futures were up $1.07 at $70.94 per barrel on Globex. The June contract expires
Thursday and the more actively traded July contract was up 38 cents at $72.86 per barrel.

The European Union fined a group of computer chip makers 331.3 million  euros ($409 million) on Wednesday for price fixing  in the first use of a new procedure that allows settlement of  cartel cases in Europe.

The European competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said on Wednesday that because of the new procedure, he expected to handle some cases in less than six months from the time that a  cartel was discovered or reported, The New York Times's James Kanter reported.

TD
In the past, some  cartel cases have taken close to a decade to complete in  Europe, largely because of lengthy investigation times. The case involving the chip makers was already six years old when the new procedure was introduced in 2008.

An important goal of the new policy was to bring long-running investigations "to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," Mr. Almunia said.

The settlement announced Wednesday involved dynamic random-access memory chips, or  DRAMs, which provide the main memory for personal computers.

Samsung of South Korea, the market leader, received the highest  fine, 145.7 million  euros, or $185 million; Infineon of Germany was second at 56.7 million  euros.

Those amounts were less than they could have been - about 20 percent for Samsung and about 50 percent for Infineon - partly because of the new procedure, which grants companies that settle a reduction in the penalties, and partly because of other leniency arrangements based on the level of cooperation with the inquiry.

Other companies in the settlement included Hynix of South Korea; the Japanese companies Elpida, NEC, Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba; and Nanya Technology of Taiwan.

The new procedure is partly aimed at cutting down investigation times by reducing the burden of casework on the commission in exchange for companies admitting that they participated in a  cartel and agreeing to pay a certain level of  fine.

The commission probably will use the new procedure in certain cases to try to clear a backlog of dozens of cases that have accumulated as a result of incentives that were introduced early in the decade.

Those incentives, which are separate from the new settlement procedure, are intended to encourage companies to cooperate during the investigation stage and can result in lower  fines.

Ordinarily the  commission fixes the fines without knowledge on the part of the companies involved. The companies then often appeal that decision to the general court, the  European Union's highest tribunal after the  European Court of Justice, where judges have frequently faulted the  commission's procedures.


Page 113 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's a matter of common sense," Mr. Almunia said. "If the company is ready to settle, I hope they will not spend more time in an appeal that can trigger for them not only positive potential consequences but potential negative consequences."

In addition to the automatic 10 percent reduction in their penalty by agreeing to a settlement, companies should also gain from using the new settlement procedure by resolving cases more speedily without having to divulge as much detail about the cartels in which they participated. Those details can be used by consumers to sue for further damages in the United States and sometimes in Europe.

Antitrust experts warned Wednesday that the  commission would need to accelerate the way it dealt with its other procedures to speed up  cartel cases significantly.

HD     Chipmakers fined $403M in cartel case; EU hits Samsung, nine other firms for price-fixing

Samsung Electronics Co., Infineon Technologies AG, and Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. are among nine chipmakers who have agreed to pay a total of $429 million in the first settlement of a  price-fixing case with European Union antitrust regulators.
Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Elpida Memory Inc., Hitachi Ltd., Nanya Technology Corp., Toshiba Corp. and
NEC Corp. also agreed to pay  fines as part of the settlement.

TD
Micron Technology Inc., the whistleblower in the case, received immunity, the  commission said in a statement Wednesday.
Samsung will pay the biggest  fine of $188.7 million, followed by Infineon, which will pay $73.4 million. "The companies concerned have acknowledged that they co-ordinated prices," said EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," Almunia said in a statement.

The settlement is the first time the Brussels-based  commission has reached an agreement with companies involved in a price-fixing probe.

All companies that agree to the settlement terms as proposed by the  commission receive a 10-per-cent reduction in their  fine.
"Several more settlement cases (are) in the pipeline," Almunia told reporters.

A U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe into computer memory chips used in mobile phones and computers resulted in four companies, including Samsung, the world's largest computer- memory maker, being fined $731 million U.S. Samsung executives were convicted of criminal charges in the U.S. probe.

Infineon spokesman Kay Laudien said the company welcomed a decision had been made "after so long." It "will have no impact on our earnings as it will in its entirety be taken out of reserves set aside," the spokesman said.

Under the settlements, Hynix was fined $66.7 million, Toshiba $22.8 million, Mitsubishi $21.5 million and Nanya $2.3 million. NEC was fined $13.3 million and jointly with Elpida and Hitachi got a $11-million penalty and another joint one with Hitachi of $2.7 million.

"Hynix has already set aside provisioning for the  fines and therefore there shouldn't be any impact on the company's financials," said Park Seong Ae, a spokeswoman at the Ichon, South Korea-based company.

Page 119 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Officials for several of the companies agreed they had accepted the  fines and did not expect them to affect their earnings.
Micron wasn't  fined in the EU probe because it had told the  commission about the  cartel in 2002.

The other companies, all of which are non-European except for Infineon, were  fined under EU antitrust rules because they sell products in the 27-nation region, said the Brussels-based regulator.
Companies that agree to a settlement can still appeal, said Almunia.

"It's a matter of common sense if a company is ready to settle, I hope they will not spend more time on an appeal," he said.

The European Union regulators have fined nine chip makers for illegally fixing prices. The nine companies have to pay 331 m  euros as fine and the companies involved are Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya.

Besides the nine companies there was one more company named Micron, a 10th chip maker, who escaped the fine as it alerted the regulators regarding the fixing of the prices. The chips -  DRAMS - are used in popular items such as personal computers.

TD
Among all, Samsung received the biggest single  fine of 146m euros followed by the Germany's Infineon with a fine of 57 m euros. However the  fines were reduced by 10 per cent because the companies
co-operated with the probe.

During the period of 1998 and 2002,  cartel was in operation and was involved in a network of contacts who shared secret information. They colluded to set prices for  DRAM chips sold to major PC makers and server manufacturers, the  commission said.

The penalties mark the first settlement decision in a  cartel case in which companies received a 10 per cent cut in penalties in return for admitting involvement. In 2002,  cartel faced the investigation after the whistle was blown by Micron. On the other hand the EU's Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said: "By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the  Commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels."

He added that in the future such cases would be concluded more speedily as new procedure will be adapted. Currently in the ongoing cases the investigations will speed up significantly as the procedure is been applied to the cases. However all the business except Germany's Infineon, are non-EU
businesses. The EU's anti-trust regulator said they were all penalised because they sell their products in the European Economic Area and were therefore subject to EU law, which bans practises that restrict competition.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Joaquin  Almunia  sings praises of cartel settlement procedure

LP
Brussels, 19/05/2010 (Agence  Europe) - After the first  cartel settlement decision in a case involving big DRAM manufacturers, EU Commissioner and vice-president of the  European Commission, Joaquin Almunia explained on Wednesday 19 May 2010 the advantages to consumers, taxpayers, the  European Commissionand companies of the new  cartel settlement procedure created to shorten administrative procedures and be used frequently in the furore.

TD
The cartel settlement procedure was set up in June 2008. It enables the  Commission to settle a  cartel case with the companies involved under a simplified procedure and is intended to speed up administrative procedures. The  Commission says the cartel settlement procedure will be beneficial to consumers and taxpayers because it will cut the costs of cartel cases, encouraging the respect of competition rules and freeing up resources that can be better used elsewhere to investigate other alleged crimes. It will also be beneficial to the companies concerned because decisions will be made faster and  fines cut by 10%. As it gains experience in the new procedure, the  Commission will be able to process cases much faster and eventually reduce case times to six months or less, added Almunia.

The cartel settlement procedure is based on Articles 7 and 23 of Regulation 1/2003/EC. It gives companies involved in illegal cartels and price-fixing the option of making use of a faster investigation of the case in point and a 10% reduction in any fines to be levied (fines are calculated based on the company's turnover) as long as the companies in question admit guilt and their involvement in a  cartel.

The cartel settlement procedure is different from commitments made based on Article 9 of the same regulation that are intended to end anti-competitive practices by making the commitments offered by the company or companies binding. It differs from the  Commission's clemency programmes, which are investigative tools to detect  price-fixing and collate evidence. The  Commission's report on clemency rewards companies for voluntarily providing the Commission with information about the existence of cartels and supplying evidence to back this up. Fines can be considerably reduced depending on the value-added of the information and evidence supplied. The  cartel settlement procedure aims to simplify and speed up cases to reach final decisions quicker. It will help the Commission save time and redeploy implementation resources to other cases. The  Commission's cartel settlement procedure will reward tangible help to streamline proceedings. The two procedures will complement each other and any  fine
reduction offered under the  cartel settlement procedure can be accumulated with any fines granted under the clemency system. In practice, this means that the 10%  cartel settlement procedure fine reduction will be based on the size of the  fine before any clemency reductions are made.

In order to make use of the cartel settlement procedure, companies wanting to cut a deal with the European Commission in price-fixing cases must indicate their desire to do so and submit a formal offer in line with discussions with the Commission. The commitment offered must contain confirmation that the company is aware of the Commission's grievances and has been informed about them in a satisfactory manner. The company must state that it has been given the opportunity to make its views heard and must admit to the crime. The company must state their language preference for the communication of
grievances and cartel settlement decision - this must be one of the EU's official languages. The company must state that they will not request access to the case files or any formal oral hearing upon receipt of the communication of grievances. The company must indicate agreement to pay the  fine likely to be levied by the Commission.

When making an offer, all sides pledge to pursue the  cartel settlement procedure as long as the
Commission's final decision reflects the contents of the company's proposed deal.
Page 122 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The request to make use of the  cartel settlement procedure shall not in any way prejudge the Commission's decision in this connection. The  Commission has full powers to decide whether or not to deal with a case using the  cartel settlement procedure and to decide which companies in a  cartel may make use of the procedure. It can decide, for example, that the procedure is not appropriate for a particular cartel case if specific issues in law have never been covered by  European Court of Justice
case law, for example. If only some of the companies involved wish to sign a deal with the  Commission, it may decide to end the  cartel settlement procedure and use the normal procedure in its dealings with all companies involved. Alternatively, the  Commission may decide to continue with the  cartel settlement procedure for the companies that want to sign a deal but apply the standard procedure to companies that do not want to make use of the  cartel settlement procedure ('hybrid' cases).
Commissioner Almunia explained that the EU's  cartel settlement procedure is different from the
equivalent procedure in the United States in that it always leaves companies the option of appealing to the
European Court of Justice, but there are unlikely to be many appeals cases because  cartel participants
admit to price-fixing. (F.G. trans fl)
Symbolism of  DRAM case
The Commission has issued fines totalling €331,273,800 against memory chip (DRAM) manufacturers
Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida, Nanya and Micron. The memory
chips are used in computers and servers. The companies drew up an illegal  price-fixing agreement which
operated from 1 July 1998 to 15 June 2002. The  Commission's decision is symbolic because it is a good
illustration of how the  cartel settlement procedure and clemency procedures operate. All companies were
granted a 10% reduction in their  fines, and some of them also benefitted from farer reductions under the
clemency procedure.

Micron was granted full immunity because it was the first company to a reveal the existence in 2002 of the cartel in question. From December 2003 to February 2006, Infineon, Hynix, Samsung, Elpida and NEC asked to join the clemency programme.

The Commission awarded them fine reductions of 45% (Infineon), 27% (Hynix) and 18% (Samsung, Elpida and NEC). Due to attenuating circumstances, the  fines were reduced by a further 5% for Hynix and
10% for Toshiba and Mitsubishi. (F.G. trans fl)

HD       Nanya Technology settles with EU in cartel probe

Taipei, May 20 (CNA) Memory chip maker Nanya Technology Corp. said Thursday it had settled a  cartel case in Europe, with the EU  Commission imposing a fine of 1.8 million  euros (US$2.21 million) on the company.
The EU Commission slapped 331 million euros in fines on nine dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) firms for alleged  price fixing  between 1998 and 2002.

TD
The other firms involved were Samsung Electronics and Hynix  Semiconductor of South Korea, Infineon Technologies of Germany and Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, NEC Electronics and Elpida Memory of Japan.

Nanya said it was aware of the  cartel accusations in 2002 and cooperated with the United States, Canada and the EU in their investigations.

According to Nanya, investigations in the U.S. and Canada had not led to any charges against the company or any of its subsidiaries, and the company won a pretrial dismissal in one of civil cases in the US.

"We have consistently denied that any of our employees or employees of our subsidiaries made price-fixing agreements with competitors, and we continue to do so, " company vice president Pai Pei-lin said in a statement.

However, Pai said, his company understood the EU  Commission tended to interpret  European law strictly as forbidding any price discussions between competitors, making any company engaged in one-on-one price discussions with a competitor liable to be charged with  price fixing.

Pai said Nanya acknowledged the participation of its employees and its subsidiary employee in one-on-one conversations that included information about prices, but disagreed with the "contemporaneous knowledge of the  cartel" that the EU  Commission found.
"We settled with the  commission to avoid the distraction and cost of further proceedings," Pai said. "After almost eight years of litigation and investigative activity, we believe it is time to move forward and
refocus on the growth of our business," he added.
The EU Commission hailed the settlement as a milestone in the  commission's anti-cartel enforcement. "By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel the companies have allowed the  Commission to bring
this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels,
" EU Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

In the settlement, Samsung faced the biggest fine of 145 million euros, while the  commission handed down 56.7 million  euros and 51.5 million euros in fines to Infineon and Hynix respectively.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined the world's largest memory chip makers a total of EUR331 million for having operated a  cartel, in its first settlement deal.

The largest  fine in the cartel goes to South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) at EUR145 million. Germany's Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE) also faces a hefty sum at EUR56.7 million, while South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE) will have to pay EUR51.5 million.

Other companies  fined as part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd. (6501.TO), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO), Mitsubishi Electric (6503.TO) and Taiwan's Nanya Technology (2408.TW).

U.S. chip maker Micron Technology (MU) blew the whistle on the  price fixing  and will therefore escape all fines.
All fines were reduced by 10% because the companies pleaded guilty to the  cartel charges, the
commission said.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The cartel was in operation between the years of 1998 to 2002. During that time, the companies shared secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, which allowed them to coordinate the price levels for Dynamic Random Access Memory, or D-Ram, sold to major computer manufacturers in  Europe, the commission said.

Though there is a possibility of a minor counter-trend rally, the short-term trend remains bearish. The Sensex has to move above major resistance at 16,740 to indicate a reversal of the short-term downtrend.
Minor support for the index is at 16,365, a breach of which would trigger a fall to major support at
16,150.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could rise to its short-term resistance at 4,935.

The Nifty has to move past major resistance at 4,990 to suggest a reversal of the bearish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,875.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, led by such industrial companies such as Caterpillar, Boeing and 3M as investors worried that the weak  euro could hurt the profits of companies that do business in the  euro zone. The declines wiped out the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's gain for the year.

Caterpillar was the Dow's worst performer with a drop of 2.8%. Boeing fell 2.2% and 3M slipped 1.1%.

The Dow's financial stocks rose as the Senate prepared to vote on whether to end the debate on legislation overhauling U.S. financial regulation.

After the market closed, the motion to cut off debate fell short of the 60 votes needed. Bank of America ended up 2.3%, while J.P. Morgan advanced 0.9%.
Hewlett-Packard was also strong, with a gain of 0.5%. The company's fiscal second quarter profit grew
28% on higher worldwide sales and profit growth in its core personal-computer business.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian shares were mixed Thursday, with bargain hunters entering some markets after sharp declines recently. In Tokyo, Resona Holdings surged on a report that it planned to begin repaying a 2003 Y2 trillion public fund infusion.
Confidence picked up a little as Wall Street's losses Wednesday were relatively mild.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average and South Korea's Kospi Composite were down while Australia's
S&P/ASX 200 was up and New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were
35 points higher in screen trade.

In Tokyo market, investors were taking a neutral stance to gross domestic product data released before the market opened, said Yumi Nishimura, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets deputy general manager.

Real GDP increased 4.9% on an annualized pace in the January-March period, marking the fourth straight quarter of gain. That was the fastest economic growth since April-June of 2009, but missed the annualized 5.9% growth expected by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
Automakers were weak with Toyota Motor down 2.0% and Honda Motor 1.7% lower.

Resona Holdings surged 6.7% as investors cheered a Nikkei report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the bank was negotiating with the government to begin repaying Y2 trillion in public funds.

In Seoul, brokerages were weak with Daewoo Securities down 0.5% but auto makers rose on bargain-hunting with Kia Motors up 1.5%.


FOREX
The euro was at $1.2382 from $1.2391 in late New York trade Wednesday, and at Y113.53 from
Y113.41. The dollar was at Y91.69 from Y91.54.


METALS
Worries about  euro-zone economies sent platinum and palladium to near-two-month lows but failed to support gold as a safe haven. The yellow metal dipped as investors felt less need for a refuge with market talk that  European officials will step in to support the  euro. Initial refuge-buying after Germany's ban on some bearish bets also wore off.
Base metals on the London Metal Exchange traded lower Wednesday as depressed sentiment from
Europe weighed on equities and commodities.
Spot gold was at $1.193.70 per troy ounce, up $2.20 from late New York trade Wednesday.


OIL SUMMARY
June Nymex crude oil futures were up $1.07 at $70.94 per barrel on Globex. The June contract expires
Thursday and the more actively traded July contract was up 38 cents at $72.86 per barrel.

HD        SEMICON Report: Booming DRAM Market To Help Chip Makers Weather EU Fine
BY        By Se Young Lee
CR        Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
WC       817 words
PD        20 May 2010

LP
SEOUL (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission's fine against memory-chip makers for  price fixing is a negative development but it won't hurt their operations significantly because it's coming at a time when the chip industry continues to rebound from solid demand and firm chip prices.

Chip makers and analysts say the  fines aren't large enough to affect the companies' bottom line in a significant manner, and the chip industry's solid recovery is boosting the players' earnings. While shares of Samsung Electronics Co.(005930.SE), Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. (000660.SE), Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) and Hitachi Ltd. (6501.TO) were under pressure Thursday, analysts attributed the decline to generally weak market sentiment stemming from continuing  European fiscal woes.

TD
The commission on Wednesday fined nine companies a total of EUR331 million after the firms admitted that they operated a cartel for dynamic random access memory, or  DRAM, chips used in personal computers. South Korea's Samsung, Germany's Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.XE) and South Korea's Hynix  Semiconductor bore the heavier fines. Japan's Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), NEC Corp. (6701.TO), Hitachi, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric (6503.TO) and Taiwan's Nanya Technology (2408.TW) were also  fined.

The cartel operated between 1998 and 2002, according to the  commission, with the firms sharing secret information --mostly on a bilateral basis. This allowed them to coordinate price levels for  DRAM. The investigation has gone on for many years and all of the Japanese firms except for Elpida have since exited the  DRAM market.

"The first quarter of 2010 has positioned the industry for a bull run, the likes of which haven't been seen for more than a decade," iSuppli Corp. analyst Mike Howard said. "The question is no longer if 2010 will be a great year for  DRAM but rather if 2010 will be the greatest year for  DRAM."

Typically, demand in the first and second quarters of the year is weak for the  DRAM industry after a strong holiday season in the latter part of the year. But this year, the  DRAM industry is benefiting from better-than-expected demand for personal computers and supply constraints after manufacturers trimmed their capital spending during the 2008 downturn. Chip makers are also moving to upgrade their process technology in order to cut manufacturing costs, which could lead to decreased output in the initial phase of the transition.

iSuppli said worldwide  DRAM revenue in the first quarter rose to $9.5 billion from $8.7 billion in the fourth quarter and just $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2009.

Samsung bore the heaviest brunt with a EUR145.7 million  fine but said this won't affect its business given its current financial standing. The company booked a record net profit of KRW3.99 trillion ($3.34 billion) in the first quarter ended March 31 and announced a record KRW18 trillion ($15.1 billion) capital expenditure plan for 2010 on Monday to take advantage of improving market conditions. The company declined to comment when asked about provisioning for the  fine.
Hynix spokeswoman Seong-ae Park said the chip maker has provisioned against the EUR51.5 million
fine, which was already reflected in its earnings. The  fine won't affect the firm's bottom line, she said.

Nanya, which was fined EUR1.8 million, said it settled with the  commission to avoid further proceedings. The Taiwanese firm had NT$1.93 billion in cash (EUR48.4 million) and cash equivalents as of March 31.

"After almost eight years of litigation and investigative activity, we believe it is time to move forward and refocus on the growth of our business," Nanya spokesman Pei Lin Pai said in a statement.

Toshiba and Elpida said they will deal with the  fines through their existing provisions and that their earnings won't be affected.

SAMSUNG, Toshiba and Hitachi were among the nine computer chip makers  fined 331 million (GBP
284m) by the European Union yesterday for  price fixing.

The EU competition watchdog levied its biggest penalty of 145.7m against Samsung, while Infineon was fined 56.7m and Hynix Semiconductor 51.5m for a  cartel of DRAM chip makers that operated from July 1998 to June 2002.

TD
Micron Technology received immunity and no  fine for blowing the whistle in 2002.

Samsung and Hynix are the world's largest and second-largest memory chip makers respectively. The chips are used in computers, printers, mobile phones and games consoles.

The other companies in the  cartel were Hitachi, which received a  fine of 20.4m, Toshiba 17.6m, Mitsubishi 16.6m and Nanya Technology 1.8m.
Elpida Memory was fined 8.5m jointly with NEC and Hitachi, while NEC took a 2.1m hit jointly with
Hitachi during their joint venture period. NEC got a separate 10.3m  fine.

The case is the first under a European Commission settlement procedure introduced in July 2008 in which firms admit taking part in a cartel in return for a 10 per cent cut in  fines.

EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: "By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels."

Almunia said there were several more such settlements in the pipeline but refused to elaborate. He insisted that the use of settlements did not soften the  commission's stance on the illegal practice.
He added: "We are not compromising on cartels. We will continue to be clearly against cartels."

Over the past decade, the EU has struck across the globe to impose massive  fines on multinationals which fix prices.

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling EUR 331 million for a  price-fixing cartel among DRAM makers. The competition ruling affects the manufacturers Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya. Micron was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission. The total  fine was reduced by 10 percent as the companies admitted their participation in the cartel, in what is the first settlement reached in EC anti-cartel investigations. Between December 2003 and February 2006, Infineon, Hynix, Samsung, Elpida and NEC also applied for leniency. Due to their cooperation with the investigation, the commission agreed to reduce their  fines by respectively 45 percent for Infineon, 27 percent for Hynix and 18 percent for Samsung, Elpida and NEC. After taking into account additional mitigating
circumstances, the  fine of Hynix was further reduced by 5 percent and for Toshiba and Mitsubishi by 10 percent.

TD
The fines take into account the sales of the companies involved in the European Economic Area, the "very serious" nature of the infringement and its geographical scope. The overall cartel was in operation between 1 July 1998 and 15 June 2002. It involved a network of contacts and sharing of secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, through which the companies coordinated the price levels and quotations for  DRAMs sold to major PC or server original equipment manufacturers in the EEA.

BRUSSELS—The world's largest memory-chip makers were  fined a total of €331 million ($404.2 million) by the European Commission Wednesday for admitting they operated a  cartel, in the commission's first settlement deal.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.'s €145.7 million  fine was the highest in the  cartel. Germany's Infineon Technologies AG also faces a hefty sum of €56.7 million, while South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. will have to pay €51.5 million.

TD
Others fined as part of the  cartel include Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc., NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Taiwan's Nanya Technology. U.S. chip maker Micron Technology, which blew the whistle on the  price fixing,  will escape all fines.

The commission, the European Union's executive arm, said all  fines were reduced by 10% because the companies pleaded guilty to the  cartel charges.
Settlement discussions in the dynamic random access memory, or D-Ram, cartel started in February
2009. As part of the process, the companies have formally acknowledged their respective liability in the
case, which means they can't later appeal the  commission's decision.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," said Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia.

The cartel operated between 1998 and 2002. During that time, the companies shared secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, which allowed them to coordinate the price levels for D-Ram, sold to major computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. in  Europe, the commission said.

Goetz Drauz, a partner at Howrey, which represented one of the companies in the  cartel, said the companies that went through the  commission's settlement process have more to gain than just the
10% reduction in fines. Participating in a settlement means the companies can, to some extent, influence the commission's opinion on the timing of the  cartel and affected turnover, which in turn can substantially reduce final fines, he said.

Samsung said it accepted the  commission's findings and would ensure its future operations meet antitrust scrutiny. "Samsung has established a compliance team that will develop guidelines for improving systems and employee training," it said in a statement.

Infineon said the  fine won't affect its fiscal 2010 result, as the company had "made provisions." Hitachi and NEC also said the  fine would have no impact on their earnings.

Toshiba said it decided to settle to avoid the "expenses, inconvenience and distraction resulting from further protracted litigation." Elpida said it would follow the decision, while Mitsubishisaid it would decide what to do after thoroughly looking into the  commission's notification.

16,150.
The National Stock Exchange's 50-share Nifty could rise to its short-term resistance at 4,935.

The Nifty has to move past major resistance at 4,990 to suggest a reversal of the bearish trend. Else, the index is likely to drift to major support at 4,875.




US STOCKS
U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, led by such industrial companies such as Caterpillar, Boeing and 3M as investors worried that the weak  euro could hurt the profits of companies that do business in the  euro zone. The declines wiped out the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's gain for the year.

Caterpillar was the Dow's worst performer with a drop of 2.8%. Boeing fell 2.2% and 3M slipped 1.1%.

The Dow's financial stocks rose as the Senate prepared to vote on whether to end the debate on legislation overhauling U.S. financial regulation.

After the market closed, the motion to cut off debate fell short of the 60 votes needed. Bank of America ended up 2.3%, while J.P. Morgan advanced 0.9%.
Hewlett-Packard was also strong, with a gain of 0.5%. The company's fiscal second quarter profit grew
28% on higher worldwide sales and profit growth in its core personal-computer business.




ASIAN STOCKS
Asian shares were mixed Thursday, with bargain hunters entering some markets after sharp declines recently. In Tokyo, Resona Holdings surged on a report that it planned to begin repaying a 2003 Y2 trillion public fund infusion.
Confidence picked up a little as Wall Street's losses Wednesday were relatively mild.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average and South Korea's Kospi Composite were down while Australia's
S&P/ASX 200 was up and New Zealand's NZX-50 was flat. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were
35 points higher in screen trade.

In Tokyo market, investors were taking a neutral stance to gross domestic product data released before the market opened, said Yumi Nishimura, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets deputy general manager.

Real GDP increased 4.9% on an annualized pace in the January-March period, marking the fourth straight quarter of gain. That was the fastest economic growth since April-June of 2009, but missed the annualized 5.9% growth expected by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
Automakers were weak with Toyota Motor down 2.0% and Honda Motor 1.7% lower.

Resona Holdings surged 6.7% as investors cheered a Nikkei report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the bank was negotiating with the government to begin repaying Y2 trillion in public funds.

In Seoul, brokerages were weak with Daewoo Securities down 0.5% but auto makers rose on bargain-hunting with Kia Motors up 1.5%.


FOREX
The euro was at $1.2382 from $1.2391 in late New York trade Wednesday, and at Y113.53 from
Y113.41. The dollar was at Y91.69 from Y91.54.


METALS
Worries about  euro-zone economies sent platinum and palladium to near-two-month lows but failed to support gold as a safe haven. The yellow metal dipped as investors felt less need for a refuge with market talk that  European officials will step in to support the  euro. Initial refuge-buying after Germany's ban on some bearish bets also wore off.
Base metals on the London Metal Exchange traded lower Wednesday as depressed sentiment from
Europe weighed on equities and commodities.
Spot gold was at $1.193.70 per troy ounce, up $2.20 from late New York trade Wednesday.


OIL SUMMARY
June Nymex crude oil futures were up $1.07 at $70.94 per barrel on Globex. The June contract expires
Thursday and the more actively traded July contract was up 38 cents at $72.86 per barrel.

HD      European Commission Announces Decision  in DRAM Case
WC    601 words

Release date - 19052010

Taoyuan, Taiwan -- Nanya Technology Corporation (Ticker: 2408) announced today that, following settlement agreements with ten DRAM manufacturers, the  European Commission has issued a decision in an investigation of pricing in the DRAM industry between 1998 and 2002.

TD
The Commission determined that the  DRAM manufacturers engaged in discussions of pricing information in violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the  European Union. The Commission’s decision is the result of a settlement process made possible by a regulation issued by the Commission in 2008, and the end of the investigation.
The decision states that the  DRAM manufacturers engaged in price contacts aimed at the coordination of
‘contract market’ prices to computer manufacturers at various times and with varying degrees of intensity
and effectiveness between July 1998 and June 2002. During most of this time, Nanya made no sales in
the contract market. Nanya’s U.S. subsidiary made its first sales in the contract market in the last quarter
of 2001. During settlement discussions with the  Commission, Nanya agreed to a  fine of EUR1.8 million.
The Commission announced fines in the total amount of EUR331,273,800 in the decision.
‘We became aware of the allegations addressed in the decision in 2002,’ said Nanya spokesperson Dr.
Pei Lin Pai. ‘We cooperated in investigations in the United States and Canada, and neither resulted in any
charges against Nanya or any of its subsidiaries. We also won a pretrial dismissal of one of the private
civil cases in the U.S. We have consistently denied that any of our employees or employees of our
subsidiaries made price fixing  agreements with competitors, and we continue to do so.’

Dr. Pai said, however, that Nanya understands the  Commission to interpret  European law as forbidding essentially any price discussion between competitors, and to make a company engaging in one-on-one price discussions with a competitor liable for the activities of a broader  cartel in which the competitor participated if it ‘should have known’ of the existence of the  cartel. Nanya has acknowledged employee or subsidiary employee participation in conversations that included mention of price information, but it did not admit contemporaneous knowledge of the  cartel found by the  Commission.

‘We settled with the  Commission to avoid the distraction and cost of further proceedings. After almost eight years of litigation and investigative activity, we believe it is time to move forward and refocus on the growth of our business,’ Dr. Pai stated.
The Commission’s decision, and the settlement discussions that preceded it, are limited to  European
law and activities in the  European Economic Area.

HD     CARTELS : COMMISSION FINES TEN MEMORY CHIP PRODUCERS WC    585 words

LP
On 19 May, the European Commission adopted its first settlement decision in a  cartel case involving ten producers of memory chips or DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory), used in computers and servers. This is a simplified procedure introduced in 2008 that allows the  Commission to settle  cartel cases more quickly.

The cartel was in operation between 1 July 1998 and 15 June 2002. It involved a network of contacts and sharing of secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, through which they coordinated the price levels for DRAMs sold to major PC or server original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the EEA..

TD
The firms concerned are Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya. The  fines amount to €331,273,800. Micron, which informed the  Commission of the existence of the cartel in 2002, was given full immunity. Apart from the German firm Infineon, the companies involved are not European but sell their products in the  European Economic Area (EEA: EU + Norway, Iceland
and Liechtenstein) and must abide by EU law that bans practices that restrict competition.

This case marks the  Commission's first use of the settlement procedure(1). It is different from commitment decisions(2), which are meant to bring anti-competitive behaviour to an end by making commitments offered by the company legally binding. The settlement decision is meant to shorten administrative procedures and reduce investigation costs. Companies involved may at any time before the statement of objections notify the  Commission that they wish to reach a settlement. The  Commission is not obliged to use this procedure and has total discretion for deciding whether or not the case lends itself
to it. If it decides to use the settlement procedure, it gives the parties a deadline for declaring in writing that they are willing to take part in discussions with a view to reaching a settlement.
"IT PAYS!"

The companies must clearly and unequivocally acknowledge their participation in the infringement. Doing so is in their interest: their  fine is reduced by 10%, decisions are quicker and companies can rebuild their reputation more swiftly. "Cooperating with the  Commission pays," explained Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who plans to make the new procedure a success in combating cartels. He estimates that the time needed for settlements in such cases could be brought down to six months at most. There
are advantages for the EU executive in this procedure as well, in particular in the reasons for the decision, which can be briefer and less detailed. The commissioner added that this type of cooperation instrument does not do away with the possibility of an appeal before the EU General Court, unlike its American equivalent. The  fines imposed take into account the EEA sales of the companies concerned as well as
the very serious nature and geographical extent of the infringement.

HD         9 chip makers to pay fines for price-fixing
BY         BY JAMES KANTER

LP
The European Union fined a group of computer chip makers €331.3 million on Wednesday for
price-fixing, the first use of a new procedure that allows settlement of a  cartel case in Europe.

The European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said Wednesday that, because of the new procedure, he expected to handle some cases in less than six months from the time that a  cartel is discovered or reported.

TD
In the past, some  cartel cases have taken close to a decade to complete in  Europe, largely because of lengthy investigation times.

An important goal of the new policy was to bring long-running investigations ‘‘to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels,’’ Mr. Almunia said.

The settlement announced Wednesday involved dynamic random-access memory chips, or  DRAMs, which provide the main memory for personal computers.

Samsung of South Korea, the market leader, received the highest  fine: €145.7 million, or $185 million; Infineon of Germany was second at €56.7 million.

Those amounts were less than they could have been — about 20 percent for Samsung and about 50 percent for Infineon — partly because of the new procedure, which grants companies that settle a reduction in the penalties, and partly because of other leniency arrangements based on the level of cooperation with the inquiry.

Other companies in the settlement included Hynix of South Korea; the Japanese companies Elpida, NEC, Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba; and Nanya Technology of Taiwan.

The new procedure was introduced when the  DRAM case was already six years old. It is partly aimed at cutting down investigation times by reducing the burden of casework on the  commission in exchange for companies admitting that they participated in a  cartel and agreeing to pay a certain level of fine.

The commission probably will use the new procedure in certain cases to try to clear a backlog of dozens of cases that have accumulated as a result of incentives that were introduced early in the decade.

Those incentives, which are separate from the new settlement procedure, are designed to encourage companies to cooperate during the investigation stage and can also result in lower  fines.

Ordinarily the  commission fixes the fines without prior knowledge of the companies. The companies then often appeal that decision to the general court, the  European Union’s second-highest tribunal, where judges have frequently faulted the  commission's procedures.

‘‘It’s a matter of common sense,’’ Mr. Almunia said. ‘‘If the company is ready to settle, I hope they will not spend more time in an appeal that can trigger for them not only positive potential consequences but potential negative consequences.’’

Antitrust experts warned Wednesday that the  commission would need to accelerate the way it deals with its other procedures to speed up  cartel cases significantly.

BRUSSELS -- The world's largest memory-chip makers were  fined a total of 331 million euros ($404.2 million) by the  European Commission Wednesday for admitting they operated a cartel, in the commission's first settlement deal.

South Korean maker Samsung Electronics Co.'s <euro>145.7 million fine was the highest in the cartel. Germany's Infineon Technologies AG faces a sum of 56.7 million euros. Others  fined as part of the cartel include Japanese companies Elpida Memory Inc., NEC Electronics Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.

TD
U.S. chip maker Micron Technology Inc., which blew the whistle on the price fixing,  will escape all fines. The commission, the European Union's executive arm, said all fines were reduced by 10% because the companies pleaded guilty. Settlement talks in the dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, cartel started in February 2009. The companies have formally acknowledged their respective liability.

"By acknowledging their participation in a  cartel, the companies have allowed the  commission to bring this long-running investigation to a close and to free up resources to investigate other suspected cartels," said Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The cartel operated between 1998 and 2002. During that time, the companies shared information, mostly on a bilateral basis, that allowed them to coordinate memory prices for sales to major computer makers, the commission said.

Samsung said it accepted the  commission's findings and would ensure its future operations meet antitrust scrutiny. "Samsung has established a compliance team that will develop guidelines for improving systems and employee training," it said.

Infineon said the  fine won't affect its fiscal 2010 result, as the company had "made provisions." Hitachi and NEC also said the  fine would have no impact on their earnings. Toshiba said it decided to settle
to avoid the "expenses, inconvenience and distraction resulting from further protracted litigation." Elpida said it would follow the decision, while Mitsubishi said it would decide what to do after thoroughly looking into the  commission's notification.

HD      European Commission Announces Decision  in DRAM Case
WC     458 words

Release date - 19052010

Taoyuan, Taiwan -- Nanya Technology Corporation (Ticker: 2408) announced today that, following settlement agreements with ten DRAM manufacturers, the  European Commission has issued a decision in an investigation of pricing in the DRAM industry between 1998 and 2002.

TD
The Commission determined that the  DRAM manufacturers engaged in discussions of pricing information in violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the  European Union. The Commission’s decision is the result of a settlement process made possible by a regulation issued by the Commission in 2008, and the end of the investigation.
The decision states that the  DRAM manufacturers engaged in price contacts aimed at the coordination of
‘contract market’ prices to computer manufacturers at various times and with varying degrees of intensity
and effectiveness between July 1998 and June 2002. During most of this time, Nanya made no sales in
the contract market. Nanya’s U.S. subsidiary made its first sales in the contract market in the last quarter
of 2001. During settlement discussions with the  Commission, Nanya agreed to a  fine of EUR1.8 million.
The Commission announced fines in the total amount of EUR331,273,800 in the decision.
‘We became aware of the allegations addressed in the decision in 2002,’ said Nanya spokesperson Dr.
Pei Lin Pai. ‘We cooperated in investigations in the United States and Canada, and neither resulted in any
charges against Nanya or any of its subsidiaries. We also won a pretrial dismissal of one of the private
civil cases in the U.S. We have consistently denied that any of our employees or employees of our
subsidiaries made price fixing  agreements with competitors, and we continue to do so.’

Dr. Pai said, however, that Nanya understands the  Commission to interpret  European law as forbidding essentially any price discussion between competitors, and to make a company engaging in one-on-one price discussions with a competitor liable for the activities of a broader  cartel in which the competitor participated if it ‘should have known’ of the existence of the  cartel. Nanya has acknowledged employee or subsidiary employee participation in conversations that included mention of price information, but it did not admit contemporaneous knowledge of the  cartel found by the  Commission.

‘We settled with the  Commission to avoid the distraction and cost of further proceedings. After almost eight years of litigation and investigative activity, we believe it is time to move forward and refocus on the growth of our business,’ Dr. Pai stated.
The Commission’s decision, and the settlement discussions that preceded it, are limited to  European
law and activities in the  European Economic Area.

HD       Commission reaches first  cartel settlement in memory chip

In what has been hailed as a 'milestone' development, the European Commission ("Commission") has adopted its first settlement decision under its 2008 simplified procedure. The cartel settlement
procedure is aimed at expediting the administrative proceedings leading up to a decision and therefore increasing the Commission's efficiency by freeing it up to take on more cases.

The Commission has imposed fines of over £331 million on ten producers of memory chips or  DRAMS (used in computers and game consoles) for engaging in  cartel conduct between 1998 and 2002.  Under the settlement procedure, the  fines imposed on the companies have been reduced by the standard 10% on the basis that they have each acknowledged their involvement in the  cartel and their respective liability for it. The companies have also waived certain procedural rights (such as full access to the file).

TD
The companies involved are: Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya. Five of the companies also benefited from reduced  fines under the Commission's leniency programme, which sits alongside the settlement procedure. Micron revealed the existence of the cartel to the Commission and has therefore benefited from full immunity.

The companies were found to have shared secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, leading to coordinated price levels for memory chips in breach of Article 101(1) TFEU. Even though the companies were based outside Europe (except for German based Infineon) their conduct was still caught given they traded within the European Economic Area.

The settlement discussions in this case started in February 2009 and have taken around 15 months to conclude. As experience grows, the  Commission has indicated that the settlement process should take substantially less time to complete, possibly less than six months.

Although more settlement cases are said to be in the pipeline, not every case will be suitable for settlement which remains subject to the  Commission's discretion. The  Commission has indicated a preference for cases where all companies agree to settle, however so called 'hybrid' cases (where some but not all of the parties settle) have not been completely ruled out.
Whether a company should opt for settlement in a given case is likely to remain  finely balanced.
Although there are certain benefits for the parties, such as a quicker and less burdensome administrative
procedure and a modest reduction in  fine, settlement does require an admission of liability and may
accelerate potential follow on damages actions. The decision itself is however likely to be shorter and
less detailed than in standard cases, potentially making it less easy to use as a basis for a damages
claim.  It will therefore be interesting to see whether any private actions emerge on the back of this
decision and how they progress.

HD     Korea punishes air cargo cartel deal
WC     484 words

Korea's antitrust agency yesterday slapped  fines totaling 120 billion won ($98.1 million) on 19 air cargo carriers for fixing shipment rates and warned two other airlines to abstain from the practice.The Fair Trade Commission said the airlines had colluded on imposing extra fuel charges on cargo shipments involving Korea routes between 1999 and 2007.

TD
The investigation followed similar probes in the U.S.,  Europe and Australia about unfair trade practices involving the air cargo industry.The Korean authorities said the investigation, which began in 2005, revealed the airlines, including Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, overcharged by 6.7 trillion won in the local market by imposing or increasing fuel surcharges during the eight-year period.It was the biggest international  cartel case the antitrust agency has ever handled, which included summoning 54 airline executives from around the world for investigation and conducting a joint investigation with foreign antitrust agencies for the first time. The Korean ruling came after the U.S. government imposed a total of
$1.6 billion in  fines on 15 airlines in 2007 for manipulating fuel surcharges. Australia this month filed lawsuits on similar charges against six global airlines, while the EU is also investigating the matter.Korean Air, the world's largest international air cargo carrier, received a 48.7 billion won  fine in the Korean
antitrust action, although this was reduced to 22.1 billion won after it admitted to the charges. Asiana Airlines was penalized 20.6 billion won, followed by 12.1 billion won for Lufthansa and 7.8 billion won on KLM. Other companies involved in the  cartel activities include Cathay Pacific Airways, Japan Airlines, Air France, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines. Scandinavian Airlines and Air India were issued with warnings.The FTC said the investigation began in December 2005 when a foreign airline operator disclosed the cartel practice to local regulators. The airline has been disclosed and its penalty  fine was waived.Korean Air and Asiana Airlines refused to comment yesterday on the ruling, saying they were awaiting official notification from the antitrust agency.'Air cargo shipments accounted for nearly 25 percent of Korea's total exports in 2009, and we believe the  cartel dealt serious damage to the export competitiveness of local companies,' the antitrust agency said in a statement. 'Now we will be able to
ease the burden on local consumers by helping lower prices on products imported by air cargo.'Many of Korea's key export products, including  semiconductors, mobile phones and other electronics items, are mainly shipped by air, meaning the ruling could improve the overseas price competitiveness of these products, the agency said.Kim Jung-ki, an official at the FTC's international  cartel investigation team, said he cannot confirm whether the agency is investigating similar practices in the passenger airline industry.

HD            U.S., EU Scrutinize Container  Shipping Rates; As Prices Rise, Regulators Monitor  Carriers for
Any Signs of Price Fixing
BY             By John W. Miller

LP
BRUSSELS—A U.S. regulator and the  European Union's competition watchdog are monitoring the world's top container shipping lines for any evidence of  price fixing.

The scrutiny comes as the prices shipping lines charge have kept rising even as the industry's supply of new ships has continued to increase sharply.

TD
The shipping lines, including industry leader AP Moeller-Maersk AS, deny they are operating a  cartel.

The Federal Maritime  Commission in the U.S., where carriers enjoy broad antitrust immunity, has opened a "fact finding" investigation into shipping rates. It is due to submit an interim report on June
15 and a final report on July 31.

The agency's mission is to make sure that collaboration between shipping lines does "not result in unreasonable increases in transportation costs or decreases in transportation services," said FMC commissioner Michael Khouri.

In Europe, regulators are "actively monitoring" the situation, said EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres. She declined to elaborate.

The companies that ship 20-foot or 40-foot cargo containers around the world had their worst year ever in 2009, losing an estimated $20 billion, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.

As global trade shrank by 10%, shipping lines received hundreds of new ships they had ordered during the economic boom, creating a chasm between supply and demand. For a while, rates collapsed. Analysts predicted that at least one major shipping line would have to go out of business.

That hasn't happened. Instead, shipping lines have adopted a variety of strategies to push rates back up. They have idled ships to reduce capacity and "slow steamed" to save on fuel, spending more
days at sea and fewer in port, further reducing supply. Carriers say slow-steaming can cut a company's capacity by as much as 5%.

In the U.S., shipping lines have teamed up to levy voluntary rate surcharges of $400 per container. The lines say the surcharge is appropriate because no one is obligated to impose it.

The average price of moving a 40-foot container from one port across an ocean to another port rose to $2,716 in March, up more than 74% from $1,557 a year earlier. The increase is even more dramatic  on some routes. For example, on shipments to  Europe, the index rate has more than tripled to $3,880 from $1,071.

"The turnaround has been much swifter than expected," said Philip Damas, who follows the container shipping market for London-based Drewry.

"The mood in the industry is that things are going relatively well, but there are suspicions among importers and exporters that they've colluded," Mr. Damas said.

Shippers—the companies that arrange for space on ships—say they are struggling to find enough space at affordable prices. "We are still concerned about prices," said Nicolette van der Jagt, secretary-general of the  European Shippers' Council, a Brussels-based lobbying group.

Richard Owens, a senior executive at delivery company DHL International GmbH, a unit of Deutsche Post AG, recently complained to International Freight Weekly that "we can't make the ships go faster." He said DHL hopes that "one of the carriers will break ranks on speed or rates eventually."

But carrier rates are expected to continue their rise as trade recovers further. "Carrier rates and surcharges are expected to keep going up over the summer," said Ashley Craig, a lawyer at Washington-based law firm Venable LLP, whose clients include shippers and freight forwarders. "This is an issue which is not going away."

The shipping lines say they are doing nothing wrong. The companies have acted separately, and need rate increases to survive, said Jean-Philippe Thenoz, vice president of North America lines for France's CMA-CGM, the world's third-biggest container shipping company by volume.
"We're still far from profitability," Mr. Thenoz added.

The crucial question for regulators will be to determine whether slow-steaming and idling ships are "a shared decision or everybody made the same decision on their own," said Drewry's Mr. Damas.
Mr. Khouri, the U.S. regulator, said that the voluntary surcharges appear to be legal, but that any
"discussions to agree on capacity restriction" would be a "violation of the Sherman [Antitrust] Act."

Historically, shipping lines often have been granted immunity to fix prices, said Mr. Damas. In the U.S., shipping lines can collectively set rates and surcharges, but aren't allowed to collude to restrict supply.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, officially ended a  price-fixing exemption for the shipping industry in October 2008.

"Clearly, following the introduction of the new rules, the  commission is looking for a case in the shipping sector to show it means business," said Ian Giles, a London-based lawyer for Norton Rose LLP, which specializes in shipping issues.

If launched, EU  cartel probes can take years, and result in  fines if regulators find that companies are guilty of collusion.

This last regulation applies to patent licensing, know-how licensing, software copyright licensing and agreements combining any of these elements. Clearance from EU competition authorities is needed if the companies party to an agreement are competitors and between them have a share of the relevant market
of more than 20%; if they are not competitors, clearance is needed only if their share of the relevant market exceeds 30%. The regulation expires on April 30th 2014.

France does not restrict the entry or export of technology, unless national security is at stake or where restrictions have been agreed under EU rules on trade in dual-use technology.

Under French patent law, an exclusive licence registered with the National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle) allows the licensee to sue in its own name if the licenser refuses to sue for protection. Nevertheless, specific licensing agreements may forbid such a move.

France ensures full legal recognition of the main forms of industrial and intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, industrial designs and models, and copyrights. Normal forms of legal redress are available through the courts. The 1992 Intellectual Property Code and subsequent amendments cover all forms of intellectual property. French protection for patents may last up to 20 years, but a utility certificate is available for a six-year period for products with a short life. Trademarks are protected for ten years in the first instance, although rights may be extended indefinitely by successive renewals.

Supplementary-protection certificates are available for pharmaceutical products and their ingredients and for veterinary medicines. The initial duration of a patent for these products remains unchanged at 20 years, but the holder may obtain a supplementary-protection certificate for up to seven more years (subject to a
cut-off date of 17 years from the date of authorisation for the product’s release on the market). Protection is also available for vegetable species and  semiconductors. Until March 2006 protection for plants and vegetable species was available only for 20 or 25 years, depending on the species. This was in line with international commitments, but not EU law. Law 2006/236 aligned France with EU requirements by extending the protection periods to 25 and 30 years. It is a criminal offence for employees to divulge manufacturing secrets.

The National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle—INPI) handles applications for all types of intellectual-property (IP) protection. It grants patents on the basis of novelty, following a detailed search (Decree 2007/280 of March 1st 2007). In January 2009 INPI concluded a new service-level agreement with the French government, which commits it to being more service-directed and less procedure-based, to make more information available free of charge, to handle applications more rapidly and to speed up the process of allowing electronic filing.

Specialist magistrates handle important IP cases. Law 2004/130 of February 11th 2004 made it easier for the courts to call outside experts for assistance and to call expert witnesses to improve the level of expertise when dealing with IP cases. Lawyers practising anywhere in the  European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) can file applications with the INPI (Ordinance 2001/670 of July 25th 2001) and plead IP cases in French courts.

Legislation was promulgated in December 2004 (Law 2004/1338, Journal officiel 286, December 9th 2004) implementing EU Directive 98/44 on protection for biotechnology inventions. The deadline for implementing this directive was July 30th 2000, but France delayed because it wanted to use its own wording on
human-cell research and needed agreement on this with the  European Commission. Because of domestic opposition to those parts of the directive that deal with the ethical aspects of the possible use of human cells in biotechnology research, France agreed only reluctantly to the original EU directive and has used wording in Law 2004/1338 that varies somewhat from that of the original directive, leaving open the possibility of a more restrictive interpretation in France. Nevertheless, it is now in theory possible to patent in France the sequence or partial sequence of a gene if there is a proven industrial application and the sequence or part-sequence has been produced by a technical process. New bioethics legislation (Law
2004/800 of August 6th 2004) applies to research using parts of the human body and also what is not patentable in the area of biotechnology. It strengthens the existing bioethics committee and sets up a biomedicines agency.

The same legislation strengthened provisions on compulsory licensing. Existing provisions were designed for disputes between two private parties that would be referred to the courts. They did not suit a situation in which a government might want to override a patent, on grounds of public interest, in the hands of one or two manufacturers that could be in a position to abuse their position in the market without there being time for competition law to follow its course. The concept of compulsory licensing in the interest of public health also applies to diagnostics.

In trademark law, Ordinance 2001/670 of July 25th 2001 aligned France’s Intellectual Property Code with EU Directive 89/104 by strengthening recourse against licensees that breach trademark rules applying to the licensed product. It also clarifies rules on counterfeiting trademarks and the relationship between national and EU trademarks issued by the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (see below). It prevents a counterfeiting claim against a national trademark that appears to breach the rights of an EU trademark if the national trademark has been in use for five years and was applied for in good faith. It also prevents a national trademark from being used to substantiate an application for an EU trademark if it can be deemed to have lapsed through non-use in France. The EU published a codified version of the Trademark Directive in November 2008: Directive 2008/95/EC of the  European Parliament and of the Council of October 22nd 2008 to approximate the laws of the member states relating to trademarks (Official Journal, 299/25, of November 11th 2008). This repealed and replaced EU Directive 89/104. There is no deadline for transposition, so a member state may deem that its existing legislation is already aligned with the codified version.

International patent protection is available through the  European Patent Treaty or through an international patent based on the Patent Co-operation Treaty. Applications can be made through the  European Patent Office in Munich, with applications accepted in English, French or German.  European Union-wide trademark and design protection can be obtained via the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trademarks and Designs) (OHIM) in Alicante, Spain (EU Trademark Regulation, Council Regulation (EC)
207/2009 of February 26th 2009 on the Community trademark (Official Journal, L78/1 2009 of March 23rd
2009), which is a codified version of the original 1994 regulation). Companies in the  European Union have
the choice of trademark protection under the  European system. It has been possible since October 1st
2004 to apply via OHIM for protection in the more than 70 countries that are party to the World Intellectual
Property Organisation’s Madrid Protocol. Similarly, companies in those countries can apply for the EU
trademark through their national trademark offices.

A similar system has applied to industrial designs since January 1st 2008, following accession by the EU in September 2007 to the Geneva Act of The Hague Agreement on the international registration of industrial designs. France became a party to the Geneva Act in its own right on March 18th 2007. As a result of EU Accession to the Geneva Act, EU designers can apply for international protection of their designs under the act, and designers established in one of the contracting-party countries will be entitled to apply for
protection of their designs under the EU design system operated by OHIM.

Filing via OHIM has in the past delayed the process, so some businesses preferred to file trademarks and designs with the INPI and offices in other EU states for faster, albeit more costly, registration. OHIM has been shortening registration time: it aims to publish 70% of new trademark applications where a national search for existing registration of similar marks is also sought within 33 weeks. Where there is no national search, the target is 70% within 26 weeks. In 2009, the average time from application to registration for a straightforward trademark fell to seven months, down from 11 months three years earlier. OHIM aims to publish 80% of design registrations within 45 days. The introduction of electronic filing tools has helped reduce processing times, with 90% of trademark applications and around two-thirds of design applications filed electronically in 2009.

A downside to registration through OHIM is the need to file in a number of languages and the risk of being totally unprotected if the application is rejected.

Software is not patentable. The European Parliament rejected proposals to make it patentable in July 2005 after months of controversy. The European Commission will put forward a revised proposal only if the Parliament specifically requests it, which it had not done by late April 2010 and was not expected to do. If a member state decides to allow software patenting, the  European Court of Justice would be the ultimate arbiter of whether this would be compatible with EU principles.

A compulsory licence can be obtained for an unworked patent three years after grant of the patent or four years after the application was filed, unless the patent holder can show good cause why the patent has not been worked.
Trademarks. Since March 10th 2008, it has no longer been compulsory for an application for a trademark
to be preceded by a search of both EU and national trademarks. The national search has become optional,
and the national trademark-registration authorities may conduct it.

France takes a broad approach to the trademarks and service marks that can be registered, and it allows the registration of combinations of letters or numbers that might not be registrable elsewhere. A trademark may not be deceptive or contrary to public morals. Existing trademarks can be searched online at www.icimarques.fr, and company names at  www.infogreffe.fr. The INPI itself will not do a search; it is up to existing trademark holders to oppose duplication or overlap when the trademark is published in the INPI’s official bulletin. The courts will consider a trademark lapsed if it has not been actively used for five years. Trademark holders can have counterfeit goods seized, but they must launch court proceedings within 15 days; otherwise, the goods will automatically be released.

French law requires the use of French in all business transactions, including advertising and invoices (though advertisers sometimes include the French translation only in small print). Trademarks can be an exception, however, if they are well recognised by the general public (Law 94/665 of August 4th 1994).

Designs and models can receive protection for five years, renewable four times. Those registered before October 2001 were automatically protected for 25 years. Those that reached the end of the 25-year protection period before October 2001 could renew the protection for another 25 years.

Designs and models must be novel and have unique characteristics to be registered. If they are not disseminated within one year of registration, it may be difficult to defend their novelty. Lines, contours, colours, form, texture or materials may be used to differentiate a design. Industrial and craft objects can be the object of design, as can packaging, presentation, graphic and typographic symbols. Computer programs do not qualify.

Following adoption in 2001 of the EU Design Regulation, a single form of protection is available across the EU for designs and co-exists with the French system. The regulation offers two types of design protection: the registered  European Union design (available since April 1st 2003 from OHIM) and the unregistered EU design (available since March 5th 2002, since the regulation applied immediately in EU member states 60 days after publication in the EU Official Journal L003, January 5th 2002). For both types of protection, designs must be new and have an individual character. Registered designs are protected for 25 years against both independent development of a separate design and deliberate copying. Unregistered designs are protected for only three years and only against deliberate copying. This protection applies from the date of disclosure of designs to the EU public either through designs going on sale or through prior marketing or publicity.

Copyrights. French copyright legislation adheres to internationally agreed terms and conditions. The Intellectual Property Code, much of which now includes EU requirements, provides basic copyright protection for literary or artistic expressions of an idea or concept, for audiovisual works, performing artists and original computer software that results from the author’s personal, creative and intellectual work. It also protects the seasonal clothing, fabric and leather goods of the fashion industry and databases. Copyright protection was extended to work that is reproduced digitally by Law 2001/624 of July 17th 2001.

Page 188 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Copyright protection lasts for 70 years from the death of an author. Legislation approved by the  European Parliament in April 2009 extended the protection of work of performing artists to 70 years from 50 previously. As at April 2010 the legislation still required approval from the  European Council before taking effect. A breach of an author’s property or ethical rights is deemed copyright infringement. The author or a person with title to exploit the work has the right to have all infringing objects seized and to bring court action for infringement. Public lending rights have been introduced in accordance with EU requirements and are paid by libraries on the basis of their purchases, not actual lending.

France is very active in pursuing cases of counterfeiting because it has a number of luxury brands that are frequent targets of counterfeiters. The French Manufacturers Union (Union des fabricants—Unifab) published a report in April 2010 showing that 27% of French businesses were each spending more than
€1m a year protecting their intellectual property worldwide. Unifab was among the signatories to an anti-counterfeiting charter unveiled in December 2009 by the industry lobby group the National
Anti-Counterfeiting Committee, the government and a number of major Internet companies. The voluntary charter outlines best practices for combating the sale and promotion of counterfeit goods online, which is seen as the primary channel for illicit goods.

Law 2004/204 of March 9th 2004 strengthened anti-counterfeiting law. It made counterfeiting punishable by up to three years in prison and  fines of up to €300,000. This doubled previous penalties and takes them beyond thresholds that enable offenders to be placed in preventive detention. Trademark breaches are punishable with prison sentences of up to four years and  fines of up to €400,000, and an extra year and another €100,000 if it is the work of organised crime. Moreover, counterfeiting has been added to the list of crimes for which customs officers have powers to infiltrate the criminal fraternity. Law 2004/575 of
June 21st 2004 extended counterfeiting law to online public-communication services.
France, as a member of the EU, was among the countries negotiating in early 2010 the multilateral
Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The ACTA aims to create a legal framework for combating
large-scale, international violations of intellectual-property rights. It covers a broad range of topics,
including counterfeit goods, generic medicines and digital media distributed via the Internet. The countries
involved in the negotiations (which also include the United States, Japan and Switzerland) released the first
draft of the proposed treaty in April 2010. They hope to encourage emerging markets such as China and
Russia, where much of the world’s counterfeiting takes place, to join the voluntary agreement.

France implemented in 2006 the EU directive on copyright and related rights in the information society (2001/29). This allows anti-copying devices to be included in CDs and DVDs. It established a Technical Measures Regulatory Authority (Autorite de regulation des mesures techniques—ARMT), which was formally set up in April 2007 to oversee digital-rights management.

Additional legislation took effect in France in October 2009 that aimed to develop a “graduated response” system to fighting illegal downloads of copyright-protected material. The system is managed by the ARMT’s successor, the High Authority for the Distribution of Works and Protection of Copyright on the Internet,
better known by its French acronym Hadopi (Haute autorite pour la diffusion des oeuvres et la protection des droits sur internet). Alleged infringers, such as consumers downloading or distributing music or films via peer-to-peer file-sharing websites, are sent a series of warnings by e-mail and post. If these do not result in an end to the activity, they may face suspension of their Internet access,  fines and eventually prison sentences. The parliament passed the initial legislation in May 2009, but the Constitutional Council rejected it in June 2009. The council ruled that only a judge, and not an administrative authority, could restrict an individual’s right to access the Internet. A limited version of the law was published in the Official
Journal (Law 2009/669 of June 12th 2009). The parliament passed additional legislation, known as Hadopi
2, in September 2009, creating an accelerated court procedure to implement the penalties. The
Constitutional Council cleared this in October 2009, and it was published in the Official Journal the same
month (Law 2009/1311 of October 28th 2009).

Patents

Types and duration. Patents: 20 years from date of application. Supplementary protection certificates: Up to seven years. Certificates of utility (no novelty requirement): six years from date of application. Patent applicants enjoy a priority period of up to one year in France if they have already filed an application in another Paris Convention country.
Novelty. Invention need not be totally new if it adds new features to an already patented product or
process. Special rules apply to biotechnological inventions, particularly those involving gene or partial gene
sequences.

Unpatentable. Goods not having an industrial character; discoveries, methods, abstract systems, aesthetic creations, computer programs; treatment and diagnostic methods; animal varieties; otherwise-protected plant varieties; essentially biological processes for producing plants or animals; parts of the human body; items contrary to public order or morals.

Fees. Fee of €36 for paper applications and €26 for electronic filing for application if documents conform exactly to requirements of the National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle—INPI) for size and manner of execution, plus various taxes based on the size of the document;
€500 for search report; €150 for a request from another country for a search report; €86 upon issue of patent; various other fees. Annual fees range from €36 in the second year to €760 in the 20th. Many of these fees are 25% or 50% less (depending on the fee) for small businesses and individuals. Usually, the reduction is 50%.

Compulsory licensing. Patents must be used in France within three years of issue or four years of filing, whichever is later. Use may not be interrupted for more than three consecutive years. Compulsory licences may be granted for non-use, for dependent patents and in the interest of public health or national defence. A licence of right may be granted for an ex-officio licence or for any product not manufactured in a manner suitable for the French economy.
Industrial designs and models

A filing fee of €38 is payable for the first graphic or photographic reproduction, plus €22 for each additional reproduction up to 100 (black and white) and €45 (colour). Registration is valid for five years and renewable for €50 for up to four more five-year periods (for 25 years in all). To register the date of creation of a design or model (or other invention or creation), the sealed-envelope process may be used at a cost of €15 per application.
Trademarks

Page 190 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Types and duration. Both trademarks and service marks are available. Collective marks also are available. Marks are valid for up to ten years from filing date and may be renewed for an unlimited number of additional ten-year periods.

Legal effect. Marks must be registered to receive protection, and registration in effect confers proprietary rights. The owner of a well-known mark may secure annulment of a newly registered mark within five years by proving that the new mark leads to confusion with the well-known mark.

Not registrable. Marks that are a threat to public order or morality, deceptive marks, generic designations and marks composed exclusively of terms indicating the essential quality of the product or service. The registration of a family name will not prevent another person of the same name from making use of it, except that the first registrant may take legal action to control use of the name when confusion is likely to result.

Fees. Fee of €225 for first deposit (up to three classes), plus €40 for further classes; €240 for renewal up to three classes, plus €38 per additional class. Legal fees to register a trademark are about €5,000.
Copyrights

Types and duration. Copyright confers a property right and an ethical right. The property right is the right to exploit the work for profit, which remains the author’s for life and may be passed on to heirs for another 70 years. For collectively owned copyrights and musical compositions (including any lyrics), the duration is 70 years from January 1st of the year following the date on which the copyright is registered or the work is published. For works of art (as distinguished from literary or other creative works), the property right includes a guaranteed 3% royalty on proceeds of any exploitation or sale. The ethical right protects the author’s personal identity and the integrity of the copyrighted work; it has no fixed duration and remains
with the author’s heirs for an indefinite period of time. Copyright legislation is based on the requirements of the European Union, which are set out in Directives 92/100 and 93/98 and amendments. These were repealed and codified for easy reading in 2006 in Directives 2006/115 and 2006/118.

Legal effect. Copyright protection begins automatically at inception of the work and is enforceable through the civil courts. France protects copyrights granted in other member countries of the Bern Convention.
Fees. No registration is required and no fees are charged.

Industrial property such as patents, registered designs, trademarks and service marks may be registered at the National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle—INPI). The necessary documentation is available from the INPI’s head office in Paris, one of its 19 regional offices in mainland France or its international representatives at the French embassies in China, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.

The INPI is responsible for all internal procedures on filing, examining and issuing patents and for registering and publishing designs and trademarks. Either the inventor or the assignee may submit patent applications. Those residing outside the  European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) must appoint an agent from within the area. To lay first claim to an invention while an application
is prepared, inventors and designers can deposit a record with the INPI in a so-called Soleau envelope. The envelopes are kept for five years, renewable once.

CureDM (US) granted a global licence in April 2010 to Sanofi-Aventis, a French pharmaceuticals maker, to develop, manufacture and commercialise Pancreate, a treatment shown in preclinical studies to help stimulate insulin production. Phase-1 studies were planned for later in 2010. CureDM, a
biopharmaceuticals company focused on metabolic diseases, will receive an upfront payment, as well as development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, which could reach US$335m. In addition, CureDM is eligible to receive tiered royalties on worldwide product sales.

Chiquita, a US-based fruit group, agreed in March 2010 to form a joint venture with Danone, a French foods group, to market in  Europe fruit drinks based on Chiquita’s Just Fruit in a Bottle. The joint venture, managed by Danone from Paris, will focus on expanding distribution and sales of the Chiquita drinks. Chiquita will receive a one-time cash payment for a 51% interest in the venture and license its trademark to the new company.

Nagravision (Switzerland) signed a global licence agreement in November 2009 with Neotion, a French manufacturer of conditional-access modules (CAMs) for pay-TV equipment. The agreement provides that Neotion will be able produce and market CAMs integrating Nagravision’s conditional-access systems. Neotion expects to launch the first Nagravision CAM product in the first half of 2010, initially targeting Spain, France, Italy and Germany.

Companies are free to negotiate licences. It is advisable to register the licence with the National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle—INPI), since an agreement can otherwise be more difficult to defend in the event of a dispute. There are national registers for patent, trademark, design and model, and software licences. Registration also facilitates justification of royalty payments with the tax authorities. The authorities normally accept royalties of 5–10% of turnover from the licence without
difficulty, though the product would need to be technologically advanced at the higher end of the range.

Rates are sometimes set on a declining scale to guarantee a minimum income at the beginning of the contract; the rate then falls as production rises. Royalties paid abroad under patent-licensing agreements are subject to withholding tax.
The US Commercial Service can help US companies identify potential local licensees. It has offices in
Paris and six other French cities.

French companies may enter into any form of licensing arrangement with foreigners, and such arrangements may cover product and process technology as well as marketing, sales and other operations. There are no legal restrictions on the countries to which licences may be granted, but relevant  European Union rules apply, such as on technology-transfer agreements and general competition-law principles. These preclude market-sharing and abuse of a dominant position.

Registration is compulsory within one month of negotiating the licence if one of the parties is not French, in order to provide the National Industrial Property Institute (Institut national de la propriete industrielle) with statistical information on technology transfer. The declaration obligation is on the French party to the licence. Revenues from licensing agreements must be declared annually, by March 31st of the following year, and must be broken down into five categories: (1) purchase, sale or concession of patents; (2) purchase, sale or concession of trademarks, designs and models; (3) transfer of know-how and computer software; (4) scientific, technical, and economic research and engineering services; and (5) technical assistance, business organisation and management operations.

Tie-in clauses (forcing licensees to purchase certain supplies) are legal only if the licenser can prove technological necessity. When a licensing agreement incorporates tie-in clauses, it is normal to set royalties at lower rates than would otherwise prevail. For example, if several pharmaceutical companies pay royalties to the same foreign company supplying the active ingredient for a French-made product, a royalty of 3–4% would be appropriate, whereas royalties of 4–5% are typical when there is no tie-in arrangement.

FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

Foreign companies may find that licensing is an attractive way to market their products in the United States, particularly in industries where technology can quickly become obsolete. Licensing may be more effective and less costly than either exporting goods or establishing a branch or subsidiary. The US government plays no part in promoting licensing in particular sectors.

TD
Licensing has its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared with other ways of doing business in the US. The advantages include the following:

the US system of patent and trademark licensing is highly developed, and many licensing arrangements are possible between US and foreign companies;
companies may use licensing to tap into the domestic-market expertise of US companies; and the licenser need not undertake the potentially costly task of penetrating US markets.
The main disadvantages are the following:
companies may find the patent application and defence process to be expensive and time consuming;
licences are subject to US antitrust laws; and
profit for a foreign licenser is limited to royalty fees for its licensed product.
The US is a signatory of the World Trade Organisation’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
(TRIPs) framework.

The US has a well-developed system of licensing that protects patents, trademarks and copyrights. Each has its own set of rules and procedures. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) of the US Department of Commerce issues patents and trademark registrations. Copyrights may be filed with the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.

Patents. Any person who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements of these may obtain a US patent. US patent laws make no distinctions based on the inventor’s citizenship. Patents are issued to individual inventors, who may assign or license their rights. It is legal and customary to require employees to assign their patent rights to their employers.

The basic law specifying the subject matter for which a patent might be obtained and the conditions for patentability took effect in 1953 (Title 35 of the US Code). The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988 amended US patent law to expand protection for owners of US process patents. Now, any person who, without authority, imports into the US or sells or uses in the US a product made outside the country but using a process patented in the US may be liable for infringement. Moreover, as a result of the
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement, on January 1st 1996, US patent law

Page 193 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
was expanded to include the importation and offer for sale of patented products and processes as acts of infringement.

The Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999 requires that all patent applications filed in the US and in another foreign country be published 18 months after filing. The bill also states that published applications will constitute prior references that can be applied to deny a patent to another applicant, in effect treating them as prior inventions and not as mere prior publications.

In April 2010 the USPTO launched the Ombudsman Pilot Programme to assist applicants with issues that may arise during patent applications. The programme aims to make the patent process more user friendly and to address unanticipated concerns that may arise.

In 2006 the USPTO implemented an accelerated approval process to give applicants quality patents in less time. In exchange for quick examination, patent examiners now receive more focused and detailed information about the invention. To be eligible for accelerated examination, applicants must provide specific information, known as an examiner support document. In return, the USPTO issues a final decision by the examiner within 12 months. Any invention that is new, useful, non-obvious and which is accompanied by a written description disclosing how to make and use it can be patented. Applicants’
submissions enjoy a presumption of patentability. Thus, to reject an application, the USPTO is responsible for ensuring that any evidence indicating that the invention is not new or is obvious (known as “prior art”)
is identified besides explaining why the invention is not patentable in view of the evidence.

Applicants have a duty to disclose to the USPTO relevant prior art of which they are aware, but they need not search for prior art. Under the USPTO’s accelerated-examination procedure, however, applicants
must conduct a search of the prior art, submit all prior art that is closest to their invention, and explain how their invention is different. The accelerated-examination programme limits the number of claims allowed in each application and shortens the periods for responding to most USPTO communications.

Trademarks. A US trademark relates to any word, name, symbol or device used in the trade of goods or services to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services and to distinguish them from the goods or services of others. Trademarks may be obtained to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks, but they may not be used to keep others from manufacturing the item or offering the services concerned.
Trademark rights in the US are now acquired through common law “use requirements” and not, as in
many countries, through first registration. Nevertheless, US law does allow for the filing of an intent-to-use
application, which provides a constructive first-use date based on the filing date. To receive the
registration, use must be proved. A trademark’s continued use, therefore, is necessary for the protection
to remain in force. A US trademark right is acquired through adoption and by use of a mark on goods or in
connection with services, or by filing an intent-to-use application that is supported by later use.

The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 imposes criminal penalties (such as seizure, steep  fines and possible prison terms) for trafficking in goods or services bearing a counterfeit mark.

Customs Service regulations implemented in March 1999 include an amended “affiliate exception”, intended to avoid consumer confusion. Under the rules, foreign goods that are different from US goods bearing a legal trademark are not detained if the merchandise bears a conspicuous label that should include the following words: “This product is not a product authorised by the United States trademark owner for importation and is physically and materially different from the authorised product.” The regulations also provide a standard to determine whether goods are “physically or materially different”.
Trade secrets are considered a form of property. Since enactment of the Economic Espionage Act of
1996, the US Department of Justice has been granted jurisdiction (previously left to the states) over the
protection of trade secrets. The department’s computer crime and intellectual-property section is the
responsible agency. Under the general outline of the trade-secret doctrine, the owner of a trade secret has
the right to use it to his economic advantage. The law also protects the holder of a trade secret against
disclosure gained by improper means, such as theft, wiretapping or even aerial reconnaissance.
Trade-secrets law does not offer protection, however, against discovery by fair and honest means, such
as independent invention, accidental disclosure or reverse engineering.

Copyrights. The Copyright Act of 1976 provides that US copyright protection is automatically extended to “original works of authorship” at the time of their creation. This provides the owner with exclusive rights to reproduce and sell a work. Works that can be copyrighted include motion pictures, sound recordings and computer software.

The holder of a US patent, trademark or copyright may sue the infringer through the US federal court system, though the process can be long and costly. The holder may also obtain an injunction and may sue for damages. A foreign patent holder who licenses a patent in the US may still be able to sue an infringer directly if the licence agreement allows.

Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, is an attractive alternative to federal patent litigation involving international trade, which typically lasts many years. Under this section, the International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates infringement claims. The ITC must conclude its investigation as quickly as possible and must, within 45 days of its start, establish a target date for issuing a final declaration.

The amended code also eliminates the need to prove “injury” to the domestic industry and provides for expedited consideration of requests for temporary relief (such as temporary exclusion orders and temporary cease-and-desist orders) if there is reason to believe a violation has occurred. In the event of a temporary exclusion order, entry may only be under bond. The result of a successful claim can be drastic: an infringing product is generally excluded from entry into the US.

The Copyright Act does impose certain limits on holders’ rights. Limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners include the doctrine of “fair use” (Section 107), which permits the use of copyrighted information for news reporting, teaching, research and a few other pursuits, and the allowances for “compulsory licensing” (Section 115) when royalty payments are made.

The Enforcement of Intellectual Property (IP) Rights Act came into law in October 2008 and created a White House-level IP enforcement division within the Department of Justice to deal specifically with IP issues. The act also raised financial penalties for copyright infringement. The IP co-ordinator oversees the law-enforcement efforts of the various government agencies that deal with piracy and IP
infringement—the US Trade Representative and the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice and
State.

IP laws and trade policy are closely linked. An amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 linked the benefits of the Generalised System of Preferences to the protection abroad of US IP rights. The Trade Act of 1984 empowered the government to bring cases charging unfair trade practice against countries that lack IP protection. The 1986 “Statement on the Protection of US Intellectual Property Rights Abroad” detailed problems in this area, including the absence or inadequacy of national laws and enforcement. It also outlined a series of multilateral, bilateral and domestic initiatives in response. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 increased the government’s leverage in using trade policy to compel foreign governments to increase their levels of protection of US IP rights.

Since January 1st 1996 certain creative works of non-US origin that had been in the public domain in the US had their copyright protection automatically restored. These included books, films, sculptures, paintings, music, photographs, computer software and anything else that is eligible for US copyright protection. Congress changed US copyright law to this effect in late 1994 when it ratified the trade agreements that created the World Trade Organisation. The owner of a work that originated outside the US can now claim infringement of copyright in the US, but only after filing a notice of intent to enforce a restored copyright. This notice may be filed with either the Copyright Office or the party using the work. The Copyright Office has additional information about works whose owners have filed such notices.

Patents. Although obtaining a US patent can be difficult, it is becoming less time consuming. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has made efforts to make the patent-application process more efficient and timely. The cost depends on the complexity of the invention. Many thousands of foreign residents file for and receive US patents each year.

In general, US requirements to establish usefulness, novelty and utility and to specify, document and corroborate the inventor’s claims are complex and differ enough from other countries’ requirements that it is virtually impossible to apply for a US patent with a simple translation of a foreign application. It is advisable to use the services of a US patent attorney or patent agent in preparing the application and in undertaking, if needed, subsequent amendments, appeals and interference proceedings.

Typically, the examiner in charge of the application issues a series of office actions. Each office action presents the examiner’s findings on the patentability of the invention. A response must be submitted to answer each point raised by the examiner.

The patent office declares an interference in the rare event that a concurrent application is submitted by another for the same invention. At that point, conception must be shown “coupled with diligence in reducing it to practice”. Only actions taken within the US are reliable in proving conception and actual reduction to practice. Otherwise, the date of filing of the US patent application is presumed to be the date of invention. Foreign applicants unprepared to meet this unusual test could lose their claims to patent rights during interference proceedings when several applicants claim the same invention.

Applicants for US patents must provide a clear, concise and accurate description of their invention; this may necessitate a drawing. The patent application must describe the invention such that someone knowledgeable in the field could reproduce it. Failure to include essential information could cause the


Page 195 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
patent to fail a court test of validity. Moreover, patent claims that are not clear enough may be declared invalid. More-detailed information and forms are available from the USPTO.

The application is examined for patentability (including novelty, utility and non-obviousness to someone of ordinary skill in the art in question) and whether it is for a single invention only. If the application is approved, the patent is granted. Appeals go to the Board of Appeals. Any person may file for
post-issuance re-examination of any patent claim on the basis of specified forms of a prior art.

In its new accelerated programme, the USPTO promises to issue a ruling on patentability within six months (down from the previous 18-month goal) if the application includes detailed information, such as prior-art disclosure and relevance, upfront.

Although the US is not a direct signatory to the  European Patent Convention, US applicants may file for coverage under the European treaty. The USPTO now conducts international searches under the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) for such applications. Chapter II of the PCT allows US nationals to have a PCT application examined on the basis of information uncovered during a PCT search. Other benefits for applicants include additional time to decide whether to pursue a patent prior to incurring major expenses and also permission to deal directly with examiners at the  European Patent Office, thus reducing the cost of employing a foreign agent.

The Supreme Court in April 1996 unanimously decided lengthy litigation on the relative role of judges or juries in patent-infringement lawsuits. The ruling held that judges, because of their technical skills, are better suited to define the terms of patents and promote uniformity in the patent system. In general, jurors still have the authority to determine the related question of whether a patent, as defined by a judge, should be found to have been infringed.

Trademarks. A trademark’s registration in the Principal Register of the USPTO provides constructive notice of the registrant’s claim of ownership and prima facie evidence of the registration’s validity. The registrant’s ownership of the mark and exclusive right to use it in commerce in connection with goods or services are limited by the description of the mark and the goods or services in the registration certificate. Without registration jurisdiction, the trademark user may not sue in US federal courts without a separate basis for federal jurisdiction. Trademark registrations may be filed with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (formerly the US Customs Service) to prevent imports bearing an infringing mark.

Terms or designs that are refused regular registration may be entered in the Supplemental Register if the owner can prove that the terms or designs may be of use in future. The terms or designs must be in commercial use for the goods or services listed in the application. Supplemental registration allows the trademark owner to sue for infringements (including sometimes in foreign courts) but does not convey any of the other rights of principal registration.

A registrant should give notice that his mark is registered by displaying with it the phrase “Reg. US Pat. Off.” or the letter R enclosed by a circle. The use of such notice before the registration certificate has actually been issued may be basis for the rejection of the registration. Many trademark owners use the non-statutory symbols “TM” for trademark rights and “SM” for service marks to assert their trademark rights and deter potential infringers. Additional information and forms may be obtained from the USPTO.

Foreign trademark applicants must designate a local lawyer or other representative domiciled in the US. A written application is required, along with a drawing of the mark and five specimens or facsimiles showing its use. Use in commerce within the US or in interstate commerce is usually required before registration; foreigners may base applications on an application or registration in their country of origin.

Applications to the commissioner of patents and trademarks are examined for correctness. The applicant must respond to any objections raised within six months, or the application will be considered abandoned. Trademarks are published in the weekly official gazette; 30 days are allowed to file opposition. The USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decides on such cases.

Copyrights. Under US law, any work of original authorship is automatically copyrighted by the author. Copyright notice has not been a legal requirement since 1989. It serves solely to inform the public of copyright protection that exists with or without the notice. Notice generally consists of a copyright symbol: the letter C enclosed by a circle, the abbreviation “Copr.” or the word “Copyright”; the year of the work’s first publication; and the copyright owner’s full name or a recognisable abbreviation. Without this notification, a copyright may be lost without recourse.

Registration of a copyright with the Copyright Office is a prerequisite for bringing an infringement action, but it is not required for the copyright to exist. Obtaining this registration is quick, easy and inexpensive. Information and forms for copyright registration may be obtained from the Copyright Office.

Conventions. Paris Convention, 1883–1967; Patent Co-operation Treaty, 1970; Universal Copyright
Convention, 1955; Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 1989 (updated in
1996 but not yet ratified); Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property of 1996
(TRIPs). The United States is not a direct signatory to the  European Patent Convention, but US
applicants can use the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) as a way to file for coverage under the
European treaty.

Basic laws. Patent Act of 1952, as amended; Lanham Trademark Act of 1946, as amended; Copyright Act of 1976.
Patents

Types and duration. For patent applications filed after June 8th 1995, duration is 20 years from date of filing for a regular utility patent. For patents in force on June 8th 1995, or from patent applications filed on or before June 8th 1995, duration is the longer of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the filing date. The duration for design patents is 14 years from the date of issue. Design patents offer protection for new, original ornamental designs; protection covers only appearance, not structure or mechanical
features.

Novelty. Not known or used in the United States or patented or described in a printed publication anywhere before the date of invention by the applicant, and not patented or described in a printed publication anywhere, or in public use, or for sale in the US more than one year before application.

Unpatentable. Inventions cannot be patented if they are considered not sufficiently useful or novel, or if they are obvious to one skilled in the art. Medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and similar products can be patented.

Fees. For any utility patent filed on or after December 8th 2004, fees are as follows: US$165 for a small-business entity and US$330 for others, plus US$110 and US$220, respectively, for each independent claim in excess of three; US$26 and US$52, respectively, for each independent claim in excess of 20. An issue fee of US$755 for small businesses and US$1,510 for others is required if a patent is granted. Scaled maintenance fees, of US$980–4,110 (or US$490–2,055, for small businesses), are charged to maintain patents beyond 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years. Failure to make payments on time also
incurs late fees of US$130–1,640 for large companies and a flat fee of US$65 for small businesses.
Re-examination costs US$2,520. Fees differ for design and plant patents. A full list of applicable fees can
be obtained from the Patent and Trademark Office.

Compulsory licensing. A patent includes the right to exclude others from making, using or selling the invention throughout the United States.
Industrial designs and models

According to US patent law, the US Patent and Trademark Office examines applications and grants design patents to any person who has invented any new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. A design patent protects only the appearance of the article and not structural or utilitarian features. To obtain a design patent, an applicant must describe the nature and intended use of the article in which the design is embodied; provide cross-references to related applications; describe the drawings and features of the design; and provide photographs.
For any design patent filed on or after December 8th 2004, fees are as follows: US$110 for a
small-business entity and US$220 for others. An issue fee of US$430 for small businesses and US$860
for others is required if a design patent is granted. Scaled maintenance fees, of US$980–4,110 (or
US$490–2,055, for small businesses), are charged to maintain patents beyond 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years.
Trademarks

Types and duration. Trademarks and service marks are available. Rights last indefinitely if the owner continues to use a mark. Federal trademark registration lasts ten years, but the owner of the trademark must file an affidavit showing the trademark is still in use (or there is excusable non-use) in the sixth year following registration. Failure to do so cancels the registration.

Legal effect. First use or first-to-file supported by later use confers proprietary rights; the right becomes incontestable with the filing of an affidavit of incontestability within the sixth year following registration.

Not registrable. Marks that comprise immoral, deceptive or scandalous matter, that merely describe or are generic terms for the goods and services marketed, or that resemble already registered marks and would cause confusion. Names used to identify businesses, vocations or occupations, or the names of titles


Page 197 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
lawfully adopted by persons, firms, associations, companies, unions and other organisations are not usually subject to registration but may be registered if actually used as trademarks.
Fees. Registrations filed on paper cost US$375 and registrations filed electronically cost US$325. Copyright
Types and duration. A copyright may be obtained for all original works of authorship. For works created on or after January 1st 1978, a copyright is protected for 70 years after the death of the author. Original
works made for hire are protected for 95 years after publication or 120 years after creation, whichever period is shorter. Copyrights are filed with the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress.

Legal effect. It is illegal for anyone to infringe a copyright. However, certain limitations may apply, including “fair use” provisions and compulsory licensing, as long as royalties are paid. For certain educational purposes, limited use and copying may be permitted without the payment of royalties.

Registrable. A copyright may be obtained for different types of literary,  dramatic,  musical, artistic, architectural and other intellectual works, including computer software programs, sound recordings and motion pictures. The following are not registrable: works that have not been fixed in tangible form of expression; titles, names, short phrases, slogans, familiar symbols or designs, variations of typographic ornamentation etc; ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes etc; and works consisting entirely of information that is common property and that contain no original authorship.
Fees. Registration, US$50-65 for paper filing; US$35 for electronic filing.

Royalties and fees are freely negotiable in the United States. The amount depends on how valuable the patent is, how much production know-how the licenser has already developed, how much profit the licensee might expect and the commercial strengths of the licenser and the licensee. Foreign companies that are just starting to look for licensing partners should contact local and regional chambers of commerce in the US.

As the US market grows and technologies rapidly become obsolete, the average life of a licensing agreement tends to get shorter and royalty rates lower. For the same reasons, devices such as lump-sum royalties are not common, but advance payments and disclosure fees for know-how to offset lower royalty payments are widespread. Royalty payments are usually based on the number of units produced or a percentage of the gross or net sales price of the articles produced under the licence. Rates vary widely
but are often 2–5% of net sales. Exclusive licences usually require payment of a minimum royalty.

An exclusive licensee is allowed to sue in its own name against infringement of the licenser’s patent. The licensing agreement normally specifies which parties have the right to sue for infringement and the licenser’s obligations to enforce the patent.

In May 2010 iPS Academia Japan, a firm that manages stem-cell-technology patents, negotiated a licensing agreement with Cellular Dynamics, an American stem-cell research and technology development firm. The agreement will allow Cellular Dynamics to make use of the Japanese company’s key patents for pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which can reprogram human skin cells into their embryonic state with potential of differentiation. The US firm will pay unspecified royalties to iPS Academia Japan for use of this technology.

In March 2010 NicOx, a French pharmaceutical firm, signed a licensing agreement with Bausch &Lomb, a US supplier of eye-health products such as contact lenses, for NicOx’s experimental glaucoma treatment known as NCX 116. Bausch &Lomb will pay an initial fee of US$10m and make subsequent payments up to a total of US$169.5m over the term of the contract. NicOx will also receive royalties based on the sales of NCX 116.

In March 2010 LEGO Group, the Danish toy manufacturer, extended its previous ten-year licensing agreement with Warner Bros Home Entertainment Group, the US entertainment firm, to continue developing and promoting video games based on the LEGO brand. The US firm will have the rights to continue developing family-friendly videogames such as LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Batman and LEGO Indiana Jones until 2016.

In January 2010 Varioptic, a French liquid-lens producer, signed a licensing agreement with Cognex, a US-based vision sensor and systems manufacturer, allowing Cognex to use Varioptic’s liquid lens products to add auto-focus capabilities. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

No government approval is needed for foreign licensing of technology in the United States, but companies operating in the US are subject to export controls on the transfer of certain technology abroad. The

government imposes no controls or limitations on remittances of royalties and fees or restrictions on paying a parent company.

US antitrust laws apply to licensing agreements. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (the two federal antitrust-enforcement entities) issued joint antitrust guidelines in April 1995 for licensing intellectual property. The guidelines reaffirm the government’s view that intellectual property and its licensing are not inherently suspect (as they were in the early 1970s when many forms of restrictive licensing provisions were viewed as illegal per se). The general approach is to evaluate the
effect on competition. Hence, certain restrictive provisions that would raise no antitrust concern if engaged in by two small participants in an industry could run foul of the antitrust laws if engaged in by major participants in a concentrated market.

The guidelines introduced a number of concepts. One is a “safe harbour”, under which the government will not challenge licensing between two companies that together have less than a 20% market share in the affected market, unless there are “extraordinary circumstances”. Another concept is an analysis of the competitive effects of licensing not only on product markets but also on “technology markets” and “innovation markets”.

The guidelines state government-enforcement policy but do not prevent private parties from initiating antitrust actions in connection with intellectual property. The following types of licensing practices are contrary to US antitrust law:

requiring a licensee to purchase separate unpatented products as a condition of obtaining the licence for a patented product;
requiring mandatory package licensing;
forming a cartel through exclusive cross-licensing;

using a patent, trademark or trade secret as the basis for an agreement that restrains where, how or to whom a patented product is disposed of in the US after the licenser or licensee has sold the product to an independent purchaser;

agreeing in relation to a licence that no further licences will be granted to any third party without the licensee’s consent;

requiring a licensee to adhere to any specified or minimum price for the licensee’s sale of the licensed products;

insisting as a condition of the licence that the licensee pay royalties in an amount not reasonably related to the licensee’s sale of products covered by the licensed rights;

attempting to enforce a patent licence or collect a royalty on it beyond the patent’s term (this reasoning could apply to attempts to enforce/collect royalties on a licence based on know-how that has entered the public domain); and

requiring a licensee to agree in advance to grant back to the licenser title or an exclusive licence on any new patents or trade secrets related to the licensed technology rights that the licensee may obtain or develop. (This is because a non-exclusive grant-back clause should meet the legitimate needs of the licenser, whereas an exclusive grant-back clause may perpetuate a monopoly and discourage innovation.)

Patent licensing and technical-assistance agreements do not need to be recorded with the US Patent and Trademark Office to have legal effect, but if an assignment, grant or conveyance of a patent is not registered with the office within three months of its taking place, it might be void against a subsequently recorded purchase. A few states have prescribed certain formalities to be observed concerning the sale of patent rights.
No regulations limit the licensing of improvements and developments of the initial patent. However, the
Department of Justice may challenge exclusive grant-back agreements.

HD     INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY/COMPETITION : COMMISSION FINES TEN MEMORY CHIP PRODUCERS

On 19 May, the European Commission adopted its first settlement decision in a  cartel case involving ten producers of memory chips or DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory), used in computers and servers. This is a simplified procedure introduced in 2008 that allows the  Commission to settle  cartel cases more quickly.

The cartel was in operation between 1 July 1998 and 15 June 2002. It involved a network of contacts and sharing of secret information, mostly on a bilateral basis, through which they coordinated the price levels for DRAMs sold to major PC or server original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the EEA..

TD
The firms concerned are Micron, Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Elpida and Nanya. The  fines amount to €331,273,800. Micron, which informed the  Commission of the existence of the cartel in 2002, was given full immunity. Apart from the German firm Infineon, the companies involved are not European but sell their products in the  European Economic Area (EEA: EU + Norway, Iceland
and Liechtenstein) and must abide by EU law that bans practices that restrict competition.

This case marks the  Commission's first use of the settlement procedure(1). It is different from commitment decisions(2), which are meant to bring anti-competitive behaviour to an end by making commitments offered by the company legally binding. The settlement decision is meant to shorten administrative procedures and reduce investigation costs. Companies involved may at any time before the statement of objections notify the  Commission that they wish to reach a settlement. The  Commission is not obliged to use this procedure and has total discretion for deciding whether or not the case lends itself
to it. If it decides to use the settlement procedure, it gives the parties a deadline for declaring in writing that they are willing to take part in discussions with a view to reaching a settlement.
"IT PAYS!"

The companies must clearly and unequivocally acknowledge their participation in the infringement. Doing so is in their interest: their  fine is reduced by 10%, decisions are quicker and companies can rebuild their reputation more swiftly. "Cooperating with the  Commission pays," explained Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who plans to make the new procedure a success in combating cartels. He estimates that the time needed for settlements in such cases could be brought down to six months at most. There
are advantages for the EU executive in this procedure as well, in particular in the reasons for the decision, which can be briefer and less detailed. The commissioner added that this type of cooperation instrument does not do away with the possibility of an appeal before the EU General Court, unlike its American equivalent. The  fines imposed take into account the EEA sales of the companies concerned as well as
the very serious nature and geographical extent of the infringement.
The fines
The following  fines (in euro) were imposed after the 10% reduction pursuant to the settlement procedure;
in brackets, the reductions under the leniency notice:
Micro: 0 (100%)
Infineon: 56,700,000 (45%)

SEOUL, June 10 (Yonhap) -- LG Electronics Inc., Korean Air and two other major South Korean firms are on a list of the world's top 10 companies that have paid a large amount in penalties to U.S. authorities for price rigging and involvement in other  cartel activities, a report showed Thursday.

According to the report by the Fair Trade Commission of Korea, the four companies that also include Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. have been  fined a combined 1.6 trillion won (US$1.28 billion) in the U.S. since 1999 for anti-competition practices.

TD
Of the world's top 10 firms, LG Electronics ranked second by paying around $400 million in  fines last year after it was found to have rigged prices for flat panels. The company followed Hoffman La Roche of Switzerland which was slapped with $500 million in penalties for fixing prices on one of its pharmaceutical products in 1999, the report showed.

Korean Air, South Korea's leading flag carrier, came in fourth with  fines of $300 million for colluding on prices of freight and passenger fares. Samsung Electronics, the world's leading maker of memory chips and flat panels, and Hynix  Semiconductor, its key rival in the memory chip sector, ranked sixth and eighth, respectively, according to the report.

A total of eight Korean companies, including the cited major businesses, were  fined in the U.S. over the past decade, the report showed.

By region, four Korean companies including Samsung Electronics and Hynix  Semiconductor, paid a combined 219.3 million  euros in the European Union countries. CJ Cheiljedang was the sole Korean company that paid penalties to Canada during this period, while Samsung SDI and LG Display were  fined in Japan.
Their combined fines to foreign countries have exceeded 2 trillion won, the report showed.

"While EU countries usually keep their focus on  eurozone companies for their involvement in  cartel activities, U.S. authorities carry out strict clampdowns on foreign exporters from major trading partners such as South Korea," an FTC official said. "Our companies have to take more heed in doing business in the U.S. market (not to be involved in  cartel practices)." kokobj@yna.co.kr (END)

Agency on Thursday.

----- (LEAD) (rocket launch) S. Korea to launch Naro-1 space rocket on Thursday NARO SPACE CENTER, South Korea -- South Korea decided to launch its locally assembled rocket on Thursday after the release of an emergency fire extinguisher caused the countdown sequence to be halted a day earlier.

TD
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology said it checked the cause of the abnormal release of extinguisher fluids and said that it did not affect the operational safety of the Naro-1 rocket.

----- (LEAD) Bank of Korea freezes key rate, warns of inflation risks SEOUL -- South Korea's central bank froze its key interest rate for a 16th month on Thursday amid economic uncertainty from  Europe's debt crisis, but warned against inflationary pressure down the road, signaling that a rate hike is in the offing.

----- Gov't website hit by cyber attack traced to China: home ministry SEOUL, June 10 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's government website came under a massive attack Wednesday evening from hackers traced to China, the home ministry said.

suffered access delays and failures for nearly four hours until midnight due to what is known as distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, the ministry said Thursday.

----- 4 major Korean firms  fined for price rigging in U.S. over past decade: FTC SEOUL -- LG Electronics Inc., Korean Air and two other major South Korean firms are on a list of the world's top 10 companies that have paid a large amount in penalties to U.S. authorities for price rigging and involvement in other  cartel activities, a report showed Thursday.

----- Bernanke supports early ratification of Korea FTA WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke Wednesday supported early ratification of the free trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, pending for years.

----- (rocket launch) Ground controllers lose contact with space rocket after takeoff

TD
NARO SPACE CENTER, South Korea, June 10 (Yonhap) -- South Korean ground controllers said Thursday that they had lost contact with the Naro-1 space rocket 137 seconds after liftoff from a space center on the country's south coast.

The state-run Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) said the rocket broke the sound barrier before contact was lost.
----- China expresses understanding of S. Korea's position on ship sinking
SEOUL, June 10 (Yonhap) -- China has expressed understanding of how South Korea wants to
handle North Korea's sinking of a warship at the United Nations, a senior diplomat said Thursday after
a trip to convince Beijing to support Seoul's push to censure Pyongyang.

South Korea referred the March sinking of its warship Cheonan to the U.N. Security Council last week for a rebuke of the North, and then dispatched Vice Foreign Minister Chun Yung-woo this week to try to win support from China, one of the five veto-wielding Council members.
----- (World Cup) S. Koreans face tough foes on road to second round

JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Yonhap) -- South Korean footballers are renewing their determination to reach the second round of the World Cup for the first time on foreign soil ahead of Saturday's opener against Greece, as neutral analysts are issuing mixed predictions regarding South Korea's success in South Africa.

The South Korean team arrived in South Africa last week following two weeks of altitude training in Austria. They are set to face off with Greece on Saturday at Port Elizabeth, then against Argentina on June 17 in Johannesburg and Nigeria on June 22 in Durban.
----- BOK freezes key rate, warns of inflation risks

SEOUL, June 10 (Yonhap) -- The chief of the South Korean central bank expressed confidence about economic recovery on Thursday and warned against inflationary pressure down the road, signaling that a rate hike is in the offing.

Bank of Korea (BOK) Gov. Kim Choong-soo made the remarks in a news conference after the central bank froze its key interest rate at a record low of 2 percent for the 16th straight month, amid economic uncertainty stemming from  Europe's debt crisis.
----- Gov't Web site hit by cyber attack traced to China: home ministry

LG Electronics Inc., Korean Air and two other major South Korean firms are on a list of the world's top 10 companies that have paid a large amount in penalties to U.S. authorities for price rigging and involvement in other  cartel activities, a report showed Thursday.

The Fair Trade  Commission of Korea said in a report that the four companies that also include Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix  Semiconductor Inc. have been  fined a combined 1.6 trillion won ($1.28 billion) in the U.S. since 1999 for anti-competition practices.

Of the world's top 10 firms, LG Electronics ranked second by paying around $400 million in  fines last year after it was found to have rigged prices for flat panels. The company followed Hoffman La Roche of Switzerland which was slapped with $500 million in penalties for fixing prices on one of its pharmaceutical products in 1999, the report showed.

Korean Air, South Korea's leading flag carrier, came in fourth with  fines of $300 million for colluding on prices of freight and passenger fares. Samsung Electronics, the world's leading maker of
memory chips and flat panels, and Hynix  Semiconductor, its key rival in the memory chip sector, ranked sixth and eighth, respectively, according to the report.

A total of eight Korean companies, including the cited major businesses, were  fined in the U.S. over the past decade, the report showed.

By region, four Korean companies including Samsung Electronics and Hynix  Semiconductor, paid a combined 219.3 million  euros in the European Union countries. CJ Cheiljedang was the sole Korean company that paid penalties to Canada during this period, while Samsung SDI and LG Display were fined in Japan.
Their combined fines to foreign countries have exceeded 2 trillion won, the report showed.

"While EU countries usually keep their focus on  eurozone companies for their involvement in  cartel activities, U.S. authorities carry out strict clampdowns on foreign exporters from major trading partners such as South Korea," an FTC official said. "Our companies have to take more heed in doing business in the U.S. market (not to be involved in  cartel practices)."

A list of 10 multinational companies that paid the largest antitrust-related  fines to the United States over the past decade includes four Korean heavyweights, according to information released yesterday.The four companies - LG Display Co., Korean Air, Samsung Electronics Co. and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. - shelled out a combined 1.6 trillion won ($1.28 billion) in penalties for their involvement in cartel activities.According to the list, compiled by Korea's Fair Trade  Commission, LG Display came in second among the 10 companies that paid the largest penalties to the U.S. Department of Justice since 1999. The world's second-biggest maker of liquid crystal displays paid $400 million in 2009 for  price-fixing related to LCD panels. LG Display, Sharp Corp. of Japan and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. of Taiwan pleaded guilty to the charges, resulting in $585 million in  fines for the group.Korean Air took the fourth spot, forking over $300 million in 2007 for colluding on air cargo rates.

The U.S. Justice Department levied the  fine for the company's role in fixing international fuel surcharges on cargo shipments with British Airways and other airlines. Samsung Electronics, the world leader in memory chips, and Hynix, the second-biggest producer of memory chips, paid $3 million and $185 million, respectively, for price collusion. The U.S. levied more than $730 million in  fines in 2006 against Samsung and Hynix as well as Infineon Technologies of Germany and Elpida Memory of Japan for the violation. Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland topped the list as it was slapped with the biggest amount -
$500 million for fixing prices of vitamins in 1999. A total of eight Korean companies, including the four, were fined for price fixing  in the U.S. over the past decade. 'While the  European Commission usually keeps an eye on European firms for their involvement in  cartel activities, the U.S. authorities strictly supervise foreign exporters to the United States,' an FTC official said. 'Our companies need to be more careful in doing business in the United States not to be involved in  cartel practices.'By Limb Jae-un [jbiz91@joongang.co.kr]

[*] FRANK: (OFF-MIKE) come to order.

I want to make some announcements. First, I know the Senate is already doing this, and we will be doing it, as well, which is to allow for proxies. The reason is that we plan to be meeting for six days, during which time everything else that ordinarily goes on in the House and the Senate will be going on. I think it is unreasonable to expect members to suspend all other activity and simply sit here, so we will have proxies.
I've spoken to Senator Dodd. My view is, on the House side -- I think this is general -- that when we come
to voting on the final product, which we hope will be a week from Thursday, I would hope we would not use
proxies and members would be here, but we will be using proxies until then.

Secondly, at the outset of every issue we take up, I will announce which House committees have votes on that. In the Senate, I know that's not a problem, because all senators are conferees on everything, but we will have an announcement of what's -- of what's there.

We have an agenda. I just want to make one switch. We're going to start with the private funds issue. Then we will go to the OTS- OCC, then to insurance, and then to credit rating agencies. I'm hoping we can move pretty quickly. We want to have full debate.

If there is a need to, we can always move the previous question. I don't think we need to. I assume we're ready 11 o'clock until 5 or 6 o'clock tonight. That would give us an hour-and-a-half to two for these issues. Some will go quicker than others.
And with that understanding, I will now move -- as I understand it, the Senate has a vote at 11:50.

Page 214 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Yes, the gentleman from Alabama?

BACHUS: Mr. Chairman, I would like, if possible, to -- to just ask a few specific questions about the process, because I think we all...
FRANK: The gentleman's recognized.

BACHUS: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, what will be the process for determining the House position on language or provision to be offered to the Senate?
(CROSSTALK)
FRANK: Well, that's a very simple answer: a majority vote of the relevant House conferees.

BACHUS: Well, will the conferees have an opportunity -- the Republican conferees have an opportunity and assist in drafting the position before it's offered?

FRANK: Well, each party -- I'm -- well, no more than we've drafted your amendments or your recommittal motion. The normal rules of the House will apply. Provisions will come forward. They'll be open for amendment and debate. So if there are -- I will recognize members who have amendments to the House provision, and then we'll vote on it. It's the normal rules of parliamentary procedure.

BACHUS: What about -- how -- how long an opportunity will the minority have? Will we have, say, 48 hours in which to review any proposed House positions that's new language...
FRANK: No.

BACHUS: ... or draft amendments to be debated? FRANK: No. The answer is, in the first place, almost everything here has been public for some time. The House had many, many votes on this. And what we generally will be offering in the House are positions that the House had already adopted in the debate.
What we are seeing is that we will have everything available by noon the day before we meet, so it will be
23 hours.

BACHUS: When you say we -- we -- we devoted -- and debated and voted on everything, so you're saying that the House text will be the same text as the bill that -- that the House passed last...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: In most cases. There will be some -- some amendments to it. The subject matter will be the same. And everything will be available 23 hours in advance, which, frankly, seems to me to exceed the normal rules around here of people making things available.

BACHUS: Do you intend to impose time limits on the conference committee's deliberations on pacific -- specific matters or...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: I would hope not to, but if things are getting beyond what seems to us reasonable, yes. I will point out that any time limit that we impose on these debates will greatly exceed all the time that I remember being invited to speak on in conferences previously.
But, yes, we do hope to get this bill finished, so there may be time limits. BACHUS: Will...
FRANK: But I would hope there wouldn't have to be.
BACHUS: Will the time limits be announced in advance? Or will they be made on just a piecemeal basis? FRANK: On a piecemeal basis. I think it depends in part on whether there is serious issues being involved
or whether or not there's -- whether we're getting crowded.

BACHUS: Do you anticipate moving the previous question before we -- our members have had an opportunity to debate any specific provision?
FRANK: No.



Page 215 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BACHUS: All right. If there are disagreements over -- over rulings of the chair on parliamentary matters, including whether a particular amendment is within the scope of the conference, do you intend to entertain appeals of the ruling of the chair, as is in order...
FRANK: Yes. BACHUS: ... of committee markups? FRANK: Yes. We don't -- we're not required to, but yes. BACHUS: OK.
FRANK: Although I would also point out, in parliamentary rules, if things become frivolous, they are out of order. I am -- so that's the answer.
BACHUS: All right. I have two more questions.

I'll save, sort of, what I consider one of the most important that my members have been asking to the last, but in -- in a memorandum to the Democratic members of the Financial Services Committee, dated May
25th, last month, you indicated that members of the committee who are not conferees will be allowed to address the conference with a matter being discussed at the conference that's particularly important to them for a variety of reasons.

Would you please elaborate on the process you intend to follow in this regard? Will Republican committee members not serving as conferees have the same opportunity as their Democratic colleagues to address the conference?

FRANK: If the question that would I recognize Democrats and not Republicans, the answer is that's the silliest question I've been asked in a very long time. Of course, not.
BACHUS: No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

FRANK: Of course not. Members will be -- there will be no partisan discrimination. I don't think the gentleman really thought there were. If members want to -- again, this is a process we hope of reasonableness. If members feel strongly and come and even members who aren't of the committee, subject to the time constraints, yes.
BACHUS: All right. And that -- that was my question, Mr. Chairman. Members which aren't on Financial
Services will -- will members.
FRANK: Yes.

BACHUS: They will be. So OK, thank you. And I think that was particularly important to Mr. Lucas, Mr. Issa and Mr. Graves and some others.

And my last question -- and this, I think, is the -- the most asked question. Could you in a little more detail explain the amendment process that will govern the House conferees consideration of...
FRANK: I thought I already had.

BACHUS: ... how the position. Well, let -- let me ask it. And then consideration of House positions to be pre-offered to the Senate. Will there be a pre-filing requirement for amendments?
FRANK: No.
BACHUS: OK. How will conferees be recognized to offer amendment?
FRANK: Well, I'll look at them. And if I don't -- if I don't know their names, I'll ask someone to help me. BACHUS: All right, so they will be recognized. Will -- will we operate under the five-minute rule? FRANK: Yes.
BACHUS: OK. For House conferees will the ability to offer amendments only occur during the House conferees' meeting to decide the House position?
FRANK: Yes.
BACHUS: All right. Will Senate...



Page 216 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: The way the rules work each House is a separate functioning entity. And someone will move a House offer. It'll then be subject to amendment and debate. Once it done, then it's up to the Senate. So it could get -- we can't amend it while the Senate's deliberating.

BACHUS: OK. Will the Senate conferees be recognized for debate first during the House conferees' discussion?

FRANK: No. No, they're two separate debates there. The Senate -- the House will debate its position, or vice versa, whichever makes an offer debates and votes internally. And the other side responds.

BACHUS: Two questions that I -- one in my letter. But I notice today we're considering some amendments dealing with the Federal Reserve, yet that title's on Thursday. But you place those provisions in the titles today, Ms. Waters' and Mr. Meeks' provisions, for instance. What determines where that provision is placed?

FRANK: They've been adequately noticed. And we are trying to get a reasonable amount of issues debated in each day's time.

BACHUS: All right. So we will -- we -- so amendments on the Federal Reserve we could offer them either today or Thursday?

FRANK: If they're relevant to today's issues and then the ones -- the others that are relevant, the audit and other things, will be coming up at a later time.
BACHUS: All right. Well, what -- when you say...

FRANK: I'm sorry, but I'm going to give the gentleman another minute or two. We've gone over the five minutes that he has. Frankly, I didn't -- you know, some of those questions are obvious. I'll give the gentleman another 30 seconds. But the five minutes is expired.
BACHUS: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FRANK: I now move that the House make its offer to the Senate on the matters involved in private funds, Title 4. And I will recognize myself. Let me note that on our side the -- on the House side, the Financial Services Committee obviously is relevant to every one of these or has jurisdiction over every one. The Committee on Oversight and Government Review and the Committee on Agriculture also has a role and will be recognized -- will be given primacy in recognition and will be voting, those members of those committees.

The private funds title deals with language that was in the House bill. We have a little history here. In 2006, I believe, Chairman Donaldson of the SEC mandated that the hedge funds register -- he did it by what the circuit court in D.C. held was a stretch of the statute. I must say I agreed with him as to policy, but I had to agree with the court that the statute was being stretched. So that was thrown out.

The new SEC decided not to contest that, or the subsequent chairman. What this proposal does is to require hedge funds and private equity funds to register with the SEC and to report. It treats venture capital differently. Venture capital has a reporting requirement, but not a registration requirement, for many of us believe that they should be treated more lightly. And there is a cutoff of $150 million below which entities do not have to -- do not have to report.

And I believe that is the -- well, there's another issue involving states, which we worked out with the -- with the states so that there's not a gap with regard to state authority. But we did listen to the states. I remember the Texas commissioner was here asking that we preserve the right of the states to deal with this.
There's also a requirement that the SEC index for inflation the qualified client standard, which is currently
$1.5 million. And I make that offer. Is there a debate or an amendment to the offer?
The gentleman from California?

(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of Financial Services suggested, we would be interested at the earliest possible time to move. The House insists on its position on section 1109 of -- of H.R. 4173 referring to -- excuse me -- auditing of the Fed. Would be -- would it be appropriate...
FRANK: That's not in order at this point.

(UNKNOWN): OK. Just, you know, one of our problems is trying to figure out when that part is in order. Not withstanding that, I have...


Page 217 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: I'm sorry. It'll be in order tomorrow. I don't think that was a hard -- we've been very clear about that. It'd be in order tomorrow. (UNKNOWN): OK, tomorrow. OK, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The -- now on section four, I have an amendment. Fifty copies are printed. And if I can be recognized to explain it.

FRANK: All right. Do we have the amendment which -- had the amendment printed. I will say I note that the text was -- or the amendment -- the clerk does not have the amendment. I -- where's the amendment?

(UNKNOWN): This is for Title 4. One -- one thing, Mr. Chairman, and it's a question. But we've been told by leg. counsel that we will be denied formal writing, that if our amendment in this form that we can submit them in are accepted, then leg. counsel would draft them consistent with that. Is that also your understanding?
FRANK: No, I hadn't heard about that. Do you mean... (UNKNOWN): They called back to many of our conferees. FRANK: I'm trying to respond to the gentleman. (UNKNOWN): Pardon me?
FRANK: The question is should leg. counsel be asked to help you with the amendment. Is that the question?
(UNKNOWN): Well, since today they've refused to draft... FRANK: That's the question. It's just a question. (UNKNOWN): Yes.
FRANK: I have no objection. Let me -- I would hope legislative counsel would help you. I don't control whether...
(UNKNOWN): OK. Well then...

FRANK: I'm sorry, the gentleman asked a question. If he doesn't want answers, tell me that when you ask them.
(UNKNOWN): I thought I'd heard your answer, sir.

FRANK: No, you haven't, which is I had not known anything about this policy but leg. counsel. I would hope they would give members full assistance in drafting their amendments. They're not subject to our direction, but that's what we would hope.

(UNKNOWN): Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. The amendment in the form that I was able to present it is -- is intended to ensure transparency consistent with what the SEC has adopted for other uses. As the chairman knows, XBRL has been accepted by the Securities and Exchange  Commission as part of -- a standard for part of their filings. Currently that standard is -- is used for financial reporting but not complete in all reporting. This amendment would require the Securities and Exchange  Commission to adopt a data standard for financial information it collects from investment advisers, including hedge funds. In a nutshell...
WATT (?): Would the gentleman yield so we could understand what he's talking about? (UNKNOWN): Of course I'd yield.
WATT (?): I don't have an amendment. And no amendment has been offered. So I don't...

FRANK: Let me ask the gentleman a question, if I could, from the parliamentary standpoint. What we have here is a summary that lists four amendments. I assume we're dealing here only with the amendment to Title 4, which is...
(UNKNOWN): It is.
FRANK: So on the sheet it's only the amendment to Title 4 that's now relevant. (UNKNOWN): Yes, Mr. Chairman, I apologize. But when we were informed that they may... FRANK: I'm sorry, the gentleman can proceed.

Page 218 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(UNKNOWN): Thank you.
FRANK: The gentleman from (inaudible).

(UNKNOWN): Yes, I'll be just a second. We were told that they may be accepted en bloc. And I think that's the reason it was drafted that way. We -- we had no guidance of whether we'd be going section by section or all of the sections today.

FRANK: Well, I -- again, let me be very clear. I hope we can do this in a reasonable manner. I think it's been a very open process. Nobody asked me that question. I would have been glad to give the answer.

I do note that there was this concern for notice, but we got no notice of this. I would suggest that notice is a two-way street. If members had amendments ready for some hours, they could have made them available to us.

So I'm -- I'm surprised that we don't get some reciprocity in notice. But if the gentleman had asked, I would have told him.
The gentleman may proceed. (UNKNOWN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I -- I guess I'd yield to the gentleman who had a question before I finished. WATT (?): The only question I had was what -- what we were debating. I think that's been clarified.

(UNKNOWN): OK, yes. And just as my time expires, all four of the amendments, but the one we're hearing now, are designed to insist on the data standard for all data related to the relevant section and that it be in a format that would be searchable and useable in all areas reported. This has been a problem recognized and fixed fully by the FDIC and partially by the SEC. And we're intending to include these new reporting requirements to comply with what the SEC currently uses or similar for financial reporting.
WATT (?): Mr. Chairman?
FRANK: The gentleman from North Carolina?

WATT (?): May I just raise a -- make a parliamentary inquiry? Has this -- has this been offered? I mean, has the gentleman...
FRANK: I recognize the gentleman offered it as amendment.
WATT (?): OK, all right. So the clerk doesn't report it in the conference like we do in the committee, I
presume?
FRANK: No. I didn't think there was any need for that so we can move quickly. WATT (?): OK. I -- I just...
FRANK: Well, in the future we will do it that way.

WATT (?): I guess I was questioning whether this is -- is within the scope of -- of the conference. Is this a new provision, or is it some existing provision in one of the...
ISSA (?): If the gentleman would yield...
WATT (?): ... one of the Senate or the House bill. Yes.
ISSA (?): If the gentleman would yield, we believe that it -- that -- that defining agreed on reporting, at least from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee's standpoint, is within the, if you will, technical corrections in order to perfect a bill that can be executed. Guidance to the administration of this sort, although not -- not dealt with in specificity, once we say report, we believe how to report with some level of detail is consistent with it already being in the bill, but simply defining it further. And that's the reason that we believe we're in this conference.

WATT (?): Well, I obviously won't push the point, but it seems to me that that would create a scope of conference that would be miles wide and deep, perhaps as big as the oil spill.

I'm just -- maybe we ought to ask the parliamentarian to rule on what you're suggesting, because if there's nothing in the House bill or the Senate bill, I don't...
Page 219 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: Well, I would say to the gentleman, I'm going to accept this one now for reasons we can deal with. I think it's hard to -- as a (ph) general subject matter, I think it's reasonable.
WATT (?): Well, I'm not objecting to it. I just want to make sure that we understand that...

FRANK: Well, the rule will be that it has to be relevant to one of the subjects here. But I think a refinement on the subject would be in order.

The question I would raise is -- although, obviously, this could have been offered in an early stage -- and again, I will stress, it's the first time we've seen it. And I would hope reciprocity would exist in terms of sharing things, if that's the...
ISSA (?): Mr. Chairman, if I may? FRANK: I'll yield to the gentleman.
ISSA (?): We would absolutely give to you every single amendment as they occur, starting today.
To be honest, our folks shared with our conferee ranking member, and I think part of the process was... FRANK: Well, that didn't get attached (ph)...
ISSA (?): ... we didn't know where to put it until this moment (ph).

FRANK: ... so, I would -- again, the ranking member raised the question about 48 hours' notice. We got 48 seconds notice of this one. So...
BACHUS (?): Mr. Chairman? FRANK: I'll yield to the gentleman.
BACHUS (?): I would agree to a 48-hour notice on all amendments...

FRANK: I wasn't asking for 48 hours. I'm asking for reciprocity. I'm asking that we not get 48 seconds. You got 23 hours' notice.

So, the notion that could mean a 48 hours or ambush seems to me not an appropriate -- the thing, I'm just trying to talk about -- look, if we're seriously interested in cooperation so we can focus on the subject is one thing. But to insist on 48 hours, and then drop something with no notice whatsoever when you've had it for awhile, doesn't seem to me to be appropriate.
BACHUS (?): Mr. Chairman, what about 24 hours' notice?
FRANK: I'm sorry, we're not debating -- we're 23 hours. And I will say now... BACHUS (?): Twenty-three hours.
FRANK: I moved the previous question I'm debating an hour in a sense. We're not -- we only have 23 hours. We have said that material will be available at noon the day before, and we meet on the 11th (ph). So, the 23-hour requirement is already in effect and has been observed on our side, not on your side.
BACHUS (?): OK. Thank you.

FRANK: Now, as to the substance, here's my issue with this. We were asked by several of the small rentees (ph) in particular that they not be burdened, and that they were hoping they could report with the data they already have, and some of the private equity prints (ph).
So, I'm wondering whether we might -- we are going to have a final kind of clean-up amendment.

I would hope we could defer this and do a -- we have a $150 million cut-off of reporting. I think an appropriate, higher level might be available for the data standard, so that the smaller entities -- particularly private equity, not so much hedge funds -- we were hoping that they would be allowed to report data they already compiled, so they wouldn't have a further burden. That was one of the issues raised.

But I would think it would certainly be appropriate to apply this kind of requirement at a higher level, in the billions.
I would yield to the gentleman.


Page 220 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ISSA (?): Yes, chairman, I completely agree with you that we don't want to have this amendment turn into burdensome on any new filing. So, I'd love to work with your staff...

FRANK: We can defer that, because there will be kind of a clean- up amendment at the end. And, you know, not -- more than just technical records (ph).
With that, the amendment is withdrawn. We will work together to get an appropriate... ISSA (?): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
FRANK: ... (inaudible) first (ph) amendment. BACHUS (?): Mr. Chairman?
FRANK: The gentleman from Alabama.

BACHUS (?): Just on that amendment, I think we all have agreed that there should be data standards which will permit...
FRANK: We just -- we just agreed to work it out. BACHUS (?): Yes, so I compliment you for that.
FRANK: Well, thank you. That will get me through another hour or so of this.
Is there further debate? If not, the question is on the House offer. House members will -- in favor will say
"aye."
Opposed, "no."
The "ayes" have it, and the House makes that offer to the Senate. Senator?
You want to do them all at once?
(UNKNOWN): Yes, why don't you go through them, and that way we can then evaluate it (ph)... FRANK: All right. Well, at least get you a couple. So, all right -- we're still.
Then the next issue is -- (inaudible) I appreciate this. And to the question about debate, moving promptly this way will leave us more time to debate other things. And that's what I hope we can do, is that we will -- you know, the debate will -- it'll be the anti- Murphy's Law. Debate will expand according to the controversial nature of the amendment, (inaudible) if it shrinks when (inaudible) any controversy.

The next item is -- and I move the Title 3, the OTS-OCC merger. And this is something that we believed was relevant. It merges the two national bank regulators to diminish the possibility of regulatory arbitrage.

There are some differences in that we do in the House work to preserve the fifth (ph) charter to improve the fifth (ph) charter. And there are other changes made in this regard. Here are the amendments we do.
We strike the provision that exempts the comptroller from the Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act. We had some question here about the employee protections, because we're merging employees of
two agencies. We try to work with the Treasury Employees Union.

Our proposal is that we leave the House version at three years rather than two years. And we have some other employee protections and property protections.

We have provisions here that enhance, we believe, the FDIC. It allows non-interest-bearing transaction accounts above the FDIC to be done similar to the current Transaction Account Guarantee Program. It makes permanent the $250,000 insurance. It provides neutral national bank and federal mutual bank holding company charters. And it amends the text to establish the office of women and minority inclusion and require the director of the office to be a senior executive. We had originally had a provision that required that to be a presidential appointee and Senate confirmation. We did not press that one here. There were some elements of that in the base text, and this adds to it.
Is there amendment or debate on this provision? I'll then go to members on our side to discuss it. Is there a
Republican who wishes to address Title 3?
The gentleman from Alabama?
Page 221 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BACHUS (?): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I noticed the majority has added two provisions to Title 3, that the House Financial Services Committee, or I don't think the Senate Banking Committee either, has included in either of the House or the Senate-passed regulatory bill. The first time we saw it was when it was offered to us yesterday afternoon.

One is the permanent extension of the Transaction Account Guarantee, the TAG program. And then the permanent, retroactive deposit insurance increase, you increase it to $250,000 and make the increase retroactive to January 2008. Those are new proposals that are either not in the House or the Senate proposal.

FRANK: Would the gentleman yield to me? Yes. And just as I said with regard to the gentleman from California, I think the language on that to have (ph) been in the proposal, in my judgment, to be relevant. The rules are, frankly, somewhat nonexistent here. But that they should be on that subject matter.

The retroactivity came from two of our California colleagues, Ms. Harman and Mr. Dreier. It was vetted with the FDIC, who believed that there was genuine confusion about this. It's a fairly small amount of money for the FDIC, who gets $10 million to cover all the banks. The FDIC felt that was a reasonable thing to do.
And it had been filed as a separate bill. And we incorporated it.

And the transaction guarantee, that was something that had been going on. And again, the interpretation I did, and which is why I did not agree with the objection to the gentleman from California's version is, if the general subject matter is before us, I don't think -- you know, if...
BACHUS (?): I'm not... FRANK: Yes, I understand...
BACHUS (?): ... I'm not disagreeing...

FRANK: ... (inaudible). But I'd appreciate if the gentleman would give him a chance to (inaudible) that. A brand new subject shouldn't be introduced, it seems to me. But we are dealing with deposit insurance and these things that we have to be reasonable about it.

I mean, I wish -- you know, as between one and 10 you know what the parameters are. Once you get qualitative, it's harder. But I hope we can have a rule of reason here. And I thank the gentleman for yielding.

BACHUS (?): Yes, if I could, reserving the balance of my time, just point out to the members the FDIC created the TAG program in September, October of 2008, during the height of the financial crisis. And I guess it was to prevent large-scale bank runs at the time, I think would be one way to describe it. It was an emergency program.

And, of course, our banks pay a premium in exchange for -- it's really an unlimited federal guarantee for non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. We've not debated this. We can certainly debate it now.

The other thing, the permanent increases to deposit insurance caps you've got going forward. But then you've got -- you're doing it retroactively. And I guess that's -- I've seen the IndyMac. This would cover IndyMac and those large... FRANK: Would the gentleman yield to me?
BACHUS (?): Yes.

FRANK: Because I misstated. It covers IndyMac and some others. And we asked the FDIC for the whole universe. The IndyMac is about $170 million, and there were $10 million from others. And again, the FDIC conceded, in effect, to our colleagues, Ms. Harman and Mr. Dreier, that there had been confusion, and was willing to -- thought it would (inaudible) for (inaudible) one time. But that is accurate.
BACHUS (?): So, yes. Of the 270, you think $270 million or... FRANK: A hundred and eighty, I think...
BACHUS (?): ... 180, 170 is IndyMac?

FRANK: ... (inaudible). And 10 to cover everybody -- it came from people concerned about IndyMac. We didn't want to distinguish, so we did everybody similarly situated.

BACHUS (?): Yes. Mr. Chairman, I'm just not sure that we ought to, without any debate or hearings, that we ought to throw in a $180 million provision in this bill that, as you say, benefits about seven institutions.

Page 222 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I certainly wouldn't want to be accused of attacking Wall Street by my resistance to these amendments, but...
FRANK: The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Gutierrez, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial
Institutions.
GUTIERREZ: We offered these amendments as part of... FRANK: Your mike isn't on, is it?
GUTIERREZ: Hopefully it's on this time, Mr. Chairman.

We offer these amendments so that there can be some parity between large, Wall Street banks and efficiencies in competing of smaller community banks. And so, we think it's time that we move forward, especially -- I mean, $100,000 was -- I think I was a kid when it was $100,000. Things have changed since then. We want to make sure that there's efficiency and there's not runs on our banks, the FDIC.
GUTIERREZ: Plus, let me make clear to everyone if we do not change from $100,000 to guarantees of
$250,000, we're going to have to find $8 billion somewhere in -- in order to satisfy PAYGO. So I -- I think as
we keep talking about the people, the people, the people and paying taxes, taxes, taxes, I think this is a
moment at which we can give the people what they need -- that is, increased security up to $250,000,
make sure there aren't runs on our banks later on, and at the same time $8 billion is not small change here,
ladies and gentlemen. And that's what the savings, according to CBO, is going to be.

So -- and the TAG program -- they've asked for that program, the FDIC, so that they can continue. And so the gentleman suggests that he doesn't want to be accused of beating up Wall Street. Well, if you attack this amendment, you're not beating up Wall Street. You're actually hurting community banks and the efficiencies of those community banks and their assessments vis-a-vis the FDIC.

So we make these amendments so that community bankers, those small bankers that my ranking member, Mr. Hensarling, speaks about so fondly and frequently at our hearings, can be properly addressed and -- and acted upon. So these are things that have been brought forward by the FDIC. We think they are good. There are five of them in total as part of our -- of our proposal here this morning.
(UNKNOWN): Would the gentleman yield? GUTIERREZ: Absolutely.
(UNKNOWN): Now, what we're talking about is the retroactive provisions. And it's my understanding that that would only benefit six or seven institutions, and primarily IndyMac and their depositors.
FRANK: Yes, if the gentleman would yield to me... (UNKNOWN): I -- I...
FRANK: If the gentleman would yield to me, the gentleman was talking about the TAG program. Those are two separate provisions. The TAG program is not retroactive one. The IndyMac one is.
Is there further debate on the... GARRETT: Mr. Chairman?

FRANK: The gentleman from New Jersey? GARRETT: Is it permissible at this time to submit a -- an amendment to this amendment to strike?
FRANK: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
GARRETT: OK. Then I have an amendment, I guess, after that (inaudible). FRANK: I'm sorry. I can't hear the gentleman. I thought it was clear. GARRETT: OK.
FRANK: It's offered for debate, which includes amendments. GARRETT: Right. So I have an...
FRANK: Do you have an amendment? GARRETT: I have an amendment.
FRANK: All right. Would he present it to the clerk? Is it presented to the clerk?
Page 223 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GARRETT: It's done.
FRANK: Does the clerk have the amendment? CLERK: Yes.
FRANK: Do we have a clerk? CLERK: Yes.
FRANK: What? All right.

CLERK: Amendment to the House offer relating to Title 3 of Mr. Garrett of New Jersey. Page and line numbers refer to House offer to Title 3. Strike Section 335, page 8, line 3 of House offer...

FRANK: I ask unanimous consent the amendment be considered as read. As I understand the amendment, it would be strike that two sections that the gentleman from Alabama referred to. Is that correct?
GARRETT: Yes, sir.
FRANK: All right. Scott, for some reason your mike's not working well. Pull it closer to you. GARRETT: How's that?
FRANK: All right. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for five minutes on his amendment.

GARRETT: I thank the chair. And the ranking member has already laid out some of the predicate to this as, you know, the question as to -- I know the chairman talked about it -- why these two provisions were added and were never considered by the House and Senate committees.

And in light of that, it really does seem more appropriate that -- that we hold committee hearings to discuss these matters before we, A, permanently extend a program that was, quite frankly, never designed to prevent possible bank runs during short-term unprecedented market disruptions and secondly, to retroactively and permanently increase the deposit insurance level.

Let's look at the two sections they have, Section 6 dealing with the TAG program. As we indicated already, created back in October of '08, that was at the very beginning and hype of the financial crisis, and it was done why? Well, to prevent large-scale bank runs back then. Under the program participating banks paid a premium in exchange for an unlimited -- and I think that's important -- unlimited federal guarantee for these non-interest bearing accounts.

Now, we know that bank runs can undermine even a healthy institution. And many believe that it was important to provide a reasonable question during those days so that healthy institutions could weather those storms.

But, you know, the rationale for short-term safety net and a permanent guarantee really are quite different things. Extreme measures might have been appropriate during the crisis, but they really do not serve the -- the country well during normal times.

Why is that? Blanket federal guarantees undermine depositor discipline. If a depositor knows that his funds will be fully guaranteed, then a depositor might not exercise the same due diligence of monitoring the financial institution. Depositors' due diligence constrains the risk that a bank takes, and without it banks might take greater risks. And taxpayers will not foot a bigger bill when they fail.

The issue of trying to get invested due diligence is something that Chairman Kanjorski was involved with when we were in Europe in discussions all the time how to re-establish market discipline. I remember when we were in Europe, it was constantly. Well, we want to do it not only there, but we want to have market discipline back here in the United States again as well.

And while the financial system has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has begun to wind down its emergency facilities, it really does not make sense to extend the TAG program forever. What we need is to get the government out of the economy, out of these blanket guarantees, and let the economy stand on its own two feet again.

And conversely, if we continue with the scratches going forward, we will only delay the resurgence of a vibrant free market here in America and delay the opportunity for the American public to know that Congress is not perpetuating this bailout mentality.



Page 224 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The second provision, very quickly, is the Section 7, which is a $250,000 increase in the cap but, most importantly, makes that retroactive to January 2008, which has already been indicated really is a situation saying that we are bailing out those folks who fell into the situation prior to the government stepping in to deal with it and without the premiums being paid for the higher risk.

It sort reminds me of the days back in this committee, come to think of it, when we were talking about -- are some people were talking about -- establishing an insurance -- are retroactive insurance policy for wind damage down south. They said, "Why couldn't we just allow people to buy their insurance after the fact, after Katrina hit, and then we're going to cover them retroactively?"

Well, no one would ever do that for an insurance policy so you pay the premium after you have the accident, and that's basically what we're saying here as well. No one should say that the American taxpayer should guarantee or insure these people after the loss has already occurred.

Now, I know the chairman, I think, said here and just now -- I'll close on this -- cited a figure that I think he also said in a article that was in the paper the other day that this would only cost about $10 million, and I know that doesn't sound a lot -- like a lot in light of all the numbers we're talking about, but I know that we have checked with the FDIC, and they have estimated the cost to be more in the 184 or the $200 million range.

Whatever the number, whether it's 10 million, 100 million, 184 million or $200 million, it is wrong to have a retroactive provision like this in the legislation, retroactivity paying the uninsured deposits for a handful -- basically, these are higher income individuals. These are wealthy depositors. What it does, it sets a bad precedent. It also increases moral hazard and undermines that discipline that I talked about before, that discipline that is necessary for a well-functioning deposit insurance program, one that provides for the system.

This retroactive reward puts a new spin on the too big to fail problem. In this case it's no longer too big to fail. In this case we should add some are too rich to lose. This committee will be saying that there are some people in this country and certain parts of this country who are just too rich to lose and that we are going to come now with this provision and bail them out.

Put simply, this is another bailout. This is a time of politically favored wealthy individuals that this bill will protect. Finally, extra...
FRANK: The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Illinois?
GUTIERREZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

You know, I had hoped to make some amendment, especially starting out, that wouldn't anger or have people make phone calls. I thought this would be one of them. I guess I was sorely mistaken. First of all, to suggest that this committee hasn't dealt with this issue -- that is, the House side hasn't dealt -- just isn't
true. The fact is that Congressman Kanjorski and I offered an amendment. We had bipartisan support of that amendment, and it passed overwhelmingly in the subcommittee -- to educate $2000. That's just a fact. The gentleman from New Jersey should check the record and be better informed.
So to suggest here that somehow we haven't dealt with it is just patently untrue and unfactual. GARRETT: Would the gentleman yield?
GUTIERREZ: No. I don't have time. I only have five minutes. GARRETT: Was that retroactive provision in that legislation?
GUTIERREZ: And it -- you know, I know that the gentleman from New Jersey hasn't been here a long time, and I know you're eager to get in as much as you can as quickly as you can, but there are members that have been here that do follow the decorum, and you should do the same.

I don't know what the rules of conduct are New Jersey. I can tell you what they are in Illinois. We respect other people's time and their prerogative to speak. I respected the gentleman. I didn't interrupt him. I hope that you will set that -- we can continue that standard as we go through this conference.

FRANK: I just want to announce, and the parliamentarian reminds me, this is solely within the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee, so only members of the Financial Services Committee, the two from the House, will be voting.
Is there further debate on the amendment offered by the....
Page 225 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The gentleman from Texas?
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I wanted to rise and support the gentleman's amendment from New Jersey for a couple of reasons. And I -- I don't believe are need to take five minutes, Mr. Chairman.

But, one, we all know that the deposit insurance fund has been challenged, at least as I read this material. It's unclear to me exactly where the funding would come from for the particular, this retroactive amendment. If there was any type of CBO score, I'm not aware of it. I was trying to listen to the debate. I didn't hear one presented, so we ultimately don't really know what the cost of this provision would be.

We know that the FDIC, frankly, has had to be somewhat creative in dealing with the deposit insurance fund. I believe there -- have had depository institutions now put in, I think, three years of assessments in advance. So here we have a fund that is challenged, not unlike just about every other government insurance fund we know, and here we're going to add yet one more financial burden.

As we know, unfortunately, there will in all probability be more bank failures, and the DIF will be called upon. The deposit insurance fund will be called upon yet again. And as they are struggling to maintain it at the appropriate capitalized level, I just think it's incredibly unwise for us to put extra burdens there.

The second point I would make on the TAG is, again, programs that were meant for a moment, an emergency calling for financial stability, does not necessarily equate in the programs that we ought to enact in perpetuity.

(UNKNOWN): We still have a recession. Everybody knows that we still have one of the highest unemployment rates in a quarter of a century. But the financial stability component that was so vivid in September of '08, that moment has passed. And, again, if we haven't -- I would agree that a specific, separate hearing on these provisions would be called for.

And then I guess I'm just somewhat curious, Mr. Chairman, going forward, because I heard you say I believe that we will be following the parliamentary procedure and rules of the House, but I -- just for a point of clarification, I'm just curious about how, if these provisions were not either in the Senate-based bill or the House-based bill, what is the scope by which the chairman is using, what basis that this...
(CROSSTALK)
FRANK: If the gentleman will yield, I will say it again. (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: I apologize if I was mumbling, because I've said it twice, and it was the ruling I gave when the gentleman from California's amendment was challenged. If the general subject matter is in the -- in the bill, then I believe we should entertain amendments based on it. That's the -- that's the general approach.

There are not strict rules for conferences, but that's the essential policy that -- if it is something that -- if the subject matter is addressed, deposit insurance being mainly a major piece of this, then I will entertain other amendments, as I did in the earlier cases.
(UNKNOWN): I appreciate the chairman for his clarification. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. FRANK: All right.
The gentleman from Kansas?
MOORE: Mr. Chairman, I yield five minutes to Mr. Gutierrez. GUTIERREZ: I thank the gentleman. I won't take up all five minutes.
I'd like to address my friend and colleague, Mr. Hensarling, just to suggest the following to him, and that is that, if we do not take this step to increase it from $100,000 to $250,000, the CBO will score it at $8 billion. We're going to have to find that money somewhere. So, really, it is a savings to the taxpayer. They will not be out that $8 billion, number one.

Number two, as we know, one of the reasons that there is some certainty in our financial system -- especially in our banking system -- is that sign that says, "FDIC-insured." We need to increase it from
$100,000 to $250,000. We've already increased it. The committee has unanimously -- our -- our bipartisan
-- not unanimously, I'm sorry. We have in a bipartisan manner adopted that. Kanjorski and I made that
amendment. So we've already, I think, reached that.

Page 226 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now, think about it just one moment.
HENSARLING: Would the gentleman yield?

GUTIERREZ: And I will yield (inaudible) think about it just one moment, Mr. Hensarling. How do you offer -- I mean, now they're offering CDs at 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent. If you want to get 3 percent, it's got to be -- how do you offer them -- if I'm going to give you $250,000 today, and I'm opening up a CD for five years, but in two years, it's $100,000, and I'm -- what am I, supposed to go back to the bank and say, "Oh, I want to withdraw it"? Now there's going to be penalties and interest.
So this is just to give some certainty to the marketplace today. I'll yield to the gentleman.

HENSARLING: I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I just wanted to clarify something I thought he said. Did the gentleman say that, by permanently increasing the depository limit to $250,000, that the taxpayer would save $8 billion? Did I understand that...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: If the gentleman from Kansas would yield to me, that's the CBO score. CBO says that, if you do the $250,000 permanently, that you get an $8 billion credit.
HENSARLING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hadn't seen that one.

GUTIERREZ: And that -- I would just like to -- I'd like to just -- so -- so, look, when we talk about, you know, the government being there, this really is our common citizen in our -- that goes to their local bank. That's what we're protecting with the FDIC.

So let's not confuse, you know, the Congress of the United States being for the rich and the wealthy. This might be all they got, you know? And they want to put it in a safe place where they know the full faith and confidence of the government is there, number one.

And let me just say: The TAG account, it really only benefits small banks and businesses. It attacks the very concept of too big to fail by eliminating the incentive for small businesses to only have their payroll accounts in too-big-to-fail institutions. It allows them to take those non-interest-bearing accounts and put them -- and thereby make it more competitive between small banks and larger financial institutions, which I know Mr. Hensarling cares deeply about, because we've shared so many hearings together as -- as we've moved forward.
Thank you so much. I -- I will yield to the gentlelady from New York. FRANK: No, it's the gentleman from Kansas' time.
GUTIERREZ: I'm sorry. The gentleman from Kansas' time. MOORE: And I yield to the gentlelady from New York. MALONEY: I speak in support of my colleague, Mr. Gutierrez.
And it's also very good for business. During the financial crisis -- and we're still in economic recovery -- people were in many, many different banks trying to run a business. They wanted to keep their money in banks that were FDIC-insured and individuals running businesses.

And so you would have -- I heard from constituents who said, I can't even run my business because I'm in three or four different banks trying to have a certain amount insured. Raising it to $250,000 will help them manage their finances better. It's good for the overall economy. We're still in recovery. It's important.
FRANK: Is there further debate on the amendment? The gentlewoman from West Virginia?
CAPITO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to yield my time to the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett. GARRETT: Yes, the gentleman from Illinois makes some good arguments with regard to the -- the basic
aspect of whether it should be $250,000 -- and the gentlelady from New York, as well -- whether it should
be $250,000 or not, although one of the statistics I saw was that the average deposit for the average
individual out there with these is $14,000.

And if that's true, then what we're saying going from $100,000 up to $250,000, you're really not dealing with the average person anymore. You're dealing with the wealth individual.



Page 227 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And if you're talking about the person who has to manage his portfolio, because to have $250,000 here and
$250,000 here and $250,000 here, well, pretty soon that's getting up to not just an average American
anymore. That's the more affluent level.

I know we never define what the rich is adequately in this country, but I guess when you have to start managing your portfolio, maybe that actually falls into the rich category. So that goes to that point. To the -- to the point that the gentleman from Texas was raising, I don't know that we got a satisfactory answer as to how this is going to be paid for. The gentleman from Texas? No.

The current system going forward, I understand, and the current system that we had -- when we implemented in 2008 was, we're going to raise the level, right, and it's -- for the banks that do that, they will pay a higher premium going forward.  Fine.

But now you're basically establishing a retroactive insurance policy for those people who lost before we created this, so we're going to have to get the money again.

FRANK: Would the gentleman suspend briefly? Just we want to note, senators are not being rude. They have votes. So the Senate -- yes, let me just yield to the (OFF-MIKE)

DODD: Just briefly. We have votes -- we have three votes, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to suggest if we might do this, because if you would (OFF-MIKE) I'm sorry. What I'd like to suggest is that, if you'd continue debating your offer to us...
FRANK: Yes.

DODD: ... and go through as many titles as you can, with the three votes, we wouldn't be through until about 12:00. We have -- we have a caucus and conference lunches that go until a little before 2 o'clock. I'd like to suggest we come back here at 2:00. At that time, we'll respond to your -- to your offer.

FRANK: Let me say, if it's acceptable, we'll keep going. If we -- we may be able to finish, and then we'll come back to listen to the...
DODD: That would be helpful.
FRANK: ... to the response. But I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from New Jersey...
(CROSSTALK)

DODD: And I'll try to come back myself. I don't need to go to the caucus. I'm interested in hearing the debate (inaudible)
FRANK: The gentleman from New Jersey will resume.

GARRETT: And just to make the senators aware, I am free for lunch, so if you -- if you -- if you would like me to come on over, go into more detail on any of these, we're...

DODD: I'm -- I'm the wrong senator to ask to buy you lunch, I can tell you that. FRANK: I had thought that the conservative view was there were no free lunches, but let's -- the gentleman -- please start the clock. The gentleman's recognized.

GARRETT: Well, I just have a concluding thought. It's -- it's to the -- it's to the cost aspect of this. We don't know what the number is between $10 million and $200 million. I'll split the difference and say...
(CROSSTALK)
FRANK: Would the gentleman yield? GARRETT: Sure.
FRANK: I misspoke when I said $10 million. I'm sorry the gentleman didn't hear me. I corrected myself. We're told it's about $180 million.
GARRETT: OK, so $180 million...
FRANK: I had -- I corrected myself (inaudible)

GARRETT: I appreciate that correction. And then, again, maybe I missed it, so I yield to the chairman. Where would that $180 million come from?
Page 228 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: The bill will have an overall cost, and it will be paid for -- there will be -- well, part of it is the $8 billion that we get from the -- increasing the deposit insurance. There's $8 billion that comes if we raise the FDIC deposit ratio, we are told by CBO, and then we will have some other fees that we believe might appropriately apply to large financial institutions. That's not yet -- that's going to be proposed.

GARRETT: OK. Reclaiming my time, I obviously cannot speak to what those proposed fees would be and what the impact of those fees would be, so...

FRANK: Well, but $16 billion will come from actions that we were otherwise planning to take already in the bill.
GARRETT: OK. OK.
ISSA: Would the gentlelady from West Virginia yield when he's done? GARRETT: I'll yield (inaudible)
CAPITO: ... remaining time to the gentleman from California.

ISSA: Since people were wondering who was rich in America, I thought it might be appropriate to -- to weigh in a little bit here. Just one second. I believe that the debate we're having is about retroactivity and about unpaid-for increases. And hopefully everybody at this table understands that somebody who was a small-businessman, that the $100,000, when you're looking at a float of a grocery store -- a minute grocery store has a float of many hundreds of thousands of dollars, very possibly, just in check transfers and so on. Very small businesses in America, the smaller the profit, the bigger the sales have to be before you can -- you can even make any money -- very small businesses have been impacted by this extremely small limit.

And during the crisis, one of the few things that occurred was the idea that your float money, money, interbank money, would be fully covered, period, and that we would deal with this $100,000 had been too long not increased.

Now, like many people, I have concerns about retroactively paying anything, but I hope we all understand that for small business -- and I speak as a small-businessman now and before -- we really were remiss in not doing more much sooner to take care of the funds in the transaction, which can be millions of dollars for relatively small businesses.
And I yield back to the gentlelady.
FRANK: I recognize myself for five minutes. (UNKNOWN): Well, I think...
FRANK: I appreciate what the gentleman said. I'm sorry. The gentlewoman had 28 seconds left.
(UNKNOWN): And on those 28 seconds, I would say, I think these individuals have convinced me on the
$250,000 raise permanently aspect on that. And so if it were permissible, I would say -- I would be willing to
strike that provision from the amendment, but retain the TAG and the retroactivity provision.
FRANK: The gentleman asks unanimous consent to drop the part of the amendment that opposes the
$250,000, but leave it as opposing the Harman-Dreier INDY Act plus and the TAG program. Is there
objection? The chair hears none.
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, sir. FRANK: That's the amendment (ph).
I now recognize myself to speak on the amendment as amended, particularly with regard to the TAG
program, because I think it is also relevant. I appreciate what the gentleman from California said.

FRANK: The TAG program is -- well, first of all, when it comes to who's going to pay for this, there will be some FDIC increases, but we have an amendment in this bill that I hope will be accepted with the collaboration of the FDIC to instruct them to go to a risk- weighted assessment, which will mean the larger financial institutions will pay more and the community banks will pay less. I think we have general agreement on this because the assessment is now straight dollar on deposits. And so -- and we ask that that be done in a revenue-neutral way so, in fact, the community banks will not be bearing this -- this burden, but the large high-fliers will.




Page 229 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Secondly, as to the TAG program, the large banks have complained about it, frankly, because they stay out of it because they don't need it. And it's the smaller banks that benefit from the TAG program. This is a way
-- the TAG program and the 250 permanent are very similar.

The -- the retroactivity is a different one. I -- I acknowledge that. But these both try to overcome psychological disadvantages that the smaller banks face in maintaining accounts. And so, that's the rationale for that.

Is there further debate on the amendment which now strikes the TAG program retroactivity? All in favor will say "aye" of the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey.
Opposed, "no."
The noes have it. And the amendment is not agreed to.

The gentleman asked for a recorded vote? All right, we will call the roll. The clerk will call the roll of Financial Services Committee members only, even though I wish we had Issa on this one. He's voting in principle, but I'm being very fair. I'm not going to count him. The clerk will call the roll.
CLERK: Chairman Frank?
FRANK: What -- the gentleman from Michigan?
PETERS: Mr. Chairman, just for a clarification on the -- the amendment.
FRANK: The amendment would strike out the Harman-Dreier (ph) IndyMac plus and the extension of the
TAG program. Yes, TAG is -- the TAG is in there. The clerk will call the roll.

The clerk will report.
CLERK: Mr. Chairman, on that vote there are 10 ayes and six noes. FRANK: The clerk will report again.
CLERK: I'm sorry. Mr. Chairman, on that vote there are 10 nays and six ayes. FRANK: The amendment is defeated on a recount. And the...
(UNKNOWN): Is there something about first answers (inaudible)? FRANK: Is there further amendments?
The gentleman from California?
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, I'll be brief. It -- without...
FRANK: We'll report the -- report the amendment. Do you have an amendment?
Page 231 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(UNKNOWN): Well, actually it was on the earlier four-part that you received. And I just wanted to clarify that on that amendment, which would require the comptroller of the currency to do a similar function, that we'll agree on that and hopefully all four that were on that sheet, that we'll work together so that I won't be bringing them.
FRANK: The same four, exactly. And it will be not the national bank supervisory (inaudible). (UNKNOWN): OK. Then I won't be offering any of those again. We'll work together on all four.
FRANK: OK, but we will -- yes. We've agreed that -- when we talk about data standards, that we will have a cutoff because it is our, I think, agreement that smaller institutions should be covered, but they should only have to send the data they already have so they don't get into extra data preparation costs.
Is there further amendments to this offer? The gentlewoman from Illinois?
BIGGERT: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. FRANK: The clerk will report the amendment.
CLERK: I do not have the amendment. FRANK: What's that?
The gentlewoman has an amendment that is not at the desk, is now at the desk.

CLERK: Amendment -- amendment to House offer financial regulatory reform to Title 3 offered by Mrs. Biggert of Illinois.

FRANK: I ask unanimous consent that the amendment would be considered as read. And again, noting that because leg. counsel wasn't available, it is a conceptual amendment which if adopted would be put into legislative form.

And with that, the gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized. She might want to take -- let me -- let me give the gentlewoman an additional 45 seconds so she can explain the amendment and then get into the debate. Give the gentlewoman five minutes and 45 seconds. And I would ask you to begin with an explanation and then into our debate.

BIGGERT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The -- this amendment would replace the current House offer, which merely folds one agency, the OTS, into another, the OCT. Instead, this amendment makes a more comprehensive overhaul creating a single independent agency and financial institutions regulator, FIR.

An FIR would be the sole federal regulator responsible for bank supervision, holding company regulation and consumer protection. And the FIR would have two divisions, one for the functional regulation of
federally-chartered banks and thrifts and another to fulfill the backup regulatory authority for state-chartered banks and thrifts. This would ensure that a dual banking system remains strong.

The -- the amendment would also ensure that the thrift charter remains an option to keep our safety net strong. The FDIC would maintain control of the Deposit Insurance Fund as well as the backup to the regulatory authority.

To prevent bifurcation of safety and soundness and consumer protection the amendment would create within the FIR a powerful office of consumer protection to promulgate regulations that would apply equally across the board to both federal and non-federally-related banks, thrifts and non-financial institutions. The board of directors would have final approval over any rule making. And the office of consumer protection would make extensive use of consumer testing to ensure that rule making and consumer disclosures are designed to protect the consumer.

And as members of this committee consider this amendment, I would urge you all to think back what we originally thought to accomplish with our regulatory reform effort. Was it to fix the fundamental flaws in our system or simply add new layers of bureaucracy while carefully avoiding stepping on the toes of entrenched interests in Washington?

A combination of unchecked greed, regulatory ineffectiveness and political complacency allowed our financial system to stretch the bounds of responsibility and accountability beyond the breaking point. For decades Congress let regulators play catch-up while bureaucratic turf wars and insider politics determined which agencies would win or lose jurisdiction of resources to respond to Wall Street's latest evolutions.

Page 232 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And as a result, there was an economic catastrophe that cost millions and millions of Americans their homes, their jobs and their savings. And now we've got two paths before us. Down one we can finally push back against the entrenched interests by creating a single streamlined, effective regulatory body with the powers and resources to keep up with Wall Street while avoiding duplicative and costly blunders of uncoordinated regulation. Or we can merely fold one agency, the OTS, into another, the OTC, and then
add a new bureaucracy and declare victory. So I would urge my colleagues to remember who we're fighting for and make the tough decisions and support this amendment. It would consolidate and streamline the functions of the four federal bank regulators by merging them together into one strong federal regulator to supervise banks. Not a new concept, and it's a proposal that's been supported by both Republicans and Democrats.

In July of last year, Republicans introduced this proposal as part of H.R. 3310. And in November, Senator Dodd and eight other Democrat senators included this as part of their comprehensive financial reform discussion draft. Upon introduction of the Senate proposal, Senator Dodd issued the following statement.

"Our proposal would replace the myriad of government agencies that failed to reign in risky schemes with a single accountable federal bank regulator. We will do this while preserving the dual banking system. For firms that play by the rules, the single prudential regulator will provide clarity, cut red tape and make it
easier to compete."

And I couldn't agree more. Our banking regulatory structure doesn't work. We currently have an alphabet soup of federal bank regulators: the Fed, the OCC, the OTS and the FDIC. All four dropped the ball when it came to safety and soundness and consumer protection regulations.

Sadly, the current Senate-based test and the House position under consideration only consolidate two of the four banking regulators. And in addition, the base text in the House position coupled with other titles expand the power of these failed regulators and create an entirely new bureaucracy. So we're -- so we're back to four.

One lesson we learned is that bigger, uncoordinated government does not work in terms of protecting consumers and regulating financial institutions. Instead, it only creates more cracks, confusion and cost for consumers.

Bifurcated and uncoordinated regulation lend to a -- a lack of effective rule making and enforcement. For example, the Federal Reserve had the authority to update regulations on mortgages and credit cards but failed to do so. And, of course, who could ignore -- who could ignore Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Yesterday Bloomberg reported that these government-sponsored entities could cost taxpayers as much as
$1 trillion.

Finally, our current system, the system proposed in the Senate- based text and the system in the underlying House offer, would continue to allow banks to shop for the weakest regulator. If Congress promotes the too many cooks in the kitchen model, again, we will continue to foster turf wars among Washington bureaucrats instead of establishing a 21st century sensible, coherent system. We can't continue with the structure that completely failed the American people.

As stated in the summary of Senator Dodd's original reform proposal last November, "For over 60 years administrations to both parties, members of Congress across the political spectrum..."
May I have additional 30 seconds?

FRANK: We -- the gentlewoman have an additional 30 seconds? She had additional 45? The gentlewoman has an additional 30 seconds.
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman? FRANK: Yes.
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, do we -- do we have a copy of this amendment? I do not see a copy of this amendment.
FRANK: Were there copies given out? (UNKNOWN): I do not have a copy.
FRANK: Well, would the clerk please distribute copies. We hope -- and we have talked -- and the ranking member has promised us that we'll get some of these -- in the future we'll get them earlier. But it is yes. (UNKNOWN): And, Mr. Chairman, just to clarify. Mr. Peterson's remarks -- Mr. Peters' remarks, from Michigan -- this was -- this is the unified regulator legislation that we introduced.

Page 233 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: All right. That goes beyond -- we will get it distributed.
The gentlewoman is recognized for an additional 20 seconds. BIGGERT: All right.
I -- I would just close with saying that as stated in the summary of Senator Dodd's original reform proposal that, quote, "For over 60 years administrations of both parties, members of Congress across the political spectrum, commissions and scholars have proposed streamlining this irrational system."

And again, I would agree with Senator Dodd. However, this can only be achieved through tough actions and strong political willpower. Less costly and twice as effective, our amendment ends the status quo and takes the bold steps necessary to enact effective and historic regulatory reform.
I... (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: I recognize myself for five minutes in opposition.

First, what this does -- and I think this was one of the reasons that Senator Dodd reconsidered -- yes, at the national level, there's an argument for consolidation, but we have the dual banking system. And while the gentlewoman says she preserves it, it is the opinion of many state-chartered banks and the state bank commissioners that it does not.

We had a great deal of disagreement that many of us heard from our state-chartered banks and our state banking commissioners about this consolidation. They do not want to be thrown into the same national bank regulator as a nationally chartered bank. Even if you'd say they're a separate division, it would still do that, and that is a major reason for objecting.

Frankly, I think that the FDIC has proven itself to be an effective regulator, and it's been important not just to have a monolithic regulatory voice here. This would abolish the regulatory role of the FDIC. I think that would be a mistake. And it would, as I said, throw the state-chartered banks into the same national bank regulator that they have resisted joining.

It also clearly is meant to strike the consumer protection independent agency. It goes to what I think is the failed experience of making consumer protection part of the role of the bank regulators, and they have not shown, I believe, a very good record in this regard. Now, it does not abolish the consumer agency which will come up next week, but it would -- clearly, if this were adopted, be inconsistent with that, and it would be a harbinger of -- of doing away with it. And I think it is a mistake for that reason, as well.

I, as I said, believe that the independent FDIC has worked well. The FDIC is an insurer and should have the regulatory responsibility commensurate with it. We will have two regulators now. We will have a national bank regulator and a state bank regulator.

I believe consolidating beyond that is not consistent with the respect a dual bank system ought to have, and it is not something I believe that the -- that the states want to see. And I also think it is wrong to do away with an independent consumer agency.

Finally, I do appreciate the amendment being offered, because it gives me a chance to elaborate on the answer I gave to the gentleman from Texas and New Jersey about scope. As the gentleman indicated, this is not in either bill. It was offered but defeated in the House; it's not in the Senate bill. But it's clearly on that subject matter, and that's the guideline that I'm trying to follow, so this is another example.

I think if we were to try to hold strictly to what was in the text of one bill or another, by definition it would mean you couldn't approve anything. And the assumption that between us we achieved perfection, while tempting, is probably more than I want to -- I want to claim. And so this is an example, again, of the kind of scope that we are dealing with.
Is there further debate on the amendment? The gentleman from Alabama.
BACHUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chairman, in July of 2009, we introduced this same language. This amendment tracks that language. And I still feel today that this is really the only comprehensive financial reform bill or provision introduced as far as ending the mishmash of -- of regulators that we have.

Page 234 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It consolidates the bank supervisory responsibilities of the OTS, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve into an agency called a financial institutions regulator.

And this actually -- if you go back to President Obama, one of the change he promised the American people, one that I think he wishes -- they wish he would keep this promise, unlike some others, was we need to streamline a framework of overlapping and competing regulatory agencies. Reshuffling bureaucracy should not be an end in itself. The large complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape do not fit into categories created decades ago. Different institutions compete in multi-markets.
Our regulatory system should not pretend otherwise. A streamlined system will provide better oversight and less costly -- and be less costly for regulated institutions. He said that in 2008.

On May 28, 2009, you said it has been reported that the Treasury Department would like to consolidate the prudential regulators, as we've done in this amendment, but still has to work out the details. You then went on to say, it would be a good one if you were starting from scratch, but he said -- you said it's not worth the political cost that it would inevitably entail.

Senator Dodd, September 2009, proposed a similar legislation. He said the most common argument against consolidation is not that it's a bad idea. Rather, consolidation is too politically difficult to achieve.

That argument doesn't work terribly well with me and with the American people, who are wanting real reform, not just shuffling the deck. We must eliminate the overlaps, redundancies, and additional red tape created by the current alphabet soup of regulators.

I don't think it was any more clear than -- than in AIG, the failed supervision of AIG, in which you had an overmatched regulator who could not supervise but one part of AIG, ending up supervising what proves to be a casino house within the world's largest insurance company, all because AIG could pick and choose the regulator least competent to understand the risk it was taking.
We've all acknowledged that they didn't have the power to do that, but we change nothing here.

Senator Dodd said, I still believe in a -- this was September 24, 2009, less than a year ago -- I still believe in a strong single regulator. I still think that it makes the most for transparency, accountability, and for stopping the charter shopping that has caused so much of the problems we have encountered during the economic crisis.

I think Eugene Ludwig, who was a former comptroller of the currency, who actually said it best. The current alphabet soup of financial services regulators and enforcers is almost unintelligible to the public. It encourages regulatory arbitrage. It has led to less rigorous consumer standards than is desired and has trouble attracting a sufficient number of talented people to supervise larger and more complex financial companies, instruments, and markets.

If we are really to address systemically significant corporations, you all have done it with the bailout fund. We do it with a consolidated regulator. This is real reform. I think we all agree, no one would set out to create the irrational regulatory structure we have today with a balkanized regulatory structure that's really a result of accident and bureaucratic turf wars.

The financial crisis we've just suffered requires us to rethink our approach to regulation and reject a structure that completely fail the American people.

In conclusion, this race to the bottom that we've all seen is encouraged by a structure which regulates entities and allows them to shop for most lenient treatments. We can end it with this amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. FRANK: Is there further debate?
The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized. And would you yield to me? KANJORSKI: (OFF-MIKE)
FRANK: I want to respond to one inaccurate statement of my friend when he said we haven't changed anything, referring to AIG. We abolish the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Office of Thrift Supervision was the weak link in this chain. They were the ones to which Countrywide fled. They were the one that AIG got itself involved in, and we abolish it. So it's simply wrong to say that we don't make a change.

And the major regulatory arbitrage was between the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. And we not only abolish the Office of Thrift Supervision as a separate entity, merge it with the comptroller of the currency so we have one national bank regulator, we amend the thrift charter, because the thrift charter -- and some want to abolish it altogether in reaction to the abuses of it by
Page 235 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
AIG -- but many of the community banks and many of the people who were involved in lending for residences in a responsible way -- said, please, don't do that.

So what the bill does that came out of the House -- and I believe the Senate agrees -- is, we amend the thrift charter. So the two levels -- what AIG did can't be done. One, there will be no more Office of Thrift Supervision. That was the entity that was overwhelmed in Mr. Ludwig's comments.
Secondly, there will not be a thrift charter which can be a fig leaf. So we very directly address that.

Then the question is this: We have two, under the bill that's before us and the proposal that the House is making -- there are two bank regulators, one for the state-chartered banks, and one for the national chartered banks. That's the issue, not whether we have confusion or multiplication, but whether given the uniqueness of the American dual banking system, which other countries do not have, given the strength of state banks and the state bank commissioners, do you protect the autonomy of the states and the state bank commissioners or do you not?
The proposal to put them all into one national regulator excites the concerns of the Conference of State
Bank Supervisors, and it also causes difficulty with many of the state-chartered banks.

So we ought to be clear. If you think that the state-chartered banks ought to be in with the national banks under one national bank regulator without the FDIC, which has paid more attention to them, then that's the issue. But the argument that we are doing nothing to remedy the AIG situation is clearly factually wrong. We have abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision as a separate entity. We've abolished OCC, but there will not be a separate thrift supervisor, and we have severely amended the thrift charter to prevent that.
Is there further discussion on the amendment? The gentleman from Texas?
HENSARLING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I want to focus in on one aspect of the gentlelady from Illinois' amendment, and that one -- that aspect is the prevention of the bifurcation between the function, the consumer function that ultimately could ban, ration, modify credit products, and safety and soundness.

And I'm glad it came up at this opportunity in the debate. I know that the CFPA provision will be debated later. And as I think the chairman said, if this amendment were to pass, it would be inconsistent with the CFPA.

But I think it's a very important part of this bill to debate, because we know that in many respects, the mother of all bailouts, the government-sponsored enterprises, occurred because of a bifurcation between the safety and soundness provision and, in many respects, the affordable housing mission of those institutions.

HENSARLING: And now we know that has cost taxpayers $147 billion and counting. And I think, as the gentlelady from Illinois acknowledged, that at least by some estimates, before all is said and done, taxpayers may be out $1 trillion, according to a Reuters report, if I understood the gentlelady earlier. I had not seen the report myself.

I know that the former head of the FHFA, Fannie and Freddie's regulator, said, and I quote, "A separation of such responsibilities among GSE regulators helped cause their downfall. You can't really separate that. Some of the problems we have today may have been the result of excessive requirements on affordable housing goals with better coordination. Maybe that would not have happened."

That comes from James Lockhart, the former head of FHFA, talking about, again, the danger of separating safety and soundness from the alternative function. In the GSE case, it was the housing function. In this case, it is a consumer function.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said, quote, "We believe that prudential supervision and consumer compliance are complementary and should not be separated."

FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, quote, "Separating consumer protection examination and supervision from other supervisory efforts could weaken both and result in weakened financial institutions."

Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, "Rules that can seemingly benefit consumers, while at the same time they diminish safety and soundness by, for example, lowering down payments or liberalizing repayment terms."


Page 236 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Office of Thrift Supervision Acting Director John Bowman, "Dividing the regulation of safety and soundness in consumer protection would undermine the safety and soundness of the banking system and weaken regulators' ability to formulate a complete assessment of a financial institution's risk profile."

Now, I thought the entire reason that we were here in many respects were to say to the American people, "Never again." How do we prevent a similar real estate bubble bursting, a financial crisis? And a lot of it -- I believe the evidence shows -- was driven from a bifurcation of a safety and soundness function.

We should do everything we can to ensure that we don't repeat that mistake in the past. And although I reserve the right to always disagree with the prudential regulators of our financial institutions, I at least take note when there appears to be unanimity of opinion that this would be a very dangerous policy undertaking.

And so I would hope that, on this provision alone, that this -- that the House members of this conference would seriously consider supporting the gentlelady from Illinois and ensuring, again, as we look at the mistake made with Fannie and Freddie and $147 billion of taxpayer money later, if we really want to say no more bailouts, then taxpayer protection, safety and soundness should trump any other consideration that has caused this bifurcation.
With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

FRANK: Let me make an announcement now, because the parliamentarian has advised me -- and I apologize if this is an inconvenience to any members -- but given the nature of the gentlewoman's amendment, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform votes on this, because it does have aspects of organizations.

So I apologize if they're missing -- but I -- originally the way the title was, it was just financial services, but members of OGR are able to vote. If that makes a difference, we will sort of -- I don't know if there are members of their staffs here, maybe, who can send out word for them that -- and I -- I do have some proxies. I don't know if you have them, but if the gentleman doesn't have proxies from OGR, I won't vote the ones I have. We want to keep it fair.
Is there further debate on this amendment? The gentlewoman from West Virginia?
CAPITO: Mr. Chairman, first of all, I'd like to say I am in great support of the gentlewoman's amendment. We're looking for the strongest regulatory reconstruction, I think, that we can put together here. And I believe a central regulator makes -- and a single regulator makes a lot of sense. And I'd like to yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Illinois.
BIGGERT: Thank you. I appreciate that.

And I appreciate the gentleman from Texas with his talking about the consumer protection. I think that is such an important item.

I did want to just make a couple comments. Chairman Frank, you said that the FDIC is doing a great job. I think Sheila Bair has held up very well, but I do have to disagree and -- and I think the FDIC inspector general has also disagreed -- in the material loss reviews on failed banks. And you can look online to find these, the reviews that were issued by the FDIC inspector general said otherwise.
FRANK: Would the gentlewoman from West Virginia yield? BIGGERT: Yes.
FRANK: If I understand the amendment, that aspect wouldn't be changed by this. It would be the regulatory powers, but their role as insurer and (inaudible) wouldn't be changed. So what you're referring to wouldn't
be changed by -- by your amendment.

BIGGERT: Well, maybe we're talking about -- reclaiming the time -- but he did clearly state that the FDIC has failed to do their job. And you're right. Under this amendment, the FDIC would maintain control of the deposit insurance fund, as well as existing backup regulatory authority over insured institutions.

But beyond that, there is an FIR board of directors (ph), and that includes the FIR (ph) chairman, the FDIC chairman, the director of the Office of Consumer Protection, the federal banking division director, and the state banking division director. And that board would have final approval over rulemaking, and I think that...
(UNKNOWN): Would the gentlelady yield for a question? BIGGERT: Yes.
Page 237 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: It's the gentlewoman from West Virginia's time.
CAPITO: Yes, I'll yield.

(UNKNOWN): I'm -- I'm just wondering, since we don't have the language of the amendment, just a summary, what impact this would have on the Consumer Financial Protection Agency? Because it's just absolutely unclear what impact that would have.

I mean, the last line of the summary says, "Office of Consumer Protection would make extensive use of consumer testing to ensure that rulemakings and consumer disclosures are designed to protect the consumer." I -- I presume this new agency would have some authority...
BIGGERT: May I reclaim my time from the gentlewoman from...

(UNKNOWN): I just don't have -- I don't know what the implications of this would be without seeing the language of the amendment...
CAPITO: I'd like to reclaim my time for this... (UNKNOWN): ... what the implications would be... FRANK: The gentlewoman reclaims her time and yields to the gentlewoman from Illinois.
The gentlewoman from Illinois an additional 30 seconds.

BIGGERT: Thank you. For one thing, is that the reg comptroller (ph) would not draft our amendments, and that's why you have this summary. Second of all, we could not address that title at this time, and so that would have to come up when -- when the title that consumer protection agency is in.
FRANK: Would the gentlewoman from West Virginia yield to me?

CAPITO: Yes. FRANK: And -- but the further answer is that this would be totally inconsistent with independent consumer agency, as it's intended to be, as was acknowledged. I thank the gentlewoman.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) gentlelady to yield... FRANK: The time's expired.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania?

KANJORSKI: Mr. Chairman, if I may take the opportunity to talk on the lady's amendment, first of all, I want to congratulate her for offering the amendment. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it probably is significantly too late to have the consideration it should have.

And it represents the very reason why we have made the effort over the last year to try and engage the minority to act in a bipartisan way with the majority to have a more thorough structured bill.

I myself was favorably disposed to a single regulator more than two years, before the crisis. As a matter of fact (inaudible) did ultimately make a trip to  Europe to discuss the success particularly in the U.K. of Lord Turner's position as a single regulator.
BIGGERT: Would the gentleman yield for just one moment? We did offer this in -- in 2009. KANJORSKI: In 2009.
BIGGERT: Yes.
KANJORSKI: But that was after the crisis and not during the process that we are attempting to get
bipartisan activity. What -- what I'm suggesting is that I'm complimenting the lady for offering it now. I intend
to vote against it because I think it's untimely and can't be properly structured.

But if we could engage the minority to be more constructive in a bipartisan way, we probably would have a bill that meets our needs structurally much better than the one we're going to pass today. But we can't -- we can't go back to bygone days. What we have to do is move on with what we've had.

All I could suggest is that I hope the minority will take into consideration that they in the future will act in a bipartisan way particularly in this bill and other bills that will be coming up before the committee to see that we can get efforts from both sides of the aisle to resolve the problems that we have.
FRANK: Is there further debate on the amendment?
Page 238 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BIGGERT: Will the gentleman yield? Sorry. FRANK: The gentleman from New Jersey -- gentleman from New Jersey? We are going to try and move this along. If we bog down too much in back and forth, everybody gets a chance to speak, and we're going to move on.
The gentleman from New Jersey?

GARRETT: And I'm going to yield to the ranking member in just a second, but to -- to answer the question, is this or is this not inconsistent with the CFPA? The chairman said it correctly: It is inconsistent with the CFPA. And for that reason, we would essentially eliminate the CFPA. You would not need that if you are going to have consumer protection directed in the manner that is most appropriate, most efficient, and does not differentiate -- not separate prudential regulation from it. And that's what this does.

And, secondly, just to my good friend from Pennsylvania, I concur with him completely as far as trying to move forward with bipartisan legislation, and that is why we actually had this in -- in language in a proposal
-- which I remember the date -- in July, but even actually in bullet points, former, prior to that, prior to the administration's actual proposal that he handed out at the White House. So we -- we've had this out there for some period of time and would look forward to their consideration.
With that, I yield to -- my remaining time to the ranking member. BACHUS: I thank the gentleman.
The amendment -- there's been some confusion. The amendment creates a separate division for state banks within the consolidated regulatory structure. It does nothing to undermine the dual banking system.

Instead, it improves oversight. We have (inaudible) to improve and reform bank regulation and do it in a significant way. That's what this amendment does. This is about making our financial system more safe and more sound.

It shouldn't be about tending to private or special interests. That's way the biggest banks oppose this. They're quite comfortable with the regulations that they see in this bill. They're quite comfortable with what they've had in the past. It's the American people that are demanding reform.

Every expert that's looked at this has said you need to go to a consolidated regulator. We preserve all the various charters and the dual banking system.

BACHUS: There always has been and always will be a federal oversight role for our state banks. The federal government has an oversight role in our federal banks. That's why -- and the FDIC has that. The Fed has that today. This puts that within one body. This is real reform and an important change. There's no reason to have to banks -- four banks on -- on one corner, on all corners of an intersection, one of them regulated by the OCC, one of them regulated by a -- the FDIC or the Federal Reserve. They ought to all be subject to the same rules, the same expertise.

And, as Sheila Bair said many times, consumer protection and safety and soundness are -- are two different sides of the same coin. You separate them, you run into trouble. And that's why we put this office of consumer protection, a council within this unified regulator.

If you're going to enforce consumer protection rules, you're going to have to have safety and soundness regulators, people in the banks to do that. This amendment -- and -- I do know that several of the members have struggled to find out more about this amendment or -- or what we're proposing -- this is 3310. Look in H.R. 3310, which was the first comprehensive financial reform bill introduced into this Congress to reform this alphabet soup. And it was offered by Republicans in July of 2009.

This amendment is that legislation we introduced in 2009. And it would be a major step forward. The American people are looking for real change that, you know, Obama -- President Obama -- excuse me -- promised that. He won't deliver it with this bill, but we would take a significant step with this amendment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CLERK: Mr. Chairman, on that vote there are seven ayes and 12 nays. FRANK: And the amendment is defeated.
I'm informed we have two more amendments on this title dealing with the diversity. I just tell that to members who -- and others who have some interest. Insurance will be next.
And I now recognize the gentleman from California to offer an amendment. ROYCE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk FRANK: The clerk will report the amendment.
CLERK: Royce number one.
ROYCE: Thank -- thank you, Mr. Chairman.

FRANK: I ask unanimous consent. Well, it's -- it's easier to read it. It says strike lines 19 through 20. And the gentleman from California style recognized for five minutes.
ROYCE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

This is only 12 words here, but I think the amendment's pretty straightforward. It would strike the requirement that each director within -- within each federal regulator develop standards for assessing the diversity policies and practices of entities regulated by the agencies -- in other words every bank or community bank or -- or credit union.

If the recent crisis proved anything, it was that regulators failed to adequately understand the risks growing in the financial sector. What concerns me about the way this is written is the way in which it's going to have regulators take their eye off the ball.

A lot of what happened in -- in my view was Congress' fault. It was Congress that put the affordable housing mandates on the GSEs, which resulted in the overwhelming majority of the losses of the GSEs. And again, in my view it -- it was Congress that encouraged lending standards to be eased for those down payments to go down from 20 percent to 10 to 5 to eventually zero.
Page 241 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So in effect it was Congress rather than the credit worthiness of the borrower were that dictated who got a mortgage. And that was all done under the flawed assumption that every American should own a home whether they could afford it or not.
In the underlying provision, regulators will again shift their focus away from systemic risks, away from
safety and soundness questions of the community banks, other credit unions that they're going to regulate,
and this time it will be toward racial and gender lending when inspecting the institutions that they oversee.

So in my view this will end up further politicizing credit allocation, and we need to refocus financial regulators on safety and soundness. Moving away from that will move us closer to replicating some of the very problems that led to where we are today. And I would just like to make a couple of points out of an editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, politicizing the Fed, in which the Journal says, "Don't the Feds already dictate racial and gender hiring?" Yes, they do through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and assorted other federal laws. This provision is at best redundant. But I'm not changing those words in this provision. What I'm going at is at the next section of the provision.

But the House is hunting bigger game -- the political allocation of credit, says the Journal. They want to put a network of operatives at the highest level of government, who are responsible for making sure that regulators put the hiring of and lending to minorities at the top of their priority list. The House provision makes that very clear by making each diversity officer a presidential appointee who must be confirmed by the Senate.
The post, says the -- the post here that this bill points out will be comparable to that of other senior level... FRANK: Will the gentleman yield?
ROYCE: I -- I will yield, if I can have some additional time.

FRANK: Certainly. That provision is no longer before us. The presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, as I said earlier, has been dropped. The gentleman will have an additional 30 seconds.
ROYCE: Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.

So that -- that provision is out, but what remains still, going back to the -- of the 12 words that I have in my amendment, goes to the other point that is made in the Journal. This creature of Congress and the White House will also be charged with increasing the participation of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the -- in the programs and contracts of each agency in conducting an assessment as stated inclusion goals.

As the Journal points out, they say mull over that for one minute. Having recently lived through a financial mania and panic caused in part by political pressure for affordable housing, Congress will now order regulators to allocate credit by race and gender. Isn't the point of this financial reform supposed to be to make regulators better judges of systemic risks, which means focusing on financial safety and soundness?

If the provision passes, federal regulators will have to put racial and gender lending at the top of their watch list when they do their checks on the banks and hedge funds they're regulating. This is especially
pernicious at the Fed regional banks, which have long operated independently of political intrusion.

The provision will also give Congress and the White House a new and powerful lever of influence to influence the operation of the 12 regional Fed banks. Accusations of racial or gender indifference, much less outright bias, are politically deadly. With the threat of such an accusation in their holster, the czars will have enormous clout to influence Fed governance and regulatory decisions, perhaps including monetary policy.

Fed regional presidents are often the main proponents of tight monetary policy. The presence of a diversity czar is one way Congress and the White House can intimidate these regional presidents to go along with the policies they favor. No Fed bank president will want to take the risk of being hauled before Congress to answer a report that the banks under his jurisdiction aren't racially or gender sensitive enough in their lending.

And the Journal, you know, sums it up with this argument. This law will make it harder for regulators to do what ought to be their main job, which is making sure that they don't again let a credit mania run out of control. That's why offer the amendment.
FRANK: The gentleman from California? WATERS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.


Page 242 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Of course, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from California's amendment. And I'm surprised that he is taking his direction from an article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal yesterday. The article is so misdirected with so many non-facts and so much misinformation until it's embarrassing.

And just as you corrected the gentleman about there not being a presidential appointment in the legislation, I could go on and correct him about most of this article. But let me just say he referred to the second page
of the Wall Street Journal article by saying -- quoting, "Mull over that for one minute. Having recently lived through a financial mania and panic caused in part by political pressure for affordable housing, Congress will now order regulators to allocate credit by race and gender."

Nowhere in this amendment do we talk about credit. And I'm surprised that the gentleman does not know that.
ROYCE: Well, if the gentlelady would yield, you might not oppose my amendment, then. WATERS: No, I will not yield.
I can understand the gentleman being misinformed about these directors being presidential appointments, because perhaps he did not have an opportunity to read the final version of the bill. But I can't understand the gentleman quoting this from the Wall Street Journal when in fact we do not refer to credit at any point in time.

WATERS: Then he goes on to read, "Isn't the point of this financial reform supposed to be to make regulators better judges of systemic risks, which means focusing on financial safety and soundness? If the Waters provision passes, federal regulators will have to put racial and gender lending at the top of their watch list." Nowhere in this amendment does it refer to any federal lending and talk about them setting priorities for having to make lending at the top of their list. And it goes on and on and on.

He further talks about the Waters provision will also give Congress and the White House a new, powerful lever to influence the operation -- influence the operation -- of the 12 regional Fed banks. Accusations of racial or gender indifference, much less outright bias, are politically deadly.

Well, let me just say this. The reason that we have this amendment, and simply what you're referring to is just an assessment. It doesn't say it will do anything more than assess. It does not mandate. It does not force. It does no more than assess.

Why is this important? If you take a look at what has happened over the last 13 years -- this is a report by the Government Accountability Office -- we find that between 1993 to 2006, the level of minority participation in the financial services profession only increased marginally, from 11 percent in 1993 to 15.5 percent in 2004. Participation rates among African Americans rose slightly, from 5.6 percent to just 6.6 percent. That's in 13 years, Mr. Royce. Asian participation rates rose from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent, and the participation rates of Hispanics only rose from 2.8 percent to 4 percent.

Only 12.4 percent of management level positions at holdings and trusts are held by minorities. The securities industry is the least diverse of all financial services industries, with minority men and minority women making up simply 8.7 percent and 6.4 percent of management positions in this sector.

I could go on and on and on, but time does not permit. Let me just conclude by saying, assessment is not mandate. It is not forcing. It is only assessing and setting standards.
And so, the gentleman is misdirected in his comments. And I'm sorry that he took this misinformed Wall
Street article that beared (ph) no facts to use as the basis for his objections to part of my amendment.
FRANK: Is there further debate? The gentlewoman from Illinois?
BIGGERT: Mr. Chairman, I would yield my time to the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce. ROYCE: I thank the gentlelady for yielding. First let me point out that we got the change on Senate
confirmation language 10 minutes ago. So, that is why I wasn't up-to-speed with the fact that this had been
taken out of the bill. But that is when my office got this change, 10 minutes ago.

But all of that aside, let me get down to the point at hand. I am not taking issue with the fact that your legislation is going to establish an office of minority and women inclusion. I am not taking issue with the requirements on racial and gender hiring.

My concern here goes only to the question of lending. And the thrust of the rest of the language in here makes it very clear that you're going to have these entities regulated by this agency -- they're going to be the banks, the community banks, the credit unions -- and they're going to be under these practices where those entities are going to come under the legislation in the sense that the regulator is now going to lean in
Page 243 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
on these kinds of goals. When does a goal become a mandate? Well, you know, the goals for the GSEs were 50 percent subprime and Alt-A lending. Right? And what was the consequence of that? Well, their portfolios, oddly enough, were 50 percent subprime. And that was done for the purpose of affordable housing. Those portfolios ended up being 50 percent subprime and Alt-A.
When does a goal become a mandate? I don't know. As we leaned in on these institutions to get rid of the
20 percent down under this assumption that, you know, we were better off if every American, regardless of
creditworthiness, regardless of whether or not they had a down payment or could afford it or not, were
going to own a home. We watched as that was ratcheted down to 5 percent, to 3 percent to zero.

So, from my standpoint, since I have carefully, carefully only taken those 12 words to take out of your overall legislation, that one particular subject that I'm most concerned about, and that is the fact that these regulators end up being trumped on safety and soundness. Just as in the case of the GSEs, we had the question of regulation for safety and soundness trumped in a way by the goals, by the HUD- enforced goals there. I'm just trying to ensure that that doesn't happen.

And it seems to me that, if you agree with me in terms of this not being an attempt to dictate lending on this basis, then you would support this amendment or work with me in order to specifically address that very provision. I think these 12 words do it.
FRANK: I recognize myself for five minutes.

First, I want to address this question about not knowing until 10 minutes ago. That's wrong. Well, I don't know when people knew things. But people could have known, if they were seriously concerned about this, yesterday at noon, because the requirement for Senate confirmation is not in the base text. We will be -- yesterday, the amendment that we would be offering to this -- and it did not include the Senate
confirmation. So, the fact is, it was clear as of our new release yesterday that Senate confirmation was not in the base text and wasn't being pushed, so that was clear.

Secondly, I am struck by the Wall Street Journal reference. But before I get to it, the gentleman from California always has a somewhat incomplete history of Fannie and Freddie. He keeps forgetting the present. He said Congress ordered these things.

In 2004, the president of the United States, George Bush, ordered Fannie and Freddie -- it wasn't a goal -- he ordered them to substantially increase the percentage of loans they gave, bought up for people of low and medium income. I objected. I thought that was a mistake.

So, it wasn't just Congress that did it. George Bush -- and by the way, we have this in the history that the gentleman from Texas prepared. Bill Clinton had done it. George Bush had done it. So, it wasn't just Congress. Presidents did that. I agree that this notion of homeownership was mistakenly done. For me, affordable housing meant rental housing. But I specifically criticized President Bush's decision in 2004 to increase that.

And in fact, in 2007, when we became the majority, we passed a bill that would have outlawed the loans in the first place, and there wouldn't have been any bad loans for Fannie and Freddie to buy. And it passed the House. It was (inaudible) -- the Senate chairman was for it -- by Republican opposition in the Senate.

And the Wall Street Journal, (inaudible) memory, denounced us when we passed the bill to restrict those kind of loans, by saying we had created a Sarbanes-Oxley -- the worst words in their lexicon -- for housing. And many of the members here voted against it.
So, we, in 2004, objected to the Bush administration's increase. That's where I changed my position from
2003 on Fannie and Freddie. And we tried to restrict their imposition of excessive roles.

But I also want to get back to the Wall Street Journal. Even by their standards this is loony. What it says, the gentleman read it. According to them, this is a plot to keep interest rates low. What they say is that we are doing this so that we can falsely accuse the regional bank presidents of racism, and therefore, lest they be pilloried by our accusations, they will reduce interest rates. Note what it says right in here.

They make it very clear where their interest is. Fed regional presidents are often the main proponents of tight monetary policy.

By the way, for those on the conservative side who thought that independence of the Fed was a bad thing, the Wall Street Journal has now issued a new New Testament about the independence of the Fed. This is the editorial the gentleman was quoting about.




Page 244 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This is especially pernicious at the Fed regional banks, which have long operated independently of political intrusion -- or democracy, depending on what you talk about. Federal bank presidents aren't appointed by the president precisely to avoid Treasury and White House control.

And the Waters provision will give the -- here's the crux of this lunacy -- the Waters provision will also give Congress and the White House a new and powerful lever to influence the operation of the 12 regional banks. Accusations of racial and gender indifference are politically deadly. With the threat of such accusation in their holster, the Waters czars will have enormous clout to influence Fed governance and regulatory decisions, including monetary policy -- perhaps including monetary policy. Fed regional presidents are the main proponents of tight monetary policy.

Well, first of all, people probably don't know the gentleman from California or our colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, the notion that they don't really care about gender diversity, but are secretly plotting to blackmail the Fed into keeping interest rates lower, it shouldn't be the subject of discussion. I would say it shouldn't be the subject of serious discussion. But it's not a serious discussion. It's a fairy tale of the worst kind.

So, get back to the merits, finally. There's no mandate here. Nobody would have the power under this amendment to do what George Bush did in 2004, and order Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase the percentage of subprime loans that they bought. And, in fact, of course, we tried to ban those loans altogether.

So, on its merits, being concerned about a lack of diversity in the financial institutions it seems to me a very good idea. And again, I urge people to read this Wall Street Journal editorial. It is a paean to the need for the federal regional banks to operate totally independently, despite the fact that they are given, under our rules, more governmental power probably than they should have.
Is there further debate?
The gentlewoman from West Virginia? CAPITO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to say before yielding time to the gentleman from California, that I think these are sensitive issues. Certainly, gender and race diversity in government and in private industry is something that we need to find good, solid documentation and try to figure out for members of the minority or members of another gender, ways to broaden the employment base or the opportunity for both segments of the population.

So, you know, I think that the question of the gentleman's amendment from California is more about doing this the right way and making sure that we're generating the right kind of data with what kind of follow-up procedures. And I think that is the intent of his amendment.
But I would yield time to him to further explain.

ROYCE: Yes, and let me just explain that, over the years, as we discussed trying to deleverage the government-sponsored enterprises and we had many, many debates on this, the argument I made throughout was that, in the issue of safety and soundness, the regulators and especially the Fed felt that they needed to be able to deleverage.

The reason the Fed would not support the bill that -- that you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, was because it did not allow the Fed to deleverage for systemic risk.
FRANK: If he yields, I'll give him extra time. (UNKNOWN): I -- I will yield, but I think that's factual.
FRANK: I didn't mention that bill. That's -- you're talking about the 2005 bill -- the bill I mentioned was the
2007 bill on subprime lending, though it wasn't a Fannie and Freddie bill. I just -- I may have been unclear.
(UNKNOWN): OK. OK.

FRANK: I was talking about the bill that we passed in later 2007 to deal with subprime lending. You're referring to the Oxley bill that came out of the House in 2005.

(UNKNOWN): And -- and, Chairman, all of this goes right to the point that I'm making. For political reasons, we did want the regulator to be able to do what they needed to do for safety and soundness. Why?
Because there was this good intention of doing something which was in the interest of subsidized housing.


Page 245 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And now again we find ourselves with language which is -- which will direct those regulators and give them a focus other than safety and soundness. And expecting the same results not to happen again would surprise me mightily.

Even when the -- when the regulators came up here with concerns -- and I'll quote Representative Maxine Waters from September 2003 -- Secretary Martinez, you said, if it ain't broke, why do you want to fix it? Have the GSEs ever missed their housing goals?

That wasn't the point. They were making their housing goals. The point was that we were headed towards systemic risk.
And former President Bill Clinton put it very well in the fall of 2008. He said, I think the responsibility that the
Democrats have may rest more in resisting any efforts by Republicans in the Congress or by me when I
was president to put some standards and tighten up a little on Fannie and Freddie Mac.

Now, Mr. Chairman, there may be people on both sides of the aisle that didn't want to do that. I'm just saying that we have to learn from history. I've been discussing this for 15 years. I've talked to everybody in the Fed that I can talk to about this and in Fannie and Freddie after the collapse, and they -- and most of them feel -- or all of them, I think -- like I do, that it is a mistake for us to politicize these institutions or to not have them directed fundamentally at the issue of safety and soundness.
And all I'm trying to do with this amendment is get back to that first principle.

FRANK: I recognize the gentleman from Kansas, and I'd him to yield me 10 seconds just to clarify that the Fed shared the gentleman's view with regard to Fannie and Freddie (inaudible) not on this one. When he said these institutions, let's be very clear. The Fed does not endorse the amendment. The Fed, in fact, is supportive of the language in the bill.
The gentleman from Kansas?
(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) yield, are you sure that's true?

FRANK: In fact, if the gentleman -- I'll give the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. In fact, the Wall Street Journal complains about that. The gentleman forgot to read, perhaps, the part about the Wall Street Journal...
(UNKNOWN): Are they silent on it or are they, in fact, supportive?
FRANK: I would be glad to read it. The political sway is clear. The Fed as an institution is bowing to the
Waters provision. So I believe we've heard no objection to the Fed.
The infinitely power Czar Waters... (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: ... in addition to manipulating interest rates, has cowed the Fed. The gentleman from Kansas, I -- have an additional 30 seconds. (UNKNOWN): I think I rest my point.
MOORE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I oppose the amendment. I want to express my support for the creation of offices of minority and women inclusion for financial regulatory agencies.

Despite what the Wall Street Journal may say, it's clear to me that having the New York Fed president appointed by the president of the United States would do more to put the Fed's independence at risk than simply encouraging that women and minorities have a fair opportunity to become the next New York Fed president.

I want to thank my colleague, Representative Maxine Waters, for asking me to do a joint subcommittee hearing we held recently to examine how women and minorities are affected by financial reform. We learned at that hearing that women- and minority-owned businesses were adversely impacted by the aftermath of the financial panic we saw in 2008 and the recession we continue to struggle through.

And based on that hearing, we need to make sure that diversity is considered and fully incorporated into the final bill the president will sign into law.


Page 246 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I yield back the remainder of my time to Representative Waters.
WATERS: Thank you very much.

I thank the gentleman for yielding. I'm simply surprised that the gentleman from California, who's stuck on the GSEs, would attempt somehow to interject the argument that he uses on everything into this very, very simplistic amendment.

This portion of my amendment that simply talks about assessing, again, it does not mandate. It does not force. It simply talks about assessing the diversity policies and practices of entities regulated by the agency. If, in fact, you heard these statistics and the data that I shared with you about the lack of improvement of diversity in these agencies over the past 13 years, you would understand that just assessing how they're doing things or not doing things could be helpful to them in correcting these -- the lack of diversity.

I know that the gentleman, again, continues to be concerned about what he thinks, where the policies of this government as it related to the GSEs, but that's a stretch. There is no way you could talk about forced lending with my assessment amendment. It does not work.

The article is so wrong that it's embarrassing. And I would commend you to that article again, read it so that you can see the inconsistencies, you can see the errors in it, so that you won't continue to believe that somehow this is going to force lending to minorities and women, rather than simply try and level the playing field, not only in government, but in all of the financial services industry, to make sure that we respect and recognize that this is a diverse society and that women and minorities deserve an opportunity to participate.
I will yield back the balance of my time. FRANK: Further debate?
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman... (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: The gentleman from Alabama. WATERS: ... to the gentlelady from New York. MALONEY: Thank you.
FRANK: The gentlewoman has 54 seconds remaining. MALONEY: OK. Well, I'll claim my own five minutes then. FRANK: The gentleman from Alabama?
BACHUS: Thank you.

Mr. Chairman, what -- what I understand we're debating right now is strike lines 19 and 20, which requires that each regulatory agency -- and I suppose that's all the bank regulators, the credit union regulators -- that they assess the diversity policies of each regulated entity under its jurisdiction.

So my question -- Czar Waters, would -- would this amendment -- it would apply to each and every financial institution, including credit unions? Is that correct?
WATERS: The ones that are listed in the bill that come under the Fed would be on page, what... BACHUS: Just the Fed? Or would it include the...
WATERS: If you will -- if you will take a look at page 390, the term "agency" means the Department of the Treasury, the corporations (ph), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, each of the Federal Reserve banks, and the board, and the National Credit Union Administration.

BACHUS: OK, all right. So it -- so it involves all -- let me tell you some of the problems I've got with this. As you said, I think, it could impact virtually -- it will impact virtually every regulated institution. I don't know of any that won't be impacted.

If the recent crisis has proved anything, it was that the regulators failed adequately to understand the risk growing in the financial sector and took their eye off the ball. And instead of focusing on systemic risk, safety and soundness, our regulators were forced to shift their focus towards other things.

Page 247 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And whether that's racial or gender lending or whatever, when inspecting the institutions they oversee, when they're talking about safety and soundness, it ought to be on underwriting standards. And the -- in your provision, the regulators, I'm afraid, are going to shift their attention, focus away from systemic risk and safety and soundness, and this time is going to be spent looking at racial and gender lending when inspecting the institutions they oversee.

And I think that further politicizes credit allocation. I think the Wall Street Journal was right. I think Congressman Royce is right. And, you know, we've got to get back to focusing the financial regulators on safety and soundness.

And moving away from -- from that will -- will move us closer to -- I mean, to -- if we move away from that, we're going to replicate some of the very problems that got us here in the first place and led us to this thing we've witnessed over the past two years.
You know, the regional -- we talk about the regional Fed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Act under the
Civil Rights Act is charged with these responsibilities. The -- the -- the Federal Reserve banks, I think all
the regulators, already report the metrics on diversity through the EEOC, and the EEOC is charged today
with -- with addressing these things.

You'll have -- you're going to have these new -- I think properly called diversity czars in each regulator, including the National Credit Union Administration, and they're asked with ensuring equal employment opportunities not only at their agencies, but also responsible for seeing that the allocation of credit is on the basis of race and sex and the institutions they oversee. I mean, I'm looking at your language.
WATERS: Will the gentleman yield? BACHUS: Yes, I will yield.
WATERS: Where are you reading anything about the allocation of credit is based on race or gender? BACHUS: Quote, increasing the participation of minority-owned women -- and women-owned businesses in the program and contracts of the institution. I guess that means the banks and the credit unions.

WATERS: No, that's not the question I'm asking you. Where does it mandate that there be given -- that they are forced to give credit to anybody?
BACHUS: Yes, increasing the participation. Isn't that -- isn't that mandating? They're supposed to go in and
-- and they're charged with increasing the participation of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in
the program and contract, not only of each agency, but also of each regulated institution, and conducting
an assessment...
WATERS: Conducting...

BACHUS: ... of stated -- it says inclusion goals. You're -- you're establishing goals. If they fail to meet those goals, what happens? I'd ask you.
WATERS: Nothing. BACHUS: Nothing?
WATERS: That's why this is such a weak amendment. BACHUS: So you're going through all of this for nothing? (CROSSTALK)
BACHUS: Is that what I'm hearing from the lady? WATERS: If I may...
FRANK: The gentleman's time has expired. The gentlewoman from New York, and then the gentlewoman from...
MALONEY: Thank you.

The -- the office would in no way interfere with policy, safety and soundness, or systemic risk. It's not going to be dictating to Ben Bernanke decisions.

The goal of this office is a goal that I believe most Americans share, is that you open the door to minorities and women who are terribly underrepresented, particularly in these financial agencies.

Page 248 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And if you look at the numbers from the GAO report, the number of women participating in financial sector hasn't changed for 13 years. For minorities, it's much lower.

So we're not talking about this office having any role in policy. The purpose of this office is to open the door of opportunity to people who've been locked out, particularly -- take the example of contracts. In the federal government, we have a central contracting office. During this period of the financial crisis, contracts were
let from the agencies immediately, and this office would say I'm going to advertise and let minorities and women know that the opportunities are there.

It doesn't have a quota. It doesn't dictate. It's trying to open the door to let women and minorities have a voice or an opportunity to bid in over the $400 billion we have in federal contracts and the billions of dollars that are in the financial services sector now and may be in the future.

I think that this is a goal that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support, too. It's a civil rights goal. The office would be looking at things like mentoring opportunities, supporting getting information out
through various networks, so that women and minorities that are -- there's no question about it, that they're terribly underrepresented throughout government and many areas, but particularly in financial areas.

It -- it is not in any way participating or dictating or influencing any -- any policy decisions that will be made on the merits. And safety and soundness is the prime goal, and that is what everyone will be working on.

But as decisions are made that women and minorities can bid on a contract, that in hiring decisions qualified women and minorities can be considered and will be considered, and that diversity and opportunity, which is a goal of this country, will also be a goal in the Federal Reserve and in the Treasury and all these other departments that are listed in the -- in the bill.

So that -- that is the purpose of this, and it has absolutely no impact on policy or practices. There are no quotas. There are no requirements. It's just allowing people to have the opportunity to apply to work and even having an office that's sensitive to having the applications advertised in the African-American newspapers, in the Hispanic newspapers, in the women's newspapers, so they're aware of the opportunities so they can apply and try to get through the door and participate.

And I would argue, if more women and minorities were sitting at the table when some of these decisions were made, that they would have been better decisions made. They bring a perspective of inclusion and -- and I think that they -- I think most Americans think that they should have an opportunity.
And I congratulate my colleague for her hard work on it. And I yield to my colleague, Mr. Gutierrez.
GUTIERREZ: Yes, I thank the gentlelady.

I think -- look, the operating word here is opportunity. There are no goals. There are no mandates. It's an opportunity, an opportunity for all of us in America to participate. And, please, don't take this opportunity and then bring in Fannie and Freddie Mac. I mean, it doesn't have -- nothing has anything to do with the other.

I know what the intent is, to say, oh, you know, those -- those Latinos and the black people, they went and got all those loans and caused this crisis in this country, and now we're going to give them jobs, and you can imagine the peril that they'll bring America to.

Well, let me suggest to you, I'm very, very comfortable -- and I think, if anything, if you look from Barney Frank over to this way, and you see the women and the Latinos and the African-Americans and the contributions that we all make, we feel comfortable.

So it's part of our -- of who we are. We feel very comfortable living in this kind of family that we all live in, and it's the same kind of family we want to see reflected. That's all, I think, that the gentlelady wants to accomplish.
FRANK: Is there further debate?
The gentleman from Texas? We go from one side to the other. The gentleman from Texas? HENSARLING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To the best of my knowledge, for almost as long as I've been alive, it has been illegal in America to discriminate on the basis of race and gender in employment decisions. And so I'm somewhat curious, if that is true -- and I believe it to be true -- exactly what the gentlelady is trying to achieve with her underlying amendment.
Page 249 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I also believe, if it is simply a reporting requirement, I'm certainly under the impression that the Federal
Reserve -- and I believe -- and I would yield to the gentlelady if I'm wrong, because, yes, in this almost
2,000-page bill that was given to us right before last week and I haven't read every page -- but I'm under
the impression that our financial regulators, certainly including the Federal Reserve banks, have to report
metrics on the composition of their hiring race and gender through provisions of the Equal Employment
Opportunity  Commission.

So in some respects, if that's true, it would seem that her underlying language is somewhat redundant. If it's not redundant, perhaps it is achieving something else, or maybe she is unhappy with the way that the Obama administration is enforcing the civil rights laws, may be unhappy with how they are enforcing the equal opportunity act and all the various provisions. Perhaps the Obama administration is not competent to administer these laws. That's perhaps a different debate.

As I read the language -- and I fully admit, in the roughly 2,000-page bill, my intention is just now focused on page 387, but I've heard many of my friends on that side of the aisle say these have no import, that these standards would not be mandatory. But I read on page 387 -- about the middle part of the page -- action by agency administrator. The agency administrator may terminate the contract, make a referral to the office of federal contract compliance programs of the Department of Labor, or take other appropriate action. I think this is referring to contractors of an agency, I suppose, including lawyers, accountants, asset management firms...
(UNKNOWN): Would the gentleman yield?
HENSARLING: ... brokers -- and just one second. I will yield to the -- to the gentleman. And so to me
there's a big difference between outlawing racial discrimination and then saying, oh, by the way, we have a
goal, and, by the way, we all know Fannie and Freddie started out with seemingly innocuous affordable
housing goals that seemed to morph into specific percentages of -- of mortgages to certain people. And we
know what the result was there.

And so it seems to me now you're setting a standard, if you don't meet our subjective goal, then we can terminate your contract, that sounds like that's getting very close to a mandate and a quota.
And I'd be happy to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.
WATT: I just want to point out to the gentleman that the amendment would strike only the language on lines
19 and 20 of page 385. It doesn't have anything to do with what you just were citing, so I'd just want to
make sure the gentleman understood that.

HENSARLING: Well, and reclaiming my time, I guess I'm asking -- and I think the ranking member asked it somewhat rhetorically -- I'll ask the gentlelady of California literally -- but as I'm reading the section that deals with the purpose of the office of minority and women inclusion, I understand that the gentleman from California's amendment maybe doesn't address this section, but in trying to understand...
BACHUS: If the gentleman would yield...
HENSARLING: ... what the -- I'd yield to our ranking member.

BACHUS: There actually -- the -- the underlying language, which was -- we received at 12:25 today, it does two things. And it -- it establishes a requirement that each regulatory agency assess the diversity policies of each regulated entity under its jurisdiction. And that's what this amendment addresses, strikes line 19 and
20.

However, it's my understanding, Mr. Royce is going to offer the second part, which is to strike line nine, which requires the regional Federal Reserve banks to establish an office in addition to the Board of Governors. And so we're discussing these together because they were offered as a package by the Democrats, so I don't think it should confuse anyone in the majority.
FRANK: Well, let me ask -- I'll...
(UNKNOWN): Sorry, Mr. Chairman. Reclaiming my time... (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: ... 30 seconds just so I can clarify something with the... (CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): I'd be happy to yield to the chairman.

Page 250 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FRANK: (OFF-MIKE) something at 12:25 today puzzles me. Nothing has been added since it was released at noon yesterday. And I really am very troubled by that suggestion.

There was the base text and additional language, and it was released by noon yesterday. And I -- I really resent, frankly, the suggestion that somebody slipped something by at 12:25. Nothing has been added, to my knowledge. And if it is, I'll rebuke myself and some others. But this was all made available as of noon yesterday.
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, I understand now I have 30 seconds remaining? FRANK: (OFF-MIKE) additional 30 seconds.
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And I would be happy to yield that time to the gentlelady from California. Again, I'm trying to understand, because as I listen to her in debate, I believe you created the impression that, again, these were merely suggestions, they could not be enforced, they were not mandatory, and yet I'm reading this language that says an agency can terminate a contract for one who doesn't meet their goals.

And I'm having trouble reconciling what you said with the provision of this bill. I'd yield to you for an answer...
(CROSSTALK)
WATERS: I thank the gentleman for yielding.

WATERS: If you're referring to action by agency administrator, it says -- and I will read -- upon receipt of a recommendation under clause, the agency administrator may terminate the contract, make a referral to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs at the Department of Labor, or take other appropriate action -- recommendation by the director.

Don't forget this is not Bernanke and other heads of the federal offices doing this work. This is the office that's being created with a director who does all of this work. The director of this office will be doing the assessment. They would give this information to the heads of these agencies with the recommendation, and they can do whatever they want to do with it, period.
(UNKNOWN): But they are empowered to terminate a contract.

WATERS: Did you read what I just read? Is that what you're referring to on page 387 starting with line 8? Did you read that?
FRANK: The gentleman from Texas' time, and then we'll conclude this. The gentleman from Texas has a response?
(UNKNOWN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Again, I have read from page 387 in the middle of the page, Action by Agency Administrator. Upon receipt of a recommendation under Clause 1, the agency administrator may -- I understand the word "may" -- terminate the contract. But are you not granting additional powers?
FRANK: I haven't -- we -- we don't have time for further dialogue (inaudible). The gentleman from Alabama?
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, I'd like to apologize for something I said that was not accurate. I said that this language striking lines 19 and 20 and 9, that we got those at 1220. That was the result of me misreading a note from my staff, which dealt with the New York Fed...
FRANK: Which would come up today.
(UNKNOWN): ... the language on the New York Fed was changed. FRANK: I appreciate. I thank the gentleman.
(UNKNOWN): And so I...

FRANK: I thank the gentleman, because at great -- you know, I have been a real pain to the staff a very hard-working people by trying to hold that, so I appreciate that.

Page 251 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We'll take one more on each side.
The gentleman from North Carolina? WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am perplexed by this whole discussion. The amendment that we've been debating would strike two lines, which would enable the director of this Minority Office of Inclusion to assess the diversity policies and practices of entities regulated by the agency. That's all Mr. Royce's amendment would do.

And I am perplexed, because I don't know how this office could do its job without making that kind of assessment. In a sense ever since the words were written, "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal," we've been assessing exactly what that means. We first thought it applied only to white men. It did. Then we found out later that we needed to apply it to white women, so we did. We then found out that we needed to apply to black people, which we did. We've been assessing this and trying to get it right ever since our country started.

And the notion that you could set up an office to encourage minority inclusion without assessing the impact of what you are doing or what these agencies are doing just seems ridiculous to me. So I'm kind of reminded of a client that I used to have when I -- when I was practicing law. When they didn't like -- when he didn't like the advice I was giving him as a lawyer, he would find me just say, "OK, the Lord told me to
do this."

And it's almost like the folks on your side have decided, "Well, we don't like this, so though Wall Street Journal told me to -- to make this a bogey man." And it's got all these conspiracy theories behind it, and -- and I think the Wall Street Journal, like I would -- would tell my client, I'm -- I'm never going to argue with the Lord. I'm not -- not arguing with the Wall Street Journal. I just think they got it wrong this time.

This is not a conspiracy. This is simply an effort to continue to assess and encourage people to do what we think this country was -- has been all about since day one. And to make this some big argument about Fannie and Freddie and allocation of credit and this and that, you know, is just missing the point.

Of all of the things that you would be trying to strike out of this underlying bill, these would probably be the last two lines I would want to strike, because we need to be constantly assessing the impact of what we're doing. And there is some interplay between what -- what the other change that we made to -- to this. It's true that had we retained the power of the director to be appointed by the President of the United States and put them on the -- the same plane with the director of each of these agencies, then maybe this director would have some power and -- and would threaten the agency.

But this is just an assessment to report to an administrator of each of these agencies so that the administrator of the agency can make a determination whether we're making any progress here, guys. This is -- this is not a conspiracy. We're not trying to take over the country. We're just trying to get us all invested in it so that the rest of the world doesn't get more and more and more ahead or catch up to us or however you want to say we're measuring up on that -- that standard.

The argument that we don't need this is kind of like the argument, well, you know, maybe we didn't need the Constitution after we had the Declaration of Independence. We had already said it, that all men were created equal. Well, what did it mean? It meant that, well, we've been trying to assess that. And we need to continue to try to assess it.

And I would just ask my colleague to withdraw this amendment. Quit trying to make it sound like we're trying to do something sinister. We're not. This is something stuff.
(UNKNOWN): Will the gentleman yield?

FRANK: The gentleman's time has expired, but I'll ask unanimous consent. The gentleman will have 30 seconds, if he wants to yield. WATT: I'm happy to yield to him 15 of those seconds if he'll give me the 15 then.
FRANK: Well, we'll do 45 then. (UNKNOWN): I'll ask -- I'll ask Mr. Garrett...
WATT: I'm happy to yield to whoever wanted me to you to for 30 seconds.

FRANK: All right. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized. This will be the last speaker. I will now put it to a vote after this last speaker.


Page 252 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GARRETT: OK. Just -- just one brief question. I would yield the balance of my time to Mr. Royce. And that is I am a little bit uncertain as to the magnitude or the breadth or the scope of exactly who would be covered by this in the section. C says assessing the diversity and practices of entities regulated by the agency.

Now, we know the agency is the regulators for the Department of Treasury and the corporation, but the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve Banks, or anything -- anything that the Fed will regulate under this new bill will come under that -- the Board of the National Credit Union, anything that the Credit Union Board would regulate, so all of my local small credit unions would now be subject to this diversity requirements and goals, if I'm understanding that correctly.

And I will yield to anyone who has a quick yes or no answer to that. Does anyone -- can anyone answer, say yes or no to that?
WATERS: No. GARRETT: No? WATERS: If I may? GARRETT: Yes. I'll yield.
WATERS: You're yielding to me? No. You -- you're trying to expand the responsibilities of the softness far beyond what is identified in this bill.

GARRETT: Well, reclaiming my time, it says, "assessing diversity and practice of entities regulated by the agency."
WATERS: That's right.
GARRETT: So would your local credit union -- your credit union is an entity that's regulated by the National
Credit Union Administration, correct?
WATERS: Right. That's right.
GARRETT: So my local credit union will be subject to this provision as well.

WATERS: Your local -- your credit union will be subject to an assessment of their policies and their practice these.
GARRETT: So the answer was yes. Anything, even my... WATERS: Assessment.
GARRETT: Right. So...
WATERS: But I don't want to confuse that with lending... GARRETT: All right. Reclaiming -- reclaiming my time... WATERS: ... as it has been attempted.
FRANK: The gentleman...

GARRETT: I appreciate it. So my answer is yes. All the way down to the local level, that assessment requirement and following that, the goals would also be pertaining to those as well.
With that, I'll yield the balance of my time to Mr. Royce. I'm yielding to Mr. Royce.
ROYCE: I thank you, sir.
FRANK: It's the gentleman from New Jersey's time is yielded to the gentleman from California.

ROYCE: Well, if I -- I could just close, I -- I raised this point because during the entire debate on affordable housing, we have had this same debate over and over again. And the thing that is very clear to me in all of this is that the attempt to reach for these goals did in fact lead to mandates and did lead to a situation where the credit worthiness of the borrower at the end of the day wasn't the prime concern.


Page 253 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now we go through all of this mania, all of this -- this meltdown caused in part -- in part by what happened with the GSEs, and we ask ourselves, are we now going to give those regulators the ability to do what they came and requested from us repeatedly -- regulate for safety and soundness, deleverage portfolios when they are at risk. Oh, no, they couldn't do that because of the affordable housing goals.

Are we or are we not going to allow the regulators to make these -- this call? And instead, we've given the regulators and you responsibility, and that responsibility will not go to whether or not they can properly judge systemic risk. It will go to whether or not every credit union under their control, every community bank, every specific institution that they might regulate is in compliance or not in compliance with something that is very broadly worded.

The attempt of my amendment was to -- was to get at most of what you are concerned about, Congresswoman, but not specifically to set in motion this undermining of the systemic risk regulator, of the safety and soundness regulator, because in all the meetings we've had with regulators post-crisis, they've
-- they've made the same point to us that they made for the last 15 years.

We would be better off if we did not try to trump their judgment on safety and soundness with these requirements, especially inasmuch as these provisions are already law, but now we've given them a new mission, a new mission to compete with safety and soundness.

ROYCE: And if it -- if it's interpreted the way in which they GSE regulation was interpreted, that will -- that will not lead to more assistance for people who are in need of housing. The results of how those affordable housing goals came down, which -- which ended up becoming mandates, was very injurious to the very people that Congress was trying to help with the affordable housing goals.
FRANK: The time for debate is expired. The question is now on the amendment. And the Committee on
Financial Services only votes on this one the parliamentarian instructs me.
The clerk will call the roll. CLERK: Chairman Frank? FRANK: No.

I will now recognize the gentleman from California to offer an amendment on the same -- a similar subject. It's not a duplicate of amendment. But in light of this long debate, I will recognize two members on each side.
The gentleman from California is now recognized to offer his amendment.

(UNKNOWN): Yes, and I will be very brief, Mr. Chairman. This amendment simply strikes the requirement that each regional Federal Reserve bank establishes an office in addition to the board of governors under this particular section we're discussing right now. Obviously this would be duplicative.

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors is included in the list of agencies required to establish an office. So having 13 different positions reporting to 13 different directors within the Federal Reserve system would be unnecessarily fractured, I think.

Page 255 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And maintaining one office within the board of governors would ensure the process is streamlined and consolidated within the Fed. I don't think this would be particularly controversial.
And it's also worth noting -- well, let me just wrap it up with that. I -- I -- I think that... FRANK: Thank the gentleman.
I'm informed that the parliamentarian that Government Reform gets to vote on this one, too. I am going to oppose the amendment. I appreciate the gentleman's cooperation.

One, I -- I must say I am particularly troubled by the Wall Street Journal editorial which objects to this provision on two grounds. One, that it intervenes on behalf of diversity. But two, that it intrudes on the sanctity of the autonomy of the regional banks. And, frankly, I don't want to give any support for that.

The regional banks are very important governmental entities that are run purely privately. I think one of the things we need to do next year is to address the structure of those regional banks. There was some effort to do it in the Senate bill. And we're going to revisit some of this. The notion that the regional banks should
not have to also do this seems to me a -- a -- a grave error. And I also did want to respond to what I think is a -- a confusion on the gentleman's part. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were given specific orders to do certain percentages. That's not in this bill. That was very different.

When George Bush in 2004 wanted them to increase the loans they bought from people below median income, he didn't give them a goal. He didn't give them a -- he ordered them, and he gave them a specific percentage. That's not what's in this bill. They are very, very different.
And I realize there were people who didn't understand that. In fact, when some of us talked about
restricting subprime lending, one major voice said but through all the demonizing, about 80 percent of even
subprime loans are being repaid on time. Another 10 percent are only 30 days behind.

Most of these new homeowners are low-income families, often minorities who would otherwise not have qualified for a mortgage. In the name of consumer protection, Mr. Frank's legislation would ensure that far fewer of these loans are issued in the future.

Now, that was the Wall Street Journal in 2007. Things come and go in the Wall Street Journals' editorial pages. But I do not think we ought to further cement the notion that it's somehow not appropriate for us to intrude on the regional banks.
Is there further debate?
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, if you will yield?
FRANK: I'll yield my remaining time to the gentleman.
(UNKNOWN): Yes, I would just point out that -- that I've been consistent, Mr. Chairman... FRANK: I understand that. I...
(UNKNOWN): ... in opposing this. I think you would agree with that.
FRANK: No, I -- I appreciate that. And I -- I was talking about the Wall Street Journal.

(UNKNOWN): I understand. But -- but I think that consistency -- it was in '92 that this passed. And back then it was a third of the portfolio.
FRANK: I agree. And it was -- it was raised -- and, again, many of us objected to it.
(UNKNOWN): So that -- that -- the compounding of that problem, whether it's on the Republican...

FRANK: Let me take my time back. The only problem is the gentleman said Congress. And it was both the president as well as Congress. That's the only objection I would have.
Is there further debate on the subject? The gentleman from Alabama?
BACHUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, let me clarify with -- with Congresswoman Waters. This amendment strikes line nine -- Mr. Royce's amendment. And what that does is it requires each regional Federal Reserve Bank to establish an office in addition to the board of governors of the main Fed.


Page 256 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I can see the establishment of an office at -- at the board of Fed, you know, maintaining one office at the Federal Reserve for this. When you get to establishing 13 different offices at each bank, to me it's -- it's duplicitous. You're going to just continue to add layers of -- of bureaucrats. And, you know, every time you hire somebody it costs more money.

The -- the regional Feds, as I've already said, they're under a mandate from the EEOC to report all their metrics on diversity to the -- to the  commission. And the  commission is empowered to act if they find a violation of the Civil Rights Act or investigate those violations.

You know, having 13 different positions at 13 -- and 13 different directors within the Federal Reserve system, I think, is unnecessarily fractured. You're going to have 13 different sets of -- of 13 different offices interpreting this 13 different ways going into all your regulated institutions because we were unsuccessful in that first amendment.

If -- if Congress believes that additional reporting needs to be done, it should be done through one office. And that should be at the Federal Reserve Bank here in Washington, the Federal Reserve Board here in Washington.

Now, let me say this. We -- if anything this discussion does prove is that this provision lacks clarity. I mean, it -- it absolutely does. How do you -- how do you interpret increasing the participation of minority-owned and women-owned businesses and contracts in the -- in the member institutions or the regulated institutions? I mean, how -- what does that mean? How do you do that?

You know, you'd have a goal. But then, you know, you -- you'd have to -- if you have a goal or you establish such a standard, you've got to enforce that standard. And, you know, if you don't have a lot of clarity as to what they're -- they're supposed to be enforcing or compelling, that -- that can lead to what I call scope creep. You know, what is their scope?

What are their powers? What can they do? What can't they do? Where do they stop? What can they ask the member banks to do? And I'm not talking about the Federal Reserve Banks. I'm talking about the -- not the regional banks. I'm talking about the credit unions, the banks, the financial companies, anyone under this regulated by this bill.

And when you do -- when you don't know what the scope is, you have mission creep. And -- and I really believe that that mission creep could include politically motivated credit allocation. You could -- you could say you need to make this loan or you -- or you don't.

So I think the Wall Street Journal is correct in saying that because of the lack of clarity in this amendment it could result in a -- a regulator, a bank examiner saying you -- you should have made this loan or you
should have made this loan at a certain interest rate. And I -- I think it's almost predictable.

We had those same affordable housing goals. And it resulted in no-downpayment loans to people with bad credit. That was -- that was mission creep. Because what did affordable housing mean? It meant different things to different people. And it's going to mean almost a different thing to every bank examiner that goes into every bank.

And you're going to have someone sitting there on each regional board, an office that's charged with getting up the participation. And I -- I think it's just an -- I think it's an overreach. I -- none of us disagree at this point in history, I hope, with the Civil Rights Act. But I believe this is an overreach. But I think...
FRANK: The gentleman's time -- the gentleman's time is expired. The gentlewoman from Ohio?
KILROY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

You know, I've heard some conspiracy theories around town from time to time. And they appear to be in vogue here. And the Wall Street Journal has now certainly joined in with that, with this panicky conspiracy theory in yesterday's editorial, now joined in with and adopted by our Republican colleagues with their amendments and their arguments regarding taking fair consideration of women and minorities into account at the various agencies that we're talking about today or that assessing the impact of policies or coordinating technical assistance to minority and women-owned businesses will somehow hurt safety and soundness or, in the milder version, that it's just too bureaucratic to bother with.

I certainly hope they don't mean that only white men can judge the -- or are concerned about safety and soundness of the financial system. Their over-the-top language, though, of the Wall Street Journal editorial, which the other side has adopted in their language talking about how we are going to be dictating to or


Page 257 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
intimidating or having czars and political operatives at these Federal Reserve regional banks is fairly absurd.

But it takes -- I'm really stunned though by the Wall Street Journal language, just as Maxine Waters' provision is a brazen attempt to hijack bank policy. I haven't heard words like that, I think, since the '70s when they talked about brazen and uppity women. And it's a little disturbing to hear it coming back again now.

KILROY: If this language establishing offices of women and minority inclusion, requiring the assessment of the impact of policies and regulations of each agency on minority-owned and women-owned businesses and establishing offices of women and minority inclusion at the Office of National Insurance and the federal regional banks is brazen, I -- I'm just really kind of at a loss for words there.

I would think that all of these offices want to have the information, would want to have the facts that would be available from such assessments, and be able to maybe hear what the impact was on some banking policies.

Maybe they would have heard that subprime and predatory lenders were preying on widows in minority communities and other communities. Maybe they would have heard and acted on that earlier and shut off this predatory lending crisis that we were in at an earlier day.

Or maybe they would have heard, like I heard yesterday from a woman in my constituency, that the bank was charging her $3 merely to take money from her savings account and put it into her checking account, a
$3 charge just to move her own money from one to another at that bank.

Or maybe they would -- we understand what we need to do to make women and minority businesses more widely available, that they can have the financing and the credit when they are creditworthy and deserve it and make sure that they're not being excluded from the credit market because they are women or minorities or that those policies have that impact.

We are -- we need to learn what's going on here. We need -- we're not talking about demanding or -- or ordering or dictating credit allocation. We want to have the information that we need so that we have fair financial regulations that serve all of our people.

And I think it's critically important that we include the consideration of women and minorities and that we have women and minorities included at each decision-making and information and regulating body.
Thank you. I yield back.
FRANK: Question now comes on the amendment. Those in favor will say aye. Opposed, no. The noes have it.
The question is now on the offer by the House to the Senate. And the office -- the Oversight and
Government Reform and Financial Services Committee members both vote.
The clerk will call the roll.

Let me just say, as you do this, insurance comes up next. I'm told there's no real controversy over that. We will then be able to get to credit unions and finish up. And, I would think, by 4 o'clock, we should be able to
-- or maybe 3:30, and be able to give our full offer (ph) to the Senate, and...
(CROSSTALK)

DODD: What I want to suggest, Mr. Chair, if we can -- and I've talked with Senator Corker about it and other members -- I've notified them not to try and be back here necessarily at 2:00, because it can take a little longer. And then when you get completed in that thing, I want to ask for a -- we may take a break for a little bit to be able to assess exactly the offer so we can come back and respond very quickly. It won't take long.
FRANK: That's  fine. (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: And then we'll take a recess and be able to respond to the -- to the -- to the counteroffers. The clerk will call the roll.

And the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who's the subcommittee -- subcommittee chairman, will preside. KANJORSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We offer...
FRANK: (OFF-MIKE)

KANJORSKI: We move the offer of the insurance section to the Senate. And it will be open for amendment and debate at any point, and I'll exercise the first five minutes, if I may, for as long as I may need to consume in representing what this is.

It reminds me of something that has transpired over the year in the movies "Back to the Future," because the Office of Insurance was first contemplated back in September 11th of 2001, when we all sat in a secure room in the Capitol and talked about what was necessary to prevent future acts of terrorism and how to ensure against those acts.

And it was determined that we wanted representatives of the federal government who were knowledgeable about insurance to come up and make reports to a task force between the House Banking Committee, who had jurisdiction of the insurance process, and members of Treasury. And what we found out is there was
no Office of Insurance to give that information.


Page 260 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And that was the seed, really, for what has transpired over several congresses to get to this point, creating the office of -- a federal Office of Insurance that's represented in this section of the bill.

What we did -- and in order to put a position together that was acceptable on the House side, we met with various people everywhere from the state -- or the national insurance regulators to various committees of jurisdiction in the House, the Ways and Means Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and various people who had a part of insurance or that jurisdiction, and we crafted what we thought was a passable bill, and, in fact, it was. It passed the 110th Congress. It passed the 111th Congress, was submitted to the Senate, but did not receive consideration on the Senate side.

When the new regulatory reform bill proceeded before our committee back in November, the same legislation that was highly tailored and made to have uniform support was submitted in the bill. And, indeed, it carried without any major objection in the committee or on the House floor and it is now part of this bill.

We're -- we have only one portion of the bill that Mr. Waxman will speak on that remains to be closed at this session. But basically, what we are asking is that a bill that the Senate took up after we introduced it when they were considering the full text of this bill -- and, quite frankly, in my own opinion, did improve it.

The Senate-based bill that contains the federal Office of Insurance is probably considerably stronger than the House bill, but does not meet all the considerations and all the accommodations that were necessary to put the work together so that we could effectively get this put together.

So as chairman of the subcommittee that put the original bill together, I go back to the point of returning to the future, that we put our bill together, we send it to the Senate, the Senate probably did a better job in constructing the bill, they've sent it back to the House, and now we're trying to reconstruct the bill as the House originally constructed it. And that's the nature of our office -- of our offer.

I -- I think there's, as I said, little disagreement. I would suggest, having spent a lot of time in crafting this, that for the balances of all the interests involved, so we don't further shake up this huge industry of insurance and the interested parties and the various and multi-state considerations, and international considerations, that we ask the Senate to give due consideration to the structure as it presently exists on the House side or in the House offer.
Are there any other interested parties in the discussion of the bill? Oh, the gentleman from California? ROYCE: Yes, Chairman Kanjorski, if I could just take a minute, I'd like to commend you for your work on
this important issue.

I also agree with you. I think the Senate language was stronger in this provision. But creating a federal insurance office, I think, is an important step towards streamlining what is for all of us -- I think, as we look at it, a very fragmented, a very outdated regulatory structure for insurance.

And we are at a unique time. We're watching  Europe come under one insurance market. There's the Solvency II directive which is going into effect. And it is troubling to think that the United States still does not have any expertise on insurance matters within the federal government.

However, watering down the language and simply creating an office in order to create an office, that won't get us very far, and, in fact, it might hurt us. And I say that because the weaker the office gets, the more likely it will not be recognized as an equivalent regulator by foreign regulatory bodies.

While we were debating this provision, during Senate deliberations, a member of the E.U. Parliament wrote a letter highlighting this potential problem. This -- this office needs to maintain strong, preemptive powers over state laws when it deals with international agreements that the United States comes into contact with.
It needs room to work. Otherwise, it will be deemed irrelevant and be little more than a data collection office.

Yielding to the state regulators is not the right approach. They have had their chance to develop a way to deal with these problems, by the way, for the last 139 years. That has not happened.

I believe the language as passed by the Senate was stronger and would ultimately be more effective. Specifically, mandating that any potential agreement achieve a level of protection substantially equivalent to that under state laws will unnecessarily tie the hands of the office and make implementation that much more difficult. Again, we have 51 different sets of rules. We have 51 different regulators.
Determining if an agreement is substantially equivalent to each of these various laws would be, frankly --
it'd be nearly impossible. Again, if we don't give this office the authority necessary to do its job, to negotiate
and implement international agreements, it will be doomed for failure. And again, Chairman Kanjorski, I
thank you for your work on this issue.

Page 261 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KANJORSKI: Thank you, Mr. Royce.

And now we're going to actually break in. We were going to have a presentation, but Mr. Waxman is in the midst of a committee hearing, so I now recognize Mr. Waxman to offer an amendment to the offer.
WAXMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment that I wish to offer at this time. And if I might speak on it, this amendment concerns the scope of the new office of federal insurance
created under the title. It provides that the scope of the office does not include long-term care insurance,
except to the extent that it contains an annuity or a life insurance component. It further provides that, with
respect to long- term care insurance that contain such components, the director of the office of insurance
will coordinate with the secretary of Health and Human Services in performing the functions of this office.

The reason I'm offering this amendment is that the Department of Health and Human Services is the primary agency with expertise and experience in the area of long-term care. It only makes sense that HHS should continue to take the lead with respect to studying long- term care insurance issues.

To that extent, the long-term care insurance includes annuity -- to the extent that it includes annuity or life insurance components, the amendment provides for appropriate coordination with the director in
performing the functions of this office. This allows the experience and expertise of both departments in their respective areas to combine for the best recommendations and advice for the future of these types of products.

I appreciate the time and effort, Mr. Kanjorski, you and your staff and the committee staff have devoted to working out mutually acceptable language on this subject.
KANJORSKI: Thank you very much, Mr. Waxman.
Are there any other discussions on the Waxman amendment? OK. So, without -- we put it to a vote.
All those in favor of the Waxman amendment vote "aye." KANJORSKI: Opposed, "no."
There's no request for record of votes, so the Waxman amendment is agreed to and adopted. Thank you, Mr. Waxman. We'll now excuse you so you can go back and do your real work.
We have the gentlelady from Illinois. BIGGERT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to thank you on
this House offer. And I enjoyed working with you. I think the basis of this bill was a bill that was probably the
most bipartisan bill that came out of our committee this year. And I enjoyed working with you. I wanted to
say thank you, and I yield back.

KANJORSKI: I thank the gentlelady from Illinois, and I assure her I enjoyed working with her. And now we'll recognize for comment on the offer the gentlelady from California, Ms. Speier.

SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. I, too, would like to recognize Chairman Kanjorski and Ms. Biggert for the good work that they performed in getting a very sound proposal completed, which represents, for the most part, the House offer.

I'm here to strongly support the adoption of the House-offered language in Title 5 regarding the establishment of a federal insurance office that preserves some of the key elements of the House compromise. You know, this is a complex area of the law, and one that I worked extensively on when I was chair of the California Senate insurance committee.

Insurance committees are regulated, and regulated well, at the state level. They have long been subject to strict capital requirements. And, if they become unsound or insolvent, they are subject to state conservatorship or receivership. Now, California has unwound a number of insurance companies over the years.

The last thing we need now is to create a mechanism that weakens state insurance regulation and consumer protections, and allows insurance companies to engage in regulatory arbitrage through international agreement. I worry that what we saw with the regulatory shopping that went on in advance of the financial meltdown will happen once again if we don't keep the House offer language intact.

The House offer creates the federal insurance office, will improve the understanding of insurance issues at the federal level -- which is a good thing -- and cooperation at the international level without interfering with

Page 262 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
our strong and effective state-based system of insurance regulation that has protected insurance consumers, even during the worst of the recent financial crisis.

Under the Senate bill, the Treasury secretary would have unilateral and broad policymaking and preemption authority. The Senate language defining international insurance agreements on prudential matters is so broad and so vague, it could inadvertently lead to preemption of state insurance laws by free trade agreements and the World Trade Organization's financial service agreement.

For example, Treasury could enter into an agreement that the United States won't place numeric limits on the sale of insurance products. Such a requirement would, in effect, prohibit states from banning any insurance product, even if it was risky or abusive. It would, in fact, eviscerate state regulations for reserves. The House-offered language will replace the overly broad definition of internal international insurance agreements on prudential measures with more narrowly defined cover agreements, ensuring that state insurance laws could only be preempted if foreign insurers are treated less favorably under the state law, and if the mutual recognition agreement provides substantially equivalent protections for consumers as under the state law.

The House language balances two competing interests: Treasury's interest and desire to participate in international negotiations on insurance matters; and the ability of state regulators and lawmakers to
maintain strong consumer protection. But it explicitly requires the foreign jurisdiction to have an enforceable law that provides real protections.
I actually encourage the conferees to take these protections one step further and also include the
House-passed requirement that a foreign insurer be directly treated less favorably. The Senate language
allows that a foreign insurer could be indirectly treated less favorably, and you answer for me what indirect
might entail in the long term.

I also encourage supporting the House-offered language that requires full authority to, in consultation with Congress, when agreements are negotiated, and a lay-over period before a covered agreement can become effective, de novo judicial review of preemption decisions and the addition of the FIO director to serve on the Financial Service Oversight Council in an advisory capacity. The council will need to have insurance expertise in its deliberations.

The House-offered language crafts a delicate but workable balance between the needs for federal insurance expertise and international coordination of insurance issues while preserving the essence of our strong and battle-tested state regulatory system. It's essential that we not take a step backwards and inadvertently deregulate the one financial industry that has remained robust and solvent through the crisis.

I guess in the end let me just say, what are we trying to fix? If we're trying to establish on a national level a knowledge base as it relates to regulating insurance, then that's great. But if what we're trying to do is provide that reinsurers, that are mostly foreign, and foreign insurers don't have to be subject to state laws regarding very fundamental issues around capital and reserves, then we are heading in the wrong direction.

I look now at what we've seen with some of these insurers who go to a reinsurer, and they agree that they will take the liability off their books as the insurance company give it to the reinsurer. But then they have a side letter that basically says they will never access the reinsurance. And it's strikingly similar to what we saw with Repo 105 and Lehman Brothers. And we cannot allow for that kind of mischief to start to happen in the insurance industry.
I yield back.
KANJORSKI: The gentlelady's time has expired. I thank you, Ms. Speier.
Now, if there are no further discussion on the offer, the question is on the offer as amended. All those in favor, signify by saying "aye."
(UNKNOWN MEMBERS): Aye. KANJORSKI: Opposed, "no."
Hearing no opposition, the "ayes" have it. The offer is set over.

FRANK: We should just note that that was on behalf of, on our side, Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, Government Reform, Financial Services and six people who were walking by on Independence Avenue.
(LAUGHTER)

Very broad coverage of this one.
I now move the House offer on credit rating agencies, which is -- which title is that? Title 9.

As I offer the amendment, this is one where we had a good deal of bipartisan agreement, but not entirely. Many of us felt -- and I think this is widespread -- frustration here. The understanding that the credit rating agencies failed badly in what people had expected them to be able to do, and that that failure was part of the cause of the crisis, is fairly widespread. Clearly, credit rating agencies over-rated substantial amounts of paper and claimed to tell us much more than they knew or that anyone could know.

In addition to that, there was the inherent conflict of interest in which people pay credit rating agencies to rate the paper they are selling. We have tried very hard to deal with that. And I know the Senate had a different approach to it.

What we did was, first, an amendment that was offered by our colleagues from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano, from California, Mr. Sherman, to make it easier for people who were misled by the ratings to sue. Under current law, basically, the only people who can sue a rating agency are the people who pay the
rating agency to rate their paper. The number of lawsuits because of over-ratings was not very high.

FRANK: We in the bill allow those who have relied on the rating agencies to make purchases to sue them. And we have removed some exemptions they had in the law.

Beyond that -- and this is one where I collaborated with the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett -- we did the best we could to put people on notice that they ought to be doing their own diligence and relying on their own information, and not be relying on the rating agencies to tell them what nobody can tell them, even if they didn't have a conflict of interest.
FRANK: So in our version, we repeal all of the statutory references that require people to get a certain
rating before they can either buy or sell. And we also mandate that the regulators who have maintained that
in regulation to undue those regulations and replace them, if they feel the need to, with some other
measure, although we do believe this is one where people ought to be told do it on your own. One issue
raised was, well, what about people who are really very small and they don't have the capacity to rate these
things? They probably shouldn't be buying complex instruments. If they do, they should do at their own risk.
Frankly, a number of municipalities, including some small ones, but some others, I think, erred in getting
into things that they -- their officials didn't fully understand. And I don't mind if they are now deterred from
doing that.

We also try to restrict the conflict of interest by saying that rating agencies should not be doing other business with those they rate, although the inherent conflict of interest of the -- of the people being rated higher in the rating agencies is not done away with here.

So that's essentially an offer which we collectively did the best we thought we could. There is -- as I said, there was some objection, I think, about the level of liability. Mostly this was a bipartisan one.
So I move this offer. Is there a further discussion or amendment? Gentleman from Alabama?
BACHUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have an amendment.

I do wish to thank you, however. Last July, House Republicans were the first to offer comprehensive financial reform, and that included a provision to remove all references to credit ratings throughout federal laws and regulations so that the rating agencies will no longer operate as a government-sanctioned oligopoly.

The federal government's Good Housekeeping seal of approval for the agencies and their products, I believe, contributed significantly to the mispricing of risk and subsequent collapse in market confidence during the financial crisis.

I think one of the most difficult issues we've dealt with is the failure of the credit rating agencies. And I think that had that failure not been present, we -- much of what we'd witnessed in the last two years probably could have been avoided.

And I for one am really not sure how we -- how we ought to address this. It ought to be addressed. When it's not addressed here, it may need to be addressed later.

However, I am pleased to see that the House offer includes a similar bipartisan provision, authored by Mr. Garrett, the chairman of the subcommittee, and myself, that would require financial regulatory agencies to

Page 264 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
review the government's reliance on credit ratings and mandates that these agencies modify their rules and regulations within one year.

So I thank the chairman and yield back the balance of my time, only to say that we continue to need to keep a focus on the credit rating agencies and continue to work in a bipartisan way. FRANK: If the gentleman would yield, I'd thank the gentleman for what he said. I just want to make clear: There was some question because there was some reference -- I think in the original Senate bill -- to some of these obligations being put on the nationally recognized rating agencies, and we've both agreed to change that
so that, by giving up your NRSRO status, you don't avoid any liability, and we've agreed on that one.
Is there further discussion or debate on the credit rating? The gentleman from California?
ROYCE: Mr. Chairman, just I'll make a couple of quick points, Mr. Chairman. But of the $3.2 trillion of subprime mortgages, three quarters of those were awarded AAA ratings. I think the failure of the rating agencies to comprehend the risk posed by these products was a huge problem.

But there was an underlying core problem: The major failure over the years was the blind reliance on the rating agencies by investors, by financial institutions, also by the federal government. And in many respects, the government has institutionalized these failed ratings. Looking back, this over-reliance was as misguided as the ratings being issued by the agencies.

And I think a more competitive market with alternatives to the NRSRO's ratings is the most effective alternative. For instance, economists have advocated for mandating large institutions issue subordinated debt. Credit default swap spreads have also been used as an alternative to agency ratings. Whatever the vehicle, nothing will replace due diligence by investors and institutions and regulators.

Alternative risk indicators must replace this government-created oligopoly in the -- in the rating agency industry, and I think, with your House version, I -- I concur with it (ph).
FRANK: Right. And we've worked this one out together. ROYCE: Yes.
FRANK: And I would just say to the gentleman, as he indicated, in our language, we mandate that the regulators remove any reliance on ratings and tell them to come up with the kind of alternative measures the gentleman mentioned, whether it's spreads or whatever. So we do, do that.
If there's no further -- oh, the gentleman from North Carolina? WATT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief.
I -- and I'm somewhat hesitant to say what I'm going to say, because I don't want it to be interpreted as defending credit rating agencies. I do think everything that's been said about how they really messed up is true, and they really did not fulfill the -- the expectations that anybody had of what they should be doing.

But we in the process have created an anomaly in the language that I wanted to point out, and I hope we can address -- and I've talked to the chairman about trying to address it in a different context.

But I just wanted to put in the record, in -- in the haste of being angry at credit rating agencies and reducing the standard of pleading and liability for them to be held accountable in private actions, we have made their standard of liability and pleading standard lower than we have made against accountants and other participants.

So you end up with kind of an anomaly here, where a person who -- an entity -- a credit rating agency that expresses an opinion is held to a higher standard than a person or entity that expresses a factual statement, such as accountants.

And I think the way to resolve that is that we may need to look at the whole standard of care for all players in this industry for liability purposes and have a study done of that, not -- not to supplant what is in our offer here, but it does seem to me kind of counterintuitive that you would hold a person who was expressing an opinion about something to a higher standard of care than you would hold people who were expressing factual determinations, too.

So with that, Mr. Chairman, I -- I put it on the record and in a way that doesn't interrupt what we're doing today, but...
FRANK: No, and we will discuss it further. I thank the gentleman.
Page 265 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Is there further discussion?
The gentleman from Texas? HENSARLING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I -- I did want to add my voice that I do believe this is a very important section of the bill. When you look at the various but-for causes of the economic turmoil, certainly the  cartel, if you will, the
government-sanctioned  cartel of the rating agencies played a very important role.

They made a huge mistake, and another huge mistake was made by people who ended up relying upon their opinions that, in the rear-view mirror, proved to be very, very wrong.

I do want to state, though, that for the record, as we increase the liability standards of these credit rating agencies, it's important to note that in many respects federal policymakers and regulators made exactly the same mistake. We know that the -- you could essentially, as a depository institution, have untold amounts
of Fannie and Freddie paper to meet your capital standards, so, again, the federal government missed the boat, as well, on the housing bubble. The entire nation made a mistake.

So as we increase these liability standards, I am somewhat concerned about our ability to, to some extent, sue our way into prosperity. And I would just note that the credit rating agencies made the same mistake that many regulators did in believing that, for example, Fannie and Freddie paper was essentially secure.

I want to make sure that there is not a government-sanctioned  cartel in rating agencies. And I fear to some extent that, in the house position, by increasing the liability standards, concurrently with that, we increase the barrier to entry for other firms that may want to come out and compete with this oligopoly or this  cartel.

And in some respects, I believe, by increasing this liability standard, it could be defeating of the goal of trying to bring in more competitors into this marketplace. And so this is a section that I -- of the House that I do not agree with.

I certainly do want to commend the chairman in the House position for ensuring that we do not concur in the Senate position of having the government essentially assign a rating agency to put their imprimatur on it and have once again an implied government seal of approval. I think that's a very important position of the House. I think in many respects it's the most important aspect of the bill, and I wanted to commend the chairman for that, but I'm concerned about the liability standards creating barriers to entry.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. FRANK: Gentlewoman from Ohio?
KILROY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.

In our -- in this bill, we are seeking to downgrade the market's reliance on credit rating agencies, and we're asking the credit rating agencies to examine the facts and to make sound assumptions when they offer a rating, rather than -- and asking them not to be grossly negligent. That doesn't seem to be a standard that is too high for them to meet.

From 2004 to 2007, credit rating agencies made hundreds of millions of dollars rating thousands of deals in residential-backed, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.

They gave subprime issuances good grades, AAA grades, but it seems like the analysis may have been more interested in market share retention than examining the facts and giving hard and objective grades. Now, it seems we maybe have a little bit of grade inflation going on in the credit rating agencies or maybe like Lake Woebegone children -- all of the children are above average.

Ninety-one percent of the AAA securities backed by subprime mortgages issued in 2007 have now been downgraded to junk status, along with 93 percent of those issues in 2006 and 53 percent of those issues in
2005. On January 30th, 2008, alone, Standard & Poors downgraded over 6,300 subprime residential mortgage-backed securities and 1,900 CDOs. Said one Moody's executive, quote, "These errors make us look either incompetent at credit analysis or like we sold our souls to the devil for revenue." We need to change the desire for market share, the perceived need to ease the issuers who are paying the fees of the credit rating agencies.

Included in the House offer is a simple commonsense proposal that will help change this dynamic, a proposal that would nullify SEC Rule 436(g) and hold all credit rating agencies accountable under Section
11 liability, a standard which already covers many experts in the financial world -- accountants, auditors, lawyers, investment bankers and the directors, officers and executives of the issuer.

Page 266 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Section 11 liability is a strict liability for making false statements and was enacted so that those persons with a direct role in a registered offering would be subject to a rigorous standard of liability to ensure that disclosure regarding securities is accurate. That all credit rating agencies should be held to a higher standard of accountability is a central recommendation of the July 2009 report of Investors' Working Group, an independent task force chaired by former SEC Chair Arthur Levitt, who was appointed by SEC -- who was appointed chairman by President Clinton, and William Donaldson Levitt (sic), who was appointed SEC Chair by President Bush.

As the Investors' Working Group stated, this change would make rating agencies more diligent about the rating process and ultimately more accountable for sloppy performance.

During committee markup I offered an amendment to repeal Rule 436(g). That amendment was approved by my colleagues via a voice vote. Subsequently, during floor proceedings of House Resolution 4173, an amendment was offered to then strike the language. That amendment was defeated 166-259, sending a clear signal that the House views repeal of Rule 436(g) to be a critical part of reforming Wall Street.

I urge passage of the House offering, an inclusion of the provision repealing 436(g) in the final conference report.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. FRANK: Is there further discussion? The gentleman from New Jersey?
GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment. FRANK: The clerk will report the amendment.
We don't have it. Do we have it? GARRETT: You should.
CLERK: Amendment to the House off relating to Subtitle C of Title 9 offered by Mr. Garrett, page 8 of the House offer, line 8, strikes "lifted" in paragraph 4. Page 9 of the... FRANK: All right. I ask unanimous consent of the amendment being considered as read.
The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for five minutes.

GARRETT: Yes, thanks, Mr. Chairman. And also thanks, Mr. Chairman, for including the language that removes the reference to the NRS or those from the regulation that was in the House offer.

As the chairman knows, that language that's now in this before us mirrors an amendment that the chairman and Ranking Member Bachus and myself included during the committee consideration of the credit rating agency legislation. So...
FRANK: Will the gentleman yield? GARRETT: Yes, sure.
FRANK: I think it's a reasonable -- I agree with it, so I'm going to vote for it. GARRETT: I have four more pages.
(LAUGHTER)
FRANK: If you have -- do that every time, you may get more yeses.

GARRETT: Yes, well, 30 seconds, then, just to say thank you to the chairman for his concurrence on this and agreement that we should...
FRANK: It's basically extending the same principle. GARRETT: To all other federal agencies, yes. FRANK: Further discussion?
Gentlemen, I -- I now ask the congressmen to listen to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is a proponent of a measure that is not in the House bill, but is in the Senate bill.

Page 267 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The gentleman from California?
SHERMAN: Thank you, Mr....

FRANK: I apologize. I haven't voted -- we haven't put the question on the Garrett amendment. All in favor say aye.
(A CHORUS OF AYES) FRANK: Opposed no.
The ayes have it. The amendment is agreed to.

The gentleman from California? GARRETT: I have some more amendments, if you'd like to do it that way, too.
SHERMAN: Mr. Chairman, thanks for the opportunity to address the conference committee.

I've been very involved in those provisions that are sometimes called bailout provisions, and I know I've been quoted by Mr. Royce in this room and -- and others. Those provisions deal with resolution authority, FDIC debt guarantee and Fed Section 13-3. And I do want to put on the record that I've been quoted, but only about prior versions of the Senate and House legislation. And I hope to be back to comment on the current versions of the bills that are actually before us on those three sub-issues.

We're here to talk about credit rating agencies and the Franken amendment. Multi -- credit rating agencies get multi-million-dollar contracts. Most of their costs are fixed, so we're talking about million-dollar profits on each contract.

The key to the money is to land the engagement, and the engagement is given by the issuer. Needless to say, they gave AAA to Alt-A. They gave the highest rating to some of the worst bonds. We shouldn't be surprised. What would happen if you had the umpire selected by the home team and getting paid $1 million per game? You can be sure that that umpire would call balls and strikes in order to secure future lucrative employment.

That's why on October 27th I proposed an amendment to the House markup that would have a government panel to identify those credit rating agencies qualified to do various classes of credit ratings and then have the government panel select the credit rating agency, ending the -- the system where the issuer selects the agency that is going to great the -- the issue.

Now, that amendment was withdrawn at the House level. Senator Franken picked it up in the -- on the Senate side. He added additional language to it and got an overwhelming bipartisan vote on the Senate floor. The Franken amendment also added a provision, and I think a good one, to say that the credit rating agency would state in every credit rating agency in this that -- in every credit rating that that credit rating was not government approved or sanctioned in any way.
Both amendments provide that the First Amendment rights of the issuer are preserved. If they want to hire
a second or third credit rating agency, they're free to do so as long as they list first the selected credit rating
agency.

And finally, to respond to the gentleman from Texas, this -- the amendment I put forward had the support of some of the small credit rating agencies and is opposed by the oligopoly of three. Now, there are -- there are some who say, well, just tell people not to rely on credit rating agencies. We'll just issue a government press release and tell them not to rely. That begs the question, well, why even have credit rating agencies? But the second thing is people will rely on credit ratings, and they should. How are you going to decide
whether to buy an IBM bond or an Intel bond? Which one has the better credit rating? How are you going to decide which bond fund you want to invest in? You just invest in the bond fund with the highest rate of return. That's the one with the junkiest bonds. You need to invest in a bond fund that has highly rated instruments.

The American people expect us to prevent this from recurring. They blame correctly credit rating agencies. While there are many good provisions in the House bill, the one thing that the people of this country have heard of is the Franken amendment. They expect it to be in the final legislation.

I would hope that someone who's a member of the conference committee would offer an amendment to the House offer so that we keep the Franken amendment, but delay its core Section 939(d) for two years. Why two years? Two reasons.



Page 268 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
First, it gives us more than enough time to come up with something better. I'm not sure the Franken amendment is the very best thing. It's just much better than anything else that's been put forward. But two years of study may yield something.

And second, it'll be about two years before the predominant emotion on Wall Street ceases to be fear and slowly returns to a tradition, a predominant emotion of greed. If we continue the issuer selects the credit rating agency, and that is still in place a couple of years from now, that it may not be mortgage bonds -- it may be some other kind of debt instrument -- but we will set up another circumstance where they give AAA to bad bonds, get huge fees, select additional engagements.

If we have the Franken amendment springing into effect two years from now, we know we'll have a better system two years from now. And if we can do even better than the Franken amendment to study and legislation, that's so much the better.

FRANK: The gentlewoman who -- New York, I believe, had a colloquy she wanted to have. So the gentlewoman is recognized for about a minute and a half.

(UNKNOWN): I have concerns about Section 933, the conflict of interest provision. The House offer contains language that would prohibit credit rating agencies and their affiliates that provide ratings from engaging in certain consulting practices and services.

Standard & Poor's parent company, McGraw-Hill, also owns subsidiaries that provide consulting services, but those subsidiaries do not also provide rating. They are concerned that this section may be interpreted to mean that any affiliates of rating agencies cannot continue to provide consulting services. This would hamper subsidiaries that provide consulting, but do not issue ratings.

I understand from talking to your staff that this is not the intent of the provision as it was drafted, but the bill is only meant to affect affiliates of rating agencies that also provide ratings. And I would like a clarification...

FRANK: If the gentlewoman would yield, that's correct. We -- we are talking about a large enterprise that has several ownerships. An entirely separate company that has nothing to do with ratings would not be restricted.
Is there further discussion? If not... (UNKNOWN): Thank you very much. FRANK: ... the question is on.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania will close out the debate. KANJORSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, this -- this has probably been the most perplexing part of the reform legislation that we consider. I want to first mention that we had such a great working task force on this with some good -- Mr. Cupano (ph), Mr. Sherman, Ms. Kilroy and so many others -- that they dedicated themselves to find a better position.

But unfortunately, the real honest position here was we have an inherent conflict of interest in rating agencies. The issuers are the ones that pay the bill. And as a result, they, very often in the past at least, have received the benefit from the rating agencies of AAA when perhaps they shouldn't have received that.

We didn't take that out. We can't take it out. We really don't know how to handle it. I think there are provisions in here that tighten up the liability. And I think they're very good. But they require monitoring.

There are further provisions in the House provisions that create statutory protection, mitigation and other things to make certain that we have close examination and oversight of rating agencies. And if I would totalize everything that we should do, that's probably what we're talking about in the Franken amendment. Take two years, see if we can come up with a better methodology.

But certainly, the committees of the House and Senate to oversight these rating agencies much closer because there isn't any question in my mind -- and I think that was the considered opinion of everyone on the task force that served. When you look at it, the most substantial contributor to the crash of two years ago was the failure of issuing unprecedented AAA ratings for securities that shouldn't have been rated that way. And a hoax was perpetrated on the American public and the world public with those security reactions.



Page 269 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I think that the House bill is a little stronger. We've seen some corrections. I look forward to working on this provision when the Senate comes back with their offer. I just want to congratulate the task force that worked on this bill. Thank you.
FRANK: The question now comes on the House offer as amended by the gentleman from New Jersey. Those in favor will say "aye."
Opposed, no. The ayes have it. And the offer is made.

We will now defer to our Senate colleagues. I want to thank the members of the House, both parties, all the relevant committees. I think those who expected this to be a lot of anger or -- or on the other hand, simply cut and dried have been confounded. And I appreciate the participation.
And we will now -- we're probably going to go vote. And we will come back with our Senate colleagues. DODD: Mr. Chairman, let me -- first of all, I -- I offer -- Senator Corker and I, anyway. This has been a very
educational process here to listen to the very robust debate here on...
FRANK: Do you miss us because you're sorry you left? DODD: Not that much. But I...
FRANK: OK.
DODD: It's certainly fond memories. And what a plan would be -- I think you've got a couple of votes, I
gather. I'd say sometime between 3:15 and 3:30, no later than 3:30 we'll...

FRANK: Well, do you want to stay in formal session, or do you want us to recess and come back when you call us?

DODD: Do you want to recess? We've been offered a room here. And I thank the chairman very much for that.

FRANK: We -- we -- what we'll then do is we'll be in recess subject to Senator Dodd notifying us that we're ready to reconvene.
DODD: I plan it around 3:30, I'd say. FRANK: All right.
DODD: OK.
FRANK: We are in recess until that time. (RECESS)
FRANK: The conference will reconvene.
I recognize the chair of the Senate committee. DODD: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
And it might be, since this is being carried by C-SPAN -- because the public may be wondering how this operates, having watched us mark up bills and conduct hearings, that what I enjoyed watching, of course -- and I commend you, Mr. Chairman, and -- and Senator Bachus and others -- Congressman Bachus and others for the way in which you handled the -- the offer that you made to us going back and forth and
having a good debate and discussion, accepting some and rejecting other amendments.

And now how the conference works, obviously, is you send us an offer, and we're prepared to discuss among ourselves here over the next time a counteroffer, which we will accept a number of provisions you've proposed to us, we'll offer to modify a few you've sent to us, and we'll end up rejecting a few that you sent to us, respectfully, of the House offer.

And -- and we're prepared to provide -- respond in the same order, Mr. Chairman, in which you proposed the titles, so we'll respond first to Title 4, then Title 3, then Title 5, and then 9(c), which was the rating agency, I think the last title that you -- you submitted to us.

And then obviously, among ourselves, while we had this discussion, and colleagues of mine may have amendments they offer to this counteroffer, which we'll debate and discuss, much as you did on -- on your
Page 270 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
side over the last several hours. So beginning with Title 4, to my colleagues over here, this was a matter, of course, of regulation advisers to private funds and others. And the House sent us a number of provisions under Title 4 as their offer. And as I said, a number of them here we accept; a number of them we will
reject and offer counters to them. And then -- in this particular case, there is a -- we have some alternatives that we'll propose, as well, under this title.

And let me begin by the first House provision that was offered to us would have required the registration with the SEC of commodity trading advisers, the CTAs who advise in private funds.

I'd say to my colleagues here that we've -- we've been approached by our Senate conferees from the Ag Committee, and they've asked that the initial counteroffer position on the first House item regarding registration with the SEC of commodity trading advisers is to reject this, to avoid the duplicative regulation. And we're going to accommodate them on that request.
Now, having said that, as well, we need some clarity in this. And my colleague from Rhode Island, Jack
Reed, had some thoughts on this, as well.

And, Jack, let me -- let me turn to you, because you raised some issues a moment ago that I thought would be worthwhile for us to consider.
REED: Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I think when you hear the term commodity trading adviser, you think of futures in wool and soybeans, et cetera, but the way the markets evolve, these could be highly sophisticated derivatives, synthetic derivatives based on equities or bonds, so there is, I think, a real logic to having the SEC involved.

But I hope that by incorporating hedge fund registration and private equity fund registration in the Investment Adviser Act that we will -- the SEC will, in fact, pick up many of these activities and that, as I understand it, but I still think there's -- this might be nominally accepted or rejected subject to review further in the process of the conference.

But at this point, I think the argument that if these are predominantly traditional commodities, they are well regulated by the CFTC, if they are funds that are dealing in securities derivatives or sophisticated swaps, et cetera, that that very well might be caught up in terms of the regulation, which we're proposing of the hedge funds and private equity funds.
And so I think with those cautionary words, I would support your first comments.
FRANK: And I apologize, because I was consulting with my staff. If I might ask a question, Senator, or you
-- I don't want to interrupt.
DODD: We just thought I'd probably keep to either side of this thing... FRANK: All right.
DODD: Because otherwise -- we didn't do it before, and I know Bob Corker was interested in engaging in that, and...
(CROSSTALK)
FRANK: All right. I'll just (inaudible) when it comes time for us to respond. I apologize.

DODD: The second House provision, which would require disclosure of certain private fund information to investors, prospective investors, counterparties and creditors, we respectfully reject that, as well, and let me say why.

The House offer would permit -- as we understand it -- the SEC to regulate disclosures made by private funds to their investors, counterparties, and creditors. These funds are not available to the general public, but only to those who meet the standard of, quote, "accredited investors."

These investors are sophisticated parties who understand the risks of private funds. They will not invest in or do business with funds without adequate information about investment risk.

The House offer would impose SEC regulation we believe in an area where private investors and market participants can monitor risks themselves. In addition, requiring disclosure to creditors and counterparties would raise issues of fair competition, since the hedge fund counterparties are often their own competitors.

SEC resources, of course, focus on improving disclosure to public investors, not regulate the flow of information among sophisticated financial investors. And that's the reason we would reject that.

Page 271 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Thirdly, we accept the House provision, which -- number three -- which provides a savings clause to ensure that the new registration requirements for advisers to private funds under the act does not absolve these advisers of their existing registration requirements as applicable under the Commodity Exchange Act. So
we accept those provisions you've sent to us in that offer.

FRANK: And the next area, having to do with private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, we accept the House provisions, that is, the threshold of 150 and above would be subject not just to reporting, but also registration. We exclude, as you do, as well, which is worthy of note here, the venture capital area, which I think we all agree is a different business model entirely and should not be subjected to the -- to the registration requirements. We are reporting requirements, so we have data, but they're not being subjected to the same criteria.

On number -- on number seven you sent us, you would strike and replace Senate provision defining state and federal responsibilities for investment advisers, replace with a House provision that requires investment advisers who qualify to report to the SEC. We accept that part.

On the second part of this, which is to strike and replace the Senate provisions defining state and federal responsibilities for investment advisors, replacing it with a House provision that requires investment advisors who qualify to register with their home state -- that is, less than 100 million in assets under management to register with the SEC, should their home state not perform examinations.

And with this we -- Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment, which was on the Senate floor, which I'd ask him to describe for us, because we would like to offer this with the acceptance part where this is part of the alternative.
Thank you.
REED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The biggest difference between the proposal of the House and what we would counter proposes that if a -- under the House provision, if a state is registered in five states, they could in lieu of that registration register with the SEC. We would increase the number of states to 15 -- if there's 15 states, and this is a national operation that probably requires registration under the SEC, at least giving them that option. Actually, it would be mandatory.

We -- we are consistent in that we require registration and states that have very active registration and enforcement and inspection provisions, so someone could not find a convenient state that has very lax requirements. And this is consistent with the House version, too.

So the major difference in our counter proposal would raise the threshold for SEC registration from five states to 15.
DODD: And we would -- we would include that as our counteroffer to you on that provision.

There are two more provisions in this bill that was sent to us by the House. Number eight in their list, for those following this by the list, would strike and replace the Senate provision for custodial assets replaced with a House provision that prohibits any -- an investment advisor from providing custodial services for consumer accounts. The SEC may provide an exception from this prohibition if the consumer assets are verified by an entity that has a fiduciary duty to a client.

We -- we in our counteroffer are suggesting, since the House directs the SEC to write rules governing the handling of client funds by investment advisors, this is a very important issue. The Madoff case, obviously, comes to mind immediately in this particular question.

However, in part a response to the Madoff action, the SEC has already conducted rulemaking in this area. New rules governing the custodian of client funds were adopted last December, and we think it would be appropriate to give these new rules a chance to actually work, and we direct the SEC to -- before we direct the SEC to write some new ones. The Senate bill requires investment advisors to follow the new SEC
rules, and we believe that's the best approach at this particular juncture.

And lastly was the -- that the House provision which requires the SEC to index for inflation the dollar amount measures to determine who is a qualified client for pursuing -- or rather for proposing of paying a performance fee to registered investment advisor. It also calls for rounding to the nearest $100,000 to make a determination. We accept that and agree with that provision that you sent to us.
Add those are our -- I say to my Senate colleagues those are our proposals as the counteroffer to the
House in Title 4. And I'd open up the floor now to any comments.


Page 272 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Senator Shelby?
SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have a few observations here. I know we don't have the votes, but I want to raise some.
Title 4 of the bill, I believe, not only fails to solve the problem that it purports to address, but I think it raises
a few new concerns. And driven by a concern that hedge funds pose a systemic risk, Title 4 requires hedge
fund advisors to register with the SEC.

If systemic risk is really our focus here, then why are we not assigning hedge fund oversight to regulator such as the council? Why are we not -- why are we not limiting the provision to the largest hedge fund advisors, who are the only ones that could really create systemic risk? As written now, as I understand it, the title actually works as a barrier to entry for new competitors in the hedge fund arena, which may explain why a lot of the large hedge funds back this measure.

SEC registration, as we all know, is designed for investor protection purposes and not for systemic risk. It should not come as a surprise to anyone on this conference when investors treat the SEC registration as a government seal of approval here. Fraudulent hedge fund advisors may even ask -- may even use the SEC registration as a marketing tool the way Bernie Madoff did with his SEC inspected fund, you'll recall.

I'd like to remind my colleagues about the SEC's failures that you're familiar with when it attempted to engage in potential regulation through the consolidated supervised entity program for investment bank that we will recall.

The SEC was completely unsuited to the task of supervising the five largest investment banks at that time. The collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the near collapse of Merrill Lynch almost brought down the entire financial system.

Hedge fund investors by statute must be wealthy individuals who can hire people to advise them before investing and can afford to lose the money that they invest.

This title, I believe, ensures that limited SEC resources will be spent on protecting wealthy investors. Wouldn't it make more sense to direct the FCC to focus on protecting ordinary Americans, who stand to lose their entire life savings?

This title, I believe, gives the SEC, an agency that has consistently failed to meet key responsibilities, yet another responsibility that it will not be able to meet, in my judgment. It also creates new investor protector expectations that will lead wealthy investors to conduct less due diligence.

I believe adopting the title, which I'm sure will be adopted, might make my colleagues feel better here. But I fear that all they are doing is providing a false sense of temporary comfort and saying the groundwork for a future regulatory failure and -- gosh, heaven forbid -- another taxpayer funded bailout.

I understand to staff that the Senate Democrats would not support an amendment transferring hedge fund registration to the council and limit it to the largest hedge funds. If that's not the case, I think the chairman will tell me. Thank you.
DODD: Thank you very much, Senator.
Any further comments on -- on Title -- Title 4?

(OFF-MIKE) Do you want to comment on this? Yes. (UNKNOWN): Well, Mr. Chairman, the direction of the regulation of hedge funds, private equity and VC appears to be including hedge funds and private equity, but excluding venture capital.

I recognize -- we held hearings -- that the venture capital model is different than the hedge fund model and the private equity model. But what I'm concerned about is that the opportunity, if one of these major pools
of private capital is not required to register for regulatory arbitrage, for the ability to move around, to classify or call yourself a venture capital fund and have other elements, I -- I am going to support your effort, but I just want to go on record as I think it would be better in terms of a regulatory standpoint to include all of these pools of private capital under registration.

I understand that would not happen, but I'm pleased at least that the proposal from the House will incorporate private equity as well as hedge funds.
DODD: I appreciate it, Senator, very much. Any further comments on Title 4?
Page 273 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
If not, all those in favor of Title 4, the counteroffer, say aye.
(A CHORUS OF AYES) Those oppose, nay.
(A CHORUS OF NAYS)
Ayes appear to have it. The ayes have it, and Title 4 of the counteroffer will be sent to the House.

Let me turn now to Title 3 in the order that we were presented the proposals. This Title 3 abolishes the OTS and transfers its powers, funds, personnel and property to the OCC, the FDIC and the Fed. It also includes some deposit insurance reforms and establishes the offices of minority and women inclusion.

And having reviewed the House offer, I propose that we agree to most of it with a few modifications. I would say to my Senate colleagues that only three provisions we -- we don't accept, as I would propose it to my colleagues. I'm obviously anxious to hear their comments.

We accept the first House offer on the transfer standards as written. We accept the second offer with modifications. The House would like there to be a transfer plan. We would like to modify it and give all of the regulators who are getting OTS powers a personnel -- and personnel, rather, the ability to write the plan, give more time to write that plan, and have the reports sent to the respective financial committees of the House and the Senate for us to review it so that we can have some comment and ability to respond to what as it goes forward.

The next three provisions are about deposit insurance, and then those who accept the first deposit insurance provision, which was offered. And on the fourth we have a -- a -- we change it here. This is the -- this is the -- I think this is the TAG program.
Is that correct? STAFF: Right.
DODD: And we don't support the provision in the House offer to make permanent the FDIC's guarantee of the full value of non-interest bearing transaction deposits, which are basically business accounts. You had this debate on your side. I listened to it. At some point here, this was raised.

Instead, we propose a two-year temporary extension. The temporary program that the FDIC established under its existing authority has helped maintain the confidence of small business. I think there's a value in this as we're going through the effort to get out of the economic crisis we're in, so we make the case for an extension for couple of years at least to give a chance maybe to provide some needed assistance by -- by providing certainty that their payroll or other operation accounts will be secured.

It has helped provide stability to community banks, which continue to remain under stress with the economic fallout. And particularly the community banks, while they didn't get involved in a lot of subprime problems, commercial loans were in an area where they did get involved pretty extensively and in too many cases, of course, made some bad choices in those matters.

DODD: So we're giving those community banks a chance to get back on their feet again. And this again argues for a temporary -- temporary program. However, Congress has not debated the merits of exempting in statute a whole category of deposits from the application of FDIC insurance limits. Therefore, we
propose instead to extend temporary full coverage of these accounts to 2012 in order to facilitate the economic recovery.

Senators Enzi and Johnson of our body -- you may recall my colleagues actually had an amendment to this regard. We never got to it. This in effect is the Enzi-Johnson, Johnson-Enzi amendment, which we are suggesting be a part of our -- our counteroffer.

The second -- the next provision we want to modify, if we can -- we support with one modification, making the $250 (ph) coverage limit permanent. We propose a delay in further inflation adjustments. And, again, we think here, until the $100 (ph) catches up to the $250 (ph), we shouldn't be providing for adjustments there.

And when Congress authorized such inflation adjustments in 2006, it did not anticipate that it would authorize a 150 percent increase in the limit only a couple of years later.
So those are the two suggestions there.

Now, number six on the list that came over from the House offer, this is the -- to amend the -- it amends the base tax provisions established in the office of minority, women inclusion (ph). And let me suggest we accept a lot here, but let me offer some modifications that are -- the Senate, will be a part of our counteroffer.

The -- the offer requires the director of the office to be a Senior Executive Service position. We modify the provision to account for agencies that are not under the SES system. And there are a number. So if you want to make sure you have those provisions, then you -- because a lot of them not -- don't have SES positions. So we're trying to modify it so they are -- would be included.

I think this ought to be accepted by the House, and my guess would be that the position of the director should be a career reserved position of the executive -- Senior Executive Service, as that position is defined in 31.32 (ph) of Title V U.S. Code or an equivalent designation are the language that we add, so that you wouldn't exclude some agencies.

The next revision in that particular area, the offer was to require the director to coordinate technical assistance to minority- owned and women-owned businesses who participate in agency programs and contracting. We accept this provision with a modification.

And the modification would be as follows: The language of the House proposal is the "director shall develop standards for increased participation of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the programs and contracts of the agency, including" and we add "standards for coordinating technical assistance to such businesses."

Third, the offer received from our colleagues in the House requires the assessment of the impact of the policies and regulations of each agency on minority-owned and women-owned businesses.

The House proposes the following language: "Other duties: Each director shall advise the agency administrator of the impact of policies and regulations of the agency on minority-owned and women- owned businesses." And we agree with this provision.

And lastly, the offer establishes an office of minority and women inclusion in the office of national insurance, ONI.

Our counteroffer would strike this provision. The ONI would not be an agency. It's a small office within the Treasury Department. It would have no hiring or contracting authority. And, as such, there's really no reason to have that office in the ONI in those provisions.

Let me see if that's -- I covered the TAG (ph) program. I think we covered -- is that it? Did we cover those? No?
(OFF-MIKE)

DODD: Yes, we will. OK. Let me finish up here. We have -- we have -- there are three -- we only some problems with three offers. Let me recite these to my colleagues.
FRANK: In this title is this, Senator? DODD: Still on III -- still on III.
FRANK: On the second (inaudible). OK.
DODD: Instead of striking the Senate provision exempting the OCC from the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, we make clear the OCC is subject to the requirements for open competition.

We understand the House Oversight Committee is  fine with this language. We are striking two provisions in this area. One is -- it would amend the -- the House would amend the Senate provision, protection of employees from involuntary separation, by increasing the protection included three years, extending the protection to OCC employees (inaudible).

The OCC and the FTC, which I mentioned already, are required to accept OCS employees. This transfer is supposed to occur up to 18 months after the bill is signed. The House offer would protect both OTS and OCC employees from involuntary separation. Reassignment for another three years after that. The
condition of the banking and thrift industries may change, I would argue to my colleagues, significantly after this bill is signed, and we do not know where the banks and thrifts will be located four and a half years from the date of this bill becoming law.

Nonetheless, the House offer proposes to require the OCC to keep the same number of employees and prevent these employees from being relocated for up to four and a half years after the bill becomes law. At
Page 275 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
a minimum the OCC needs to be free to relocate employees so that it can fulfill its responsibilities to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank and savings associations that it will be charged with supervising.

The House offer is also -- technically I think has a flaw in it, because it only applies these restrictions to the OCC and not to the FDIC, even though the OCC employees are also being transferred to the FDIC as well as the OCC -- just to make that point.

The last one, I'd say to my Senate colleagues, under Title III, the House offered to establish a new, quote, "mutual national bank charter option and mutual holding company structure."

Our counteroffer would reject this provision for the following reasons: The provision is basically a holdover from the administration's bill which abolished the thrift charter and required all savings associations, including mutuals, to become banks.

The administration's bill created the mutual national bank charter so that mutual savings associations could convert to national banks more easily. A mutual bank structure is not necessary anymore because the Senate bill preserves the thrift charter, which is a strong interest of the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and I agree with him on it, and therefore does not force conversions.

Companies that would like to be mutuals simply can become mutual savings associations. The proposed structure may not be -- may not be a safe and sound business model for national banks. National banks engage in commercial lending on a large scale and it could result in significant losses. The national bank structured as a mutual could have difficulty raising capital to offset these losses. And for those reasons we urge the adoption of House members of this counteroffer.

Those complete at least a draft of the counteroffer. And I'd invite my colleagues for any comments or thoughts they have on Title III.
CORKER: Is it time to offer amendments? DODD: Senator Corker?
CORKER: Mr. Chairman, I had the great benefit of listening to our House colleagues earlier. And candidly, I wish they'd go first every day. I thought it was very educational. And I heard the debate that took place over one issue where I think some members were concerned about the new office that's being set up and how that might affect credit and then also the notion of an assessment occurring and what that really meant.
And I thought to clear that up I'd offer an amendment that I hope you'll accept. On page 385 of the conference debate text...
DODD: Does everyone have a copy of this, by the way? I think I may have it. I have -- I don't know what I
did with mine. I lost it. Do we have a copy of Senator Corker's (inaudible)?
(OFF-MIKE)
DODD: Oh, well, how about passing it out on this side over here. We don't care if they (inaudible). (LAUGHTER)
We need them over here. Yes, this -- we'll get you copies of this eventually, but let my colleagues over here see it. They're the ones that have to vote on it.

CORKER: It doesn't look like to me they're looking at the same one we're looking at. Their lines are -- their lines are...
DODD: Yes, that's different one.
You're a full-service chairman here, obviously, Congressman Frank. (LAUGHTER)
(OFF-MIKE)
CORKER: You can keep the one they're passing out. We're going to use that one in just a second. DODD: There you go. Do you all have it now?
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

Page 276 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CORKER: So it seemed to me that there were issues that were being raised and those were being erased by the responses that were being given, and I enjoyed listening to those.
So on page 385 of the conference base text between lines 20 and 21, insert the following... DODD: Could we have a little order over here, please? My (inaudible).
Go ahead, Senator. CORKER: "The rule of construction, nothing in paragraph 2(c) may be construed to mandate any requirement on or otherwise affect the lending policies and practices of any regulated entity or to imply or require any specific actions based on the findings of the assessment."
DODD: (inaudible)?

CORKER: I think it -- you know, for those who were here for part of the debate, it seemed that people were answering each other's questions. It seemed this just codifies that and puts it into law, and I think clears up any misunderstandings that may have been -- I think Congresswoman Waters clearly stated what her -- what her -- what she intended to do, and I think this just clarifies that.

DODD: Well, let me say -- and, again, having been here as well and listening to the debate, and I want to begin to by, first off, commending my good friend and colleague. We've known each other a long time, Congresswoman Waters and I, and have spent a lot of years together, both here and back and forth on a number of issues.

And I want to commend her and whoever your cosponsors and colleagues were in this whole area. We're catching up with the private sector. The private sector -- almost every major corporation in this country now has offices like this. And they understood the value of this way before we have.

And, again, there have been some wonderful changes. In fact, you look at the head of the SEC today, the head of the FDIC are women.

But clearly I think it's in everyone's interest here to understand what we're trying to -- I don't think Senator -- Congresswoman Waters could have been any more clear in the discussion you had that we were privy to listen to as to what your intentions are as the author of the -- of the language here.

But I think what our colleague -- I say to my Senate colleagues -- what Bob Corker has offered here, (inaudible) you could argue may be redundant, given the language of the authors of the amendment, but I think it clears this up as to what's intended and it's a worthwhile addition to our product. And therefore I'd urge my colleagues to accept the Corker amendment.
Any further debate on the Corker amendment? If not, all those in favor say aye.
Those opposed nay.
The ayes appear to have it. And the ayes have it and the Corker amendment is adopted. Do you have another amendment?
CORKER: Yes. Again, I want to thank -- I want to thank my House colleagues. I, for what it's worth, sat here the whole time, except for one vote, and learned a great deal listening. I hope you all will go first for the rest of the time we're here, Mr. Chairman. You'll have to change the procedures.

I have another amendment. I know that in the base House bill the Board of the FDIC was set up in a certain way in the House. The Senate bill changed that. And I'd like to make the composition of the FDIC Board
like it was in the House bill as it came over.

And so, what that would do is on page 382, starting with line 23, the conference text of H.R. 4173, strike "director of consumer financial protection bureau," and insert "chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system."

CORKER: I just think that's a much better make-up of the board. And -- or other such member of the Board of Governors as the chairman of Board of Governors shall designate.
DODD: Well, let me respectfully offer the following thoughts to my colleagues on this proposal. As -- as our
-- all of us are aware, under our bill, we eliminate the Office of Thrift Supervision. Currently, the director of
the OTS serves, as all of us know, on the board of the FDIC, which leaves a vacancy on the FDIC board.



Page 277 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The bill before us fills that vacancy by making the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a member of the board. And the Corker amendment, obviously, would reverse the decision to remove the -- the -- the director of the CFPB as a fifth director.

And the reason I oppose it is a couple of reasons. First is a practical reason. By removing this and having just a four to four -- sorry, a four-member board, you end up too often with two-to-two ties on these things. So having an odd number makes it -- you always get a decision one way or the other, rather than having these sort of deadlock occurrences that can happen over and over again.

CORKER: If I could, Mr. Chairman, I -- we still would have five for my amendment. I think you may be looking at an old amendment.
DODD: I may be. Who'd you add?

CORKER: Basically, what we've done -- I think it's a five-member composition now. The House sent it over with five members. We'd be leaving it with five members and basically putting it back the way they had it.

I think what we did on the Senate side or what -- what your office may have done is -- is to put the consumer protection bureau head on the board versus the Fed, but we still have five members, so that wouldn't be an issue of...

DODD: (OFF-MIKE) all right. OK. All right. Well, anyway, we've heard concerns additionally -- let me say in addition to that concern -- I apologize then. I thought it was back to four -- about the separation of
prudential regulation from consumer regulation and the worries that that poses.

While the provisions in the bill to ensure some close cooperation, consultation, even vetoes, proposed regulations out of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there was legitimate issues raised about having a consultative and -- and (inaudible) prudential regulators where safety and soundness issues could be involved.

And so, as a member of the FDIC board, the director of the bureau would gain, I think, a much deeper understanding of the safety and soundness concerns. And it seems it would complement, rather than detract, from what has been, I think, a fairly universally held view that, to the extent you can get as close to cooperation.

One of the big arguments we faced over and over again in the debate about whether or not we even ought to have a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was that this was going to create conflicts with prudential regulation, safety and soundness regulation. Over and over again, we heard that debate.

And I -- and I admitted that there was some value to that debate. And so in our bill, we made efforts here to try and ease those concerns through the consultative process, as well as the veto process, which is unique, as far as I know, in all of federal regulation, but we actually give another group the power to veto a
regulation of an existing board.

So it seems to me by having the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director as a part of -- of this FDIC board, you at least begin to ease some of the stated concerns. As an FDIC board member, the director would gain (inaudible) important window to bank operations, more thorough understanding of prudential regulatory process, and (inaudible) I think further to improve consumer regulation.

Secondly, the FDIC is the primary regulator for small banks and with responsibility for the supervision of over 5,000 banks under our proposals. And for those institutions, the FDIC will be the primary enforcement agency for consumer compliance. Keeping the CFPB on the board, I think, ensures better coordination and better enforcement between these agencies, given the fact that they're now responsible in that area.

And, thirdly and finally, having the director on the FDIC board would help ensure that supervisory guidance put out by the FDIC and the consumer financial protection board are consistent so that large and small banks are treated in a consistent and appropriate manner. There's legitimate issues being raised about whether or not you can have different levels here applying. By having someone involved with the FDIC, it seems to me with the smaller banks you eliminate that concern about a disparate or uneven application of these rules.
And so I appreciate the proposal, but I would urge my colleagues to reject it. Senator Shelby?
SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, I'll be brief here, but I want to take a minute and commend my colleague from
Tennessee for his persistence in this area.


Page 278 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A lot of us, including the senator from Tennessee, have great problems with basically ignoring the idea that safety and soundness is the number-one issue, should be, although there are other many issues involved
in the running of a financial institution.

What -- there are about -- I understand from the FDIC people that there are about 750 banks right now on the watch list or the problem list. My goodness. You know, we're all consumers. And we're all interested in consumer, and so is the FDIC. The FDIC basically, as it stands, they were the original consumer agency, you know, with the -- with the money to protect their money.

But I think what the senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker, is doing here makes a lot of sense and will go a long way to make sure that, in the future, that we're dealing with the safety and soundness, number one, of our financial institutions. Without safety and soundness, there are no -- there are no -- no institutions left, no confidence in them. So I commend you. Thank you.

DODD: Well, I thank my colleague. I'd just say -- and, again, I'll turn to my other colleagues for any comments -- we were being told over and over again over the last number of years that our financial institutions were safe and sound, because they were making money. That was usually the definition of safety and soundness. Were they profitable? And clearly, there's no question about being profitable.

But underneath all of that, we saw there was a tremendous amount of erosion of consumer issues. In fact, we listened to our House colleagues talk today, as we have discussed at great length -- in fact, Bob Corker has been one of the leading advocates, of course, of doing more, and I agree with him on this, on the underwriting standards and so forth that contributed initially to the problems we're facing today.

It was the failure to keep an eye on what was happening to the average consumer on all of this. So safety and soundness, I agree with Richard Shelby. He's right. It's a critically important area.

But one way to guarantee you have safety and soundness is not just on the profitability of institutions, but whether or not the people who access and use these products, whether depositing a paycheck, buying a stock, purchasing an insurance policy, or -- or -- or a mortgage on a home, needs to have some
assurances and guarantees that they're not going to be abused and taken advantage of, which we painfully learned caused, of course, the collapse in the crisis we're presently living with.

So I think this is a good marriage here, because you are doing the prudential regulation, but you're involving that consumer advocate, as well, in those decisions.
Anyway, on that point, anybody else want to be heard on this matter? CORKER: Mr. Chairman, if I could?
DODD: Yes, Bob?

CORKER: First of all, I appreciate your comments. And I appreciate the time all of us have spent on this -- on issues regarding consumer protection and certainly these board make-ups.

I will say that the -- the argument that was made regarding having a consumer protection person on the FDIC board is exactly the argument I've been trying to make with having prudential regulators on the board of the consumer protection agency, which there is no board. On the consumer protection agency, the way it's being construed per the bill today, there is no board. There is no check and balance that is real per the standard that is in place.

So I really appreciated the argument you put forth and would love for us to -- to have that same exact discussion when the consumer protection title comes up, because you're arguing my case for me, the same case I've been arguing now for about 90 days.

Let me ask you this. If we want coordination, would it make sense to let the Fed be the voting member and allow another board member, the consumer protection head, to sit on the board, and therefore, they'd be coordinating, but they would not be involved in the safety and soundness issues that the FDIC will be looking at?

DODD: Well, let me suggest to you here -- and, again, the chairman of the House committee and I have both suggested we're going to deal with title by title on this. It doesn't prohibit us coming back to a provision. And rather than trying just engaging in the conversation (inaudible) I'd prefer to vote on this, but
I'd leave the record open, in terms of our ability to come back and consider something you might write up in that area, OK?
CORKER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
DODD: You want a recorded vote on this, Bob?
Page 279 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CORKER: No.
DODD: All those in favor of the Corker amendment, say aye. Those opposed, nay. The noes appear to have it. The noes have it. The amendment is defeated.
Any further amendments on Title 4 -- 3, excuse me, of the bill? We'll go to Title 5 then.

Well, let me -- I apologize. Let me -- let me ask my colleagues here. We're now to vote on -- on the counteroffer to Title 3. All those in favor of the counteroffer to Title 3 as amended by the Corker amendment will say aye.
Those opposed, no.
The ayes appear to have it, and the offer -- counteroffer is agreed to.
Let me ask -- I'll turn my colleagues' attention now to Title 5. And this is the -- this establishes the Office of
National Insurance.

Let me say to my colleagues, the House and Senate provisions are pretty close in Title 5, which would establish an Office of National Insurance within the Treasury Department to monitor and coordinate issues
-- insurance issues at the federal level.

DODD: Having reviewed the House offer, I propose the following counteroffer, one, that we agree with most of what the House offer has sent to us. And in the spirit of a bicameral cooperation, I think one of the things we can certainly agree to change is the name of the office from the Office of National Insurance in the Senate bill to the Federal Insurance Office in the House bill.

I say that to my good friend from Pennsylvania, who made that suggestion, and we'll accept that offer, and congratulate Chairman Kanjorski for his proposal in that area.

And the areas that I would propose the Senate accept is a great majority that's in the House offer. There are a couple of provisions that I do believe -- or do not believe, rather -- we can accept, and let me just describe them. And again, I don't want to (inaudible) the fact that we're focusing until we disagree with there's any indication of the fact that we're agreeing with most of what you've sent over to us.

And the two areas, one is the office, the judicial review of administrative findings of the Federal Insurance Office are -- FIO I guess is how you pronounce that -- we believe should be the standard APA review. The second proposal that we don't accept is the definition of the international insurance agreements on prudential measures. And the Senate bill should be the one used for FIO instead of the House definition of covered agreements.

And other than that, we accept all of the changes that you've said to us: require the Treasury and USTR to jointly negotiate international insurance agreements; requiring Treasury and USTR to consult with Congress before initiating negotiations; requiring that the agreement lay over in Congress for 90 days before it can enter force; clarifying that FIO must collect information, first from regulators or publicly available sources, if available, before collecting from the industry; adding a study on U.S. and global reinsurance markets; requiring Treasury to coordinate with the secretary of Health and Human Services in determining which lines of insurance are health insurance, and therefore excluded from FIO authority. We believe this is a counter offer, if (ph) it's a good faith effort to reach agreement.

Let me mention why the two areas we disagree with, and I'll be brief on this, the first one dealing with the de novo judicial review. In the Senate counter offer, we don't accept a House provision requiring de novo court review of the O&I (ph) director's determination that a state insurance measure is inconsistent with international insurance agreements. This de novo court review changes the Administrative Procedures Act under which deference is given to agency action in any judicial review. Instead, the House provision -- instead of this, the House provision -- and what's in the House provision, we're proposing that the standard judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act ought to apply.

Also, this House provision confuses trade agreements with prudential agreements. It is clear in the Senate bill that O&I (ph) is not to deal with any trade agreements, only prudential agreements on insurance regulations. And de novo review is not applicable of such regulatory agreements that are not trade agreements.

Secondly, under the House definition of covered agreements, in addition, we're not accepting the House definition of covered agreement, which is essentially limited to mutual recognition agreements. This is a highly technical issue, but our understanding is that a recognition agreement will not allow the O&I (ph) to


Page 280 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
deal with issues such as those arising from the state requirement that non- U.S. reinsurance companies post 100 percent collateral.

The European Union is in the process of revamping its insurance regulations under what is known as the Solvency II Directive. To continue to operate in the  European Union, U.S. insurance companies will need the European Union to recognize the U.S. insurance regulatory system under Solvency II. However, my understanding is that addressing the reinsurance collateral issue in the U.S. is linked to the E.U.'s recognition of the U.S. insurance regulatory system. The House definition of covered agreements therefore casts into doubt whether we should reach -- whether we could reach, rather -- an agreement with the European Union.

Sorry about the technicality of all of that, but it's a very important provision, and one that could be very harmful to our interests.

But with those two differences, other than that, we accept the House language in this area, including the change of the title that Chairman Kanjorski has recommended.
Are there any further comments, additions to Title 5?
If not, all those in favor of Title 5 counter offer will say "aye." (UNKNOWN MEMBERS): Aye.
DODD: Those opposed, "nay."

The "ayes" appear to have it, and the ayes have it, and we submit the counter offer to our friends and colleagues on the House side.
The last provision for us to consider is subsection C of Title 9.

Mr. Chairman, I'm going to say to my colleagues, we're going to take about a five- or 10-minute break here. We're drafting. And this is a -- I want to underscore something that I heard Chairman Kanjorski say, and I think others did as well. I think I heard Mel Watt talk about this and others.
Like our House members, we wrestled with this rating agency area. This is a -- the more you know, the
more complicated it got in terms of how to deal with it. And, you know, our colleague in the Senate, Senator
Al Franken, offered an amendment that was adopted pretty overwhelmingly in the Senate. I voted against
it, as did several of us here on this conference committee, but despite our objections to it was agreed to.

And I would say, I know the House basically sent us a study in this area, and it was -- personally, I kind of like the idea of the study, given the complexity of how do you deal with conflicts of interest. And they are significant. How do you answer anyone who raises the question, how is it that you get to pick your own rating agency when you don't do any due diligence and just rely on the data and information given to you
by the very company that's hired you to give them a rating? I mean, just saying it alone, it screams out for a resolution of something other than that.

Senator Franken raised a very interesting idea on how to do this. And my concern with it is, I don't know how you work it. It's complicated. But I want to, in fairness to him, say that it was well -- he spent a lot of time working on this, brought in a lot of people. It was a bipartisan amendment, supported by Democrats and Republicans -- this wasn't a partisan vote at all -- in our Senate floor debate.

But I think there are difficulties in implementing his idea. But I think his idea is worthy of consideration. And so, what we're drafting -- to give you some idea, we don't have the language for you yet for my colleagues to consider -- is accept the notion of the study, but also to go forward and put language of "shall," that the
regulator come up with some answers on conflicts of interest in this area, and giving a priority consideration to what Al Franken has proposed as one way of dealing with this.

This way, it takes the Franken idea, which has, I think, some merit. It needs some work, but you're not rejecting it altogether. It takes the House idea of looking at this, which clearly is warranted, because none (ph) of (ph) us (ph) have really figured this out yet. But clearly, it says you shall deal with this conflict of interest.

So, it seems to me it touches on all three of the areas that all of us have a common interest in in dealing with the rating agencies. But as yet, I don't have some specific language to offer to you in this area.
Senator Schumer?

SCHUMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As somebody who supported the Franken amendment, let me just say this. First, Senator Reed, yourself, did very good work on credit rating agencies, and a lot of
Page 281 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
safeguards are in place that weren't in place before. We know that credit rating agencies were one of the major tripping points of our financial system. When a company gives a AAA rating to $300 million of no-doc loans, something's wrong. No-doc loans means they say to you, "Do you want a mortgage?"
"Yes."
"Good, you have it."

They don't ask you your income. They don't ask you your debts or anything else. It was based on the theory that housing prices would always go up, so if they had to reclaim the house, they'd get it for more than they sold it for. But something was wrong,  dramatically wrong in the credit rating agency world.

And the safeguards that have been put in place, I think in both the House and Senate bills, are pretty good. The problem is -- at least to my way of thinking, and I know to Senator Franken's, because we worked together on this amendment -- is it doesn't get at the core of the conflict of interest. We have conflicts of interest in other areas. You pay your accountant to audit you. That led to a lot of problems during the Enron situation. And now you're paying a credit rating agency to rate how good your product is.

And so, the thought in the Franken amendment is to have some independent, non-conflicted verification. It's a good thought. It makes a great deal of sense.
As you said, Mr. Chairman, the trouble is in implementing it. Some people have talked about let the
investor pay. The problem with that is, who's going to pay, at what point? And do you make it public? And if
you don't make it public, you've got 28 people, so that didn't work.
So, Franken's idea in the amendment that passed in the Senate said, let's have an auditor -- rather, a rater
-- selected not by the issuer, give an independent rating. Now, he does it every time. He has this
commission choose a different rater every time.

I had an amendment similar. I deferred to him saying, do it at one out of every 10 times, or do it one out of every 20 times to keep them honest. They wouldn't know which time it would be, so the credit rating agency would say, OK, there's 10 percent or 5 percent chance someone's going to be looking over my shoulder
and doing an independent rating. I'd better not let the conflict of interest overwhelm me.

We do have lots of documentation in all the newspapers and stuff that these credit rating agencies were swayed at times by their issuer -- issue new ratings, and stuff like that.

So, I would hope that, along the lines of what you said, Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues in the House might come to accept, some way of ensuring that there'll be at some points in time an independent assessor. Now, I know the problems with it. I've talked this over with Senator Reed, who's studied it longer than I have, in terms of who picks them, what's the price, all these kinds of things. But those seem to me to be level B considerations. Getting independent assessment is level A.

FRANK: Senator, we're going to have to vote. We're ready to give you answers on almost everything. So, at some point if we could do that and get to the vote, we could return to...
DODD: (inaudible) heard on this thing...

REED: I just -- a few quick points. I think the chairman said it very well. The more you know about the problem, the more you want to know about how credit rating agencies operate. One, the legislation reports, both bills have improvements, significant improvements, in internal controls, conflict of interest.

There is language to controlling conflict (ph) of (ph) interest; establish an office of credit ratings within the SEC, so there's a focal (ph) point now for activities of regulation; emphasis on transparency through the individual ratings disclosing what information they're relying on; and cumulatively looking at the record of rating agencies to see how well they're doing, actually sort of scoring them, if you will; boards of directors will be (ph) reformed (ph) for better oversight, independence; enhanced emphasis on training and the experience of NSRO personnel; adoption of consistent rating symbols.

REED: And also, I think I want to emphasize reforming the legal standards for liability and pleading, which could be a critical role in regulating their behavior.

But still, we're still left with the Franken proposal, which is, you know, do we have an independent regulatory organization that will hand out the ratings?

And we are -- obviously we -- it has merits, but we're concerned about implementing it without study and what form will it be implemented at the end of the study. And like the chairman, we're still looking for I think a credible and reasonable response to the proposal.

Page 282 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DODD (?): Mr. Chairman, let me suggest -- we don't have language for you on 9(c), and Senator Shelby has -- he can do it now -- well, we can do it either way.
FRANK: The vote is pending. We're going to give you some answers.

DODD: Let me let Senator Shelby offer an amendment to 9(c) that he wants to offer. At the conclusion of that, we may have the language. If we do, we'll consider it. If not, what I suggest to House colleagues is since you're ready to offer us your responses to our counteroffers on three, four and five, we can deal with that and come back to 9(c) which may be ready for by the time we complete that.
So Senator Shelby, you are recognized. SHELBY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will offer the amendment -- if it hasn't been stripped, it will be. I offer an amendment here to eliminate the over-reliance on credit ratings that we're talking about by removing references to credit ratings in federal law.

Mr. Chairman, Senator LeMieux and Senator Cantwell, as you will recall, amended the Senate bill to eliminate statutory references to credit ratings and to apply new standards of credit worthiness. Senator Cantwell said, and I will quote her, "Over-reliance on credit rating agencies significantly contributed to the
2008 financial crisis as we all know."

Senator LeMieux said on the floor of the Senate, "The damage in the financial markets was due in large part because of our reliance on these rating agencies."

I could not agree more. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, which I sponsored, was an attempt to stop investors from relying blindly on a few large credit rating agencies and to foster competition among credit rating agencies. Unfortunately, that act came too late to stop the devastating effects of over-reliance on credit rating agencies by investors and regulators that underlay the financial crisis of 2008.

I believe we need to take a strong stand against future over- reliance on credit rating agencies. Investors and regulators must own up to their responsibilities to conduct their own due diligence. Prohibiting
ratings-based statutes and regulations ultimately is the only way to achieve that.

Mr. Chairman, the LeMieux-Cantwell amendment passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support, showing that there is a strong bipartisan support in the Senate and I'm sure in the House to eliminate over-reliance on credit ratings.

The amendment that I offer today is completely consistent with the intent of the LeMieux-Cantwell amendment, but it makes a complete break with the culture of over-reliance. My amendment, again, would allow regulators and investors two years -- two years, Mr. Chairman -- in which to wean themselves off of credit ratings. After that, statutes and regulations would be precluded from requiring reliance on ratings by NRSROs, and unlike the LeMieux-Cantwell approach, regulators would not be directed to define new standards of credit worthiness. Investors would be expected to identify and to defend to their regulators their own standards of credit-worthiness.

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would hope we would adopt my amendment today to stop rewarding investors for relying on the credit rating agencies that have been so flawed, that all of us acknowledge have done such a bad job over the past several years.

FRANK: The conference is in recess. The House has three minutes left to vote. I'm sorry, but we're going to vote and come back. We'll come back.

DODD: We'll try to finish up our side over here on (inaudible). Just call us, and we'll be right back here for you.
FRANK: Let me propose that we begin tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. with our responses to you. Take 15 minutes, unless members want to come back here at...
DODD: All right. I was hoping we could finish up. I would just like... FRANK: All right. We've got to go vote. We'll try and come back. DODD: Vote and then come on back. We'll finish up.
(CROSSTALK)


Page 283 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DODD: We have a vote at 5:30.
We'll meet you back here at 6:00.
Let's finish up here on these -- on ours.
All right, Jack. You wanted to be hear on Senator Shelby's amendment? REED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We are in the process of making fundamental changes in the law, but we'll be I think less effective in changing some of the dynamics of the marketplace. I think it's important to recognize that these -- the three or four major rating organizations existed before federal recognition of the national recognized statistical rating organization.

Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch were in existence long before there was a federal sanction of their activities. They existed because the marketplace needed information on an efficient basis. They had a comparative advantage to look at sophisticated investments, make judgments about them, and inform the marketplace. So whether we strike their reference from federal statutes, they're still going to be part of the marketplace. I think that this -- the amendment goes much too far, though, because essentially it would deny many different investors who don't have the expertise or the resources to conduct exhaustive investigations to look at these credit ratings and make a judgment.

And in fact, the language in the amendment suggested that even through an interpretation, a federal agency couldn't suggest that this is one way to look at an investment. I think that goes much, much too far. The reality also is that the real problem we've had over the last several years has not been with some of
the traditional evaluations of corporate bonds, but structured products, very sophisticated products designed by investment banks in cooperation with -- someone might even say in collusion with -- credit rating agencies. But that is in a sense not representative of some of the traditional ratings of corporate bonds, of other instruments that have had fairly good records in terms of the reliability of the ratings.

This would prevent all of those ratings from being used by effective -- or by investors. And I think we have to recognize that, you know, there are many federal, state, local enterprises that have to rely upon some type of outside advice. I think the approach we've taken in the bill is a much more effective approach than this categorical removal of every reference to a credit rating agency in federal statutes.

So I would urge that we continue to press forward with respect to the provisions in the bill we have, together with I think serious consideration of the proposal Senator Franken had. And again, I will emphasize the legislation before us takes serious steps with respect to the internal controls, conflicts of interest, et cetera.

And I would also add one more time that the reform pleading standards and the liability standards will give investors for the first time a credible judicial way to question the performance of credit rating agencies. I think this will go to -- not totally -- but a long way in balancing their interests and pleasing the issuer who pays them versus their interest in providing credible ratings for the investing public.

DODD: Let me just say before I ask for a vote on this or any further comment, I wish there was some way I could write into this proposal here that we accept what Senator Shelby's driving at, but yet not leave this sort of in a freefall. That's my nervousness about this.

Because I think his point is, here we have a handful of these that get sort of a sanction, and yet we all know the inherent problems that exist as well, which just have really driven us to distraction trying to figure out how to -- how to solve the issue.

Again, you have smaller -- larger corporations can obviously come to a lot of these conclusions themselves. They have the capacity, the wealth, the personnel to make their own conclusions about whether or not certain products are worthy of a AAA or AA or whatever. It's the smaller public corporations, the smaller public entities and so forth that make investments that don't have that capacity in terms of where do they go to.

And I don't like where we're telling them they have to go to, but I don't have an alternative for them. And so I'm torn in that sense about all of this in a way. So given the fact that I'm given a choice here between trying to do something to modify this in a way that'll allow it to work or just getting rid of them altogether, my temptation is to do that. I got to be honest with you. But I'm not comfortable with it.
My colleague from Alabama?
SHELBY: I'll be brief, Senator Dodd. We've talked about this a long time and worked on it a long time.

Page 284 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But what we're basically doing is by statute we're telling the smaller entities that they can invest in these, they should invest in a sense, we sanction them, and then they're doing so at their peril because look at the record of the rating agencies.
Senator Schumer alluded to that earlier. Senator Reed's done a lot of work in this area.

And what our amendment would do would give us two years, and then people would be -- there's nothing like due diligence. I'd like -- I'd like a roll call vote.
(CROSSTALK)

CORKER: Mr. Chairman, if I could just -- first of all, I respect very much the work that Jack Reed has done in this area. He's one of the most diligent members of our committee. But I don't see anything in the Shelby amendment that in any way would preclude anybody in the world from using rating agencies. All it does is write them out of the code.

So the statement that people that might want to rely upon these couldn't do it is just -- I'm not saying that, and I wondered if Senator Reed might tell me where he says that in this language.
(CROSSTALK)

REED: I am -- if you'll yield to me -- I am looking at item 2, which says, "... no federal agency may by rule, regulation, form, interpretive guidance or any other means require..." I think that's not far from if, in fact, an agency published a ruling or regulation that said you could rely upon, among other things, a credit rating agency, could you challenge that interpretive guidance or anything else as essentially requiring or suggesting that credit rating should be relied upon. And I think it raises a great deal, I think, of uncertainty as to what the intent is of the amendment.
SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, could I... DODD: Senator Shelby?
SHELBY: Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Senator Corker bringing this up, and he's absolutely right, in my judgment. You can read the language yourself. It says, "Nothing in federal law" -- in this proposed amendment -- "shall require" -- shall require -- "the use of a crediting rating issued by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by any person, federal (inaudible) state, and no federal agency may by rule, regulation, form, interpretive guidance or any other means require any person, federal agency or state or local government to use a credit rating." It doesn't mean they won't or couldn't, but it doesn't require it. Senator Corker's absolutely right.

REED: Well, I just want to be clear then. So if the FDIC or the OCC said, "You may rely upon -- you may, you're not required. You may rely upon a rating by a credit rating agency. It fulfills all your fiduciary duties. It fills all your regulatory responsibilities under federal law," you would think that would be appropriate under this language?

SHELBY: No, I don't. I think that's the problem today. If you say they may, they're going to jump into it and think they're covered, whereas what we're interested in is due diligence, and rating agencies that -- that are worthy of their name.

REED: But -- so that -- what you're saying is, that the federal agencies -- you may not rely upon a credit rating of any way, shape or form. You have to conduct individual due diligence?
SHELBY: Absolutely. That's what we're getting at.
REED: So you're asking -- you're asking -- you're asking that the treasurer... SHELBY: No, now, wait a minute. We're talking about due diligence. (CROSSTALK)
REED: ... of Springfield, Massachusetts, to conduct individual due diligence on a sophisticated investment product sold by Wall Street? CRAPO (?): I think we may be misunderstanding each other. Senator Shelby, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not saying that any agency can prohibit someone from relying on a credit agency. You're saying they can't require it. And I thought that maybe the two of you were...
(CROSSTALK)




Page 285 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
REED: No, I'm trying to understand. So -- so an agency could say, to fulfill your responsibilities under federal law, you may rely upon -- you don't have to, but you may rely upon, fully rely upon a credit rating issued by a national rating organization?

CRAPO (?): Well, I'll leave that to the drafter of the legislation, but it seems to me that any agency rule that simply made it optional for someone to rely on it if they chose to would not be in conflict with this language.

REED: Well, understanding that, then I think effectively what you're doing is removing the references, but not removing credit rating agencies from effectively rating many different issuances, but also of local communities, treasurers, agencies rely upon.

CRAPO (?): I think that that is correct. I don't want to speak for Senator Shelby, but my understanding is that the senator's amendment does not eliminate credit rating agencies from operation or from being relied upon by investors or anyone. It simply stops their monopoly and stops the government from requiring that they have to be brought into the process.
REED: Well, one... (CROSSTALK)
REED: I think that's an important clarification, because I think the initial impression that I certainly got -- and
I know others might be -- that these ratings could no longer be used by investors under federal law...
CRAPO (?): Well, if we need to make that... REED: ... but you're making clear that they can?
CRAPO (?): ... correct here in the record that we're creating, I think that we could so state.

DODD: All right. The clerk will -- Senator Shelby has asked for a roll call vote on the Shelby amendment. The clerk will call the roll.
CLERK: Chairman Dodd? DODD: No.
CLERK: Chairman Dodd votes no. Mr. Johnson?
JOHNSON: No.
CLERK: Mr. Johnson votes no. Mr. Reed?
REED: No.
CLERK: Mr. Reed votes no. Mr. Schumer?
SCHUMER: No. CLERK: Mr. Schumer votes no. Mr. Shelby?
SHELBY: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Shelby votes aye. Mr. Crapo?
CRAPO: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Crapo votes aye. Mr. Corker?
CORKER: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Corker votes aye.
Page 286 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr. Gregg?
GREGG: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Gregg votes aye.
DODD: What about Senator Leahy and Senator Harkin? (UNKNOWN): And Lincoln?
DODD: And Lincoln?
CLERK: I'll call the roll for them.
DODD: Yes, they're all roll conferees in all matters here, yes. CLERK: Very good. I'll go back. Excuse me.
Ms. Lincoln?
DODD: No by proxy. CLERK: No by proxy. Mr. Leahy?
DODD: No by proxy. CLERK: No by proxy. Mr. Harkin?
DODD: No by proxy.
And you have Senator...
CLERK: Mr. Chambliss? SHELBY: Senator Chambliss votes aye by proxy. CLERK: Aye by proxy, Mr. Chambliss.
So the vote would be five aye, seven nay. The measure does not pass. DODD: What's the final tally?
CLERK: Five yes, seven no.
DODD: OK. I've now -- we've got some language to offer to finish up Title 5 -- Title 9, excuse me. So let me
-- let me try and -- and then we'll be done with this, and then we can wait and see if the House wants to
come back and make their...
(UNKNOWN): They're coming back at 6:00.

DODD: Well, we may not be back here by 6:00, because we're going to start voting at 5:30, and I'm told that three votes. So it may be a little later than -- than six.
(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)
DODD: Let me suspend for one second.

All right, let me -- let me finish up with -- with Title 9, subsection C, on these matters, and then we'll open it up for any debate or further amendment. But this is dealing with the improvements to regulation of credit rating agencies.

In addition to this debate, the -- the House has a provision in their offered to us that strikes reference to furnish or replace with file, the words file, in existing statute information that is, quote, "furnished to the SEC as subject to a lower standard of accuracy and liability than information that is filed with the SEC." We accept that -- that change.

The House provision adds language concerning conflicts of interest. Provisions include an explicit prohibition of an NRSRO advising the issue and rating that issuer's -- and that issuer's securities, a
look-back requirement at the ratings of an analyst that switches jobs, and public notification of a job change by an analyst.

Page 287 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This is -- our counteroffer, we have a sense of the Senate that the SEC should use its authority in Title
15(e) of the exchange act to prohibit -- quote, "to prohibit or require the management and disclosure of any
conflicts of interest relating to the issuance of credit ratings by a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, including, without limitation, conflicts of interest relating to the provision of consulting,
advisory, or other services by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or any person
associated with such nationally recognized statistical rating organization or to the obligor of any or any
affiliate of the obligor."
Both in terms of, as I understand this vote, on 2(b), the look- back, and 2(c), the SEC, we accept those. The third provision they have sent to us, which we reject -- and I'll make a counteroffer, they -- they asked
us to replace the Senate provision for state of the mind in private actions of, quote, "knowing and reckless."
We replace the House provision that states a gross negligence requirement for cases brought against an
NRSRO in violating the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, and that standard is to be applied to the
NRSROs in the same manner as is applied to other defendants in the same lawsuits under the securities
laws.

Statements made by NRSROs shall not be deemed forward-looking statements. An investor in a rated security can recover damages if the process determining ratings is deemed grossly negligent and a substantial factor in the economic loss of the investor.

We reject their language. And in this provision, this one is -- the liability standard to allow private suits against credit rating agencies who fairly conduct reasonable investigations of the facts that ratings are based -- are based on. We prefer the language in the Senate bill. It's carefully crafted by Senator Reed, which may speak to it.
Jack, do you want to be heard on this? REED: (OFF-MIKE)
DODD: This was on the -- on the -- the standards, pleading standards.

REED: The pleading standards that incorporated in the Senate bill was a reckless pleading standard. The House proposed a gross negligent standard. We believe that the Senate standard is a higher -- is a more appropriate standard for the conduct of these types of activities and would urge that that be accepted.
DODD: All right. I ask my colleagues to consider that.

The Franken debate we had a few minutes ago -- and this is what we've suggested and ask you to take a look at this -- the Franken amendment in the Senate bill seeks, as you've heard, to address a central problem in credit ratings. The issuer of the security gets to pick which rating agency will rate the securities and intends to sell to the public, which means that securities issuers can stop for the rating agency -- can shop, rather, for the rating agency that will give the highest rating, again, the obvious conflict.

The Franken amendment addresses this basic conflict of interest by creating an independent board under the SEC's oversight to assign rating assignments for structured financial -- finance products, the complex asset-backed securities that were at the heart of the crisis.

The House offer would replace this provision with a study. I understand the thinking behind this study, as I said earlier, there are complex issues of implementation, many uncertainties. However, I do not think (ph) a study really addresses the problem in a substantial way.
I would also note that the base text already includes a study of how credit rating agencies get paid, so the
House offer does not substantially to this.
And I propose a compromise. Under the Senate counteroffer, the SEC would conduct a study of the fee
and payment issues, as the House has proposed, but at the end of the study, the SEC will have authority to
put in place a mechanism to prevent the issuer of an asset-backed security or structured finance instrument
from selecting the credit rating agency that would provide rating.

By giving the SEC time to consider the alternative approaches to the problem, we will not risk setting up an unworkable system. At the same time, we'll move forward towards meaningful action to address this basic problem in the credit rating system.
I believe the Senate counteroffer combines the best features of the -- of the House... (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)
DODD: That's number four, yes.
Page 288 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCHUMER: (OFF-MIKE) question?
DODD: Certainly.

SCHUMER: In the counteroffer, you don't say how long it would take for the study to go before there's implementation.
DODD: I think it's two years.
SCHUMER: I thought it was going to be two years, yes, but it doesn't say that. DODD: Is that correct?
SCHUMER: It doesn't say that here. DODD: We'll make it two years. SCHUMER: OK.
DODD: I believe it (inaudible) was.

Number five, because we've already touched number four -- that's the language -- number five on the list here is -- it would -- this is House eliminates the credit rating agency exemption from the fair disclosure rule when working with issuers. We reject that.

The House offer would end the exemption for credit rating agencies from Reg FD -- that is the fair disclosure -- which requires companies to make financial disclosures to all investors at the same time. This would prevent rating agencies from having access to private information about the firms they rate. In other words, ratings would be based on less information that would therefore be less reliable.
I think our language is stronger language.
SCHUMER: Mr. Chairman, I support that, but just one other point on number four here. I think the word
"for" in line three of the counteroffer should be "from."
DODD: I'm sure you're right. What is that, on four?
SCHUMER: I guess so. Yes, or underwriters (ph) from selecting. I don't know if you mean for or from. I
don't quite get it.
(CROSSTALK)
DODD: What did you say? Where is it again?

SCHUMER: This is the counteroffer. It says, "The issuer, sponsor, or underwriter of the structured finance product for selecting the NRSRO," and...
DODD: Yes.
SCHUMER: You mean from? DODD: That's correct. SCHUMER: From?
DODD: From. SCHUMER: Great, OK. DODD: Apologize.
SCHUMER: Please don't apologize.

DODD: The last number six, this one provides the House for review of the reliance on ratings and the rules and regulations of the covered agencies, mandates a modification of their rules and regulations within one year.

DODD: The provision also includes a GAO study of other federal agencies' reliance on ratings and recommendations to reduce the use of ratings in rule and regulation.
We replaced the House offer with -- is this correct here? Is the the number seven?
Page 289 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(OFF-MIKE)
That's the original House bill?
So we go back to -- our counter-offer consists of the -- of Section 6.010 of the original House bill. That's
Section A in the modified GAO study.

And number seven is to add -- the House wants to eliminate the NRSRO exemption from expert liability under Section 11 of the securities laws. We suggest, on that one, a change -- as I said, the House would repeal SEC rule 436G, which exempts credit rating agencies from expert liability. It applies to underwriters and accountants in connection with securities offering that contains false or incomplete financial information for investors.

We appreciate the intent of increasing accountability for rating agencies, but the provision would not help investors, in our view. Rating agencies do not prepare securities offering documents, but ratings are often included in those documents to provide information to investors.

If credit rating agencies were held liable for the accuracy of offering statements and prospectuses that they have not prepared, they would simply not permit ratings to be included in those documents. And that would
-- that would result in less information for investors, which seems to be counter to what we're trying to achieve.
Those are our counter offers under Title 9.C. Any comments or thoughts on those? GREGG: Yes.
DODD: Judd?

GREGG: If we vote on these, I'd like to divide the question so that I can be reported as voting against the proposal...
DODD: On which one? GREGG: (Inaudible.) I support the House position. DODD: OK. We can do that.
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman?

On the item -- I believe it's item number six -- which refers to an amendment that Mr. Garrett had amended on the House side, this gets back to the same issue that we just talked about with regard to Senator Shelby's previous amendment.

I just want to raise the question again. This is -- the House side has already acknowledged this, that what we're doing is creating, by federal regulation, rules that essentially make credit agencies a monopoly.

And all that this -- all that we're trying to do, in all that the House amendment that we are now rejecting -- and I'll have to oppose that -- is trying to do is to follow the lead of the SEC.

The SEC, as I understand it, has already begun removing a number of their references to credit agencies in trying to move toward a standard of creditworthiness rather than creating a monopoly system here. And if
we reject that, then we once again are going back to the very -- one of the very cores of the problem, and that is setting up the credit rating agencies as the -- as basically the federal legal standard by which people can seek to achieve justification for their offerings.

And it just seems to me that we should accept this House amendment. It's not the same as the Shelby amendment. I thought the Shelby amendment was actually better. But I think this amendment at least should be accepted, because what it does is extend this trend that the SEC has already started to all federal agencies, and not just apply the standard to financial agencies that are already moving down that road.
(UNKNOWN): Well, Mr. Chairman, one, this is a trade-off between having reliable, easily accessible
ratings, which in many contexts -- corporate bond issuances -- can be relied upon and are relied upon on a
daily basis by big companies, small companies, local communities, investment funds, retirement funds, et
cetera.
And there is -- I think, over time, there's been a utility and efficiency of having these ratings available.

The issue of monopoly -- I think my reading of the history is that these major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, et al., were dominant before the NSRO designation -- NRSRO designation, rather.


Page 290 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So I don't know if you can (inaudible) cause and effect between the -- the recognition of these agencies
and the -- in statute -- and their dominance. I think they'll -- I think most people recognize, and the colloquy
between Senator Shelby and I and Senator Crapo, that, if we make these changes, they'll still be important
players; they'll still be providing...
(UNKNOWN): Let me suggest...

(UNKNOWN): In fact, their ratings will be recognized. Going to the point about the Garrett amendment, just a final point, is that the House -- and I think we are moving toward a very significant study of all the uses, not just in laws subject to our jurisdiction but pension funds, ERISA funds, et cetera, where there are references to rating agencies or to ratings.

I think that study has to be undertaken. And based on that study, I think we can make more positive recommendations as to how we reduce reliance, at least explicit reliance on these rating...
(CROSSTALK)

DODD: Let me make a suggestion on this. And I appreciate Mike Crapo's comments about this, and I went back and forth in our conversation, and I listened to Bob and I listened to the House debate on this. I'm going to recommend that we accept the House language, as they provided.
I think we end up with the same result, ultimately -- this language on this particular provision. (UNKNOWN): On number six?
DODD: Yes.

And that's -- I thought they did a pretty good job in explaining that. We're moving -- Jack's right. I think you end up -- you haven't rejected the idea that you could use a rating agency. So I'm going to modify my own suggestion here. We'll just take the House language on that provision, and then we'll have a separate vote
-- as I understand it, Judd Gregg wanted a separate vote on the number six -- was it number four or six, the
(inaudible) -- what number was that?
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman, (inaudible) talking about the House (inaudible)?
DODD: I was just going to go back -- I want to go back to whatever that number was. I want to make sure I
get the right number.
It was number four. (CROSSTALK)
DODD: Was it number six? (CROSSTALK)
DODD: All right. Well, let's have a separate -- do they want a roll call vote? I assume they do. (UNKNOWN): I thought you were going to confer with the House.
DODD: I am going to confer with the House on -- on number six. But Senator Gregg wanted a separate vote on number four. All right?
(UNKNOWN): Have we disposed of six?

DODD: We have disposed of six. And I'm going to ask for a vote on -- two votes. One will be on the first, on the Franken proposal on the rating agencies, a separate vote, and then after that vote, we'll vote on the overall package...
(UNKNOWN): Mr. Chairman...
DODD: ... modified by taking the original -- the House language on the... (CROSSTALK)
SCHUMER: Mr. Chairman?
DODD: Yes.

SCHUMER: I just -- just want to underscore, you and I and Senator Franken talked about some of this stuff on the floor today, and this counter-offer embodies the spirit, which is a study to look at what constitutes -- study his amendment, see if it can be put into effect, see what needs to be done to avoid conflicts of
interest and then the ability to put into effect if they find a workable way to do it.
DODD: Right, that's correct.
SCHUMER: OK -- without further congressional action.
DODD: So let's have a -- let's have a vote, one recorded vote on the Franken amendment. I think Judd
Gregg wanted one.

CORKER: I think Judd wants one. I just -- I guess, if we're studying something, I don't know why we're telling them to go in a direction while they're studying. That would be my objection to it. But let's go ahead and vote. I know what -- we know the outcome.
SCHUMER: Well, I would just say to my colleague... (CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): Do we have language on that yet? DODD: We do, yes.
SCHUMER: I would just say to my colleague from Tennessee, if the House voted -- the Senate voted quite overwhelmingly to implement it.
DODD: We did. And that's why I've tried to combine the...

SCHUMER: And to me, this provision more than any other allows removing the conflict of interest, opposed to, sort of containing it. That's why I think it's a good strong provision.
CORKER: I think your point that it was overwhelmingly voted for is a good one, and I understand -- I
appreciate -- I understand the outcome.
(UNKNOWN): What are we voting on, Mr. Chairman?

DODD: We're going to vote on the -- on number four, which was the so-called Franken -- modified Franken proposal.
(CROSSTALK)
DODD: We're -- it's part of our counter-offer. And, on that, I'll ask the clerk to call the roll. CLERK: Chairman Dodd?
DODD: Aye.
CLERK: Chairman Dodd votes aye. Mr. Johnson? JOHNSON: Aye. CLERK: Mr. Johnson votes aye. Mr. Reed? REED: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Reed votes aye. Mr. Schumer? SCHUMER: Aye.
CLERK: Mr. Schumer votes aye. Ms. Lincoln? DODD: Aye by proxy.
CLERK: Ms. Lincoln, aye by proxy. Mr. Leahy? DODD: Aye by proxy.
CLERK: Mr. Leahy, aye by proxy. Mr. Harkin? DODD: Aye by proxy.
Page 292 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CLERK: Mr. Harkin, aye by proxy. Mr. Shelby?
SHELBY: No.
CLERK: Mr. Shelby votes no. Mr. Crapo? CRAPO: No.
CLERK: Mr. Crapo votes no. Mr. Corker? CORKER: No.
CLERK: Mr. Corker votes no. Mr. Gregg? SHELBY: No by proxy.
CLERK: Mr. Gregg votes no by proxy. Mr. Chambliss? SHELBY: No by proxy.
CLERK: Mr. Chambliss votes no by proxy. DODD: The court will report.
CLERK: The votes are seven ayes, five nays. The measure is passed.
DODD: And the member that has agreed to the Franken amendment has agreed to this.

As modified now by Franken, and as I modified my own suggestion on the -- on point number six, all those in favor of adopting Title 9.C as our counter-offer will say aye.
Those opposed, no.
The ayes appear to have it, and the ayes have it, and we'll submit 9.C as our counter-offer.

I want to thank my colleagues for their time and effort and I thank them for their ideas and thoughts. I think it's a better bill, a stronger bill.

I'm going to wait -- we've got votes, and I'm going to wait -- I'll just say to the staff on the House side, why don't you have Congressman -- or Chairman Frank call me. If he wants to wait until the morning rather than come back tonight, I'm happy with doing that. We finished at least the counter-offer.
(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)

DODD: All right. Well, we're going -- it won't be six. It's going to be more like 6:15, 6:30, because we've got three votes.
(UNKNOWN): 6:30?
DODD: So let's say 6:15, meet here.
OK, the committee will stand in recess until 6:15. (RECESS)
FRANK: The conference will reconvene.
The House conferees have confereed, and we are ready to give -- I'm going to propose... (CROSSTALK)
FRANK: ... an amendment.
DODD: So we're going to get ready. You want to listen now.
FRANK: I will do these in the order in which we -- we did them, so we start with Title 4. (UNKNOWN): Title 4?
FRANK: On Title 4, the Senate had three items of disagreement with us, numbered in the Senate counteroffer one, two and eight. We concur in the Senate's position on numbers two and eight -- this is my

Page 293 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
proposal, subject to my Republican colleagues who want to try and amend it. We would disagree with the Senate -- we would insist on a disagreement with regard to the provision that requires the SEC registration of commodity trading advisers.

And our point was that, if all -- and this could be worked out in the language -- if all they are doing is commodities, that is one thing, but the concern is that people's business models can change and alter, and we would want the SEC jurisdiction to come in.
So that's -- that's our offer. Do you want to respond on this one or...
DODD: No, I'm told -- I offered this, as you may recall, on behalf of the members of our Ag Committees, but
I've since been told that the Ag Committees have even changed their mind on the issue, so I need to
consult with my colleagues before giving you a final conclusion on it, but I think we'd be prepared to...
FRANK: All right. Subject to that (ph), then, we would be in total agreement on -- on Title 4. DODD: Right.
FRANK: Next is Title 3. And there were some changes. The Senate didn't accept three provisions, numbered one, two and three. We agree to the Senate's rejection. Language gets...
DODD: There's a better word than that one.

FRANK: We agree to be disagreed with, so we accept the Senate on that. We have only one issue on the others, and the Senate made some modifications (inaudible) with one exception that I would like to say wouldn't be final until we get the answer.

On the question of the transaction account guarantee, we have been told that there is a significant difference in the PAYGO under the arcana that is the language of the CBO, so that if it's permanent, there's a significant increase the way they score it, and if it's temporary, they have as a decrease.

If, in fact, that's the case, we would disagree with making it temporary and converting a potential plus into a minus, so we would like to hold off on that, subject to -- we've asked CBO for an answer.

So with -- with the exception of that, all the other points -- the ones where the Senate has made modifications -- that's points one, two, three, five and six -- we accept, and the Senate's position on the points of disagreement one, two and three, we would also accept.
So we would accept everything, with the proviso that we want to wait and see on the TAG.

DODD: OK, well, I'll just -- Amy and staff are telling me here, it's a minor cost if it's temporary. It's a huge cost savings, I would guess, if it's permanent.
FRANK: If it's permanent.

DODD: This goes back to my good friend, Luis', proposal. Yes, but it is a public policy debate, as well, as to whether or not you want to, by statute, claim an exemption of this size in the FDIC. And we ought to talk about that, see what's...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: ... Senator, let me propose this, that we're making progress here. There will be some areas of disagreement. I would have proposed that we agree on what we can. Where we have a disagreement, we put it aside for further conversation. Or, let's be honest with each other, if it gets -- you know, one issue may be hard to resolve. If we have seven or eight towards the end, there's a process of compromise and
flexibility, and, you know, the last day will be the day of disagreement day, or what we have. So let's put the permanent TAG -- of the first two, that's the only one that would go into that -- that thing.
DODD: And we'll work on it in the meantime.

FRANK: Next, on the Federal Insurance Office, we agree to the provisions to the modifications the Senate made on one through five, but we have very strong disagreement with your disagreement on the de novo judicial review and the definition of (inaudible) we believe both the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and those members in the House in particular who are concerned about international trade, having disadvantageous impacts on American workers, are concerned.
And as I walked to the floor, our colleague, Mike Michaud, who was chairman of the House Trade Working
Group, handed me out of -- on three provisions, one of which I'm not (inaudible) but the two in here are


Page 294 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
included. So we would -- we would disagree -- and I think there's fairly strong sentiment in the House about those.

Maybe there's some way -- de novo seems to me a yes-or-no thing. As to the definition, I would suggest there might be a way we can further refine that, that that's a verbal difference which can often be changed. But as of now, we would disagree to those two.

DODD: Let me suggest on -- on that -- let me suggest, if I could, Mr. Chairman, because there is some -- particularly on the trade questions, we think we've got a number of ways in which we can clarify that.

But I would suggest, for those who've been involved, the members that have really been deeply involved in this and staff, take some time aside as sort of a side bar on work this thing here, because it's -- it's highly technical stuff and...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: No, I agree. And we also have our -- although Ways and Means members are not conferees, this reflected them, and they objected to some of these changes. I agree.

Let me say, the two interact, de novo review and the definition. The more people like the definition, the less they're going to be worried about the need for de novo review. But I would agree to that, so let's set up a working group of members that will deal with that.
The gentleman from Alabama? BACHUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'm also concerned about taking out the House covered agreement definition, because those who believe strongly in the state regulation and the -- I think the good job that state regulators have done -- feel that, without the protection of that provision, that international law could -- could easily trump anything that the states wanted to do and the -- in consumer protection or safety and soundness. And so I wish we would take another look at that.

FRANK: Let me say, Mr. Chairman, Senator, we'll have a bipartisan delegation from the House trying to reach agreement. And I do think, if we can get the definition worked out, the de novo might be less of an issue, because if you got an agreed-upon definition -- but the definition is clearly a sticking point right now.
DODD: My -- my -- my chief negotiator among our staff here is trained on the House side, Charles Yeats
(ph). So I'm going to send back the House-trained man to negotiate with you.
FRANK: Or as we would call him, as we would call him, a defector. (LAUGHTER)
DODD: We'd call him a patriot, I'll tell you.

BACHUS: I might -- I might, if I could, comment. You know, when we have House or Senate staffers taking a position on whether there ought to be federal regulation or state regulation, they usually are very
pro-federal regulation, because they work in Washington.
So I -- I...

FRANK: Well, if the gentleman would yield, that's not the case here. It was my staff who alerted me to these issues.

And, again, there's a significant number of House members -- and I think some senators, too -- who have this concern, and the AFL-CIO and others, environmental groups who are worried about trade. So we will set that one aside.
BACHUS: I was alerting the Senate to that. FRANK: All right.
The last one we have, I think, the most disagreements, on the credit rating agencies, we -- and let me call my Republican friends' attention -- we are inclined to -- we would agree -- but I'll -- let's see if my Republican colleagues -- to the approach you took on the Franken amendment, which is to begin the study with the -- with the proviso that in two years it would take effect unless we have done something in -- in the interim.


Page 295 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And in that sense, it seems to me that two years is almost a decision-forcing mechanism, rather than something that may necessarily go into effect. So we would be inclined to agree to that. That's open to discussion.
BACHUS: Could we go maybe two years and eight months? FRANK: Is that when you're leaving? DODD: What the hell's that got to do with anything?
BACHUS: No, that's when we might -- never mind.
FRANK: Oh, win the White House, I see. All right. Well, I think... (LAUGHTER)
... we'll go to two years. But on the other provisions, Mr. Chairman... (UNKNOWN): Let's talk about Fannie and Freddie again, I think. (LAUGHTER)
(UNKNOWN): Let's go.

FRANK: We agree -- we then agree to that provision, but on the others, again, we -- we need to more work it. We have significant disagreements on the rejection of the -- of the increased liability and of the -- of removal of the protection, if it's under FD. There's a fairly strong House insistence.

We believe that, as we said, none of us were satisfied with what we did about rating agencies, but to the extent that we did much, they seem to us to have been dropped here. And so -- oh, and we appreciate, you know, on the question of the review of (inaudible) the agencies, obviously, we agree on that.
But on the -- let me just say, on provisions 2(a) -- we would agree to one. We would have a problem with
2(a), with 3, with 5, and with 7, which basically have to do with those restrictions that apply to the conflict of
interest, but also to me, more importantly, the rejection of tougher liability standards, so those would need
further work.
DODD: What's that?

Our only concern about that was, I think, was it seemed to be sort of redundant. But I -- but, again, there's no strong objection to that, I could just tell you. That's...

FRANK: My Republican colleagues tell me they tend to agree with the House Democrats, I think, with regard to the conflict of interest, but -- but disagree with us on the -- on the liability.

DODD: But on the sense of the Senate, we said the SEC has already promulgated regulations, but we want to continue -- I don't have any objection to that. They've got the -- they've done it already, but if you want to keep...
(CROSSTALK)

FRANK: Well, can we suggest, let's take our poor, overburdened staff, and let them do a little more work on this and see if we can come closer?
All right, with that, Mr. Chairman, I -- just to review the bidding, we have agreed on Title 4, with -- what was
-- I just misplaced Title 4. We agree with Title 4, with everything except number one, on the registration. We
agree in the entirety with...

DODD: We've agreed basically, I can say, on that one. I mean, I'll talk with my (OFF-MIKE) we'll go over this stuff.
FRANK: And then on -- on titles -- so in that case, it seems to me, on the first two titles we did today, Titles
4 and 3, we are in complete agreement, except for our reservation regarding the pay-for on the TAG, and
we'll want to revisit that, if it's a -- we -- we think it should be made permanent public policy ground (ph), but
our regret will deepen if it's going to cost us a lot of money.

So the -- and then on the credit rating -- on the insurance, we're going to try to work out the definition. And on credit rating agencies, we will see if we can come to closer agreement.
DODD: OK.
FRANK: That seems to me to conclude our business. Does anybody...
Page 296 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(CROSSTALK)
DODD: Let me ask -- let me ask Chairman Lincoln, because I... (CROSSTALK)
DODD: We had made the request and put in our counteroffer the request from the Ag Committee regarding the -- the question of whether or not the SEC would have jurisdiction. I'm trying to get the right language here.
FRANK: Just -- if I can say something -- on the commodity trading advisers, not over the broader question. DODD: On the commodities trading advisers. And -- and we put that in our counteroffer. The House has
rejected our counteroffer. And I (inaudible) said in consultation with Ag members that there was no longer
the insistence upon the language which we fought for in the counteroffer.
(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) DODD: Ah, well...
FRANK: But, senator, if I -- this doesn't deal with the supervision of the commodities themselves. It was just the commodity trading advisors, whether they had to register with the SEC as well as the CFTC, the advisors of private funds.

DODD: Well, how would you like to proceed? I mean, I think we probably need a little time on some of these (ph). (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) ... regulation and registration with the SEC and the CFTC...
FRANK: If they are doing things that affect both, yes. Well, we can hold off and get back on that one then. DODD: OK? Well, I think we probably need -- I need...
FRANK: Right. Well, I think, you know, we made significant progress, got a lot of agreement. And we would then meet tomorrow to take up the next titles.

And let's do this. We don't need unanimous consent. As the other group -- as we work on these, to the extent that we are able to come to agreement on some of them, they'll be in order at any point...
DODD: Any point, yes.
FRANK: ... because they will be, by definition, agreed to by both parties, and we can very briefly recess
(ph) what we're doing, each side accept them and put them in the pile of things done.

DODD: I agree with that. What are the titles tomorrow now, Mr. Chairman? Do you know off the top of your head?
FRANK: Have you got me the list for tomorrow? (UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE)
FRANK: Tomorrow we are doing -- it says, gavel conference to order. (LAUGHTER)
Oh, no, that's today. I'm sorry. Wrong one. Oh, apparently I don't have to gavel it to order tomorrow.

Title 9, subtitles E and G, which is executive comp and corporate governance. Title 11, Fed ordered and governance, and emergency liquidity provisions. And Title 9, subtitles A, B, F, H, I and J, investor protection regulatory improvements.
DODD: OK.
FRANK: And then Thursday is systemic risk resolution authority, payments clearing, settlement. DODD: Well, and I understand you'll be -- again, you'll be making an offer to us.
FRANK: Yes. And we'll do it again -- yes, so, it'll be...



Page 297 of 298 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DODD: Sort of the same pattern as today. You'll put together an offer... FRANK: Right. So, we'll let you know when we're getting ready. (inaudible) Senator Corker will monitor us.
(LAUGHTER)

DODD: What is helpful, obviously, we appreciate yesterday getting the -- as soon as we get the offer, it really helps, so that our folks can...

FRANK: (inaudible). You have most of it already. It was released. So, what you'll be getting will be any amendments to the offer, but they'll be less than, you know, 10 percent.
DODD: And then we'll...
FRANK: And we do, I think. Any amendments that my colleagues have, we'll make -- we'll share them. With that, the conference -- and I want to thank the members. I think it has been constructive.
And I particularly want to thank House and Senate Democratic and Republican staffs. The American
people get an enormous bargain from this extremely talented group of people in this room, who could all be
making a lot more money elsewhere, who work under very stressful conditions -- many of the stressful
conditions being us. And we are very appreciative of what they do.
The conference adjourns, recesses till tomorrow morning. END
