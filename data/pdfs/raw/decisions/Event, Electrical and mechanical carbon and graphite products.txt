BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday are expected to impose  fines for fixing prices of key  carbon products on France's Carbone Lorraine SA (3962.FR) and Germany's SGL Carbon AG (SGG) and The Schunk Group, said lawyers and officials familiar with the probe.

The E.U.  Commission has concluded that the companies colluded over 10 years to sell  carbon used to make brushes that transmit  electrical current in consumer and industrial goods ranging from portable power tools to train engines.

TD
A fourth company, Morgan Crucible Co. PLC (MGCR.LN) of the U.K., was first to cooperate with European regulators and is entitled to full leniency. "Morgan Crucible does not expect to be  fined in Europe," said Robert Osgood, an attorney with Sullivan & Cromwell in London who represented the company in Europe.

In contrast, SGL and Carbone Lorraine are repeat offenders and could receive stiff penalties. SGL increased its provisions for paying antitrust  fines by EUR5 million in November, said spokesman Stefan Wortmann. He wouldn't give the total figure SGL has set aside for  fines.

The companies are among the world's leading manufacturers of  carbon products and face potential fines as high as 10% of their annual global sales. SGL could be forced to pay as much as EUR110 million, Carbone Lorraine EUR72 million and Schunk Group EUR63 million. Morgan Crucible could have been fined GBP88 million.

The E.U.  Commission declined comment. Spokespersons from Carbone Lorraine and Schunk Group had no immediate comment.
Other companies also may receive  fines on Wednesday, lawyers say.

Carbon brushes are highly conductive and heat-resilient blocks that transfer  electrical current to the revolving part of a motor. Such brushes are found in most car and train engines but the sector is suffering from overcapacity and slowing global growth.

Carbon brushes "represent a mature market," according to Carbone Lorraine's 2002 report. Still, the products represent more than a quarter of Carbone Lorraine's total sales, which slipped about 10% in
2002.

The Commission's investigation stemmed from a previous case in which manufacturers were caught fixing the prices of  carbon electrodes used for making steel. In that case, SGL  Carbon paid fines totaling about EUR200 million to E.U. and U.S. authorities between 1999 and 2001. Carbone Lorraine paid EUR7 million to  European regulators in that case.

It now appears that some of the companies fixed prices in separate product markets, including the market for brushes. "They've been very naughty boys for not confessing during prior investigations," said one lawyer familiar with the E.U.'s probe.
Some of the executives involved also could face jail terms in the U.S.
In September, a Federal grand jury in Philadelphia indicted Ian Norris, a former chief executive of
Morgan Crucible, and Robin Emerson, a former employee for the company's Morganite Electrical     

Page 2 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Carbon Ltd. subsidiary. The grand jury says the men persuaded others to destroy or conceal documents in the U.S. case.

That case predates the U.K.'s criminalization of  price-fixing, so any extradition would take place under charges that the representative obstructed U.S. justice. Still, any extradition of Norris and Emerson to the U.S. would mark the first-ever in an antitrust case.

The situation mirrors that of Sir Anthony Tennant, the former chairman of Christie's International PLC, who was indicted by a Federal grand jury in May 2001 for fixing  commission rates charged to sellers of art, jewelry and furniture at auctions during the 1990s.
Tennant is believed to be safe from U.S. jail as long as he remains at home in the U.K.
Morgan Crucible's American unit Morganite already paid $11 million in  fines to the U.S. Department of
Justice in the  carbon brushes case.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The following is a summary of Monday's antitrust developments involving the
European Union Commission and companies publicly traded in the U.S.:

E.U. Stands Firm, Insists U.S. Must Lift All WTO Steel Tariffs

The European Union said Monday it would go ahead with retaliatory sanctions on $2.2 billion worth of U.S. exports this month unless the Bush

administration repeals all of the steel tariffs declared illegal by the
World
Trade Organization. Asked about reports that U.S. President George W. Bush

has decided to repeal "most" of the tariffs imposed last year, E.U. trade spokeswoman Arancha Gonzalez said the 15-country trading bloc wants them all
lifted, as demanded by the WTO. "The U.S. knows this," she said. The Washington Post, citing unidentified Bush administration and industry sources, reported Monday that the Bush administration would probably announce
its decision to repeal most of the tariffs on imported steel this week.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission fined five European companies more than euro101 million (US$121 million) Wednesday for setting prices in carbon and graphite  products for more than a decade.

A sixth company that came forward in 2001, setting off the investigation, also took part but received immunity from  fines, the Commission said.

TD
The six control 93 percent of the  European market for electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite
products used in electrical motors and railway products. They held more than 140 "summits" between
1988-1999 to decide on prices and undercut remaining rivals, the  Commission said.

"None of the companies involved has seriously disputed the facts ascertained by the  Commission," it added.

Under the decision, French firm Carbone Lorraine SA was fined euro43.05 million (US$51.66 million); Germany's Schunk GmbH and an affiliate were fined euro30.87 (US$37 million); SGL  Carbon AG of Germany was fined euro23.64 million (US$28.37 million); Hoffmann & Co. Elektrokohle AG of Austria was fined euro2.82 million (US$3.38 million); and C. Conradty Nuernberg GmbH of Germany  euro1.06 million (US$1.27 million).
British firm Morgan Crucible Company plc escaped  fines for being the first to come forward. (pfg-pa)

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday imposed  fines totalling EUR101.4 million on five companies for fixing prices of key  carbon products.

The E.U. Commission fined France's Carbone Lorraine SA (3962.FR) EUR43.1 million and Germany's SGL Carbon AG (SGG) EUR23.6 million. Germany's The Schunk Group was  fined EUR30.9 million, while Austria's Hoffman & Co Elektokohle AG was  fined EUR2.8 million. Germany's C. Conradty Nurnberg GmbH received a EUR1.1 million penalty.

TD
The E.U.  Commission concluded that the companies colluded for more than 10 years to sell  carbon used to make brushes that transmit  electrical current in consumer and industrial goods ranging from portable power tools to train engines.
A sixth company, Morgan Crucible Co. PLC (MGCR.LN) of the U.K., was first to cooperate with
European regulators and was entitled to full leniency.

The six companies control more than 90% of the  European market for carbon products worth about EUR290 a year. The companies held more than 140 meetings to decide price increases and ward off outside competition by undercutting rivals, the  Commission said in a statement.

"The top meetings, which they called 'summits,' provided strategic direction and solved problems, while the detailed price and other arrangements were worked out and agreed in 'technical committee' meetings," the  Commission said.
The fines have been much higher. Under E.U. law, companies guilty of collusion can be fined up to
10% of their annual global turnover. For Morgan Crucible - which doesn't have to pay a fine - that
would have meant an GBP88 million penalty.

The Commission's case stems from a previous investigation in which manufacturers were caught fixing the prices of  carbon electrodes used for making steel. In that case, SGL  Carbon paid fines totaling about EUR200 million to E.U. and U.S. authorities between 1999 and 2001. Carbone Lorraine paid EUR7 million to  European regulators in that case.

It now appears that some of the companies fixed prices in separate product markets, including the market for carbon brushes. And although SGL and Carbone Lorraine are repeat offenders, they still won significant reductions.

Carbone Lorraine's  fine was cut by 40% to "reward it for good co-operation in the investigation," the Commission said. Officials cut SGL's  fine by 33% because the company "finds itself in a difficult financial situation."
Conradty didn't co-operate but its  fine was small "to reflect size."

Carbon brushes are highly conductive and heat-resilient blocks that transfer  electrical current to the revolving part of a motor. Such brushes are found in most car and train engines but the sector is suffering from overcapacity and slowing global growth.

2002.

Some of the executives involved could also face jail terms in the U.S. In September, a federal grand jury in Philadelphia indicted Ian Norris, a former chief executive of Morgan Crucible, and Robin Emerson, a former employee for the company's Morganite  Electrical Carbon Ltd. subsidiary.
The grand jury says the men persuaded others to destroy or conceal documents in the U.S. case.

Tennant is believed to be safe from U.S. jail as long as he remains at home in the U.K.
Morgan Crucible's American unit Morganite already paid $11 million in  fines to the U.S. Department of
Justice in the  carbon brushes case.

WIESBADEN, Germany (Dow Jones)--SGL  Carbon AG (SGG) Wednesday criticized a  European antitrust fine levied against it as "too exorbitant by far," and said it may pursue the case at the European Court of Justice.

A European Union Commission investigation concluded that  graphite  production companies colluded for more than 10 years to sell  carbon used in consumer and industrial goods.

TD
It slapped  fines on five offenders totaling EUR101.4 million, EUR23.6 million of which was levied against SGL.
It is the third time the company has been  fined by E.U. antitrust authorities.

In July 2001 and December 2002, the E.U. imposed  fines of EUR80.2 million and EUR27.75 million respectively, both of which are being challenged by the company in court.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French  electrical parts maker Carbone Lorraine SA (3962.FR) said Wednesday that a EUR43 million  fine imposed on it by the  European Union Commission for price fixing  will inevitably push its earnings into the red this year, even though it is determined to appeal the ruling.
The appeal will delay the application of the sentence, Carbone Lorraine Chief Financial Officer
Jean-Claude Suquet told Dow Jones Newswires.

TD
However, the company had only set aside EUR18 million to cover potential liabilities from the E.U. probe and will therefore need to increase provisions, he said.

"We had hoped to break even or to post a small profit this year," Suquet said. "But with the additional provisions, we will record a loss in 2003."
Earlier Wednesday, the Commission fined Carbone Lorraine and four other companies a total of
EUR101.4 million for operating a cartel in carbon products used in electrical motors for 10 years until
1999.
"We are shocked by the amount of the  fine which is out of proportion with the violations," Suquet said. At 1525 GMT, Carbone Lorraine shares had slipped 2.9% to EUR30.0.
Suquet said he didn't expect such a high  fine because Carbone Lorraine agreed to cooperate during the investigation and implemented thorough procedures to eliminate  cartel practices.

Carbone Lorraine, which makes brushes for  electrical motors, posted a net loss of EUR10.8 million on revenue of EUR721 million in 2002.

Under the E.U.  Commission decision, SGL  Carbon AG (SGG) and The Schunk Group of Germany were fined EUR23.6 million and EUR30.9 million respectively, while Austria's Hoffman & Co Elektokohle AG was  fined EUR2.8 million. Germany's C. Conradty Nurnberg GmbH received a EUR1.1 million penalty.
A sixth company, Morgan Crucible Co. PLC (MGCR.LN) of the U.K., was first to cooperate with
European regulators and was entitled to full leniency.

SGL Carbon said it also plans to lodge an appeal with the  European Court of Justice against the ruling.

Late last year, the E.U.  Commission imposed a EUR60.6 million  fine on eight companies, including EUR7 million on Carbone Lorraine, for  price fixing  in specialty graphites, used to make industrial tools.
Carbone Lorraine didn't appeal the latter sentence.

The free-falling forint opera

An urgent appeal: anyone fancy running a struggling east  European economy undermined by party politics and a central bank boss out of his depth? The word in Budapest is that Csaba Laszlo, Hungary's finance minister, might be sacked as early as tomorrow.

TD
He is vulnerable not just because of the usual search for a scapegoat at a time of financial crisis (the forint has plunged, interest rates have soared). Neither Laszlo, 42, a Bertolt Brecht look-alike and banker by training, nor his biggest backer, prime minister Peter Medgessy, are members of the ruling socialist party. So, his 2004 budget having failed to impress the financial markets, he does not have allies to fall back on.

Laszlo, in the US on Thursday, may have added to the mess with unwise words on the exchange rate. But it was Zsigmond Jarai, central bank governor, who started the spending spree when he was Laszlo's predecessor as finance minister. Jarai's obsession now with getting Hungary into the  eurozone by 2008 (God forbid the Slovaks get in first) has made things worse.

The interest rate hikes have not worked - but nor would Laszlo's departure. Central bank governors may be sacred these days, but the markets would rather see the back of Jarai ...
Verhofstadt's plan

Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt declared on Wednesday that he was ready to stand in next year's elections to the  European parliament - sparking speculation about why he suddenly wants to join the EU political arena.

A first, profile-raising step towards becoming president of the European Commission? That remains to be seen. One thing that seems clear is that Verhofstadt will not be discussing the finer points of
euro-deputies' travel expenses, the role of the "Cocobu" committee, or other heavyweight parliamentary issues any time soon.

Indeed, Observer hears that, if elected, Verhofstadt would let a substitute from his liberal party take his place on the monthly ride to Strasbourg.
Rumsfeld's prize

To Brussels' 16th-century Egmont Palace for the annual "Europeans  of the year" awards run by European Voice magazine - which showed brilliantly just how complex or confused the mind of the European remains.

How else to explain, after the collapse of the Cancun trade meeting, why Pascal Lamy, EU trade commissioner, was "Commissioner of the year" in the online readers' poll? Or, when EU/US relations are worse than for perhaps 50 years, why Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, was "diplomat of the year"?

Other results:  European of the year was Eddie Fenech Adami, Malta's premier (worrying evidence of how effectively the tiny new EU member can swing a vote?).

Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president who wrote the EU's draft constitution, was "visionary of the year" but, though not there to collect his gong, apparently sees himself more as a statesman.

Businessman of the year was Ryanair's Michael O'Leary - maybe deservedly, but did he have to bang on about just how brilliant he is?

And "non-EU citizen of the year"? Who else but Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary so loved in Brussels? Strangely, although he was in town for Nato meetings, Rumsfeld decided not collect his award in person.
Observer hears he feared what reception he would actually get. Arrived on time
Every lobby group under the sun wanted to get its voice heard at the United Nations conference on climate change in Milan. So hats off to the group of public transport and railway groups that came up with a great idea for stressing the importance of public transport.

They would start their fringe event, "keep Kyoto on track", with a dramatic description of how nightmarishly impossible life would be in a gridlocked city wholly dependent on cars.

But in the event the show was stolen ... by Milan's transport workers who on Monday night called a strike, thus making life in the gridlocked city nightmarishly impossible.
Brussels waist

What is happening to the great tradition of long, lavish Brussels lunches? As reported on Wednesday, Chris "Fat Pang" Patten, Oxford University chancellor and external relations commissioner, is these days ready to be burnt in effigy as long as it makes him look slim.

Now Observer's man with the Brussels restaurant guide hears Margot Wallstrom, Swedish environment commissioner, feels that lunching at her desk on "disgusting diet soup" is what she needs to keep the healthy look, and get away with wearing those black leather jackets. As long as the soup doesn't contain any disgusting chemicals, of course.
Rise of machines

Good to see Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner known for his Arnold Schwarzenegger "Terminator" stare, back in action on Wednesday, imposing swingeing  fines on five companies involved in a carbon and graphite  products cartel.

But, wonders Observer, is it just coincidence that Monti always takes action against companies that make technical things to do with, well, pumped-up artificial beings - the  electrical and mechanical manufacturers, chemical groups, vitamin producers etc?

One explanation is that Monti wants to challenge alleged consumer goods cartels, but it is harder to gather evidence against them. Or is it just that Monti has, by character, more of a feel for the mechanical world?
Paperwork

Finnish papermakers went on strike on Wednesday, shutting down paper and pulp factories in protest at industry cutbacks. Apparently they feared business was folding.

The European Commission fined on December 3, 2003 German  carbon and graphite  products maker SGL Carbon 23.6 mln euro ($28.5 mln) for fixing  carbon prices and undercutting rivals in cooperation with five other companies from October 1988 to December 1999, the  Commission said on December 3, 2003.

The Commission also fined French Carbone Lorraine 43.1 mln  euro ($52.1 mln), German Schunk GmbH had to pay 30.9 mln euro ($37.3 mln), its Austrian subsidiary Hoffmann & Co AG was fined 2.8 mln euro ($3.4 mln) and German C. Conradty Nuernberg GmbH was imposed a 1.1 mln euro ($1.3 mln) penalty. U.K. Morgan Crucible Company Plc., which also participated in the carbon price fixing,  was
the first to cooperate with the  Commission and will not be fined.

TD
The six companies controlled 93 pct of the  European carbon products market, the  Commission said, adding they held 140 meetings between 1988 and 1999 to decide on illegal price hikes.
SGL shares traded at about 12.4  euro ($15) on December 3, 2003, going up by 4.55 pct after the news. SGL increased its existing provisions for antitrust risks by 5.0 mln  euro ($6.04 mln) in its  Graphite
Specialties division, as the EC had objections relating to minor business activities in the division, SGL
said on November 5, 2003.

The Commission fined SGL with 27.8 mln  euro ($33.6 mln) in December 2002 for fixing prices of graphite  specialties. It also  fined the company 80.2 mln  euro ($96.9 mln) in July 2001. SGL has lodged appeals against both decisions.
U.S. regulators  fined SGL $145 mln ($120 mln) in 1999.

FRANKFURT, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Germany's SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE) and other  graphite  producers face a new set of European Commission cartel fines, a German newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing Brussels-based industry sources.

The Handelsblatt daily said that the  fine on SGL, the world's top producer of graphite  electrodes that go into steel making, would be lower than earlier penalties imposed on it by the cartel authorities.

TD
The authorities imposed a  fine of 27.75 million  euros ($33.15 million) on SGL in December 2002 for
price fixing  in specialty graphites.

An SGL spokesman told Reuters that the  European Commission was probing related products and that the company had sold a major part of the businesses which were now being investigated.

"At the moment we do not know whether there will be a  fine announced by the European                  Commission," he said. "We have not been officially informed yet."
The European Commission had also slapped an 80.2 million  euro fine on SGL in July 2001. SGL has appealed both the July 2001 and December 2002  fines, which it has not paid.
The German firm also makes  carbon and composite materials for industrial and aerospace uses.

BRUSSELS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it will fine France's Carbon Lorraine (CBLP.PA) and four other firms 101 million  euros for participating in a cartel in electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite  products.

"In a decision adopted today, the  European Comission has imposed fines totalling 101.44 million on Carbon Lorraine, SGL, Schunk and two other companies for operating a cartel," the EU executive said in a statement.

TD
Carbon Lorraine was fined 43.05 million euros ($51.43 million), Schunk 30.87 million and Germany's
SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE) has to pay 23.64 million  euros.

A sixth firm, Morgan Crucible (MGCR.L), which had also participated in the  cartel received immunity from the fines for being the first to tell the  Commission about the illegal activities, the EU executive said.

The Commission said the cartel operated in the market for  carbon and graphite  products, principally used to transfer electricity to and in  electrical motors in shavers, electric car windows and vacuum cleaners.

EU regulators  fined SGL 27.75 million euros ($33.15 million) in December 2002 for price fixing  in specialty graphites, and 80.2 million euros in July 2001. SGL is appealing both these fines.

BRUSSELS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it would  fine the world's top producer of  graphite  electrodes, SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE), and four other firms a total of
101 million euros ($122 million) for taking part in a cartel.

The Commission said the cartel operated in the market for  carbon and graphite  products, used principally to transfer electricity to and in electric motors in shavers, car windows and vacuum cleaners.

TD
"In a decision adopted today, the  European Commission has imposed fines totalling 101.44 million on Carbon Lorraine, SGL, Schunk and two other companies for operating a cartel," the EU executive said in a statement.

SGL said it was considering appealing against the decisions to the  European Union's court and that it considered the fine of 23.64 million  euros against it too large.

France's Carbone-Lorraine (CBLP.PA) also planned to appeal against a 43 million-euro fine imposed on it, saying the firm was convinced it had a "number of reasons" to appeal.
Of the other companies, Schunk had to pay 30.87 million  euros, Hoffmann 2.82 million and Conradty
1.06 million.

A sixth firm, Morgan Crucible (MGCR.L), which had also participated in the  cartel, received immunity from the fines for being the first to tell the  Commission about the illegal activities, the EU executive said.

SGL shares rose on Wednesday's news after having lost ground on uncertainty about the size of a fine. The stock was up 8.8 percent at 12.90  euros in afternoon trading, outperforming a slightly higher mid-cap MDAX index .

"The market is relieved by the fact that there is now some certainty and concrete numbers on SGL. The share has fallen a lot on fears of such a move and now people at least know the sums involved," said Frank Albrecht, a trader at M.M. Warburg.

EU regulators  fined SGL 27.75 million  euros in December 2002 for  price fixing  in speciality graphites and 80.2 million  euros in July 2001.
SGL has appealed against those  fines. An SGL spokesman said the company hoped for a decision
on the July 2001 case in the first half of 2004. (Additional reporting by Sitaraman Shankar in Frankfurt

COURT-VOLKSWAGEN

Asked for comment on a ruling by the  European Court of Justice that annulled a  fine imposed by the Commission against Volkswagen, spokesman Tilman Lueder said the EU executive regretted the Court's ruling.
"This is of course not a victory," he said.
Lueder said the Court had reproached the  Commission for not being able to prove that both
Volkswagen and car dealers were willingly taking part in  cartel operations.

"It is regrettable that there is this constantly open issue between dealers and manufacturers about what constitutes acquiescence in manufacturers' unilateral orders...The  Commission has actually to prove


Page 20 of 49 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
whether the dealer agreed (to the anti-competitive practice suggested by Volkswagen) or not, but the dealer just says nothing," he added.

Asked if the  Commission would be more careful in preparing such decisions in the future, Lueder said: "As the dealer risks being excluded from the network, he will never say anything. He will just receive his unilateral orders from the manufacturer but will not commit himself in any case...It was not a question that we have not diligently prepared our case," he added.

COMMISSION-PUBLIC PROCUREMENT

Spokesman Jonathan Todd said the Commission warmly welcomed the fact that an agreement had been reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the  Commission's proposal to update and simplify current rules on public procurements.

GREECE-OLYMPIC
In response to a question on a probe into Olympic Airways, spokesman Gilles Gantelet said the
Commission had received information from Greece at the end of September.

"There were several hundred pages in Greek, which are currently being translated...The translation will be finished during December...At first sight, we consider that some parts are still not in the package. So, as it is normal in these proceedings, there was a letter from the Department of Transport and Energy to the Greek authorities to ask for further documents. Especially, the publication of the law...this was done some weeks ago and we are now waiting to receive the documents. We need to have the elements to give our approval. We support efforts made by the Greek authorities for Olympic Airways, we think that privatisation is the only chance for this company for the future, but of course, it must respect fully European law," he said.

HUNGARY-CRISIS

In response to a question on a monetary crisis in Hungary, spokesman Gerassimos Thomas said that the situation was in the hands of the authorities at this stage.
"It is their responsibility and they are the most competent ones to deal with the situation. Of course, the
Commission follows the events," he added.

ITALY-MEDIA

In response to a question on a new law on Italian media, spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the Commission was not planning for now to open an investigation into an Italian media bill adopted this week.

"For the moment, I have no information that we would have any intention of opening an examination on this issue," Kemppinen added.

COMPETITION-LAGARDERE

In response to a question on Lagardere, spokeswoman Amelia Torres said: "Competition Commissioner Mario Monti obviously takes note of the announcement which has been made this morning by Arnaud Lagardere with regard to the modification of the operation and in view of this, Commissioner Monti has the intention to propose to his colleagues in the next few weeks to clear the operation as modified."

Confidence in Britain's economic resurgence was given a further boost as the latest CIPS/Reuters barometer of services showed the sector's fastest expansion for six years. A surge in new business saw the survey's headline index climb from October's 59.1 to a November reading of 59.6. Any figure over 50 indicates expansion.

Worries over the impact of higher interest rates on the consumer were stoked as the CBI's latest snapshot of high street conditions showed disappointing November trading. The balance of retailers reporting higher sales fell to plus 19, from plus 35 in October. But retailers were confident of

The dollar suffered another mauling on the currency markets, hitting record lows against the  euro for the fourth day in a row despite the strength of the American recovery.

COMPETITION Commissioner Mario Monti plans to rule on a state aid case concerning ElectricitÈ de France before Christmas. His officials began a probe in April, after France refused to end unlimited state guarantees to the state-owned utility - the EU's biggest power firm.

THE European Commission has fined the world's top producer of  graphite  electrodes, SGL  Carbon, and four other firms EUR 101 million for taking part in a  cartel.

GOVERNMENTS and MEPs agreed rules designed to boost the EU's multi-billion  euro public procurement market. The rules impose competitive tendering for public contracts, to ensure the contract is awarded to companies offering best value. Buyers will be able to stipulate social or environmental conditions, but any restrictions must give bidding firms a fair chance.

GERMANY, Italy, Portugal, Austria and Luxembourg vetoed plans to allow EU funding for stem-cell research for the second time. The five states, at a 26 November research and competitiveness council, formed a blocking minority on the issue, postponing it for a week. Faced with such strong opposition, the Irish government - due to take over the EU presidency next month - said it intends to drop the proposal.

HD         Carbon, graphite  groups  are fined PRICE-FIXING. BY        By TOBIAS BUCK.

The European Commission yesterday imposed a Euros 101.44m ( $122.7m) fine on five carbon and graphite  producers, arguing that the companies had operated a price-fixing cartel for more than a decade.
The companies involved are Carbone Lorraine of France, Schunk, SGL  Carbon and Conradty of
Germany, and Austria's Hoffmann, which is now part of the Schunk group.

TD
Another member of the  cartel, the UK company Morgan Crucible, was let off because it was the first to come forward with information on the cartel agreement. Some of the companies had been fined before. SGL Carbon, for example, has now been fined a total of Euros 131m for breaking EU cartel restrictions. Yesterday was the third time it was named in a cartel case since 2001.

Following a two-year probe, the Commission concluded that the six companies had operated a  cartel in the market for  electrical and mechanical carbon and graphite  products between October 1988 and December 1999. These products can be found in electric car windows, shavers and vacuum cleaners.
"During this period the companies, which control 93 per cent of the  European market, held more than
140 meetings to decide price increases for a broad range of products as well as for large individual
customers, and to ward off outside competition by undercutting the few rivals left," the Brussels
executive said.

Carbone Lorraine was fined Euros 43.05m, Schunk  Euros 30.87m, SGL  Carbon Euros 23.64m, Hoffmann  Euros 2.82m and Conradty  Euros 1.06m.

Carbone Lorraine said it would appeal, in an attempt to reduce its  fine. The company said: "The size of the fine appears to be completely disproportionate to the practices of which it stands accused and, to an even greater extent, to their economic implications. The decision has led to inequality of treatment of the relevant companies, which is totally unwarranted."

SGL Carbon said it found "the absolute amount of the  fine disproportionate and excessive". It said it was also considering an appeal to the  European Court.

Brussels, 03/12/2003 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission imposed a fine of a total of EUR
101.44 million on the companies Carbone Lorraine (EUR 43.05 million), Schunk (EUR 30.87 million), SGL
(EUR 23.64 million), Hoffmann (EUR 2.82 million) and Conradty (EUR 1.06 million) for having reached an
understanding on  carbon and graphite  products for electrical and mechanical applications. These
products are used in the composition of current electrical household appliances such as razors, vacuum
cleaners and air conditioners. The company Morgan Crucible, which took part in the  cartel, enjoyed
immunity from the  fine for being the first to denounce the agreement. The illegal practice began in
October 1988 and continued until December 1999. During this period, the companies in question, which
controlled 93% of the market, agreed together on price rises to be defined and systematically offered to
the large clients at prices lower than those practised by the few existing competitors.

TD
During this period, some of these companies also took part in other agreements, namely those on graphite electrodes (July 2001) and special graphite  (December 2002). SGL thus took part in three cartels and Carbone Lorraine in two. The Commission, however, did not take this fact into account when increasing the fines.

FRANKFURT, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Germany's SGL  Carbon (SGCG.DE), the world's top producer of graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, said on Friday it aimed to raise 830 million  euros ($1 billion) through a capital hike and debt to strengthen its finances.

The company, which has racked up debt from investments in its composites unit and faces cartel fines, said in a statement it planned to raise 200 million  euros from an share issue at six euros a share, a steep discount to the current price.

TD
It will raise a further 630 million  euros through senior and subordinated debt, and plans to complete the fund raising in early to mid-February.

The company's shares first fell as much as 10 percent in reaction to the impending capital increase, but then rebounded strongly to be up 6.05 percent at 14.90  euros at 1600 GMT as analysts lauded the move for ensuring financial security.
"It's a positive move in that securing financing reduces uncertainty over the company's future," said
Sal. Oppenheim analyst Petra Meyer.

"The cash inflow from the capital hike will reduce gearing, and together with the cheaper debt will help it meet cartel liabilities," she said.

An SGL spokesman said the company had net debt of 459 million  euros as of September 30, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.1.
He said it had invested heavily in recent times in SGL Technologies, a unit that makes  carbon
composites for aerospace and defence industries,  carbon fibres and fuel cell components.

CARTEL FINES

On Wednesday, the European Commission said it would fine SGL 23.64 million euros for price    
fixing  in specialty graphites.

The fine is the latest such blow to SGL, which was  fined $145 million by U.S. regulators in 1999 and has to pay a fixed amount every year till 2007.

It also faces European Commission fines of 80.2 million  euros imposed in July 2001 and 27.75 million euros imposed in December 2002. The company has appealed against the  fines.

SGL reported a third-quarter operating loss and has forecast a lower full-year profit than some analysts estimated, hit by the strong  euro that has made its exports less competitive.

The European Commission decided on December 3 to  fine five European carbon and graphite  firms a total of over Euro 100 million for illegal agreements. French firm Carbone Lorraine got a Euro 43.05 million fine, German group Schunk  Euro 30.87 million, German company SGL  Carbon got Euro 23.64 million, German firm C. Conradty Nurnberg  Euro 1.06 million and Austria's Hoffmann & Co Elektrokohle (currently part of the Schunk group)  Euro 2.82 million. A sixth British company, Morgan Crucible also took part in the  cartel but was exempted from  fines as it was the first company to tell the  Commission of the illegal activity.

TD
The inquiry began in September 2001 and put the spotlight on a secret agreement between October 1998 and December 1999 between the six firms, which control 93% of the  European market. They held over
140 meetings to fix price rises on a large range of products and certain major clients, and to ward off competition by undercutting their few remaining rivals. During the same period, some of the firms were also part of two other cartels on graphite  electrodes and special graphites. These cartels were also discovered and sanctioned by the Commission.

The fines imposed on SGL, which took part in the three cartels have now reached a total of  Euro 131 million. Those on Carbone Lorraine, which was part of two of the illegal groups are at Euro 50 million. Electrical carbon and graphite  products are used to transfer electricity in and to electrical motors for a wide range of applications. These include the automotive industry (electric car windows, starters, air conditioning, etc.), public transport (trains, metro, trams) and virtually all consumer goods equipped with a motor (vacuum cleaners, shavers, etc). Mechanical  carbon and graphite  products are used to seal dangerous gases and liquids in pumps, compressors and turbines. The European market for the
products concerned is worth around  Euro 290 million a year.

The European Commission has fined SGL Carbon, Carbon Lorraine and three other companies a combined EUR 101 M for participation in a carbon and graphite  products cartel. SGL has so far been fined a total of EUR 131 M for its part in three cartels, Carbon Lorraine EUR 50 M for its part in two. The fine in the present case was reduced by 33% to EUR 24 M because of the heavy  fines imposed in the other two cases and SGL's difficult financial situation.

The supervisory board of troubled German  carbon and graphite  products maker SGL  Carbon approved a 830 mln euro ($1.01 bln) refinancing package, comprised of a capital increase, a bond issue and a syndicated loan arrangement, the company CEO Robert J. Koehler said on December 8, 2003.

SGL will submit the package for approval to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting, scheduled for January 15, 2004. A bank consortium, lead by Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and Kleinwort Wasserstein, will implement the capital increase with subscription rights for shareholders. The consortium has agreed to fully underwrite the 33 million share issue at a minimum subscription price of 6.0  euro ($7.3) per share. SGL expects 200 mln  euro ($243.1 mln) in proceeds from the capital increase.

TD
SGL plans to generate 300 mln  euro ($364.7 mln) in proceeds from the issue of a high-yield bond. CSFB
and Deutsche Bank were appointed lead managers of the issue.

The company will arrange a 330 mln  euro ($401.2 mln) six-year syndicated loan facility, which will be used to repay a syndicated facility established at the end of 2002 and maturing in May 2005.

Experts deemed the amount of the refinancing package inappropriate in view of the 310 mln  euro ($376.9 mln) market capitalisation of SGL and 149 mln  euro ($181.1 mln) equity capital. The company
equity-to-assets ratio collapsed to 11 pct at the end of the third quarter of 2003, and its financial liabilities grew to 458 mln euro ($556.8 mln). SGL aims a 20 pct equity-to-assets ratio after the implementation of the package, Koehler said, adding that it will help the company management to concentrate on operating activities. SGL will be able to repay a 135 mln  euro ($164.1 mln) convertible bond due in May 2005 and will secure the payment of a 131.6 mln  euro ($160 mln) fine, imposed by the European Commission (EC) for price fixing  in the 1990s. The EC imposed on the company three cartel fines within two years. SGL is appealing against all three fines and is not obliged to pay until a final decision is reached. A decision on the first and largest fine from July 2001 is expected in the following six months.

HD          EU To Decide Cartel Fines Wed For Akzo Nobel, Total Unit

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators will decide Wednesday whether to impose fines on Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) and Total SA (TOT) for fixing the prices of key industrial chemicals, according to sources from the company and the E.U.

The E.U.  Commission has concluded the companies colluded over sales of organic peroxides, which are used to make plastics and polystyrene for products like containers and packaging.

TD
"We're not sure yet if we'll get a  fine," said Akzo Nobel spokeswoman Patricia Janssen. According to the company's 2002 annual report, the company has made provisions totaling EUR102 million for possible cartel penalties in Europe and North America.

Total's chemicals unit Atofina also said it's made provisions for  cartel fines in Europe. But Atofina spokesman Gilles Galinier said it was too early to comment on the size of any penalty that could be imposed Wednesday.

The E.U.  Commission can fine companies up to 10% of their global annual sales for  cartel offenses. Europe's record penalty was imposed in 2001 on Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY) F. Hoffmann-La Roche. Regulators handed the company a  fine of EUR462 million for fixing vitamin prices.

Fines Wednesday won't be that high. Nor will Wednesday's  fines exceed last week's EUR100 million penalty for five companies that make  carbon products for motors, one source close to the case said.
Total has already been punished by U.S. regulators for fixing the organic peroxides market.

Total unit Elf Atochem paid $8.5 million in 2002 for colluding over sales of the peroxides and for rigging markets for a substance called MCAA, which is used in products ranging from pharmaceuticals and herbicides to plastics.
In 2001, Akzo Nobel paid $12 million to U.S. regulators for MCAA offenses.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Court of First Instance Tuesday upheld antitrust  fines for
price fixing  against the Dutch association of  electrical equipment wholesalers.

After an eight-year probe, the  European Union Commission in 1999 fined the Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Elektrotechnisch Gebied, or FEG, EUR4.4 million for artificially maintaining prices and preventing association members from selling to nonmembers. FEG's biggest member, Technische Unie, was  fined EUR2.15 million.

TD
Both parties appealed to the court, saying the E.U.  Commission had not properly analyzed the Dutch market for electro-technical equipment - which includes a wide range of  electrical products such as cables, plugs, switches and sockets.

They also argued the probe had lasted too long, and that a so-called gentleman's agreement between FEG and an importers association, which prevented sales to non-FEG members, was not a real agreement.
But Europe's second-highest court rejected all of the claims, saying the E.U.  Commission "did
analyze correctly the market situation in the Netherlands [...] and did correctly interpret the gentleman's
agreement as a real agreement."

On 3 Dec 2003, the  European Commission decided to fine five European carbon and graphite  firms a total of over EUR 100 M for illegal agreements. French firm Carbone Lorraine got a EUR 43.05 M fine, Germany group Schunk EUR 30.87 M, German company SGL  Carbon got EUR 23.64 M, German firm C Conradty Nurnberg EUR 1.06 M and Austria's Hoffmann and Co Elektrokohle (currently part of the Schunk group) EUR 2.82 M. A sixth British company, Morgan Crucible also took part in the  cartel but was exempted from  fines as it was the first company to tell the  Commission of the illegal activity. The inquiry began in Sep 2001 and put the spotlight on a secret agreement between Oct 1998 and Dec 1999 between the six firms, which control 93% of the  European market. They held over 140 meetings to fix price rises on a large range of products and certain major clients and to ward off competition by undercutting their few remaining rivals.

During the same period, some of the firms were also part of two other cartels on graphite  electrodes and special graphites. These cartels were also discovered an sanctioned by the Commission. The fines imposed on SGL  Carbon, which took part in the three cartels, have now reached a total of EUR 131 M. Those on Carbone Lorraine, which was part of two of the illegal groups, are at EUR 50 M. The  European market for the products concerned is worth around EUR 290 M/y.

German banking group Hypo-Vereinsbank (HVB) has lowered its share price target on German  carbon and graphite  products maker SGL  Carbon to 11.5 euro ($14.25) from 13  euro ($16.11) due to a dilution effects of the planned capital increase, the bank said on December 22, 2003.

Interest rates are expected to rise, which will affect SGL  Carbon's net profit for 2004 and 2005, even if the capital increase results in a decrease of the company's net debts, analysts at the bank said. HVB reiterated its „underperform" rating on SGL  Carbon.

[Editor's note: German private bank M.M. Warburg's analyst Sven Dopke cut on December 8, 2003 his share price target on SGL Carbon to 22 euro ($27.26) from 23 euro ($28.50) in view of the 23.64 mln euro ($29.3 mln) cartel fine imposed on the company by the European Commission. Dopke maintained his "buy" recommendation on SGL  Carbon shares, the German News Digest reported on December 9, 2003.]
