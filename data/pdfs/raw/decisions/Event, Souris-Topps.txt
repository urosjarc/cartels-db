(ANSA) - BRUSSELS, May 25 - The European Commission (EC) has decided to  fine the U.S. distributor of entertainment products Topps and some of its European branches for having maintained too high prices of Pokemon cards and a series of stickers hindering their import to some of the EU member states.

According to information, provided to ANSA, Brussels ended the investigation against  Topps and some of its branches in Great Britain, Finland, Germany and Spain, initiated in June 2003, accusing them of
having maintained extremely high prices of the reproductions of Pikachu and other characters through an illegal system for control over their distribution and retail prices.

TD
According to Brussels sources, the sentence has been passed but the EC has not decided on the the  fine
for the companies involved. It appears, however, that the  fine will be moderate. (ANSA) (MI/krc)

BRUSSELS, May 26 (Xinhua) - The European Commission (EC), the executive arm of the  European Union (EU), on Wednesday fined Topps Group, a producer of collectible stickers and cards popular with young children, 1.6 million euros (about 1.92 million US dollars) for breaking EU competition law.

According to the EC, the New York-based  Topps had agreements with several of its distributors in the UK, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain to prevent imports of Pokemon products from low-price to high-price countries.

TD
"Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states lead to a fragmentation of the European Union's single market and keep consumer prices artificially high," the  Commission said in a statement.

The market for Pokemon cards and stickers was worth more than 600 million euros (about 727 million dollars) in the European Economic Area in 2000, the year that the Commission's probe relates to.

The European Commission said Wednesday it has  fined Topps Co., a New York-based maker of collectible cards and stickers, 1.59 million  euros for keeping the prices of Pokemon goods artificially high by discouraging distributors from selling across borders between EU nations.

The executive body of the  European Union said in a statement that  Topps, which has subsidiaries in various EU countries, has blocked fair competition among distributors and thereby forced EU children and their families to pay more for Pokemon goods.

TD
Topps earlier obtained a license from Nintendo Co. of Japan to use the designs of Pokemon cartoons in producing collectible stickers and trading cards.
The fine is equivalent to 215 million yen or $1.93 million.

According to the  commission, Topps repeatedly asked distributors in several EU countries to help it monitor parallel imports of Pokemon goods by distributors that are not designated by  Topps in order to prevent Pokemon goods in low-price EU nations from streaming into high-price nations.

The European Commission found that the price of one Pokemon product in Finland is 2.4 times that of the same product in Portugal. There are sharp differences in prices among EU member states.

"Topps entered into a series of agreements with several of its distributors in the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain with the objective of preventing parallel imports of stickers and other collectible products bearing the image of Pokemon," the  commission found.
Distributors who did not comply with  Topps' supervision policy were threatened with supply cuts, the
commission said.

The market for Pokemon stickers, cards and other collectible products bought by children was worth more than 600 million  euros in the EU area in 2000, when the craze for Pokemon goods was at its zenith. The figure is equal to 81 billion yen or $726.57 million.

Topps broke European Union competition law by restricting imports of Pokemon stickers and cards from low-price countries, the EU's regulatory body said.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Topps Co. (TOPP) confirmed the  European Union Commission fined it EUR1.59 million , or $1.92 million, in connection with its distribution of the popular Pokemon stickers and cards in Europe.

A company spokesman said the  fine will be reflected in the company's fiscal first-quarter results. Wall Street expects the company to post earnings of 9 cents a share for the quarter ending May
31, according to Thomson First Call. The company posted a profit of $3.5 million, or 8 cents a share, for the comparable year-ago period.

In a press release Wednesday, the maker of baseball cards and Bazooka bubble gum said the
commission began an investigation of the products' distribution by  Topps units in 2000.

In a separate statement, the E.U.  Commission said the company had barred imports from low price to high-price countries. "Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states led to a fragmentation of the E.U.'s single market and kept consumer prices artificially high."

Topps distributes collectible Pokemon stickers and cards under license from Pokemon trademark owner, Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd. (7974.OK).

At midday Wednesday,  Topps shares traded at $8.55 on Nasdaq, up 9 cents, or 1.1%. Composite volume was 125,820 shares, compared with the stock's average daily trading volume of 80,675 shares.

Topps distributes collectible Pokemon stickers and cards under license from Pokemon trademark owner, Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd. (7974.OK). [ 26-05-04 0930GMT ]
The market for Pokemon stickers and cards was worth over EUR600 million in the  European
Economic Area in 2000.

The E.U.  Commission said they found evidence that  Topps charged up to 243% more in Finland compared with Portugal, where the stickers and cards are the cheapest. Regulators added the company asked distributors to trace parallel imports and threatened to terminate supplies if they didn't comply.
"Such unlawful partitioning of the  European market represents a hardcore violation," the E.U.
Commission added.

However, since Topps acknowledged the existence of the agreements and ended them immediately after receiving a warning by the E.U.  Commission, regulators only imposed a small  fine.

Under the E.U.'s antitrust rules, companies can be charged up to 10% of annual worldwide revenue for antitrust offenses.  Topps reported 2003 sales of over $290 million.

BRUSSELS, May 26 (AFP) -

European anti-trust regulators  fined a US-controlled group nearly 1.6 million  euros (1.92 million dollars) Wednesday for ripping off children collecting Pokemon stickers.

TD
The Topps group illegally blocked "parallel imports" of stickers, cards and sweets bearing the Japanese cartoon characters from countries in  Europe where they were cheaper to more expensive ones, the European Commission found.

The campaign resulted in Finnish children paying 2.5 times more for the pleasure of swapping collectible cards showing Pikachu and friends than children in Portugal, according to the  European Union's executive branch.

After a year-long investigation, the  commission said "Topps repeatedly asked its distributors to trace back parallel imports and to monitor the final destination of the products".
"Those who did not comply were threatened with supply cuts," it said in a statement.

The fine was set at a relatively low 1.59 million  euros (1.93 million dollars) as the illegal practice was of short duration and  Topps stopped the infringement immediately after receiving a warning from Brussels.

According to the commission, the European market for stickers, cards and other collectible products was worth 600 million euros in 2000, the year for which  Topps fell under investigation.

The group was found guilty of preventing parallel imports through its subsidiaries in Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
The ubiquitous Pokemon characters were originally developed by Japanese company Nintendo for its
"Game Boy" machine and were licensed to  Topps for a range of spin-off products.

BRUSSELS, May 26 (Reuters) -  Topps Co. Inc (TOPP.O) was  fined 1.6 million euros ($1.94 million) by the European Commission on Wednesday for keeping prices high on Pokemon collectibles for children by discouraging distributors from selling across borders.

The Commission fined the company for an elaborate strategy to prevent imports of the children's items from low-price to high-price countries in 2000 in the  European Union, saying it was distorting competition.

TD
"The anti-competitive behaviour by  Topps made families in high-price countries pay more for Pokemon stickers than they would have done if competitive market forces had been in play," the Commission said in a statement.
For example, the price in Finland was more than twice as high as the price in Portugal, the
Commission said.
The practices also involved distributors in Britain, Italy, Germany, France and Spain.

The decision itself involved the Topps company and its subsidiaries  Topps Europe and Topps UK, both in Britain, and Irish-based Topps International and  Topps Italia.

The Commission said that the  fine was relatively low because of the short duration of the infringement and the fact that the practice was terminated as soon as the  Commission warned the company.

Topps obtained a licence to use Pokemon for the production of collectibles from trademark owner
Nintendo (7974.OS) of Japan, but Nintendo was not involved.

The Commission said the market for stickers, cards and other collectible products bought by children was worth more than 600 million  euros in the European Economic Area in 2000.
It has said that the craze for Pokemon cards reached  European playgrounds in the autumn of 1999. In order to prevent trade,  Topps repeatedly asked distributors in several EU countries to help it trace
back parallel imports and monitor the final destination of Pokemon products. Those who did not
comply with this distribution policy were threatened with supply cuts, the  Commission said.

Topps, founded in 1938, creates and markets confectionary and entertainment products.

AILING French engineering giant Alstom unveiled a long-awaited state-backed bail-out yesterday (26
May) that would pump up to l2.5 billion into its balance sheet and prevent a collapse. The rescue plan -
under which Paris would take up to a third of Alstom’s capital - won approval from competition chief
Mario Monti but was still awaiting the okay from Alstom’s banks as  European Voice went to press. Monti
said he had insisted on tough conditions, some of them secret, adding France had agreed to withdraw
from Alstom’s capital within four years. However, the maker of the country’s prized high- speed TGV
trains, heavy gas turbines and cruise ships vowed to hold on to its core businesses and said talk of
breaking up the company was "absurd", despite demands by Brussels that it form industrial tie-ups over
the next four years.

TOPPS was fined €1.6 million by the  Commission for keeping prices high on Pokemon collectibles for children by discouraging distributors from selling across borders.

A SWATHE of leading global forestry firms were raided by competition enforcers on Tuesday as part of anti-trust operations on both sides of the Atlantic regarding price-fixing and manipulation of markets for various paper products. Raids were carried out by local or EU anti-trust authorities at Finland’s
UPM-Kymmene, Stora Enso, Metsaliitto and M-real and Norway’s Norske Skog.

MEANWHILE, Mario Monti has issued a ‘statement of objections’ outlining his concerns about the market power that entertainment giants Sony and Bertelsmann would wield if they were allowed to combine their music units.

THE UK, Ireland, Denmark and Italy emerged as the most investment- friendly nations for telecoms operators, according to a report by the  European Competitive Telecommunications Association (ECTA). It said regulators in the four countries had done the best job of applying a new EU telecoms regime. Trailing the pack, however, were France, Belgium and Germany. ECTA said the leaders can expect to grab a bigger share of €19 billion investments in fixed networks predicted over the next three years.

WORLD oil trade should be switched to a basket of currencies, including the  euro, rather than be priced in dollars only, Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio said.

Gent will be a good foil for Garnier

Sir Chris Gent did the biggest deal in history when he was chief executive of Vodafone; now, as the next chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, he is joining one of a handful of British firms capable of breaking that record.

TD
Not just yet, of course. Glaxo's shares are still down in the mud - pounds 11.50, rather than the pounds
20 of a few years ago. Mega deals would be tricky from that base, but Big Pharma's long-term addiction
to big deals should never be underestimated, even if the evidence suggests the leaders are already so
big they border on unmanageable.

As chairman, though, Gent's direct responsibility is to manage the board rather than the company. The biggest battle - over chief executive JP Garnier's pay - has already been fought and the institutions seem placated.

The bigger boardroom challenge will be to restore some swagger to Britain's pharmaceutical champion. Garnier - often abroad, always reticent - is a detail man and no charmer.

Gent might just be a good foil - a salesman who is willing to be a bit of an ambassador. Those skills will always be valued by this industry: rather than novel science, drug companies' profits these days seem to be mostly dependent on persuading governments to fund ever-expanding healthcare budgets. Gent
& Garnier has promise.
Rewards for failure

Edward Roderick was yesterday turfed out as chief executive of Christian Salvesen and, frankly, one wonders why it took so long.

The business is a perennial underper former and has been a miserable investment. Ten years ago the shares stood at 100p, as they did when Mr Roderick arrived in 1997. Yesterday they closed at 50p.

In the last three years Mr Roderick has issued five profits warnings and seen off a pounds 500m takeover bid. The company is now valued at pounds 130m.

Last year investors revolted against Mr Roderick's two-year contract. They were concerned about potential rewards for failure and they were right to be worried. Mr Roderick will now collect more than pounds 800,000 - or about pounds 160,000 per profit warning.
No defence

There is something strange - if not reckless - about the government's willingness to see defence assets sold overseas. Yesterday, just as the EU was agreeing to French support for the Alstom engineering company, Britain's GKN agreed the sale of its Westland helicopters unit to Finmeccanica of Italy.



Page 17 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Part of the concern about the defence sector is the speed with which the sell-off is taking place. Westland is being sold for pounds 1bn a month after Alvis agreed a pounds 309m takeover by General Dynamics of the US.
BAE is meanwhile talking to foreign buyers about the potential sale of its ship and submarine yards in
Britain while openly looking for a foreign - probably American- partner, if not buyer.

Other countries with major defence interests - most obviously America and France - would not let their key defence contractors move abroad.

Neither would they think of handing out huge chunks of military contracts to foreign firms when their own businesses were struggling. Finmeccanica has already talked of the need to cut costs at AgustaWestland and it is not hard to conclude that it will favour British cuts over Italian ones. Finmeccanica is still part-owned by the government, and chopping local jobs would cause a political storm. At the Yeovil Westland plant, however, political hassle will be limited. And, of course, British employment laws make any redundancies cheaper.

This is not to suggest that BAE should be simply given contracts, or that some of the ways it wins contracts should be condoned. But there is scope for British defence interests to be given a steadier pipeline of potential orders.

Westland has hit trouble because it has virtually no short-term contracts. GKN cannot handle this but Finmeccanica is willing to pay decent money because its supportive government allows it to plan a long-term business.

Fine time for Topps

Remember Pokemon cards? They were all the rage back in the 1990s. Parents will also recall the feeling that the little packets were a rip-off. Well they were right. The  European commission yesterday fined Topps, the US company which made the cards, for stitching up the market so that distributors in several European countries - including Britain - were unable to import cheaper cards from elsewhere in Europe, thus keeping prices artificially high.

It is a flagrant abuse of the rules that established the European Union in a market that, at its height, was worth euros 600m a year. So how much was Topps fined? Just euros 1.6m.

The commission said yesterday the reason for the paltry  fine was that Topps ended its illegal agreements once their illicit nature was pointed out. That was in 2000, when Pokemon was already so over. It then took the EU an astonishing four years to clobber  Topps - even though the firm admitted the breach.

This fine is therefore no deterrent to any other company in a fast-moving, fad-driven industry doing exactly the same again. Parents be warned.

The European commission yesterday fined the maker of Pokemon stickers and cards  euros 1.6m (pounds 1.1m) for keeping the price of the collectibles artificially high in Britain and parts of mainland Europe.

The commission said Topps Company, of New York, had prevented distributors from importing cards and stickers from other parts of the EU where prices were lower.

TD
Topps, famous in the US for its baseball cards, made agreements with distributors in Britain, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain to stem the flow of cheap cards, and threatened to stop supplying cards to distributors who refused to help it discover who was providing cheaper imports.

"Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states led to a fragmentation of the EU's sin gle market and kept consumer prices artificially high," the  commission said.

"In this case, the anti-competitive behaviour by  Topps made families in high-price countries pay more for Pokemon stickers than they would have done if competitive market forces had been at play."

During its investigation the  commission found that  Topps charged up to 243% more in Finland for Pokemon cards and stickers, depicting characters from the video game and TV series, than it did in Portugal,  Europe's cheapest market for the cards.

The market for Pokemon cards (pictured being swapped by children at a fair in Epsom) - is estimated to have been worth  euros 600m at the height of their popularity in 2000.
The commission said its fine was relatively small as  Topps had admitted to the agreements.

Wells Fargo is buying all the assets of Strong Financial, the Wisconsin-based mutual fund company whose founder and principal owner was banned from the industry last week because of his involvement in a trading scandal. Terms for the sale of Strong's $34 billion in assets under management were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that the transaction could be worth as much as $700 million. Wells Fargo's total assets under management would grow to $217 billion. Wells Fargo and Strong Financial, which is 85 percent owned by Richard Strong, had been rumored to be in talks for months, and the settlement had cleared the way for a sale.

Alstom's state-supported, multibillion-dollar bailout is being backed by  European Union regulators, allowing the troubled engineering giant to keep core businesses. Under the deal between EU competition chief Mario Monti and France's finance minister, Alstom is to sell off activities representing about 10 percent of its revenue and will be barred from making acquisitions in the  European transport sector for four years.

China's wholesale prices soared to their highest levels in nearly eight years in April and consumer prices also leapt, the government reported. The National Bureau of Statistics said that the producer price index increased 5 percent year-to-year, the fastest increase since late 1996. Consumer prices rose by 3.8 percent, the sharpest increase in seven years, it said.

Milan prosecutors probing the bankruptcy of Parmalat Finanziaria made a second attempt to indict Calisto Tanzi, the food company's founder; a Bank of America unit; Deloitte & Touche; and the former Italian branch of Grant Thornton, accusing them of market manipulation, false statements and obstructing a market regular. A request for indictments and a fast-track legal process was rejected in March, but evidence needed to support the second request is less stringent because prosecutors have to demonstrate only that they have proof for a preliminary hearing.

Topps Co. was fined $1.9 million by the  European Union because of irregularities in the way it distributed the popular Pokemon stickers and cards in different  European countries. The  European      Commission said Topps had barred imports from countries where the cards and stickers were priced low, to those where the cards were priced higher, thus fragmenting the EU's single market for the items and keeping prices "artificially high."

The European Union fined Topps $1.9 million yesterday over its distribution of Pokemon stickers and cards in Europe. The European Commission said the company had barred importing the items from countries where they had low prices to those where they were more expensive. ''Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states led to a fragmentation of the E.U.'s single market and kept consumer prices artificially high,'' the  commission said. Topps distributes collectible Pokemon stickers and cards under license from the Nintendo Company of Japan, Pokemon's trademark owner. The European market was estimated at more than 600 million  euros ($720 million) in 2000, at the height of the cards' popularity. The  commission said it had found evidence that  Topps charged up to 243 percent more in Finland than in Portugal, where it charged the least within the union.

The European commission yesterday fined the maker of Pokemon stickers and cards  euros 1.6m (pounds 1.1m) for keeping the price of the collectibles artificially high in Britain and parts of mainland Europe.

The commission said Topps Company, of New York, had prevented distributors from importing cards and stickers from other parts of the EU where prices were lower.

TD
Topps, famous in the US for its baseball cards, made agreements with distributors in Britain, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain to stem the flow of cheap cards, and threatened to stop supplying cards to distributors who refused to help it discover who was providing cheaper imports.

"Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states led to a fragmentation of the EU's sin gle market and kept consumer prices artificially high," the  commission said.

"In this case, the anti-competitive behaviour by  Topps made families in high-price countries pay more for Pokemon stickers than they would have done if competitive market forces had been at play."

During its investigation the  commission found that  Topps charged up to 243% more in Finland for Pokemon cards and stickers, depicting characters from the video game and TV series, than it did in Portugal,  Europe's cheapest market for the cards.

The market for Pokemon cards (pictured being swapped by children at a fair in Epsom) - is estimated to have been worth  euros 600m at the height of their popularity in 2000.
The commission said its fine was relatively small as  Topps had admitted to the agreements. Photograph: Martin Godwin

Remember Pokemon cards? They were all the rage back in the 1990s. Parents will also recall the feeling that the little packets were a rip-off. Well they were right. The  European commission yesterday fined Topps, the US company which made the cards, for stitching up the market so that distributors in several European countries - including Britain - were unable to import cheaper cards from elsewhere
in Europe, thus keeping prices artificially high.

It is a flagrant abuse of the rules that established the European Union in a market that, at its height, was worth euros 600m a year. So how much was Topps fined? Just euros 1.6m.

TD
The commission said yesterday the reason for the paltry  fine was that Topps ended its illegal agreements once their illicit nature was pointed out. That was in 2000, when Pokemon was already so over. It then took the EU an astonishing four years to clobber  Topps - even though the firm admitted the breach.

This fine is therefore no deterrent to any other company in a fast-moving, fad-driven industry doing exactly the same again. Parents be warned.

Brussels, 27/05/2004 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission has imposed a 1.59 million EUR fine on Topps, a group of companies producing stickers and "Pokemon" collectors' cards, which are very popular with children, for having blocked imports of these products for countries where prices are low to ones with higher prices. This anti-competitive behaviour has caused a compartmentalisation of the European market and infringes  European rules, stresses the  Commission. Topps had concluded a series of agreements and implemented concerted practices with several of its distributors in the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain, in an attempt to block parallel imports of stickers and cards, and also confectionery items representing "Pokemon" characters, initially designed for the Nintendo "Game Boy" games console.  Topps obtained a sub-licence to feature these characters on several collectable items.

TD
This market was estimated at over 600 million EUR in the EEA in 2000, the year in which young consumers' infatuation for these products was at its height.

Following an inquiry, the  Commission was able to amass proof of  Topps's anti-competitive behaviour. Stating that the prices invoiced by the group to its distributors were up to 243% higher in Finland than in Portugal, where they were the lowest, the  Commission also demonstrated that  Topps had provided incentives for its distributors to stop parallel imports and keep an eye on the final destination of the products, on pain of reduced deliveries in future. Thus, families in countries practising higher prices had to pay more for stickers, cards and sweets than if competition had been able to play a role. The
Commission therefore decided to  fine Topps. However, given the brevity of the infringement and the fact that it was stopped immediately on receipt of a warning, the  Commission reduced the amount of the  fine.

Topps, a group of companies that produce collectable stickers and cards, has been found guilty of artificially hiking the price for the popular Pokémon stickers by limiting imports from low-price countries. Via a Decision adopted on May 26, the  European Commission imposed an overall fine on Topps of Euro 1.5 million. The relative leniency reflects the short duration of the infringement of EU competition rules and of its termination immediately after the company received a warning.

During its investigation, the  Commission found that  Topps had entered into a series of agreements with several of its distributors in the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Germany, France and Spain with the objective of preventing parallel imports of stickers and other collectable products bearing the image of Pokémon. Pokémon is the name for a whole range of characters originally developed for Nintendo but also used, under a licence, by  Topps to illustrate several collectable products.

TD
The Commission has evidence that  Topps worked out a strategy to prevent imports from low-price into high-price countries in 2000, when the price it invoiced to its distributors was up to 243% more in Finland than in Portugal, the cheapest market. According to the  Commission, Topps repeatedly asked its distributors to trace back parallel imports and to monitor the final destination of the products; those who did not comply were threatened with supply cuts.

The Commission Decision is addressed to The Topps Company Inc. and its subsidiaries:  Topps            Europe, Topps UK, Topps International, and Topps Italia.

---------- BOJ blames minus interest rates partly on yen-selling interventions

NEW YORK (AP) -  Topps Co. Thursday reported first-quarter earnings of $4.1 million, or 10 cents a share, up from $3.5 million, or 8 cents a share, last year. The latest period includes a charge of $1.9 million, or 5 cents a share, for a  fine by the European Commission related to high Pokemon prices.
A survey of anaylsts by Thomson First Call placed first-quarter earnings estimates at 9 cents a share.

The maker of confectionary and entertainment products said sales rose 15.9 percent to $88.1 million for the quarter, partially boosted by stronger foreign currencies.

First-quarter confectionery net sales fell 2.9 percent from the year-ago to $44.2 million. In addition to the continuation of certain trends affecting the U.S. confectionery industry in general, sales of Baby Bottle Pop were below last year's levels. Partially offsetting these factors was a favorable contribution from the further roll-out of two new chewy candy brands -- Juicy Bugs and Juicy Drop Chews -- and growing sales of Juicy Drop Pop.

Entertainment sales in the first quarter were $43.9 million, 44 percent above the first quarter last year. This increase was attributable to strong sales of sticker album collections featuring teams and players participating in the  European Cup, a tournament held every four years, as well as to higher sales of English Premier League products. Entertainment sales for the period were also impacted by the inclusion of results from WizKids, acquired last July, and strong demand for NBA trading cards.

OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the  Topps Company fiscal 2005 first quarter earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Betsy Brod with Brod & Schaffer. Please go ahead, ma'am.

TD
BETSY BROD, BROD & SCHAFFER: Thank you operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Topps Company fiscal 2005 first quarter conference call. Management will begin with formal remarks, and then we'll open the call up to take your questions. Before we begin, please let me read this Safe Harbor statement -- Today's call may contain forward-looking statements according to the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes the expectations contained in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance such expectations will prove to be correct. This information may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to factors detailed in the company's filings with the S.E.C.

With these formalities out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Arthur Shorin, Chairman and CEO. Arthur, you may begin.

ARTHUR SHORIN, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, CEO,  TOPPS COMPANY: Okay, Betsy. Hello, everyone, again. Thanks for dialing in. With me on the call is a small brigade. Cathy Jessup, CFO; Scott Silverstein, Executive Vice-President, who among other duties runs the entertainment section; Ron Boyum,
Vice-President of sales and marketing, general manager of domestic confections; Warren Friss, VP - Internet Activities and general counsel; and Mike Clancy calling in from Ireland, as promised. Mike is VP - International. Cathy is going to take you through a comprehensive business review, then as I said on the last call, Mike Clancy would join us and present briefly on international.

So there's a lot to cover today before we go to Q&A, so let's get right to Cathy and her business review. Cath?

CATHERINE JESSUP, VP, CFO, TOPPS COMPANY: Thank you, Arthur. And good morning, everyone. I'll be taking you through a review of Topps' financial results for the first quarter ended May 29, 2004, as well as providing insight on our financial expectations for the full year of fiscal 2005. Overall, financial results for the first quarter were very solid. On the confectionery business, we believe we are holding our own in an industry impacted by negative trends, including consumer concerns regarding nutrition, retail consolidation, and discounting by chocolate manufacturers. As you heard on the fourth quarter call, we're making certain changes to our packaging and product configuration, as well as to the way we approach the market in order to mitigate the impact of these trends going forward to the extent possible. Our entertainment business had an excellent quarter with both sales and margins showing strong gains versus the quarter last year. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash and stockholders equity posting increases versus the end of fiscal
'04, and that's after both a dividend payment and the continued repurchase of company stock. And, last, while no fine is a good fine, we're glad to have behind us the  European commission legal issue
stemming from the commission's assertion that we restricted trade of Pokemon cards in certain  European
markets four years ago.
Now to the details. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were 88.1 million dollars, up $12.1 million, or
15.9% from $76 million last year. Of the increase, $2.8 million was the result of stronger foreign currency
than a year ago. Income from operations for the quarter was $5.6 million versus $4.4 million, and net
income was $4.1 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, compared with $3.5 million, or 8 cents per share last
year. Results this year include the one-time non tax-deductible  European commission fine of $1.9 million,


Page 38 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
or almost 5 cents per diluted share. Were it not for the  fine, income from operations in the quarter this year would have been $7.5 million, and EPS would have been 15 cents.

Turning to sales, net sales of confectionery products in the quarter decreased 2.9% to $44.2 million, including a benefit from stronger  European currencies of $1.1 million. Softness in the quarter was largely the result of a reduction in Baby Bottle Pop sales in the U.S., a function of difficult comparisons against the introduction of Baby Bottle Pop with candy juice introduced in the quarter last year, as well as somewhat diminished product vitality. As I mentioned up front, we continue to be impacted by industry-wide confectionery issues. Specifically, consumer concern over childhood obesity and nutrition; retail consolidation, which results in fewer outlets from which to purchase our products; and continued
discounting by large chocolate manufacturers. We've developed an action plan to address these issues and are moving to implement it. Meanwhile, our newer confectionary products are having a positive impact. Sales of Juicy Drop Pops, which we began introducing in the second quarter of the last year, are strong, believed by an effective television advertising campaign, and the rollout of our Chewee products, Juicy
Drop Chews and Juicy Bugs, is also adding incrementally to sales. In addition,  European confectionery sales increased slightly in the quarter, driven by stronger currencies, and the expansion of Juicy Drop Pops. You'll hear moe about international from Mike Clancy in a few minutes. Contributed margins on the overall confectionery business were 29.4% in the quarter this year, a decrease of 80 basis points versus the first quarter last year. U.S. margins actually increased slightly in the period, while margins overseas were below year ago, largely as a result of the timing of advertising. We're proactively managing the profitability of our confectionery business through this somewhat difficult period with the expectation that full-year margins will be up year on year.

Turning to the entertainment segment. Entertainment sales in the quarter this year increased $13.4 million, or 44.1% to $43.9 million, with stronger  European currencies providing a $1.7 million benefit. WizKids, acquired in July of last year, added 5.4 million to net sales in the quarter, generating cash earning of
$500,000. And by cash earnings, I mean earnings before depreciation and purchase-related amortization, and broke even on a reported basis. Both sales and earnings for this operation came in ahead of internal expectations. We believe the steps taken to restructure the WizKids organization, improved forecasting and inventory management and stabilized performance have been successful, and we're shifting the focus to leveraging the skills of both companies in order to grow the existing business and expand in new gaining direction. Excluding the impact of WizKids, entertainment segment sales in the quarter increased 26%. A key factor was higher sales of  European sports sticker albums, which benefited from the addition of products featuring teams and players participating in the European Cup, which is a tournament held every
four years, growth of English premier league sales, and stronger European currencies. Sales of U.S. sports products also exceeded year-ago levels, largely due to strong demand for basketball products. And sales of non-sports publishing products were similarly strong despite a drop-off in demand for  Topps Yu-Gi-Oh! products. Barbie mini albums in Italy, Wacky Packages in the U.S., and a new Garbage Pail Kids sticker series drove the solid performance. Finally, sales of internet products in the quarter were below year ago. We did not repeat the heavy investment in advertising that occurred last year and have begun testing a
new direction that incorporates fantasy style games and trading capabilities. To date, the new direction has yielded increased traffic and activity on the E  Topps site, and we'll continue to test with both basketball and football products in order to more fully evaluate its potential. Internet costs are down significantly, requirements in a pre-tax loss of $350,000 in the quarter this year, versus a loss of $1.2 million last year. Were it not for the deferral of revenue into the second half of the year, internet operations would have been break even in the quarter this year. First quarter contributed margins on the entertainment business were
30.6%, up more than 7 points versus last year. Several factors contributed to favorable margins including improved profitability on U.S. sports and internet operations, the absence of costs associated with the discontinuance of Cool Junk last year, and strong non-sports licenses which better leveraged our fixed costs.

Turning to the P&L, the first quarter gross profit margin of 38.4% was 1.4 percentage points above last year. This was largely the result of a mix shift favoring our entertainment business which generally has higher gross profit margins than the confectionery business. The absence this year of Cool Junk obsolescense costs also had positive relative impact. Other income in the quarter of $433,000 was below last year's figure of just over $600,000, largely due to the recent stabilization of the U.S. dollar. This resulted in the absence of mark to market gains on foreign exchange contracts, as well as foreign
exchange gains on cash balances held overseas, both of which contributed positively to last year's quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $28.6 million, up from $24.3 million last year. As a percent of sales, SG&A was
32.5% this year, up from 32%. The dollar increase of 4.3 million was primarily a function of two things. First,
the addition of WizKids, which added $1.7 million of overhead costs and just over $400,000 in
acquisition-related amortization expense, and, second, the $1.9 million  European commission fine. Cost
savings initiatives instituted last year, served to virtually offset higher legal costs, salary inflation, and the
impact of stronger  European currency. Were it not for the one-time  fine, total SG&A would have been


Page 39 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
30.3% of sales, down 1.7 percentage points from last year's quarter. Total advertising and marketing expenses in the quarter were $9.5 million, flat with year ago.

Going further down the P&L, interest income of $484,000 was $550,000 below the comparable quarter, due to last year's receipts from the IRS of interest on an income tax refund. And the first quarter tax rate of 33%, representing our best estimate of the full year -- and our fax rate was 33%, which represents our best estimate of the full year rate. It has been driven above previous expectations by the inconclusion of the European commission fine and it's non-deductability.
Moving to the balance sheet, cash at the end of the quarter was $96.4 million, an increase of 2.5 million
from year-end. Working capital excluding cash decreased 1.4 million from the end of fiscal '04. This was the
result of the favorable timing of marketing and royalty payments, and the accrual of the European              
commission fine, which will be paid in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these changes, inventory
balances increased in the quarter this year, due to a delay in reducing Baby Bottle Pop purchases in line
with weaker sales and pre-production costs related to second quarter publishing sales. We spent $750,000
on capital expenditures in the quarter, down approximately $100,000 from last year. We also paid our
regular quarterly cash dividend of four cents a share, or $1.6 million, and spent another $1.3 million to
acquire 143,800 shares of our stock at an average price of $8.95. We continue to be debt-free. Our credit
agreement expires in a couple of days, and is in the process of being renegotiated. We've obtained a
three-month extension in order to allow plenty of time to finalize discussions with the bank. And last,
stockholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $221.6 million, up a few hundred thousand dollars for the
year end.

Finally, I would like to share with you our financial outlook for the full year of fiscal 2005. Over all, and excluding the $1.9 million  European commission fine, our current financial outlook is in line with the plan as discussed on our last conference call. We're still anticipating a return to operating earnings growth this year, and are maintaining our forecast of a 10 to 15% increase in pre-tax earnings. However, there have been changes in our businesses since the last conference call, which impact the way in which we expect to generate this growth. Let me provide a little more detail. As discussed, the U.S. confectionery industry is undergoing change, putting pressure on sales and margins and prompting adjustments to the way we do business. Our current forecast for the confectionery segment overall calls for flat full year sales, with domestic declines offset by growth overseas. Spending on the confectionery business is being carefully reviewed and modified to fit the current market environment. We're not doing anything that compromises
the long-term growth of the segment, but rather are redirecting spending to where it will do the most good. As a result, we continue to believe that full year confectionery margins will be above last year, despite the projection for flat sales.

Turning to entertainment, the combination of a decline in demand for Yu-Gi-Oh! products and the absence of hockey, due to anticipated unrest between the players and owners, is expected to result in lower full year segment sales this year than last. However, due largely to the strength experienced in the first quarter,
we're now projecting a mid-single digit decline for the segment, an improvement from our earlier estimates. Within entertainment, international sports sales are expected to be strong as a result of having marketed products associated with the  European Cup, and we're holding to our full year sales figure of $18 million
for WizKids, an increase over fiscal 2004 due to a full year of ownership. Last, while sales of licensed
non-sports publishing products have shown growth to date, we're not expecting them to be up for the year
due to the Yu-Gi-Oh! decline. However, we secured the rights for Star Wars cars during the quarter, and
other deals are under discussion, so the potential exists for a higher sales forecast on this part of the
business. Entertainment earnings for the year are expected to be above those in fiscal 2004, despite the
somewhat lower sales. This is largely a function of a substantially reduced loss on our internet operations
to approximately $400,000 pre-tax, versus $2.7 million last year, as well as the expectation that WizKids will
at least break even on a cash basis. That is, before depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.8
million.

Moving to overhead, we expect costs, excluding the  European commission fine, to be up somewhat this year, despite initiatives throughout the company which have reduced year-over-year costs by $3 million. Cost increases are driven primarily by the anticipation of higher employee incentive payments, triggered by improved earnings, stronger  European currencies, and a full year of WizKids ownership. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we've increased our full year tax rate to 33%, due to the addition and non-deductability
of the European commission fine. So that's the outlook for fiscal '05 as it stands today. The fiscal year is off to a solid start, with first quarter performance significantly above last year, and full year earnings projections, while reflective of changes experienced to date in each of our businesses are in line with previous expectations.
With that said, I'll now turn it back over to you, Arthur.

ARTHUR SHORIN: Thank you very much, Cathy. Well done. Let's head overseas now to Mike Clancy who rus our international operation.

MICHAEL CLANCY, VP - INTERNATIONAL,  TOPPS COMPANY: Thank you, Arthur. Good morning, everyone. Sorry for missing the year-end call, as I was in Asia on important business. Just a reminder that Topps international business covers sales and marketing of  Topps products in all areas excluding the USA, Canada, and Mexico, which are handled by the U.S. International employs over 80 people with
offices in the U.K., Ireland, Italy, and South America, and country-based managers in Japan and Germany. Like domestic, International has two business segments -- confectionery, and entertainment. As I mentioned on a previous call, while brands are tools of power in  Topps domestic markets, innovation and strong licenses are also drivers in the international theater. On the confectionery sign of the business, we had growth primarily from the successful rollout of Juicy Drop Pops in major markets such as Spain and Japan. And on the entertainment side of our business, our continued investment in the English (INAUDIBLE), Italian soccer, and other  European football-related sticker collection continues to yield double-digit sales growth in our sports business. As you know, we also extended our mini album with bubble gum concept to non-sport licenses such as Barbie, Pokemon, and Yu-Gi-Oh!. Strategically, we complemented this innovation and development of strong licenses with the major focus on expanding confectionery distribution. This was with a view to brand building and increasing sustainability. We gained
important placement in mass retailers in the U.K., France, Germany, Ireland, and Norway, and we continue to look for additional gains in this respect.

Now, looking to the future, for international candy business, we continue to focus on our three-part strategy for growth. First, build existing brands by achieving sustainable distribution and mass retailers. Second, as I mentioned earlier, innovation is a key driver in international candy sales. In the second half of this year, we plan to test launch at least one new candy product on a regional basis. If it is successful, we will roll this product out over other regions in the new year. And third, we will look for growth via geographic expansion. We are exploring feasibility or suitability of our products in new markets such as India.

International entertainment business has three parts. That's sports, non-sports sticker albums/collections, and collectible games. With respect to sports, we have three main strategic targets. First is to continue to develop our England Premier League rights, the 2004 sticker collection was the third year in a row that we achieved significant double-digit growth. We will work to continue this trend in 2005, with combinations of product innovation, refreshment and aggressive promotions. We will build on the major success to date with our 2004 Italian soccer collection. Here we have created a completely new format for collector, which packages mini stickers of football as with gum in a flow pack, and supply this with free albums for the kids.
In only our second year, we have achieved substantial growth year on year in our Italian football collection. Our plan is to capitalize on this momentum in the next collection. Finally coming off a strong international sports year, we plan to broaden our sports base with new collections around country leagues and other tournaments such as the World Cup that comes around every four years. The next World Cup is in 2006. Our non-sports sticker collections for us -- within  Topps, non-sport sports sticker collections are more a port of Topps international business than domestic. Here our strategy will continue to involve the selected development of entertainment licenses. This year we plan to launch Garbage Pail Kids in France. Here it's branded La Cradle, the same name used when it was a success in the '80s. And other sticker collections planned for launch in fiscal '05 are Sponge Bob in Germany, (INAUDIBLE), and in new Russia, a Japanese animated series. As to collectible games, we are working on the assimilation of the WizKids product range into our international business with a focus on testing new market initiatives and marketing programs to
grow the international side of the WizKids business.

So in summary, internationally we continue the emphasis on leveraging our expertise, infrastructure, and general capabilities. We will invest in building more sustainable distribution in mass merchandisers while continuing to complement this with innovation and exploitation of editorial and sports licenses. Thanks for your attention. Off to you, Arthur.
ARTHUR SHORIN: Thank you very much, Mike. Operator, let's open the call to Q&A, please. OPERATOR: If you would like to ask a question on today's conference, you may press the star key
followed by the digit one on your touch-tone telephone. Again, it is star one to ask a question. If you are on
speakerphone equipment, please make sure the mute function is turned off so your signal can reach us.
Again, it is star one. And we'll pause a moment to assemble our roster. And we'll take our first question
from Jim Barnett with CL King & Associates
JIM BARRETT (ph), ANALYST, CL KING & ASSOCIATES: That's Jim Barrett. Good morning, everybody. ARTHUR SHORIN: Good morning, Jim.
JIM BARRETT (ph): Arthur, this may a question for you or Mike Clancy, but can you shed any light on why the sticker market in  Europe is so more -- so much more vibrant than the traditional card market in the U.S. The reasons for that, and how those dynamics may change as we look forward?
ARTHUR SHORIN: I should --

Page 41 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JIM BARRETT (ph): Go ahead.

MICHAEL CLANCY: Jim, in  Europe, the sticker market is a traditional format for collections. And sport in the last three years for us has been particularly vibrant due to a combination of factors. It has been the competitiveness of leagues, but also a change in the formats we have presented to the market and much more aggressive promotions. For instance we were in league in the U.K. with a major newspaper publisher where we gave away over a million sticker albums. So this is new format and new promotions

JIM BARRETT (ph): I see. That's helpful. Arthur, there are any lessons learned in  Europe that could be applied to the U.S., or do you still see the U.S. as being in a longer term secular decline?

ARTHUR SHORIN: Well, I think there -- interesting enough, we are in the process of testing, getting some experience under our belt with many sticker album collections, and there are some things relative to distribution that, frankly, I wouldn't want to detail on this call, but there are some things in terms of distribution practices that might have some application over here. I think that is similar over here that is over there is that we have some very good people on both sides of the pond, and that really does make a difference.
JIM BARRETT (ph): Sure. And then finally, Arthur, could you comment on the sports collect initiative? ARTHUR SHORIN: I'll ask Scott to do that.
SCOTT SILVERSTEIN, EVP,  TOPPS COMPANY: I'm sorry, I didn't -- the sports collection initiative? Right now, sports collection has been out there. It has been the out there for -- since, I guess we launched it in February or March time period. It's really performing below our internal expectations right now. It has not triggered the type of enthusiasm and game play that he wad hoped for. We are currently making some very fairly significant product modifications that we're excited about, and will be launching again next year. So we're far from over on sports collections, although we were less than overwhelmed by the performance this year.
JIM BARRETT (ph): Thank you very much.
OPERATOR: We will go next to Robert Soft with Sidoti & Company.

ROBERT SOFT (ph), ANALYST, SIDOTI & COMPANY: Good morning. A couple of questions. The first relates to eTopps. Cathy had given a little kind of updating on where we stand. If you could provide a little more detail, kind of how things are going right now, having changed the format recently. And then as WizKids revenue, I have heard 18 million. I'm not 100% sure if I heard that correctly. If you could detail that. And if that is the case, it looks like it's quite a bit lower than what it was in 2002, and I just wanted to touch base on why, you know, leading -- what led to some of the short falls.
ARTHUR SHORIN: Warren, would you answer the question on eTopps please?

WARREN FLISS, VP- INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND GENERAL COUNSEL,  TOPPS COMPANY: Sure. So far the games that we've instituted for baseball in the trading have gone very well. We've had about 65,000 trades executed with eTopps cards. There have been about 25,000 games played so far during baseball season. And within our community, albeit still a small community be hate has gone very well. Definitely brought people back and increased the activity. The next test, though, is now we want to do some research and see if be can use to the things to attract more people to eTopps. And, you know, we're not going to invest the kind of money in advertising that we have in the past, because we want to make sure we don't, you know, sustain the same kind of losses until we do some testing and see whether those concepts can appeal to the broader group than we have now. So that's really the next step for us, is to see whether the trading and the games can appeal to that broader group.

ROBERT SOFT (ph): Okay. Now, a question. As far as revenue deferral Cathy talked about, is that just orders that you have on hand?
WARREN FLISS: Yeah, that's orders are that we've -- ecards that we've sold, but we can't -- CATHERINE JESSUP: This is a production issue. We haven't produced the cards yet. ROBERT SOFT (ph): Understood.
CATHERINE JESSUP: But that will be a pick up then in the second half of the year. ROBERT SOFT (ph): Sure. And then the WizKids?
WARREN FLISS: Scott will address that.

Page 42 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCOTT SILVERSTEIN: On the WizKids side, sales are lower, significantly lower this year for a number of reasons. First of all, as we talked about at the end of the year ending call, we've rationalized the line. We've cut a number of releases out from the line. There was, I guess, lower sales per line, as well, you know, the business was softer this year than it was last year, although we are seeing a buildup of momentum again
as we've made some of these changes. And we've changed some of the inventory and purchasing practices, which have, you know, a corresponding result of taking away some of the upside, but it does protect us on the down side. So it's really a combination of all of those things that are contributing to the year-on-year comparisons.
ROBERT SOFT (ph): Okay. Great, thank you.
OPERATOR: As a reminder to our participants that is star one to ask a question. We go next to Denis
McAlpine, with McAlpine & Associates.

DENNIS MCALPINE, ANALYST, MCALPINE AND ASSOCIATES: Thank you. Good morning. Would you talk about the internet revenue for the quarter and the expectations for the year, and what your plans are? This looks like it's getting downsized, and gradually just going to sort of disappear. When do you put it out of its misery and not do anymore with it, or go in a totally different direction? And then second, you mentioned Yu-Gi-Oh! is dying. Is that in a terminal phase, or is there likely to be a pick up again?

ARTHUR SHORIN: Just before I ask Warren to comment on the internet thing, which we're not going to let it die, there's too much opportunity there, I think. But relative to Yu-Gi-Oh!, we think the boom is quite off the road and do not anticipate seeing much more activity with  Topps Yu-Gi-Oh! products. Warren, could you just touch on that?

WARREN FLISS: Sure. And Cathy is going to have to help you with the numbers, because I don't have those handy. But from a strategic standpoint, we continue to feel that the internet is a very important place to be for us. Being in sports, being in entertainment, being a company that markets to kids, we're not going to ignore the internet, and whether or not eTopps is exactly the right thing for it, as I mentioned, we're still not sure, and we need to do some more testing. Now that we've changed the focus of eTopps to more gaming and trading, we need to see whether it can appeal to more people before we decide whether we decide it's something that we're going to continue to pursue. But whether it's eTopps or something else, the internet in and of itself is not something that we plan to walk away from.

CATHERINE JESSUP: I mean just in terms of the numbers, I mean, you're right, the sales are down in the quarter, versus a year ago, and we expect them to be down for the year. We're looking at something, you know, in the $5 million range for full year sales. But I think the important thing is that we're in a test phase with this business. We're testing a concept. The sales are down. The losses are down dramatically. And, you know, so it's not that this isn't working, it's that we're testing a new phase, and we have the case well under control.
DENNIS MCALPINE: That would put first quarter internet sales at about $1.5 million?

CATHERINE JESSUP: The first quarter internet sales were just under a million. About $980,000. That was total. But the other thing, I'm sorry just to throw in, there was a significant deferral, and I think this may have been alluded to earlier. We were not producing for the most part in the first quarter. So that is impacting sales, cutting them almost in half. And we'll pick that up in the second half of the year.
DENNIS MCALPINE: So it was 900 of deferred revenue?
CATHERINE JESSUP: Not quite that much, but it was a significant deferral.

OPERATOR: Again, as a reminder, it is star one to ask a question. Again, if you are on speaker phone equipment, please be sure your mute function is disengaged so your signal can reach us. Again that is star one. Again star one for questions. We'll take a follow-up from Jim Barrett with CL King & Associates.

JIM BARRETT (ph): Yes, Arthur, could -- you mentioned the U.S. confectionery business being difficult. Could you quantify that with the scanning data in terms of what the category trends are, and, if possible, how your market share has performed given those trends? And also if you had any retail pricing trends, as well.

ARTHUR SHORIN: Yes. I'll ask Ron to pick up after a couple of top line comments. First, we strongly believe that we have actually picked up share in the -- over the last six months, and certainly in the last quarter. However, having said that, I'm really loathe to press the point, because the information that we have is really so difficult to put together that I don't want to characterize it as a sure thing. We purchased Nielsen, we purchased -- we get retail link from Wal-Mart, put Nielson doesn't cover Wal-Mart. We have certain sources of data, but they're just too incomplete to give you a highly reliable answer. That said, we know from distribution studies that we do ourselves that we're giving a very good account of ourselves out
Page 43 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
there. There are issues, as you have heard Cathy mention. One of them, this child obesity thing, is something that we think we have a couple of things to say about. That is, a Ring Pop, for example, has 70 calories. You all might be surprised to find that so does an Oreo cookie. A Ring Pop takes over 30 minutes to consume; an Oreo cookie takes somewhere in the area of 6 to 10 seconds. I've never heard of a portion size of one Oreo cookie. At least I'm never able to get away with that with my grandson. Other things that are candy products that are ubiquitous -- Starbursts; one Ring Pop equals three and a half Starbursts. One Ring Pop or Push pop is like one quarter of a regular sized Snicker bar. There are statistics such as that that start to become the basis of an interesting story for consumers. We have been in touch with top nutritionists, people that are truly in the know and highly respected. We really believe that we have an argument, but there is a requirement for consumer education. Right now, we're finding that mom is
reaching out to buy things that are actually not as good for the kids as they think that they are, but there is this wave that has been affecting everybody, I think, in the candy business. The best information that we have now, and I was out in the field just day before yesterday, and heard retailers saying that the carb
issue is toning down dramatically. So as a community of consumers, we've gone through low-fat, now we're going through carbs. I think we're probably going to end with moderation. But I think  Topps can do some things to get our story across, and I think we've got a good story. At the end of the day, what we're selling is candy, and it's a treat. And nutritionists say, yeah, candy is candy. And maybe the worst part of their
concern relative to candy is those manufacturers that start saying it's therapeutic. It has vitamin C and Vitamin A and contains fruit. At the end of the day, it's candy, and when compare our candies with other candies on the market, they compare very favorably with some of these important measures. Ron, do you want to mention in answer to his question something about share and distribution?

RON BOYUM, VP - SALES AND MARKETING, GENERAL MANAGER,  TOPPS COMPANY: Yes, first in terms of share. We do subscribe to Nielson data, as well as have pretty detailed information from key retailers through Scan Data. What has complicated the syndicated data -- meaning Nielson data right now is there's an enormous number of new SKUs being added that we're trying to sort through and recategorize. For example, Atkins low carb bars fall into the chocolate candy bar segment. And there's sugar- free hard candies that are falling into traditional hard candies. And in order for us to really evaluate where we are and understand share better, we're sorting through that data, and categorizing that data better. And that is why, just for a snapshot today, we aren't going to comment specifically on numbers until we have them sorted out. But we do have that data, and it's a matter of go through the data in more detail. As far as perspective, though, I'll tell you this -- having worked out in the field recently and called a number of key customer myself, and having attended a national confectionery association trade show in Chicago, and talked to dozens of customers and brokers and distributors, I feel very safe in saying that anecdotally, the knowledge that we're getting back from the retail trade from our customers is that we are doing very well in terms of our direct competitors, and that we are outperforming some key SKUs and brands that would be logically compared to ours.

ARTHUR SHORIN: I think the other thing that you had mentioned, or asked about, was pricing activity. There is no pricing activity. The is no price inflation the last quarter relative to  Topps. There is a tremendous a mount of price cutting out there. In Texas, a couple of days ago, I saw where Hershey Bars, Hershey had raised there are price to 55 cents per par, and I saw them selling it four for a dollar. I must admit, I bought a couple myself.
JIM BARRETT (ph): Okay. Thank you very much.
OPERATOR: We'll go next to Beth Lilly with Woodland Partners. BETH LILLY, ANALYST, WOODLAND PARTNERS: Good morning. ARTHUR SHORIN: Good morning.
BETH LILLY: I had a couple of questions. Kind of as a follow-up to Jim's question on the confectionery side. You know, you talked about observations that you have of what's going on the confectionery business, and, Arthur, you talked about how the low fat trend and now the low carb trend and how you see that
moderating. Can you talk about whether -- Cathy mentioned this in her opening remarks. You developed an action plan on the confectionery side, and you're implementing it. Can you delve a little bit more deeply into what you're doing to kind of counter what's going on the market?

ARTHUR SHORIN: Yeah, sure. You want to -- you want us to answer that and then come to your next question?
BETH LILLY: Yep. That would be great.
ARTHUR SHORIN: Sure. Ron, why don't you address that.

RON BOYUM: Let me touch on a couple of highlights. One is Cathy had mentioned trade consolidation, and as the larger customers get larger, we have been actively developing customer teams and adding
Page 44 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
resource teams in support of those customers, and have implemented that. In fact, that's what Arthur has been out in the the field the past couple of days meeting with some of the people who are on these customer teams. And we feel very good about the impact we are making in terms of business relationships with these top retailers. We've also implemented some new packaging into key customers, like our club segment. Already we're seeing the benefits of that, particularly on the Ring Pop brand. In terms of new
products, in terms of the best part of the strategy, we're actually seeing the performance of Juicy Drop Pops beginning to accelerate. I was going through data as recently as yesterday. And we've seen strong
week-by- week growth, and it's now exceeding our original forecast. Coming to the -- so those are three areas of development, focusing on trade consolidation. Work with our key partners, and then focusing very specifically on new products. In terms of nutritional concerns, Arthur talked about some of what we're doing already. The first step was to really do in-depth comprehensive R&D analysis of how our products stack up against other brands and products on key management such as calories, carbs, and sugar content. And as Arthur commented, we're actually pretty favorable, and we need to find a way to get that communicated to consumers and to the trade. We're also in the process of conducting next week research with parents to
find out more from parents about their perspective on kids, on consumption of candy and other snacks, so we can better understand how we can position and market our products against not only the kids, but against the parents, and letting them know that these products aren't necessarily the villains they they may be currently described as. So we're really aggressively going against trade consolidation, as Cathy said. We are looking at the nutritional and childhood obesity concerns. And lastly as relates to chocolate pricing that Arthur commented on, we have lined up some value pricing promotions with key retailers for later this
year that will put us in position to offer some excite consumer values in key retailers before the close of this calendar year. So those are some thing that I think actually speak to the issues Cathy raised in her comments.
ARTHUR SHORIN: What is your next part of the question, Beth?

BETH LILLY: My next question is, and it gets -- it dovetails into it. So you talked about on the confectionery side the full year margins in 2005 are going to be above the margins in 2004, and I don't have the annual report in front of me. I'm traveling. What were the full year margins on confectionery in 2004?
CATHERINE JESSUP: The full year margins were 31%.
BETH LILLY: Okay. So you expect the full year margins for confectionery this year to be higher than that? CATHERINE JESSUP: Yes.
BETH LILLY: Okay. And then what about on the entertainment side? Where do you see margins on that business going?
CATHERINE JESSUP: We also see those being higher on the total entertainment business. BETH LILLY: Okay. What were they last year?
CATHERINE JESSUP: They were 28.3.

BETH LILLY: Okay. And so you see those -- are they going to be significantly higher? I mean the quarter, they were 30%?

CATHERINE JESSUP: Yeah. I see us being at least that high for the full year. And it's a function -- the key elements of that sort of change are going on both in the internet business and the WizKids business, and then we're seeing strengthening on the U.S. sports business, as well.
BETH LILLY: Great. All right. Thank you very much.
ARTHUR SHORIN: You're welcome. Operator, if there are no further questions, we'll move along. OPERATOR: We do have another question in queue, sir. We'll go to Patrick Slaven, from Slaven Blake &
Company.
PATRICK SLAVEN (ph), ANALYST, SLAVEN BLAKE & COMPANY: Good morning, all. ARTHUR SHORIN: Good morning, Pat.
PATRICK SLAVEN (ph): Warren, could you lay out a strategic plant for us in terms of the combination of internet and gaming beyond just the rotisserie-type things you're doing with baseball right now? In other words, where do you go with other sports?

WARREN FLISS: Well, in terms of other sports, I guess there's two things to that we're looking at. One is -- one is the rotisserie-type gaming. I mean, as we probably all know, fantasy is very big in football. There is a
Page 45 of 50 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
weekly competition for that. It is something we're looking to add to football. But, in addition, what we're looking at is adding more instantaneous games -- games that you can play and don't have to watch, you know, an actual baseball game to see the result of. So whether it's a card flipping game, or some other type of game that two people can play against each other on-line, and either play for their eTopps cards, or play for fun, you know, that would be another direction that we're looking at to add to eTopps. And again, I talk about eTopps. I mean, eTopps doesn't have to be be in the same format that it's currently in. Other things we're looking at is whether or not eTopps should be sold in addition to on-line. Should they be sold in
stores, where you can buy a card with a pin code on it for $5, and then go on-line and buy your cards. So eTopps won't necessarily say in its current format.

PATRICK SLAVEN (ph): Okay. And the revenue model for this in terms of -- because the secondary trading occurs on eBay, and to eBay, how do you agree derive combination between this games and internet

WARREN FLISS: One of the things that we are looking at is adding some type of subscription. Right now the gaming and trading are free. And we want people to try it out and, you know, really like it, and continue to do it, and build it up. At some point in the not-too-distant future, we would charge a subscription. So in order to play the game, get a certain number of trades, we have would have a subscription for that on a monthly basis.

ARTHUR SHORIN: One of the things that you are hearing is that the internet program is going take some time. What we tried to do earlier was to really move it along quickly, and thereby requiring a major investments in advertising and promotion. It turns out those investments didn't pay out and weren't appropriate, and that's why we've taken more conservative approach, but that will take additional time. I think it's the right way for us to go.
PATRICK SLAVEN (ph): Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing comments.

ARTHUR SHORIN: Thank you. As Cathy mentioned, the financial plan calls for performance north of last year, and we will continue working hard to make that happen. I said on the last quarter's call that further progress on the strategic front was also important in addition to numerics, and as mentioned in a moment, that's happening, as well. That is, we spent some time this past quarter selecting an outside consulting firm to help us confirm or adjust our strategic direction. That firm is no now; the study will take four months or
so, and we're likely to have more to day about strategy later in the year. In the meanwhile, if asked, you'll find us restraining ourselves from commenting on the subject beyond what I just mentioned until the study is complete. In confectionery, we're aligning our go to market plan and in keeping with today's realities. We're acting to optimize paybacks and trade spending, and creating brand refreshment initiatives. We're committed to fueling growth through now products, which we believe are a critical element to success. In entertainment, our strategies remain circled around leveraging existing overhead and maximizing profit. This means too many things again to detail here, but it includes introducing new brands and finding operational improvements, leveraging internet assets, expanding distribution, using WizKids to impact our product offerings across various  Topps product lines. I we've got our work cut out for us. But then again, who doesn't? So thanks again for dialing in, and we'll see you, so to speak, in 12 weeks or so.

OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's teleconference. Again, thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

HD       The Topps Company, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Results

LP
NEW YORK, June 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The  Topps Company, Inc. today reported financial results for the fiscal 2005 first quarter ended May 29, 2004.

Net sales in the fiscal 2005 first quarter were $88.1 million compared to $76.0 million last year. Stronger foreign currencies versus the prior year increased 2005 first quarter sales by $2.8 million. Income from operations was $5.6 million compared to $4.4 million in last year's first quarter. Net income in the fiscal
2005 first quarter was $4.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, versus $3.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, last year. Fiscal 2005 first quarter results include a one-time charge of $1.9 million, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share, related to a previously disclosed European Commissionfine.

TD
Confectionery net sales were $44.2 million in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, a 2.9% decline from the prior-year period. In addition to the continuation of certain trends affecting the U.S. confectionery industry in general, sales of Baby Bottle Pop, which benefited last year from the introduction of Baby Bottle Pop with Candy Juice, were below last year's levels. Partially offsetting these factors was a favorable contribution from the further roll-out of two new chewy candy brands-Juicy Bugs and Juicy Drop Chews-and growing sales of Juicy Drop Pop.

Entertainment sales in the first quarter were $43.9 million, 44% above the first quarter last year. This increase was attributable to strong sales of sticker album collections featuring teams and players participating in the  European Cup, a tournament held every four years, as well as to higher sales of English Premier League products. Entertainment sales for the period were also impacted by the inclusion of results from WizKids, acquired last July, and strong demand for NBA trading cards.

Arthur T. Shorin, Chairman and CEO of  Topps, said, "We are very pleased with overall first quarter results, particularly in light of challenging confectionery industry trends including consumer concern over nutrition, retail consolidation resulting in fewer outlets and continued discounting by large chocolate manufacturers. Within Entertainment, a number of positive factors contributed to first quarter performance. Overseas activities were strong, U.S. sports card sales were above a year ago, Wacky Packages and Garbage Pail Kids products performed well and WizKids was modestly accretive."

The Company paid its regular quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.04 per share. Additionally, the Company repurchased 143,800 shares of stock at an average price of $8.95 per share. At May 29,
2004, the Company had $96.4 million in cash and no debt.
