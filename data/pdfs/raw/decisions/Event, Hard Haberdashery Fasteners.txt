HD          EU Crt Reduces Antitrust Fines For Thread Makers Coats, Prym

LUXEMBOURG (Dow Jones)--A European court Wednesday reduced antitrust  fines imposed by the European Commission on two suppliers of needles and  haberdashery products, privately owned U.K. thread maker Coats Holdings Ltd. and William Prym GmbH&Co. KG of Germany.
The Court of First Instance reduced Coats'  fine to EUR20 million from EUR30 million and William
Prym's fine to EUR27 million from EUR30 million. [ 12-09-07 0753GMT ]

TD
The commission found in 2004 that three companies Prym, Coats and U.K. based Entaco Group Ltd. had operated a cartel in the needle market and shared geographic markets in other  haberdashery products between 1994 and 1999.
Prym and Coats appealed the decision.

The court, Europe's second highest, dismissed Prym's call for the decision to be overturned but it said the commission was wrong to refuse to reduce the  fine after Prym didn't dispute the facts set out against it. A reduction for this is included in E.U. rules.

The court also partially upheld the commission's decision against Coats, but it found the commission was wrong to include wrongdoing by Coats after March 1997 and reduced the  fine accordingly.

The European Court of Justice has reduced  fines imposed by the European Commission against Coats
Holdings Ltd and William Prym GmbH & Co for their participation in a cartel in the needles market.

The two companies were each  fined EUR30m (US$41.6m) in October 2004, after the Commission found that they had joined with Entaco Group in a series of anti-competitive agreements where they shared product and geographic markets between September 1994 and December 1999.

TD
As well as needles, other ancillary products such as pins, buttons,  fasteners  and zips were covered by the market sharing agreements. Specifically, the three companies shared the needle market and kept Entaco from competing in other  haberdashery markets such as pins or fasteners.
The court said in a statement today (12 September) that it has reduced Prym's  fine to EUR27m and
Coats’ to EUR20m.
Entaco was not  fined, because it cooperated with the Commission.

HD       EU fines fasteners cartel almost $500m

The European Commission has fined YKK, Prym and Coats and four others a total of €328.6 million ($458 million) for operating cartels on the  fasteners  and attaching machines markets in Europe and worldwide over a period of 20 years.

In addition to YKK, Prym and Coats, the commission has named Scovill Group, A Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik (VBT), which also participated in one of the infringements, it said.

TD
The commission has found four separate infringements in which these companies agreed on co-ordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information.

Prym received full immunity from  fines for the worldwide  cartel on the markets of other  fasteners  and attaching machines under the commission's leniency programme as it was the first to provide information about the  cartel.

The fines imposed on Prym for its involvement in other infringements were also lowered as a result of the company's co-operation.
Smaller reductions of  fines were granted to YKK and Coats under the same leniency programme. "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to
maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every
day by a lot of consumers," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement on Wednesday.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway."

The commission began the investigation on its own initiative after certain information had been brought to its attention. This led to surprise inspections in November 2001 at the premises of several European producers of hard and soft  haberdashery.

The evidence uncovered in the inspections showed that the companies ran illegal cartels on the markets for zip fasteners,  other fasteners,  such as snap buttons and rivets, as well as their attaching machines.
This was further confirmed by numerous documents and statements provided by the leniency applicants. The first  cartel, involving YKK, Prym, Scovill, A Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the association VBT,
ran from 1991 until at least 2001. During this period the companies agreed among other things on
co-ordinated price increases in annual "price rounds" with respect to 'other  fasteners'  and their attaching
machines, in the framework of the work circles organised by the trade association VBT.

The second cartel, involving Prym and YKK, ran from 1999 until at least 2003. During this period, the two leading manufacturers of fastening products in Europe fixed prices on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and allocated customers on a worldwide level with respect to 'other  fasteners' and their attaching machines.
Page 5 of 65 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The third  cartel, involving YKK, Coats and Prym, ran from April 1998 to at least November 1999. During this period, the three leading manufacturers of zip  fasteners  met on a number of occasions to exchange price information and to discuss price increases. The three undertakings also agreed on a methodology to set minimum prices for zip  fasteners  in Europe.
The fourth  cartel, involving Prym and Coats, was the longest infringement discovered by the
commission and lasted for more than 21 years, from 1977 until at least 1998. During this period, the two
companies agreed to share the whole  haberdashery market between themselves.

The commission has evidence that in all four cartels, high-ranking management participated in regular meetings and discussions. There is also evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal.

It was an open and shut case, and the  European Commission took action.

TD
A gang of European zip manufacturers was running an illegal price-fixing cartel, rigging the market in
zips, poppers and other  fasteners  at the expense of consumers.

Today the  cartel, including the UK's 250-year old Coats group, one of the world's leading threadmakers, was  fined a total of £230 million for what EU competition chief Neelie Kroes described as unacceptable collusion between major 'fastening technology producers''.
She said they collaborated on price increase, fixed minimum prices, shared markets and exchanged
'important and confidential'' information.

A Commission statement explained: 'Fasteners such as zips are used, for example, in clothes and footwear, and are also used in industry''.
The largest individual  fine was £104 million against Japan's YKK group. The second highest  fine of
£85 million, against Coats group would have been higher but for a reduction under the Commission's
'leniency programme'' for firms which cooperate in anti-trust investigations.

The firms were involved in several cartels, said the Commission, including one lasting 21 years which involved the Coats group and the German-based Prym group.

Their cartel operation ran from 1977 until at least 1998, said the Commission: 'During this period the two companies agreed to share the whole  haberdashery market between themselves.''

Ms Kroes said: 'It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers.

'The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway.''
A Commission spokesman added: 'Our crackdown on this zip  cartel is further proof that the
Commission's regulations have teeth. In this case we have achieved closure.''

EU CARTEL/ZIPS (UPDATE 1)
UPDATE 1-EU  fines zip-makers over 328 million euros for  cartel (Adds countries of each company)

TD
Brussels, Sept 19 Reuters - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined a group of zip-makers including YKK, Prym and Coats a total of 328.6 million euros ($459.5 million) for running worldwide price-fixing  cartels and sharing markets. ``The Commission has found four separate infringements in which these companies agreed on co-ordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information,'' the European Union executive said.

Japanese firm YKK and Coats of Britain were hit with the biggest  fines, of 150.3 million and 122.4 million euros respectively.

Prym of Germany was ordered to pay a lesser  fine of 40.5 million euros because it alerted the Commission to a cartel, the Commission said in a statement. ``The decision names five subsidiaries of the above groups, together with Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Soehne and the German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik, which also participated in one of the infringements,'' it said.
Scovill is a US company, A. Raymond is French and Berning is German. Reuters

HD     EU fines seven firms for sewing up market for zips and fasteners

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday fined seven sewing companies €328.6 million
(US$455.7 million) for stitching up the market for  zips and fasteners.
The European Commission handed down the largest individual  fine to Japan's YKK Group, charging it
€150 million (US$208 million) while Coats Group of Britain must pay €122 million (US$169.18 million).

TD
It said they and others ran four illegal cartels -- one lasting 21 years -- to coordinate price increases, fix minimum prices, allocate customers, share markets and swap "commercially important and confidential information" for  zips, snaps and rivets and attaching machines used widely to make clothes.
"It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to
maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day
by a lot of customers," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal but decided to continue anyway," she said.

The overall fine includes a €40 million (US$55.47 million) penalty on Prym Group which the EU executive waived because it was the first to blow the whistle.
The fines for YKK and Coats were reduced because the companies had cooperated with the EU  cartel
investigation.

Smaller fines were levied on others. A. Raymond SARL must pay €8 million (US$11.09 million) while Scovill Group will have to cough up €6 million (US$8.32 million) and Berning & Soehne GmbH & Co. KG was fined €1.1 million (US$1.53 million).
Regulators also fined a German trade association -- Fachverband Verbindungs-und Befestigungstechnik
-- a nominal €1,000 (US$1,386.70).

The EU said it started look into the  cartel on its own initiative after "certain information had been brought to its attention." It led surprise raids on the companies in November 2001, which saw Prym, Coats and YKK come forward with information to seek immunity or a reduction of  fines.

It earlier found Prym and Coats guilty -- along with others -- and  fined them in 2005 for  fixing  the price of industrial thread and, in 2004, for a  cartel on the haberdashery market, including needles.
Regulators said the EU zip market is worth some €400 million ($555 million) every year.

The European Commission has fined zipper producers YKK Group, based in Japan, and European producers William Prym GmbH & Co and Coats PLC a total of EUR328 million for operating a fasteners  and attaching machines  cartel in Europe and worldwide.

("EU Fines YKK, Prym & Coats EUR328.6M For  Zippers Cartel," published at 1011 GMT, incorrectly stated that YKK Group was a European zipper manufacturer.) [ 19-09-07 1137GMT ]

The high fines take into account the size of the companies involved, the duration of the cartels and the fact that there were four separate occasions when the companies colluded, antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

When asked if the commission was concerned the  fines could lead to bankruptcies, Todd said the commission had to consider "very serious infringement and the damage done to consumers over many years."
The European market for  zippers alone totals EUR400 million a year, Todd said.

"It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers. The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway," said the commissions antitrust chief Neelie Kroes.

Prym received full immunity on one of the  cartel charges as it was the first to provide the commission with information and other  fines were reduced because Prym cooperated with the commission. YKK and Coats'  fines were also reduced slightly because they cooperated with the commission's investigation.

The parent companies may also be regarded as liable for the payment of the  fines, the commission said.

Brussels, Sept. 19 (Jiji Press)--The European Commission said Wednesday it has  fined Japan's
YKK Corp. group, five European and U.S. fastener makers and a German industry group a total of
328 million euros for allegedly operating cartels in the European and other markets.

Among the seven, the YKK group was slapped with the biggest  fine, 150 million euros, after being granted a small reduction as a result of its cooperation with the commission's investigation under a leniency program.

TD
The fine for the YKK group is believed to be the largest the  European Commission has ever imposed on a Japanese company in a  cartel case.

The European Union's executive arm alleged that the six firms were involved in a total of four separate infringements in which they agreed on coordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information.
The YKK group participated in three cartels since 1991, according to the commission.

The EU's Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said, "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are use every day by a lot of consumers."

Benchmark crude oil hits new record of $82.40 in N.Y.

TD
NEW YORK - Benchmark crude oil futures continued to rise in early trading Wednesday, setting a new record high of $82.40 per barrel in the wake of the Federal Reserve's larger-than-expected interest
rate cut.

The October contract for West Texas Intermediate crude marked a closing high of $81.51 in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday and maintained its upward momentum.

BOJ holds key rate steady, Fukui sees need for tightening

TOKYO - The Bank of Japan decided Wednesday by a majority vote to leave the bank's benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, but Governor Toshihiko Fukui underlined the need to eventually raise rates to ward off any risks from maintaining an accommodative monetary stance.

Eight of the nine BOJ Policy Board members agreed to encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0.5 percent, but Atsushi Mizuno, a former Credit Suisse economist, objected to the decision.

BRUSSELS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined a group of zip-makers including YKK, Prym and Coats a total of 328.6 million euros ($459.5 million) for running worldwide price-fixing  cartels and sharing markets.

"The Commission has found four separate infringements in which these companies agreed on coordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information," the European Union executive said.

Japanese firm YKK and Coats of Britain were hit with the biggest  fines, of 150.3 million and 122.4 million euros respectively.
Prym of Germany was ordered to pay a lesser  fine of 40.5 million euros because it alerted the
Commission to a cartel, the Commission said in a statement.

"The decision names five subsidiaries of the above groups, together with Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Soehne and the German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik, which also participated in one of the infringements," it said.
Scovill is a U.S. company, A. Raymond is French and Berning is German.

BRUSSELS, Sept 19, 2007 (AFP) -

The European Commission on Wednesday hit a group of zipper makers with a  fine of 328.6 million euros (458 million dollars) for running an illegal  cartel.

TD
The European Union's competition watchdog accused six companies and a German trade group of  fixing price hikes together, setting price floors, sharing customers, carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

"It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
The fines targeted companies YKK, Prym, Coats, Scovill, A. Raymond, Berning und Soehne and
German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungtechnik.

BRUSSELS, Sept 19, 2007 (AFP) -
The European Commission on Wednesday hit a group of zip and other  fastener makers with a fine of
328.6 million euros (458 million dollars) for running an illegal  cartel.

TD
The European Union's competition watchdog accused six companies and a German trade group of  fixing price hikes together, setting price floors, sharing customers, carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information.

"It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
The fines targeted companies YKK, Prym, Coats, Scovill, A. Raymond, Berning und Soehne and
German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungtechnik.

In addition to  zips, the companies also make such  fasteners  as rivets and snap buttons for clothing and footwear as well as machines for attaching them, Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

The Commission handed the biggest fine to Japanese group YKK, ordering the company, which has about 50 percent of the world fastener market, to pay 150 million euros.

Coats was fined 122 million euros and Prym 40.5 million euros while the other companies received much smaller penalties.

The fines would have even been higher for YKK, Prym and Coats, had they not sought to cooperate with regulators after the Commission carried out surprise inspections at  haberdashery makers.
The Commission was particularly disappointed that the illegal activity had lasted so long -- 21 years in
one case -- and that top management, including managing and sales directors and board members, were
involved.

Kroes is in the midst of a "no-tolerance" crackdown on cartels and has lodged ever-rising record  fines against those she snares, often in low-profile industries where clients pay little attention to suppliers' prices.

"It is the gravity of the infraction, but also the duration," which led the  European Commission to inflict, on
19 September,  fines totalling €328 million on companies YKK, Prym and Coats and four others, which
were operating cartels on the markets for  fasteners  (zips and other types of  fasteners  like poppers and
rivets) and attaching machines in Europe and worldwide. The decision names five subsidiaries of the
above groups, together with the Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the German trade
association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik, which also participated in one of the
infringements.

TD
The Commission has found four separate infringements in which these companies agreed on coordinated price increases and fixed minimum prices, and they also allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information. The Prym group received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency programme in respect of the worldwide  cartel on the markets for other fasteners  and attaching machines, as it was the first to provide information about this cartel. In addition, the fines imposed on the Prym group for its involvement in the other infringements discovered were also lowered as a result of the company's cooperation. Smaller reductions of the  fines were also granted to the YKK group and the Coats group as a result of their cooperation under the Commission's leniency programme.

The Commission began the investigation on its own initiative after certain information had been brought to its attention. This led to surprise inspections in November 2001 at the premises of several Community producers of hard and soft  haberdashery. In turn, these inspections triggered applications from the Prym group, the Coats group and the YKK group for immunity or reduction of  fines under the leniency programme.

The first  cartel, involving the YKK group, the Prym group, the Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the association VBT, ran from 1991 until at least 2001. During this period, the above companies agreed among other things on coordinated price increases in annual price rounds' with respect to other  fasteners'  and their attaching machines, in the framework of the work circles organised by the trade association VBT.

The second cartel, involving the Prym group and the YKK group, ran from 1999 until at least 2003. During this period, the two leading manufacturers of fastening products in Europe fixed prices on a
product-by-product and country-by-country basis and allocated customers on a worldwide level with respect to other  fasteners'  and their attaching machines.

The third  cartel, involving the YKK group, the Coats group and the Prym group, ran from April 1998 to at least November 1999. During this period, the three leading manufacturers of zip  fasteners  met on a number of occasions to exchange price information and to discuss price increases. The three undertakings also agreed on a methodology to set minimum prices for zip  fasteners  in Europe.

The fourth  cartel, involving the Prym group and the Coats group, was the longest infringement discovered by the Commission during this investigation. It lasted for more than 21 years, from 1977 until at least
1998. During this period, the two companies agreed to share the whole  haberdashery market between themselves.

The European Commission on Wednesday revealed it had uncovered and severely punished a  cartel
of zip and fastener manufacturers.

The Brussels regulator imposed fines totalling 328.6m ($458.2m) on six companies and a German trade association - the eighth-largest cartel fine imposed by the Commission.

TD
Japan's YKK group received the highest  fine, 150.3m, followed by Coats from the UK with 122.4m and
Germany's Prym with 40.6m.

It is the second time that Brussels has unravelled a cartel in the haberdashery sector, following a 2004 ruling that found several of the same companies guilty of fixing  prices in the market for needles and pins. Companies that have a previous conviction for cartel abuses are punished much harder than
first-time offenders.

The Commission described the zip  cartel as "very serious", both because it went on in some cases for more than 20 years and because it involved the companies' top management, including managing directors, sales directors and board members. The EU  zips market is worth about 400m a year, with another 200m coming from sales of other  fasteners  such as snap buttons and rivets.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway."

It is understood that the comparatively high  fines imposed triggered debate inside the Commission, amid concerns that the penalties could put some of the smaller members out of business.

However, a spokesman for the Commission insisted that the  fines had been calculated to ensure all companies would be able to continue their operations.

He added that the  fines were "relatively high because of the large size of some of the companies involved, the fact that there were four different cartels and the duration of these cartels".
All the groups have the right to appeal the Commission ruling in front of the Luxembourg-based
European Court of First Instance.

Brussels, 19/09/2007 (Agence Europe) - On 19 September, the  European Commission decided to impose fines of a total of €328,664,000 on YKK, Prym, Coats and four other companies, which operated cartels on the markets for  fasteners  and attaching machines in Europe and worldwide, in clear violation of EC Treaty rules that outlaw restrictive commercial practices. Wednesday's decision refers to five subsidiaries of the above-mentioned groups, together with the Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the German trade association Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik (VBT),
which also took part in one of the infringements. Fastenings such as  zips are used, for example, in clothes and footwear, and industry. The Commission has found four separate cases of infringements.

TD
The Prym group received total immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency programme in respect of the worldwide cartels on the markets for other fastenings and attaching machines, as it was the first to provide information about this  cartel. In addition, the  fines imposed on this group for its involvement in other infringements discovered were also lowered as a result of the company's
cooperation. Smaller reductions of the  fines were also granted to the YKK and Coats groups to take account of their cooperation.

The Commission began the investigation on its own initiative after certain information had been brought to its attention. This led to surprise inspections in November 2001 at the premises of several Community producers of hard and soft  haberdashery. In turn, these inspections triggered applications from the Prym, Coats and YKK groups for immunity or reduction of  fines under the Commission's leniency programme.

The evidence uncovered in the inspections showed that the companies ran illegal cartels on the market for zip fasteners,  other fasteners  (e.g. snap buttons and rivets) and their attaching machines. This was
further confirmed and complemented by numerous documents and statements provided by the companies which applied for leniency. The first  cartel, which involved the YKK group, the Prym group, the Scovill group, A. Raymond, Berning & Söhne and the VBT, was in operation from 1991 to 2001 at least. During this period, the above-mentioned companies agreed, amongst other things, on coordinated price
increases in annual “price rounds” with respect to 'other  fasteners'  and their attaching machines, in the framework of the work circles organised by the trade association VBT. The second  cartel, involving the Prym group and the YKK group, was in operation from 1999 to 2003 at least. During this period, the two leading manufacturers of fastening products in Europe fixed prices on a product-by-product and
country-by-country basis and allocated customers on a worldwide level with respect to 'other  fasteners' and their attaching machines. The third  cartel, which involved the YKK, Coats and Prym groups, was in place from April 1998 until November 1999 at least. During this period, the three leading manufacturers of zip fasteners  met on a number of occasions to exchange price information and to discuss price increases. The three undertakings also agreed on a methodology to set minimum prices for zip  fasteners  in Europe. The fourth  cartel, involving the Prym and Coats groups, is the longest infringement discovered by the Commission during its investigation: it lasted for more than 21 years, from 1977 to 1998 at least. During
this period, the two companies agreed to share the whole  haberdashery market between themselves. The Commission has evidence that in all four cartels, high-ranking management participated in regular meetings and discussions. There is also evidence that the companies were aware that their behaviour was illegal.

The fines imposed amount to €40,538,000 for the Prym group, €150,250,000 for the YKK group,
€22,405,000 for the Coats group, €6,002,000 for the Scovill group, €8,325,000 for A. Raymond S.A.R.L., €
1,123,000 for Berning & Söhne GmbH & Co. KG, and € 1,000 for VBT. Even though the Commission has

fined the companies in question, any person or firm affected by the anti-competitive behaviour as described in the decision taken by the Commission on Wednesday may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages. (ol)

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)-- Guinness Peat Group's subsidiary, Coats Group, said Thursday it is yet to decide whether it will appeal the European Commission's decision to  fine Coats EUR12.2 million in relation to price  fixing  in the fasteners  market.

TD
However, the Company totally rejects the Commission's allegation of a market sharing agreement with Prym in the European  haberdashery market and in respect of which Coats has been  fined EUR110.3 million.

The Commission alleged that between April 1998 and November 1999 European zip manufacturers exchanged price information.

Coats said it will carefully study the Commission's conclusions once details are made available before determining whether to appeal against this aspect of the Commission's decision.

Coats said that, during the Commission's investigation into a market sharing agreement with Prym in the European  haberdashery market, the Company presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted the allegation and demonstrated that in any event a  fine was time-barred.

Contrary to its rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation.
Coats will vigorously appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance once the full details of the
Commission's decision have been made available.
The Court of First Instance last week quashed a large part of the Commission's factual findings in the
Needles case for want of proof or clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission.

The Company has confidence in the impartial, judicial analysis that the Court applies. As well as rejecting the substance of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the  fine is grossly disproportionate to any possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the European haberdashery market. The Company's customers have certainly not been injured, it said.

Subject to a review of the details of the Commission's decision, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of  fines is adequately covered by existing provisions.

It should be noted that the alleged contraventions occurred many years ago, between 1977 -1999, prior to the acquisition of Coats by the GPG Group and do not involve any current members of the Coats Board or management team. Anti-competitive behaviour goes directly against company policy and represents a serious disciplinary offence.

It should be stressed that this legacy issue has no impact on Coats current operations which continue to make good progress. Coats acknowledges the full support of its shareholder GPG and its role in the successful development of the business over the last four years. [ 20-09-07 1430GMT ]

West Australian conglomerate Wesfarmers has largely avoided the inflationary effects of the global credit crunch, with only A$20 million being added to the cost of the loan required to acquire struggling retail company, Coles Group . Analysts said the A$20 million increase was minor considering the size of the loan, expected to be nearly A$10 billion. Three banks -- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, BNP Paribas and National Australia Bank's nabCapital division -- are underwriting the loan. Page 62.

Investment holding company, Guinness Peat Group , says it will launch a "vigorous' legal battle against a European Commission (EC) finding that Guinness Peat's British-based thread-making business had engaged in price fixing.  The Coats business, acquired by Guinness Peat in 2004, was accused of being involved in a cartel in the European  zips and fasteners  market and fined 122 million (A$201 million). The EC alleged Coats agreed on coordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices and exchanged commercially sensitive information with other companies. Page 62.

Dairy products group, Dairy Farmers, has applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales for a ruling on whether its milk supply cooperative and largest shareholder is entitled to its 27.5 percent holding. According to state laws, the Dairy Farmers Milk Cooperative may only hold 20 percent of shares. Dairy Farmers has called on the cooperative to return the excess shares, a request the cooperative is resisting. The co-op, led by chairman, Ian Zandstra, believes it should be able to retain its stake under exemption provisions. Page 63.

Regional television group, Prime Television, has pulled out of the bidding contest for the Hoyts cinema chain owned by James Packer's Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) and West Australian Newspapers . Prime said it was not willing to pay the rumoured asking price of A$435 million, as other interested parties also pulled out of the bid. Industry sources said private equity firm, Pacific Equity Partners, was now favoured to win control of Hoyts. Interested parties are due to lodge their final bids with PBL adviser, UBS, today.

Increasing demand for rail wheels and wire ropes will see steelmaker, OneSteel , invest about A$22 million on upgrades to two of its factories. Capacity at the Waratah steel mill, in the New South Wales city of Newcastle, will increase from 21,000 wheels to 105,000 wheels per year through a A$14 million funding injection. The remaining A$8 million will go towards the installation of a plastic injection and rewinding

Two executives from investment services provider, Grange Securities, have left the company amid controversy surrounding its involvement in securities connected to the faltering sub-prime mortgage market in the United States (US). About 35 municipal councils across Australia have bought A$50 million worth of collateralised debt obligations (CDO) on the recommendation of Grange, which is owned by US investment bank, Lehman Brothers. The CDOs are said to be presently worth as little as A30 cents in the dollar. Page 23.

Oil company, Caltex Australia , has announced that company director, Elizabeth Bryan, will take over as chairman when Dick Warburton retires at the end of the month. Caltex said Mr Warburton would remain on the board until April to "effect a smooth transition and to assist with finding and inducting a new director.' Analysts praised the contribution of Mr Warburton, who has overseen a 25-fold increase in the shareprice of Australia's biggest oil refiner and marketer since taking charge in 2001. Page 23.

Sigma Pharmaceuticals has cut its full-year profit outlook for the second time in four months, citing rising competition in the generic drugs market and heavy discounting by a key Indian rival. Sigma said net profit would decline to between A$88 million and A$93 million, after forecasting a result of A$104 million in July. The company reported a 38 percent drop in net profit to A$30.3 million for the six months ending July 31. Managing director, Elmo de Alwis, said he was extremely disappointed with the downgrade, which reflected a "particularly challenging period' for Sigma. Page 24.

Macquarie Airports (MAp) has reported a strong rise in passenger numbers at its facilities during the month of August, with Sydney Airport recording an 8.2 percent surge in air traffic compared to a year earlier. MAp attributed the gains to the robust economy and the strong Australian dollar. MAp also confirmed the sale of its remaining 24 percent stake in Birmingham Airport in the United Kingdom, and flagged its interest in expansion into Japan with the purchase of a stake in the company that controls the passenger terminals at Tokyo's Haneda domestic airport.

The board of national telecommunications group, Telstra , will request that an extra A$1 million be made available to pay the fees of its directors. If approved, the cash pool would increase to A$3 million, which Telstra said was comparable to Australia's largest listed companies. It said the additional money would help the company attract and retain "suitably qualified, high-calibre directors and to pay fees consistent with market benchmarks.' The request will be put to shareholders at Telstra's annual general meeting in early November. Page 21.

Mr Mohl announced just four weeks ago his decision to quit as head of the country's largest "pure' wealth management group.

Analysts have warned West Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers, that it is bidding too much for retailer, Coles Group, which this week released yearly results described by some as "dreadful.' Merrill Lynch analyst, David Errington, said the 10 percent fall in earnings at Coles's food and liquor division "represented a company in distress,' and said it would take "a lot of money and a lot of time' to repair the damage. He said the biggest concerns ultimately facing Wesfarmers were Coles's supply chain and information technology systems. Page B1.

FULL DISCLOSURE
IT'S not often Sir Ron Brierley gets caught with his fly undone.

TD
The corporate raider has enjoyed a stellar career in Australia, Britain and his native New Zealand - but there are a few red faces at Guinness Peat Group at the moment, after subsidiary Coats Group was fined EUR122.4 million ($A199.3 million) by the  European Commission for its role in a price-fixing    cartel in the global zipper industry.

The news put Guinness Peat, which trades on the London, Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges, in a trading halt as directors assess how the huge  fine will affect Coats.
That halt is expected to last until Monday.
The Commission this week  fined Coats, YKK and Prym a total of EUR328.6 million for running
price-fixing  cartels for more than 20 years. Japan's YKK was  fined EUR150.3 million, Coats EUR122.4
million and Germany's Prym EUR40.5 million - it spilled the beans on the  cartel.

"The Commission has found four separate infringements in which these companies agreed on co-ordinated price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers, shared markets and exchanged other commercially important and confidential information," the Commission said.

Sir Ron pounced on ailing Coats back in 2004. The 250-year-old British company is the world's largest supplier of commercial thread for footwear, furniture and yarns, in addition to making  zippers.

The £218 million purchase of Coats made it Guinness Peat's prime investment, representing 31 per cent of its portfolio.

GPG executive director Gary Weiss - Sir Ron's long-time protege - said at the time: "Very rarely in one's commercial life does one have an opportunity to buy a company that is a global leader and a company
of this pedigree."
Weiss says the  fine - the fourth largest in EU history - is "outrageous".

"We totally reject the allegations of market sharing," he said. "We will exhaust all rights and appeals available to us. This is round one."
Venetian class

EQUINE flu is a distraction, but it's full steam ahead in the car parks of Flemington, where a Venetian palace will be erected in coming weeks.
After last year's Palace of Versailles marquee, Emirates has unveiled its plans for this year's Melbourne
Cup carnival. To celebrate its new route to Venice, the Italian city was chosen as the inspiration.



Page 49 of 65 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There will be canals beneath the floors, an Italian bistro and a gondola-shaped bar with waiters dressed as gondoliers and genuine Murano glass decorations. "The facade will be inspired by the rich tapestry
of the buildings that line the Grand Canal," says Emirates vice-president Stephen Pearse.

"Through arched windows guests can catch a glimpse of the chefs as they work, or spy the serving staff as they move across a small bridge from the kitchen to the ristorante area."
A large upstairs balcony area will provide views of the track.

"We set the standard for corporate entertainment at Flemington, but the following year we try to raise the bar a little," says Emirates sales manager Dean Cleaver.

For those who watched Kenny on television this week, rest assured the Emirates marquee will again offer fully plumbed bathrooms.
Worked up over zero

IT SNEAKED on to retail shelves with little fanfare, but Coca-Cola Amatil's ill-fated Jim Beam Zero is on sale - for now.

After losing a legal battle with Foster's, which has won the right to use the trademark Zero for alcoholic drinks after launching Cougar Zero this year, Jim Beam and Coca-Cola have until October 12 to get rid of the 1.68 million cans and bottles they have produced.
After that, the name will change to Jim Beam and Zero Sugar Cola.
"Stock with the original label is in the market this week, sell-ing in liquor outlets nationally," said
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Sally Loane.

"We won't be facing any stockpiles or discounting any of this stock because is has all been sold into the market."
Indeed, Jim Beam staff are lamenting the misfired launch, as the product is selling fast.

"Demand has been so strong that we are working frantically to ensure that we have sufficient levels of the next new batch of Jim Beam and Zero Sugar Cola with the amended label - which is not in breach of Fosters' trademark - to meet orders," Loane said.
Lego stays lead-free

US TOY companies are reeling from the discovery of danger-ously high levels of lead in Chinese-made toys, but Christ-mas looks like being a boon for two traditional toy makers.

Germany's Playmobil and Denmark's Lego both resisted the urging of their banks and financiers to move production to China, and are now counting their blessings.

"Looking back, it feels like it was right to make that decision," said Andrea Schauer, managing director of Geobra Brandstatter, which makes Playmobil toys. "We didn't have enough manpower to inspect factories in China."

Lego executive vice-president Iqbal Padda said it was hard to resist the move to China - Chinese wages are $US1.50 an hour, compared with almost $US30 an hour for Lego's Danish factory workers. It makes 85 per cent of its toys in Europe, and just 3 per cent in China. But Playmobil and Lego are not willing to gloat over Mattel's misfortune. "We don't want to throw stones, in case we're sitting in a glass house," said Schauer.

A EUROPEAN subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group has been  fined for fixing  the price of clothing and industrial  zippers.
On Wednesday, European authorities fined haberdasher Coats, which GPG bought in 2003,
$122.405 million ($A197 million) for its role in the cartel.

TD
The European Commission said a series of cartels involved Coats, five other companies and a
German trade association.

In all, the groups were  fined a total of $328.644 million, the eighth-largest  cartel fine ever imposed by the commission.
The company's executive director, Gary Weiss, could not be reached yesterday.

GUINNESS Peat Group has branded a (Euro)122 million (NZ$230 million)  European Commission fine against its subsidiary Coats outrageous.
"We will undoubtedly be appealing it," GPG's New Zealand director, Tony Gibbs, said yesterday.

TD
The fine was part of (Euro)328 million levied against seven companies for alleged  cartel activity conducted many years ago. It was the final part of a long-running, three-step inquiry the commission has been conducting into the needle, industrial thread and  fastener markets, the latter including production of  zips, snap buttons and rivets.

The activity, from 1977 till the late 1990s, pre-dates GPG's involvement with British-based threadmaker Coats. GPG, chaired by investment veteran Sir Ron Brierley, did not take control of the company till 2003 and completed a full takeover the following year.

Coats is already paying (Euro)38.5 million in  fines relating to the needle and industrial thread markets. Though another  fine was expected, the size of it wasn't.

"What's shaken everyone is the sheer size of this, because the (Coats)  zips business is not enormous," Mr Gibbs said.

GPG has made allowances in its accounts for the  fines -- but has never disclosed how much it expected to have to pay. The company's annual report for the year to December 2006 shows general provisions of (PndStlg)124 million (NZ$341 million). But it is not clear how much has been targeted specifically for the  fines -- and Mr Gibbs would not say yesterday.

But he said GPG and its lawyers would be examining the details of the  fine and the adequacy of those provisions. A statement would be issued by Coats today.

GPG shares dropped as much as 11 cents yesterday before recovering somewhat. NZX placed a trading halt on the company just after midday pending an expected material announcement. The shares, which remained in trading halt for the rest of the day, closed down 5c at $1.93.

Some market participants were disappointed GPG had not immediately put out a statement outlining the likely impact of the  fine. "They should be able to come out now and say what the provision they made was," Tyndall Investment Management equities manager Rickey Ward said. "I don't know why they can't disclose that now."

The fine appeared "quite hefty to say the least". The issue would be a short-term negative for GPG, Mr Ward said, but he remained positive about its prospects. "It still looks cheap. It is trading at a massive discount to its asset backing."
For the six months to June GPG reported an after-tax profit of (PndStlg)94 million.

In fining the seven companies, European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said it was unacceptable major companies had colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets.

A EUROPEAN subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group has been  fined for allegedly fixing  the price of industrial and clothing  zippers.
On Wednesday, European authorities fined haberdasher Coats, which GPG bought in 2003,
122.405 million ($A200 million) for its role in the cartel.

TD
The European Commission said a series of cartels involved Coats, five other companies and a
German trade association.

In all, the groups were  fined a total of 328.644 million, the eighth largest  cartel fine ever imposed by the commission.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: ``It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers.

``The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway.''

The fine covers four cartels, two of which included Coats. One  cartel, involving Coats and German firm Prym, ran from 1977 until 1998.

``During this period, the two companies agreed to share the whole  haberdashery market between themselves,'' the commission said.

``The commission has evidence that in all four cartels high-ranking management (such as managing directors, sales directors, and board members) participated in regular meetings and discussions,'' it said.
Continued Page 50
From Page 49
Prym's fine has been waived because it broke open the  cartel.
Under the Commission's leniency rules, whistleblowers are entitled to full immunity.
Coats'  fine was reduced because it had cooperated with the investigation, the Commission said. Japanese company YKK was  fined the most, at 150.25 million.
The firms can appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance.

Several of the same companies -- including Coats -- have previously been  fined for anti-competitive practices.

Coats was fined 30 million in 2004 for conspiring with Prym and British company Entaco to sew up the European needle market.
GPG put its stock into a trading halt yesterday, pending an announcement involving Coats. Before the trading halt GPG's scrip was off 5 at $1.65.
The announcement did not mention Coats'  fine, or its part in the  cartel. The company's executive director, Gary Weiss, could not be reached.

The European Commission fined YKK (Unlisted, Issuer Rating: AA-) and other six companies total of
328.64 million euro (approximately 53 billion

yen) for operating cartels on the markets for  fasteners  and attaching machines in clear violation of anti-trust rules. The  fine imposed on YKK and its two subsidiaries in Europe is 150.25 million euro (approximately 24 billion yen). EU points out the  cartel practices up to 2003 and it does not advert to the infringement since then. At the moment, YKK commented it is difficult to accept this decision, and is currently discussing countermeasures including appeal against the  European Commission.

TD
R&I considers the impact the EU decision will have on YKK's profits and financial condition will remain limited even it has paid the  fine in full amount since its profitability and cash flow generating ability are very stable backed by firm financial base. However, R&I will pay attention to whether the decision will affect YKK's business base which holds an overwhelming share in the world market, and the impact the punitive measures due to the  cartel practices may have on its clientele and product prices especially in Europe.

Guinness Peat Group (GPG) says a C122 million ($NZ230m)  fine levied against its subsidiary Coats by the European Commission is "simply outrageous".

Guinness Peat Group has labelled as "outrageous" a  fine of EUR122 million ($201 million) the European Commission has handed its British-based thread-making business Coats for alleged involvement in a cartel in the zips and fasteners  market.

The commission announced the fine on Wednesday night after completing an investigation into the activities of seven firms in the zips and fasteners  market in Europe and other parts of the world.

TD
A Japanese company, YKK, faces the largest  fine, of EUR150 million, as part of total  fines of
EUR329 million.

Guinness Peat took full ownership of Coats in 2004, after the claims of price  fixing  and swapping of commercial information are alleged to have occurred.
The EC alleged one of the four separate instances of  cartel behaviour ran for 21 years until 1998. Guinness Peat director Gary Weiss said the company would launch a vigorous legal fight.
"We regard the decision as being outrageous," he said yesterday.

"We most certainly do intend to vigorously appeal against it once the full decision of the commission is made available."

Coats is the world's largest supplier of threads for industry and apparel, and makes up about one-third of Guinness Peat's portfolio of investments.
Guinness Peat shares went into a trading halt yesterday, after slumping 5¢ to $1.65 in early trading. The EC alleged the seven firms operated four illegal cartels in which they agreed on co-ordinated
price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers and exchanged commercially sensitive
information.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers."
Guy Hallwright, an analyst at New Zealand stockbroking firm Forsyth Barr, said the  zips and
fasteners  decision was the final leg in three regulatory investigations.
Mr Hallwright said they were "legacy issues" Guinness Peat would have to deal with.
The first decision was a EUR30 million  fine relating to the needles market, which the EC cut to
EUR20 million after Guinness Peat appealed.

Guinness Peat is considering another appeal on that matter.
Page 59 of 65 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A second investigation into the Nordic thread markets resulted in an EUR18.5 million  fine, Mr
Hallwright said.

He said market expectations for the  cartel fines would have been about EUR20 million, and the size of the  fine was a "negative surprise".

HD               GPG PREPARES TO PAY HUGE FINES 'EVENTUALLY' BY                David HARGREAVES

GUINNESS PEAT GROUP'S threadmaking subsidiary Coats is confident it has already made sufficient provisions to meet "eventual payment" of  fines to the European Commission.

GPG, which is planning an appeal against the commission's ruling, has still not disclosed its specific provisions. It does not intend to. The appeal could take about three years.

TD
British-based Coats was this week  fined (Euro)122 million (NZ$230 million) by the commission. This was part of a (Euro)328 million package of  fines levied against seven companies involved in fastener production for alleged  cartel activity from 1977 to the late 1990s. The largest  fine, of (Euro)150 million, was levied against YKK of Japan.

Coats chairman Gary Weiss said yesterday the company would get a bank guarantee to cover the full amount of the  fine during the appeal process. "Only once we have completed the appeal process will payment of any  fine, as finally determined by the court, be made."
GPG's New Zealand director Tony Gibbs reiterated that it would fight tooth and nail against the
fine's size. He stressed, however, that Coats' and GPG's operations were entirely unaffected by the
decision.
GPG shares dropped five cents to $1.88 yesterday.
The alleged cartel activity relates to well before GPG took over Coats, in 2004.

It was the last part of a long- running three-stage commission inquiry, first into the needle market, then into industrial thread, and finally into  fasteners,  mostly zips.

GPG and Coats are already paying  fines relating to the earlier inquiries -- one of (Euro)18.5 million and the other of (Euro)20 million. The latter was reduced on appeal last week, from (Euro)30 million.

GUINNESS PEAT GROUP'S threadmaking subsidiary Coats is confident it has already made sufficient provisions in its accounts to meet "eventual payment" of  fines to the European                Commission.

However GPG, which will appeal against the commissions's ruling, has still not disclosed what level of specific provisions it has made to cover the penalties and doesn't intend to. Based on previous cases, the appeal could take about three years.

British-based Coats was this week  fined (Euro)122 million (NZ$230 million) by the commission. This was part of a (Euro)328 million package of  fines levied against seven companies involved in fastener production for alleged  cartel activity from 1977 to the late 1990s.
The largest  fine, of (Euro)150 million, was levied against Japanese company YKK.

Coats chairman Gary Weiss said yesterday the company would get a bank guarantee to cover the full amount of the  fine during the appeal process.

"Only once we have completed the appeal process will payment of any  fine, as finally determined by the court, be made," he said.

GPG's New Zealand director Tony Gibbs reiterated yesterday that the company would fight tooth and nail against the size of the  fine.

He stressed, however, that the operations of both Coats and GPG were entirely unaffected by the commission's decision.
GPG shares dropped 5 cents to $1.88 yesterday.

The alleged cartel activity relates to well before GPG took over Coats, in 2004. It was the last part of a long-running three-step inquiry the commission conducted, first into the needle market, then industrial thread, and finally  fasteners  -- mostly zips.

GPG and Coats are already paying  fines relating to the earlier inquiries -- one of (Euro)18.5 million and the other of (Euro)20 million. The latter was reduced just last week on appeal from (Euro)30 million.

Mr Weiss said Coats totally rejected the commission's allegation of a market-sharing agreement with Germany's Prym Group in the European haberdashery market. It was for this alleged offence that Coats picked up (Euro)110 million of the fine. The other (Euro)12 million related to alleged exchange of price information.

Mr Weiss said that during the investigation, Coats had presented the commission with "ample evidence" that refuted the  haberdashery market allegations "and demonstrated that in any event a fine was time- barred".

"Contrary to its rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation," Mr Weiss said.

Prym Group, which had (Euro)40.5 million  fines levied against it, said the penalties were "unique in the history of the European Union and bear no relation to previous decisions of the commission in comparable cases".

Mr Weiss said an appeal to the Court of First Instance would be made once the commission's full decision had been circulated.
"We have confidence in the impartial, judicial analysis that the court applies," he said.

"As well as rejecting the substance of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the  fine is grossly disproportionate to any possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the European haberdashery market. Our customers have certainly not been injured."
