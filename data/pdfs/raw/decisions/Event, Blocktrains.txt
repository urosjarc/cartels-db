Brussels (dpa) - The  European Commission on Wednesday fined subsidiaries of German rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) and of its Austrian counterpart, Oesterreichische Bundesbahnen (OeBB), a combined total of 49 million euros (53.4 million dollars) for illegally  fixing cargo prices.

DB subsidiary Schenker and OeBB affiliate Express Interfracht, together with Kuehne+Nagel of Switzerland, had formed a  cartel for so-called block train services, in which all wagons carry the same goods in bulk from a single origin to one destination.

TD
Kuehne+Nagel was not  fined as it blew the whistle on the  cartel, which lasted from July 2004 to June
2012, the commission said.

Specifically, the companies had fixed their prices and allocated customers for two of their services: Balkantrain, which operates between Western and Southeast Europe; and Soptrain, which runs between Central Europe and Romania.

"The EU needs rail  cargo markets to function efficiently on the basis of effective competition, and not to be hijacked by vested interests to the detriment of customers," said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

Schenker must pay the largest share of the  fine, almost 32 million euros. The penalty takes into account factors including the sales generated, as well as scope and duration of the infringement.

Both companies had their  fines reduced for cooperating with the investigation and agreeing to settle with the commission, which is the EU's competition watchdog.

It can impose a penalty of up to 10 per cent of a company's annual worldwide turnover if the bloc's competition laws have been breached.

BRUSSELS, July 15 (Reuters) - German logistics company Schenker, part of Deutsche Bahn , and a unit of Austrian  train operator Osterreichische Bundesbahnen (OBB) were  fined a combined 49 million euros ($54 million) on Wednesday for  fixing  prices over an eight-year period.

The European Commission said Swiss peer Kuehne und Nagel International AG, which was part of the group, alerted the cartel to the authorities and was not penalised.

"The three companies fixed prices and allocated customers for their "Balkantrain" and "Soptrain" services in Europe for nearly eight years," the EU antitrust authority said in a statement.
Balkantrain connects western Europe to the central region while Soptrain connects central Europe with
Romania.

The Commission said the  cartel operated in blocktrain services, which is a rail shipping system to transport cargo from one hub to another without splitting up the wagons, between July 2004 to June
2012.

Schenker's  fine was 31.8 million euros while that for OBB unit Express Interfracht was 17.4 million euros. The companies admitted wrongdoing in return for a 10 percent cut in the sanctions.

(RTTNews) - The  European Commission has imposed heavy fines on two cargo train operators for operating a cartel in breach of EU antitrust rules in the market for so-called cargo 'blocktrain' services.

Express Interfracht, part of the Austrian railway incumbent Österreichische Bundesbahnen ("ÖBB"), was fined EUR17,356,000 and Schenker, part of the German railway incumbent Deutsche Bahn ("DB"), was fined EUR31,798,000.

These two companies and Kühne+Nagel of Switzerland fixed prices and allocated customers for their
"Balkantrain" and "Soptrain" services in Europe for nearly eight years.

Kühne+Nagel, which is one of the largest transport and logistics companies in Europe, was not  fined as it was granted immunity under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the cartel. Express Interfracht and Schenker received reductions of their  fines under the Leniency Notice for cooperating with the investigation. Since all three companies agreed to settle the case with the Commission, the  fines imposed were further reduced by 10 percent.

HD     Europa-Antitrust: Commission fines cargo train operators EUR 49 million for cartel

Antitrust: Commission  fines cargo train operators EUR 49 million for  cartel.

TD
The European Commission has imposed fines of EUR 49 154 000 on Express Interfracht, part of the Austrian railway incumbent Osterreichische Bundesbahnen (‘OBB’), and Schenker, part of the German railway incumbent Deutsche Bahn (‘DB’), for operating a  cartel in breach of EU antitrust rules in the market for so-called  cargo ‘blocktrain’ services. The three companies fixed prices and allocated customers for their ‘Balkantrain’ and ‘Soptrain’ services in Europe for nearly eight years.

Kuhne+Nagel of Switzerland, which is one of the largest transport and logistics companies in Europe, also took part in the  cartel but was not  fined as it was granted immunity under the Commission’s 2006
Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel. Express Interfracht and Schenker received reductions of their  fines under the Leniency Notice for cooperating with the investigation. Since all three companies agreed to settle the case with the Commission, the  fines imposed were further reduced by
10%.

Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who is in charge of competition policy said: ‘I find it very disappointing that a project to enhance transport efficiency and promote environmentally friendly  cargo transport was derailed into a cartel. The European Union needs rail  cargo markets to function efficiently on the basis of effective competition and not to be hijacked by vested interests to the detriment of customers.’

‘Blocktrains’ refers to a rail shipping system to transport  cargo from one hub to another without wagons being split up or stored on the way. This saves time and money for customers from a wide range of industries, in particular those with large volumes to transport. In principle, blocktrains are economically more efficient than traditional rail  cargo transport, notably for single commodity shipping.

The ‘blocktrains’ covered by the  cartel, named ‘Balkantrain’ and ‘Soptrain’, were jointly operated by Kuhne+Nagel, Express Interfracht and Schenker. ‘Balkantrain’ ensures the connection between Western and Central Europe with Southeast Europe. ‘Soptrain’ connects Central Europe with Romania.
In order to limit competition between them, the companies agreed on several restrictive practices:

they agreed and allocated existing and new customers as well as setting up a customer allocation scheme including a ‘notification system’ for new customers;
they exchanged confidential information on specific customer requests;
they shared transport volumes contracted by downstream customers;

they coordinated prices directly by providing each other with cover bids in respect of customers protected under their customer allocation scheme and coordinated sales prices offered to downstream customers.
The infringement lasted from July 2004 to June 2012 for all companies.

The intrinsic upstream coordination of the operators (joint purchasing of transport services, such as locomotion/traction, trailers and other equipment from national rail carriers) is not covered by today’s decision because such coordination to create a ‘blocktrain’ service is not anticompetitive. The decision solely concerns the collusion between the operators of the blocktrains in the marketing of the service.

Fines

The fines were set on the basis of the Commission’s 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see press release and
MEMO).

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into particular account the companies’ sales generated from rail cargo transport services related to the jointly operated blocktrains ‘Balkantrain’ and ‘Soptrain’, including ancillary transport services, the serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope and its duration. The  fines ensure an appropriate level of deterrence while remaining proportionate to the infringement.

Under the Commission’s 2006 Leniency Notice, Kuhne+Nagel received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel, thereby avoiding a  fine of more than EUR 62 million. Express Interfracht received a reduction of 45% and Schenker a reduction of 30% for cooperating with the investigation.
Under the Commission’s2008 Settlement Notice, the Commission applied a reduction of 10% to the  fines
imposed in view if the parties’ acknowledgment of their participation in the  cartel and of their liability in
this respect.

Background
The Commission’s investigation started with unannounced inspections in June 2013.

More information on this case will be available under the case number 40098 in the public case register on the Commission’s competition website, once confidentiality issues have been dealt with. For more information on the Commission’s action against cartels, see its cartels website.
The settlement procedure

Today’s decision is the 19th settlement since the introduction of the settlement procedure for cartels in June 2008 (see press release and MEMO). In a settlement, companies acknowledge their participation in a cartel and their liability for it. Settlements are based on the Antitrust Regulation 1/2003 and allow the Commission to apply a simplified and shortened procedure. This benefits consumers and taxpayers as it


Page 7 of 16 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
reduces costs; benefits antitrust enforcement as it frees up resources to tackle other suspected cartels;
and benefits the parties themselves in terms of quicker decisions and a 10% reduction in  fines.

The Commission previously reached settlements with cartels participants in the following cases: DRAMs, animal feed phosphates, washing powder, glass for cathode ray tubes, compressors for fridges, water management products, wire harnesses, Euro and Yen interest rate derivatives, polyurethane foam, power exchanges, bearings, steel abrasives, mushrooms, Swiss Franc interest rate derivatives and bid-ask spreads, envelopes and parking heaters.
Action for damages

Any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages. The case law of the Court and Council Regulation 1/2003 both confirm that in cases before national courts, a Commission decision is binding proof that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Even though the Commission has  fined the companies concerned, damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the Commission fine.
The Antitrust Damages Directive, which the Member States have to implement in their legal systems by
27 December 2016, makes it easier for victims of anti-competitive practices to obtain damages. More
information on antitrust damages actions, including a practical guide on how to quantify antitrust harm, is
available here.

Brussels, 15/07/2015 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 15 July, the  European Commission handed down fines for a total of €49 million to the company Express Interfracht (EXIF), which is part of the Austrian railway incumbent Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB), and the company Schenker, which belongs to the German railway incumbent, Deutsche Bahn.

EXIF and Schenker must pay  fines of €17.3 and €31.7 million respectively for having taken part in a cartel, between July 2004 and June 2012, in the market for  cargo block-train services, a system of transporting goods by rail from one point to another without the convoy being separated or the wagons being stored on the way. They fixed prices and allocated customers for nearly eight years on the 'Balkan train' (between Western Europe and central and south-eastern Europe) and 'Sop  train' (Central Europe and Romania) services.

TD
As well as dividing up customers between themselves, the companies also exchanged confidential information regarding specific customer requests and directly coordinated prices by providing each other with cover bids in respect of customers protected under their customer allocation scheme. Lastly, they coordinated sales prices offered to downstream customers.

The Swiss group Kühne+Nagel, which is one of the largest transport and logistics companies in Europe, also took part in the  cartel but was not  fined, as it was granted immunity for having revealed its existence. Express Interfracht and Schenker received reductions of their  fines as they cooperated in the
investigation and agreed to settle the case with the Commission. (Elodie Lamer)

LONDON – German logistics operator DB Schenker and Austria’s Express Interfracht have been fined a combined 49 million euros ($54 million) by European Union trust busters for  fixing  freight rates for eight years.

Kuehne+Nagel, the Swiss global forwarding and logistics company, was also guilty but was granted immunity and forgiven its 62 million euros  fine for revealing the existence of the  cartel, the European Commission said.

TD
The three companies colluded on prices and allocated customers for their “Balkantrain” and “Soptrain” block  train services between central and Western Europe to Romania between July 2004 and June 2014, the EU’s executive said.

“I find it very disappointing that a project to enhance transport efficiency and promote environmentally friendly cargo transport was derailed into a  cartel,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.

“The European Union needs rail  cargo markets to function efficiently on the basis of effective competition and not to be hijacked by vested interests to the detriment of customers.”

Schenker, a unit of Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s state-owned railway, was  fined 31.8 million euros, and Interfracht, a subsidiary of Austrian state railway OBB, 17.36 million euros.

Schenker’s penalty was reduced by 30 percent and Interfracht’s by 45 percent for co-operating with the investigation into the  cartel.

THE European Commission (EC) has fined DB Schenker and Express Interfracht (EXIF) - now rebranded Rail Cargo Logistics - a total of EUR49.1 million (US$53.2 million) for marketing a rail  cartel in western and central Europe.
Kuehne + Nagel (K+N), also part of the  cartel, avoided paying a EUR62 million  fine by turning informer.

TD
The EC reduced the penalties for DB Schenker and EXIF in exchange for their cooperation, London's freightweek reported.

The EC said the two forwarders and Austrian railway subsidiary EXIF fixed prices and allocated customers for their Balkan  train and Sop train services in Europe for eight years from July 2004 to June
2012.

The EC said the  fines ensured "an appropriate level of deterrence while remaining proportionate to the infringement," and were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006 guidelines on  fines.

K+N declined to comment on the case. DB Schenker referred questions from Lloyd's Loading List to Deutsche Ban corporate compliance department, which said it was checking with its lawyers before responding. However, a spokesman clarified that the case related to the Austrian entity of its DB Schenker Logistics business, not to its rail business.
The company also issued the following statement:

"The DB Group is currently evaluating possible damage claims against them. Should customers of DB Schenker have legitimate claims for damages based on the facts established by the  EU Commission, we are of course open to discussions with them."

Competition commissioner Margaret Vestige said: "I find it very disappointing that a project to enhance transport efficiency and promote environmentally friendly  cargo transport was derailed into a  cartel. The European Union needs rail  cargo markets to function efficiently on the basis of effective competition and not to be hijacked by vested interests to the detriment of customers."

HD     DB Schenker participates in cartel in violation of company  code

GERMAN logistics provider, DB Schenker, declared in its code of conduct last year that the company was against any form of  cartel and was to comply with competition regulations.
This was disclosed after the company and Express Interfracht (EXIF) - now renamed Rail  Cargo Logistics
- was fined EUR49.1 million (US$53.2 million) by the  European Commission for marketing a rail  cartel
in western and central Europe between 2004 and 2012.

TD
Cartel member Kuehne + Nagel avoided paying a EUR62 million  fine because it informed on the rest. The EC reduced the penalties for DB Schenker and EXIF from a potential EUR50 million and EUR35 million respectively in exchange for their cooperation, London's freightweek reported.

The DB Schenker Code of Conduct, updated in 2014, declared: "We abide by the applicable competition regulations and do not reach any arrangements or agreements which affect prices and/or terms and conditions or which in any other way illegitimately restrict fair competition."

A year earlier, the commission discovered DB Schenker and the other two companies had colluded when operating Balkantrain, a block  train connecting western, central and southeast Europe; and Soptrain, a similar service linking central Europe with Romania.

DB Schenker appeared to take a different view back in December 2014 when it announced it was suing a group of airlines $3 billion in US and German courts for allegedly operating a  cartel.

Meanwhile, in the same month, it agreed to pay $8.75 million to settle a similar complaint against it by a group of shippers.

In March this year its parent company issued a follow-up statement in respect to the airline litigation: "Deutsche Bahn can confirm that its logistics subsidiary, Schenker AG, has dismissed its claims against Nippon Cargo, SAS and Cargolux in the air  cargo cartel lawsuit brought in the Eastern District of New York."

EC Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager commented: "I find it very disappointing that a project to enhance transport efficiency and promote environmentally friendly  cargo transport was derailed into a cartel."

HD     Competition policy: Monopolies and market dominance

Market dominance per se is not illegal in Germany, but abuse of a dominant position is prohibited. The definition of market dominance hinges on whether an enterprise, as a seller or a purchaser of goods or services, has no effective competitors or holds an overwhelming position against its rivals. Evidence may be a company's financial power, its access to sales and procurement markets, interlocking arrangements it might have with other companies, or legal or practical obstacles that prevent competitors from entering the market. Using market dominance in one product area to undercut prices and eliminate competitors in another also is prohibited.

TD
A 2013 amendment to the Law Against Restraint of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen BGBl. I 2011, S. 3044-GWB) established the significant impediment of effective competition (SIEC) test. The SIEC test reviews mergers and acquisition on the basis of whether they are likely to significantly impede effective competition. While it does not greatly impact company practice, it does align Germany's regulations more closely with those of the EU and US.

The European Commission regulates cartels at the EU level and levies  fines against companies, including those domiciled in Germany, found to be in violation of pricing rules. Commission guidelines published in 2006 increased  fines, applying twice the new levels on repeat offenders and reaching to 25% of the turnover determined to have derived from collusion.

The Federal  Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt, the regulator) assumes there is market dominance when a company controls market share of at least one-third (increased to 40% under the 2013 amendment to competition law). If abuse is found, the office can invalidate contracts or impose penalties. It also can prevent or dissolve mergers that create or strengthen market-dominant positions.

A group of companies may be regarded as dominant when it consists of three or fewer companies that together control 50% of a market, or when five or fewer companies together control two-thirds. Exceptions apply when the companies that together hold a dominant market share can prove that the competition between them is such that no dominance is likely or that the group is not dominant compared with competitors.

Abuse exists when dominance is used to impede or threaten other participants or to demand excessively high or low prices. The office also examines "concert parties"-companies that act together to control specific markets.

The office sometimes grants exemptions to cartels that submit plans for gradual downsizing of capacity. For example, it registers and approves cartels formed for rationalisation purposes (either through uniform standards and types or through specialisation agreements) or for market or industry restructuring. Exceptions also apply to small and medium-sized companies if they are unlikely to gain market dominance in a particular region or industry, and if co-operation improves their competitiveness against larger companies. Import and export cartels are not eligible for exemption.

To aid policing, a "bonus rule", introduced in 2000, eliminates  fines for the company or individual that informs the office of intercompany price  fixing.  The office also offers clemency for those providing essential help in investigations of collusion among companies and groups.

As at the EU level, stiff penalties for offenders are a domestic deterrent, with regulations permitting  fines of up to EUR1m or one-tenth of annual revenues resulting from infringement. During 2014, the Federal Cartel Office issued a total of EUR1.12bn in  fines, the highest value of  fines imposed in a single year for

the bureau. Most recently, in July 2015 the regulator fined three suppliers to the German Federal Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) a total of EUR1.3m for price-fixing  over a period of four years in sales of rubber track pads and vibration dampers for military vehicles. In June 2015 it imposed a total of EUR75m in  fines on five automotive parts producers for collusion in the market prices for components supplied to the automotive industry. The action marked the first proceeding to come about via an anonymous tip through the office's electronic whistle-blowing system. Also in June 2015 it imposed  fines totalling EUR11m on ten manufacturers of prefabricated garages for having entered into price-fixing  agreements.

Recent EU-level investigations have seen German companies in a range of sectors fined for collusive activities. In July 2015 the European CommissionfinedDeutsche Bahn's cargo train subsidiary (Schenker) EUR49.2m for operating a cartel for almost eight years with the Austrian railway operator, Osterreichische Bundesbahnen, and the Swiss transport and logistics company, Kunhe+Nagel. Kunhe+Nagel was spared  fines for reporting the  cartel, which had fixed prices and allocated customers for two cargo train services. In June 2015 the Commission found Germany's Silver Plastics among eight European producers and distributors of retail food packaging guilty of  fixing  prices in the market for polystyrene and polypropylene trays, fining the  cartel EUR115.9m. Also in June 2015 it found two German automotive parts producers, Eberspacher and Webasto, in breach of antitrust rules. It  fined Eberspacher EUR68m for coordinating prices for parking heaters (which heat parked cars or trucks) with Webasto. Webasto was spared  fines for having reported the  cartel.
