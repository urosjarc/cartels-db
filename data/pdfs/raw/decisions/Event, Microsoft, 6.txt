BRUSSELS, March 24 -- European regulators ruled on Wednesday that  Microsoft broke European Union law by using its ''near monopoly'' in the Windows operating system to squeeze out rivals in other kinds of software.

The penalty, which came after five years of investigation, consultations and negotiations, went well beyond what the United States Justice Department ultimately agreed to in its  antitrust case brought in the late 1990's.

TD
The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, ordered  Microsoft within 90 days to offer a version of Windows with its media-playing software stripped out. The commission also gave the company 120 days to disclose the necessary information about Windows to rival makers of software for computer servers to allow them to design products that work as easily with Windows as Microsoft's own server software. And it  fined Microsoft 497 million euros ($603 million), its largest fine ever.
The Justice Department said late Wednesday that it was concerned about the European action.
''Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant'
companies,'' R. Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general in charge of the  antitrust division, said in a
statement.

Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it would appeal the ruling to the European courts. Such an appeal could take as long as five years, and the company said it would also ask for a suspension of the commission's penalties days after filing its appeal.

The European decision is ''an unfortunate step and it's an unnecessary step,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, noting that the Justice Department had already spent five years addressing similar issues.

The ruling, if it survives an appeal, can be expected to change the way the company does business in the European Union, a market for Microsoft of more than $3 billion that is soon to include 25 countries. And it may make Microsoft more vulnerable to antitrust litigation in the future.

Mario Monti, the European Union's  competition commissioner, said he was ''confident we have produced a decision that can withstand an appeal.''
''If future cases do materialize,'' Mr. Monti added, ''they will benefit from this precedent.''
While a number of  Microsoft's competitors declined to comment, others hailed the European ruling. Matthew Szlulik, chief executive of Red Hat, a company that competes with  Microsoft in software for
desktop computers and servers, said: ''This sends a clear message to the international and European

Page 5 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
marketplaces that innovation and choice really matter. As the E.U. looks forward, they are going to create an environment that inspires  competition and leads to better products and lower prices.''

The most important aspect of the ruling concerned  Microsoft's bundling of its media-playing software in Windows, a practice the commission calls tying.

''Tying harms  competition because it prevents a lot of high-quality alternatives from being available,'' Mr. Monti said, adding: ''Media players are separate products from operating systems. There is separate demand for them.''

Under the commission's order on Wednesday,  Microsoft may still sell a version of Windows with Media Player in European Union countries, but this bundled version must not be favored in any way over the unbundled one. The commission did not order  Microsoft to sell the unbundled version of Windows at a discount to the version with Media Player attached -- an essential requirement for restoring competition, according to computer analysts and lawyers.

''If the commission's remedy allows Microsoft to sell the two versions of Windows at the same price, then that's a problem,'' said Thomas Vinje, a competition lawyer in Brussels with the law firm of Clifford Chance, who represents one of Microsoft's strongest adversaries on both sides of the Atlantic, the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

Mr. Monti said in an interview he was convinced that offering different versions of the operating system would open the market for media players.

David R. Stewart, deputy general counsel for RealNetworks, an important  Microsoft competitor in this area, said the decision was ''a great step toward leveling the playing field'' for media players.

The requirement that  Microsoft disclose information about Windows to rival server software makers so they can design products involves only information on how Windows works with other applications
-- so-called interface documentation -- and not the operating system's source code, the commission said.

Sun Microsystems had prompted the European  antitrust case with its complaint to the commission about Microsoft in 1998. On Wednesday, Sun's vice president for legal affairs, Lee Patch, said, ''This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and competition worldwide.''

Mr. Patch continued: ''The remedy concerning interoperability will result in a wave of new competitive products on the market. Users will be able to mix and match software from different vendors. They'll be able to choose the best product on the market, then six months later take advantage of the choice to pick the best product at that particular time.''
Mr. Szlulik of Red Hat said he expected to have new products in the market six to nine months after
Microsoft made its technical standards available.

But many big Silicon Valley companies that have been both rivals and partners of  Microsoft declined on Wednesday to comment on the  European Commission's ruling, among them Apple Computer, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Intel.

Mr. Smith, the  Microsoft general counsel, said the company would request an appeal of the ruling at the European Court of First Instance within 70 days, seeking to reverse it. The commission, he said,
''isn't just freezing Windows development, it is taking consumers backward.''
It is ordering ''the broadest compulsory licensing of intellectual copyright since the founding of the
European Union more than 50 years ago,'' Mr. Smith added.

Although a suspension of the commission's ruling pending an appeal is likely, it is not certain. The commission will argue against granting a stay on the basis that the monopoly  abuse is continuing and that the  Microsoft dispute is the most serious  antitrust case the European Union has had, a spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said.

Steven A. Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, said that a settlement offer the company proposed last week would have been better for consumers and for the software industry. He added that  Microsoft still hoped to resume negotiations with the commission.

The company declined to say exactly what it had offered Mr. Monti in the settlement talks last week. In an interview, Mr. Smith said the offer included bundling two rival media players in with  Microsoft's Media Player in the Windows operating system. He said the company also offered to divulge all the

Page 6 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
necessary information about Windows that the commission was seeking to restore fair  competition in the server software market.

In addition,  Microsoft offered to put the changes into effect worldwide. The commission's decision applies only in Europe.

He declined to address how  Microsoft could meet the commission's desire to establish a precedent in having a say over future products.

One lawyer close to  Microsoft said it ''tried to meet this demand part of the way'' by offering to consult the commission about future plans to add software products to the Windows operating system. But a top antitrust official working on the case said this fell short of what regulators were looking for.

''The commission was quite indifferent as to whether the case was settled or ruled on, as long as the equivalent of a precedent was made,'' the head of the  antitrust team, Philip Lowe, said.

Microsoft ''proposed that we should accept an agreement whereby they would say 'if problems arise, come back and see us,'" Mr. Lowe said, adding, ''We couldn't agree to that.''

Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has argued cases against  Microsoft, said that the position taken by the Europeans means that regulators there have a chance to preserve  competition, while American regulators have reacted too slowly.

''The prevailing sentiment of U.S.  antitrust enforcers is, 'Come back when you're dead,''' Mr. Reback asserted. ''This is the first time somebody's stepped in while there was still  competition.''

Although  Microsoft survived a United States judges order that the company be split in two, its stock price has not recovered because of continuing weakness in the technology industries and increasing pressure from regulators in Europe to change its business practices.
FEB. 2000 -- The  European Commission begins investigation into whether  Microsoft blocked
competition by bundling features in its Windows operating system.
APRIL 2000 -- U.S. judge rules that  Microsoft violated antitrust law. JUNE 2000 -- The judge rules that  Microsoft should be broken in two.
AUG. 2000 -- The  European Commission says Microsoft blocked competition.
JUNE 2001 -- A U.S. court of appeals overturns the decision ordering that  Microsoft be split.
AUG. 2001 -- The  European Commission says for second time that  Microsoft blocked competition. NOV. 2001 -- Microsoft and the Justice Department settle the U.S.  antitrust dispute. The agreement
does not prohibit Microsoft from continuing to bundle features in its operating system.
AUG. 2003 -- The  European Commission says for the third time that  Microsoft inhibited
competition. The commission says it may impose  fines and other penalties.

YESTERDAY -- European regulators follow through on their warnings after attempts to resolve the dispute fail.

BRUSSELS, March 24 -- When Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, arrived in Brussels early last week to negotiate with the European Commission over its antitrust case, lawyers involved in the talks said they believed that a settlement was within reach.

But Mario Monti, the commission's chief  antitrust enforcer, insisted on provisions that would constrain Microsoft from future behavior like the current practice of bundling its Media Player into Windows.

TD
Microsoft, a lawyer representing the company in the case, said, was ''absolutely astonished.''

Still, he said, Mr. Ballmer did not reject the demand outright. After two days of trying to close the gap, however, the company was not willing to expand the scope of the agreement enough to suit Mr. Monti.

Mr. Monti has stalked plenty of big corporate game in his five turbulent years overseeing  antitrust enforcement for the European Union. With his term in Brussels coming to an end this fall, his latest trophy, Microsoft, is without a doubt his biggest.

The European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft, issued here on Wednesday, brands the company as an abusive monopolist, and imposes remedies on it that go much further than those negotiated between  Microsoft and the Justice Department three years ago.

Brussels also hit Microsoft with a fine of 497 million euros ($603 million), the largest it ever imposed on a single company in an antitrust case. But the money, both sides agree, pales in comparison to the message.

Europe continues to chart an aggressive course in regulating the behavior of big corporations, despite the more laissez-faire approach in the United States under the Bush administration and despite a series of legal setbacks that many predicted would blunt Mr. Monti's hard-charging style.

''It's hard to argue he's pulled his punches,'' said Joe Simons, a former chief of the  competition bureau at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington. ''Microsoft is about as big a thing as you can bite off.''

For Mr. Monti, a courtly, silver-haired former economics professor from Milan, the  Microsoft case is also something of a bookend to the commission's landmark decision in 2001, when it blocked General Electric's planned $45 billion takeover of Honeywell.

That decision, which came after bruising negotiations with G.E.'s former chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and despite intense pressure from Washington, brought Mr. Monti sudden notoriety. An obscure European bureaucrat had thwarted one of America's leading industrial empires.

Page 9 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now, Mr. Monti, 61, has taken on arguably the leading American technology company, and has again refused to settle, despite face-to-face negotiations with Mr. Ballmer.

''We wanted a settlement which would set clear principles concerning the future conduct of  Microsoft, to avoid going back to these sort of abuses,'' Mr. Monti said in an interview. ''They were not prepared to do this. We had to agree that on this point, we disagreed.''

Mr. Monti's critics said the ruling perpetuated the European Union's tendency to take a more restrictive approach to business.

''There is still a broad gulf between  competition policy in Europe and the United States,'' said William Kolasky, a former  antitrust official in the Justice Department who had criticized the G.E.-Honeywell ruling.

''European agencies come from a more corporatist perspective,'' Mr. Kolasky said. ''There really is less stomach in Europe for the kind of Darwinian  competition that we've embraced'' in the United States, he added.

Still, Mr. Kolasky noted that the  Microsoft case did not arouse the same invective from Washington as did the G.E.-Honeywell case. In contrast to the earlier reaction, the Justice Department issued a relatively mild statement Wednesday after the European ruling noting that it may produce
''unintended consequences.''

Mr. Kolasky attributed that restraint in part to the fact that the Justice Department had itself already gone toe-to-toe with  Microsoft. At the same time, he noted that Washington was eager not to antagonize Brussels right now.

While Mr. Monti may take a harder line than American regulators these days, legal experts say he has actually brought Europe closer to the United States in the way it prosecutes  antitrust cases.
''There is a marked convergence,'' said James F. Rill, a former director of the  antitrust division in the
Justice Department. ''That has to be a large part of the legacy of Mario Monti.''

None of this mollified  Microsoft, which said the commission's ruling would stifle innovation and deprive consumers of choices. If the ruling survives legal challenge, the company will be required to offer PC manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system stripped of its multimedia software, Media Player.

Microsoft had offered to sell Windows with three rival media-player programs already installed. The company's general counsel, Brad Smith, said that would have resulted in  Microsoft's distributing 300 million copies of competing programs a year for the next three years.
''This gives consumers less value for their euros,'' Mr. Smith said in a conference call with reporters.
''It is crystal clear that it would have been far more productive to reach a settlement last week.''

Even some experts who question  Microsoft's practices cautioned that Brussels's move could set bad precedents.

''Once regulators get their bit in their teeth and realize they can regulate, they may not stop with the bad actors,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future, a Silicon Valley research firm.

Mr. Monti, lawyers for  Microsoft suggested, may have felt emboldened to take a tougher stance at the 11th hour by the endorsement of his ruling by all 15 of the European Union's countries.

''I can't figure out any other explanation for it, except that he wanted to make a grand public gesture,'' said one lawyer close to  Microsoft.

Mr. Monti said the notion of setting a precedent for  Microsoft's future behavior was not new. He would have been willing to delay the ruling, he added, if he had sensed that  Microsoft was moving in his direction.

Mr. Monti's muscular performance on  Microsoft positions him for a prominent future role in Europe, even after his term expires. He said he would be willing to serve another term in Brussels if nominated by the Italian government. Insiders say he could be up for the post of commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, which is expected to be vacated by Pedro Solbes of Spain.
By spurning a settlement with  Microsoft, Mr. Monti has bequeathed this case to his successor.
Microsoft plans to appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Some

Page 10 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
analysts predict that the company, as it did in the United States, will work out a deal only after a court ruling.

Mr. Monti seemed unconcerned about leaving behind unfinished business, saying that was inevitable in a big institution.

Some of Mr. Monti's comfort may stem from the fact that after a rocky period during which his staff came under criticism for inadequate and even slipshod legal work, his office has rebuilt its reputation.

After a European court overturned three of the commission's vetoes of mergers in 2002, Mr. Monti instituted sweeping changes -- recruiting a chief economist to analyze mergers from a business perspective, and appointing ''devil's advocates'' to cross-examine his staff's conclusions.
Mr. Monti's new-found caution was evident in the  Microsoft case, which stretched over five years.

''He reacted well to his three defeats,'' Mr. Kolasky said. ''Hiring an economist, and giving him staff, has made the analysis more sophisticated. Merger reform is moving in the right direction.''

Despite his reputation for confrontation, Mr. Monti adopted a penitent tone after the legal reversals, promising to learn from them. Some experts said the strategy probably saved his reputation.
''He handled it beautifully by being conciliatory,'' said Robert Pitofsky, a former chairman of the F.T.C.
''It's a rare person that can see the disadvantages of being resentful and thin-skinned.''

Despite the settlement in 2001 of the U.S.  antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., the European Union is continuing its attack on the software firm. In the U.S. case, Microsoft was allowed to continue "tying" -- or combining -- new software into its Windows operating system.

But in the ruling released yesterday, the  European Commission -- which enforces EU regulations -- "not only declared the software company an abusive monopolist, but levied penalties designed to prevent similar abuses in the future," reported the New York Times. "The ruling orders  Microsoft to sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers of personal computers ... . One version must remove Microsoft's audio-video playing software, called Media Player. The ruling ordered the
company to produce the alternate version within 90 days."  Microsoft was fined 497 million euros (about
$613 million). Microsoft is appealing the decision.

TD
This is the computer equivalent of ordering automakers to sell cars without transmissions, which then could be bought from another company.

"The commission's ruling also forces the company, within 120 days, to divulge previously proprietary information about the way Windows works in order to allow rivals the chance of making software suitable for Windows users," the Times reported.

Why don't they also order U.S. automakers or pharmaceutical companies to divulge their proprietary business information? Companies spend billions of dollars on research and development. To mandate that they open their discoveries to the world would decrease their incentive to invest in new products in the future.

Robert Levy, senior fellow in Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, told us that the lawsuit in Europe, as with the federal lawsuit in the United States, was instigated by  Microsoft's American rivals, especially Sun Microsystems. "The EU ruling sends the following message," he said: "`If you don't make it in the marketplace [selling your product], go to the federal government. If that doesn't work, go to the state governments, then the Europeans, then to Japan."'

He said that countries should respect the antitrust rulings of one another concerning home companies, in this case the U.S. federal actions because Microsoft is a U.S. company.

We would add that the U.S. government under the Clinton administration should continue to be blamed for starting the  antitrust roller coaster moving in the first place against  Microsoft in 1998. The EU action
-- which we hope is overturned on appeal -- might never have happened without the U.S. action. And the
EU action now could well hurt any American company that does well in the international marketplace.

HD         Europeans  Come Down Hard on Microsoft

Microsoft Corp. is abusing a "near monopoly" in crucial computer software to squeeze out competitors, the European Union ruled Wednesday after a contentious five-year investigation. It ordered the
company to pay a fine of more than $600 million, and to offer two versions of its Windows operating system in Europe, one without software for playing digital music and videos.

The order effectively puts  Microsoft on notice that future attempts to add features to Windows could be challenged in Europe if the additions put rival products at a competitive disadvantage. The ruling is intended to ensure that "anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace," EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti said in Brussels.

TD
The penalties go well beyond the terms of a settlement  Microsoft reached with the U.S. Justice Department and several states in 2001. A Justice Department official criticized the EU's decision to adopt separate mandates, and several members of Congress warned that the ruling could widen trade and diplomatic rifts between the United States and Europe.

EU officials, in defense of their action, said they sought to establish what has eluded  Microsoft competitors in the United States: legal precedent to limit the company's 20-year-old practice of constantly incorporating new applications such as the Windows Media Player into the operating system, then capitalizing on Windows' nearly universal distribution to overwhelm rival products.

"That's . . . really the point of this verdict," said Jaap Favier, research director of Forrester Research Europe in Amsterdam. "Instead of running behind  Microsoft, Monti is trying to get in front of them and say, 'Stop!' "

Microsoft, which said it will appeal the order, now faces the prospect that at least in Europe it cannot enhance future versions of Windows as it has planned by incorporating an Internet search engine and other features.

"Every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers," General Counsel Bradford L. Smith said.

Smith said  Microsoft would attempt to postpone some or all of the penalties while the appeal, which could take years, is pending.

Smith used his toughest language to decry the 15-nation EU's refusal to stay within the boundaries of the U.S. settlement, even after the company offered to impose licensing terms that would have required computer makers to put at least three rival media players on their desktops with the Windows player.

"The commission clearly chose to turn down an offer than would have avoided conflict and instead chose a path that has conflict attached to it," he said.

Late Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department defended its settlement, which required only that computer makers have the freedom to mask user access to  Microsoft programs such as the Web browser and media player in favor of highlighting other applications.
"Sound antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies,"
antitrust division chief R. Hewitt Pate said in a written statement.

The Justice Department had lobbied Monti's staff frequently to fashion sanctions that were not at odds with those imposed in the United States.

"I now fear that the U.S. and the EU are heading toward a new trade war -- and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) said.

The European investigation was triggered by a complaint by Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1998. It focused on two issues:  Microsoft's inclusion of its media-player software -- which plays video and sound -- in Windows, and its refusal to disclose technical information that competitors say they need to make networks compatible with computers that use Windows.

Microsoft contends that enhancements to Windows such as the media player reduce costs and make computers easier to use.

Wednesday's decision was made by the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU. In a written statement, the commission said Microsoft deliberately abused its market power -- creating less choice and higher prices for consumers -- and that the "illegal behavior is still ongoing."

The commission gave Microsoft 90 days to offer in EU markets versions of Windows with and without the media player, and specified that the version with the player could not be offered on terms more favorable than the other.

The commission gave Microsoft 120 days to disclose "complete and accurate" data on Windows to allow work-group servers -- computers that control office networks -- to be fully compatible with Windows computers on the desks of network users.

The fine -- set at 497.2 million euros, or $602.90 million based on Wednesday's closing exchange rate in the United States -- is the largest ever imposed by the commission, which jointly handles economic and other policy matters for the union's 15 member nations. With $10.15 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, and more than $50 billion in cash and equivalents on hand,  Microsoft would not be financially pressed to pay the  fines. Many antitrust analysts have said the main impact is symbolic.

Settlement talks in the EU failed on the commission's insistence that any deal include rules for Microsoft's future behavior concerning Windows, EU officials said. Otherwise, the commission would be "only putting off the problem," said Anthony Gooch, a commission spokesman in Washington.

After spending five years investigating  Microsoft, the commission is not eager to repeat it in connection with complaints about other Windows features, current and planned, that it is already considering,
Gooch said.
In interviews,  Microsoft rivals praised the commission's ruling.

"The commission condemned a central part of  Microsoft's business model as being illegal," said David Stewart, deputy general counsel of RealNetworks Inc., which makes media-playing software that competes with  Microsoft's.

The commission is imposing "competition on the merits," by which such considerations as speed, reliability and security are factors in sales decisions, "rather than the artificial one of whether a machine can interoperate with  Microsoft's desktops," said Lee Patch, vice president of legal affairs at Sun Microsystems Inc. The decision "deals not with the past but addresses the future," he said.

The fight now goes to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, where appeals to such commission decisions are filed.  Microsoft can seek an injunction that would put off the penalties pending appellate consideration. The EU said the normal procedure would be for  Microsoft to set up a bank guarantee for the amount of the  fine. Smith, of  Microsoft, said he hoped the commission and Microsoft might resume settlement talks after appellate rulings clarify legal issues. He contended that removing the media player would violate  Microsoft's intellectual property rights, in part by creating an inferior product under its brand.

Removing the media player from Windows would also harm the operating system's internal workings, disabling 20 related functions, he said. For instance, advanced video features on certain much-visited European Web sites would not work as intended -- a claim that rivals dispute.
"Whatever the commission is ordering us to create today is a new operating system -- it is not
Windows," Smith said.

HD          Microsoft Faces Tough Sanctions As EU Attacks  Its Business Strategy --- Software Leader Told
To Disclose  Its Codes, Fined 497 Million  Euros

BRUSSELS -- In a landmark bid to shake  Microsoft Corp.'s stranglehold on the personal-computer industry, European Union regulators slapped the software giant with tough sanctions aimed directly at its treasured business model and meant to influence its future behavior in the marketplace.

The European Commission, judging that the software titan was abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips, ordered  Microsoft to reveal code
from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals' competing server software. Unless Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with that disclosure requirement.

TD
In the other major part of the penalties,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer PC manufacturers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play audio and video.

Michael Hausfeld, a U.S. litigator who represented European consumer groups in the case, said the commission's remedy is significant, because it "addressed not only the specifics of this case but also sought to encompass future misconduct, which the U.S. failed to do in its settlement."  Microsoft's 2001 settlement with the U.S. Justice Department included a system whereby PC makers or consumers can remove access to Microsoft software code, but not take it out of the product altogether.

The commission signaled that it would keep up the pressure on  Microsoft, saying the company's "illegal behavior is still ongoing." It also warned that it remains concerned about  Microsoft's "general business model" that "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which Microsoft could conceivably take an interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

The EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, also  fined Microsoft 497 million euros, a record against a single company. Still, Microsoft has more than $50 billion (more than 40 billion euros) in cash and short-term investments, making any fine less important than the other orders to modify its business model.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and doesn't harm consumers and innovation," Mr. Monti said. He denied that his orders violated  Microsoft's intellectual-property rights and called his moves "proportionate" and "balanced."

Microsoft said it will appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance, saying the decision oversteps European and international law.  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, made it clear that the company plans to use laws regarding the use of intellectual property as the foundation of its appeal of the commission's ruling, and for a stay of its orders. The company contends that the disclosures about information related to server software amount to an improper form of compulsory licensing, which he compared to ordering a movie studio to give competitors its scripts.  Microsoft has 70 days to ask judges to freeze and eventually overturn the decision.

Antitrust experts say the company has a fighting chance to win that order to freeze -- particularly if judges share Microsoft's fears that the decision represents a threat to intellectual-property protection in Europe.

In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, condemned the commission's action. Noting that Europe's economies were stagnant because of huge debt, taxes and crippling business regulation in Brussels, Mr. Frist said, "Now, the  European Commission has taken aim at Microsoft, a company whose products and technology have been engines of global economic growth."

The ranking Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, hailed the ruling as "significant steps to protect competition in this vitally important industry." But he also raised concern about diverging U.S. and EU regulatory policy. "We are concerned that in an era of global business competition, the U.S. and EU must work harder to harmonize their  antitrust laws."

Microsoft competitors RealNetworks Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. praised the decision and said it gave them a fair chance in the market. Both companies had led the anti-Microsoft campaign in Europe.

"The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' vice president and general counsel.

Lee Patch, a Sun vice president of public affairs, challenged Microsoft's basis for appeal, arguing that intellectual-property laws do not necessarily trump rules governing antitrust law. He noted that a U.S. appeals court, in denying similar arguments in the Justice Department case, used the analogy of Microsoft owning a baseball bat. Just because the company holds property rights to that object, that doesn't indemnify it for any violations of law associated with using it, Mr. Patch said.

Mr. Monti, the competition commissioner, spent much of Wednesday defending a decision that goes far beyond what Microsoft agreed to in a 2001 settlement with the administration of President George W. Bush in a similar case. Mr. Monti said he could have imposed a  fine on Microsoft's global sales but refrained "in deference" to regulators in different parts of the world, including the U.S.

Europe set its fine by taking into account  Microsoft's sales only in Europe. The sum represents less than 2% of Microsoft's world-wide sales and 8% of the company's narrower sales in Europe and
nearby countries, European Commission officials said. Under EU law, regulators could have  fined     Microsoft as much as 10% of its most recent annual world-wide sales -- which works out to about 3 billion euros.

Europe's case against  Microsoft dates back to 1998, when Sun accused Microsoft of withholding code that enables smooth connections between its servers and Microsoft-powered PCs. On Wednesday, EU regulators upheld those charges, but said Microsoft can charge "reasonable remuneration" for sharing its interfaces.

In 2001, the commission later expanded the case to investigate  Microsoft's power over multimedia software. That part of the case focused on RealNetworks' RealPlayer software. As part of Wednesday's ruling, the commission said  Microsoft can't sell at a discount versions of Windows that are prebundled with its own Media Player.

The earlier U.S. case also focused on the concept of bundling but it differed in the details. While the U.S. concentrated on the Internet Explorer Web browser, the European case concerned compatibility issues between PCs and servers, and later on media players.

As in the U.S.  antitrust battle before it, an overriding philosophical issue in the European decision concerned whether government should put limits on the features a dominant company can add to its products. In the case of  Microsoft's Media Player product, the commission argued that  Microsoft's inclusion of the software with Windows amounted to an illegal "tying" action that hurt competitors and deterred the development of products that could help consumers.

Microsoft has long argued that it should be able to add almost any feature to Windows for the purpose of product improvement. Resolving the question is key to  Microsoft. It still faces at least two separate antitrust challenges in Europe.

EU regulators already are investigating whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, such as hand-held computers and smart phones. They also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer-hardware makers to agree to unfair technology-licensing terms.

HD         Microsoft Faces Tough Sanctions As EU Attacks  Its Business Strategy --- Monti's  Initiatives On
Commerce Leave An Enduring Mark

BRUSSELS -- Mario Monti may be remembered most as the mild-mannered economist turned tough antitrust cop who stared down General Electric Co. and  Microsoft Corp. But other decisions made under his watch are likely to have longer-lasting effects.

Six months before he is scheduled to leave office, the European Union's competition commissioner slapped the Redmond, Washington, software company with the biggest antitrust fine in EU history --
497.2 million euros -- and ordered the company to stop using its Windows monopoly to elbow its way into other markets. The landmark case, which took five years to press, showed that both Mr. Monti and the fast-growing EU are willing to tackle the most controversial international trust-busting challenges, in additional to blocking big mergers such as GE's plans to buy rival Honeywell International Inc.

TD
"He's going out with a bang," said Greg Olsen, head of the competition practice at law firm Jones Day Gouldens in London, which has no connection to the Microsoft case. Mr. Monti's legacy inevitably will be based in part on comparisons between the commissioner's willingness to tackle the software giant and the U.S. Justice Department's 2001 decision to settle with the company after an earlier landmark investigation, Mr. Olsen said.

Memorable as such individual crackdowns may be, they're ultimately less important -- both to European consumers and the global economy -- than a series of quiet but far-reaching changes that Mr. Monti introduced to the regulation of business in Europe, say lawyers, lobbyists and others who have followed his initiatives.

The changes, some of which take effect May 1 when the EU grows to 25 nations from 15, affect not only companies based in Europe but also thousands of U.S. and other multinational companies. As the top regulatory authority for America's most important trading partner, the  European Commission, which is the EU's executive agency, increasingly is making decisions that have ripple effects abroad.

Moreover, those changes will remain in place long after Mr. Monti is expected to leave office. "Mr. Monti will leave broad, structural reforms in place, and those will remain for many years to come," said Christopher Thomas, a partner at law firm Lovells in Brussels who represents one of  Microsoft's rivals in the EU case. "May 1 is very much a Big Bang for  competition-law enforcement in Europe," he said.

The new powers include sealing off corporate offices for unspecified periods to prevent destruction of evidence in merger cases and entering the homes, cars, yachts and other personal property of executives suspected of abusing their companies' market power or conspiring to fix prices. EU officials also have a clearer mandate to order dominant companies to sell themselves off in parts. In a separate case, Microsoft's opponents have vowed to push the commission to split apart the software company to break Windows' grip on the computer operating-system market.

"Monti will leave a very rich legacy," agreed Charles Stark, a partner at law firm Wilmer Cutler & Pickering in Brussels who previously observed Mr. Monti from the  antitrust department of the U.S. Department of Justice. "An enormous amount of reform has taken place, or is about to take place, under his watch," he said.


Page 21 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Mr. Monti's aggressive antitrust enforcement also has attracted critics. William Kolasky, a former assistant attorney general for antitrust at the U.S. Department of Justice when Mr. Monti blocked GE's
$42 billion (34.1 billion euros) bid to acquire Honeywell in July 2001, said at the time that Europe's reasoning wasn't "strongly grounded in economic theory or empirical evidence." While Mr. Kolasky, now a partner in the Washington office of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, now calls Mr. Monti "one of the good guys," he also criticized Wednesday's Microsoft decision. Europeans such as Mr. Monti are "far less comfortable with the Darwinian view of competition" than Americans, Mr. Kolasky said, arguing that the EU antitrust chief should give market forces a chance to decide which business model works best for consumers.

On Wednesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called Mr. Monti's remedies against  Microsoft "a preposterous demand by a foreign government."

The low point for Mr. Monti was in 2002, when the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance overturned three commission merger prohibitions, including Airtours PLC's bid to take over U.K. travel-company
rival First Choice Holidays PLC. In that decision, the court said the commission's economic analysis
"was vitiated by errors and omissions." (Airtours has since been renamed MyTravel Group PLC).
Mr. Monti's handling of the  Microsoft decision reflects his response to the court's criticisms. The former
Italian economics professor, introduced new checks and balances in  antitrust reviews. For example,
Mr. Monti subjected an early draft of the commission's decision to an internal "devil's advocate" panel of
officials who weren't part of the  Microsoft-case team. He commissioned several surveys of large
institutional users of  Microsoft software to gather more evidence of  Microsoft wrongdoing, independent
of complaints by the company's competitors.

Responding to one of the most frequent criticisms of European  antitrust enforcement, Mr. Monti told a news conference Wednesday, "Competitors were by no means the driving force of the commission's investigation."

During the five-year  Microsoft investigation, commission officials sent  Microsoft three different official statements of objections, or charge sheets, each time refining their arguments in response to Microsoft's replies. Last week, Mr. Monti personally met for more than six hours over three days with Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and other company executives in Brussels to explore the possibility of a settlement.

"We've been extremely careful about the quality of the decision-making process," Mr. Monti said Wednesday. "I'm confident we've produced here a decision that will stand up before any appeal." Microsoft said it plans to appeal the commission's findings and also seek suspension of Mr. Monti's orders pending the outcome of the appeal, a process that could take another five years.

By that time, Mr. Monti is unlikely to be Europe's  antitrust czar. Mr. Monti prefers to take a longer view. For example, he has angered national politicians in France, Germany and other European countries by blocking financial aid for faltering marquee companies, arguing that corporate failures and the resulting layoffs are natural costs of healthy market economies.
If Mr. Monti, 61 years old, leaves his post, a possible successor is Frits Bolkestein, 70, the
commissioner responsible for enforcing EU rules on interstate commerce. Like Mr. Monti, Mr. Bolkestein
is a proponent of free-market principles. The veteran Dutch Liberal politician and former executive with
Royal Dutch/Shell also has a reputation for speaking his mind.

HD      Microsoft to Appeal EC Ruling on Media Player

The European Commission (EC) Wed. ordered  Microsoft to unbundle Media Player from its Windows operating system, and slapped the software giant with a 497 million euro ($613 million)  fine. If  Microsoft's appeal and request for a stay fails, it must, within 90 days, offer PC makers and end users it sells to
directly a version of Windows without Media Player, the EC said. Although pricing wasn't part of the Commission's antitrust analysis, the decision contains strong provisions barring  Microsoft from circumventing the remedies by giving computer makers who opt for Media Player a price break, Competition Comr. Mario Monti said at a Wed. news briefing. The EC also ordered the company to disclose the code needed to talk to the Windows operating system.

TD
Microsoft called the decision "unfortunate," and said it would appeal it to the European Court of First Instance. The company's settlement offer would have helped consumers more than the EC ruling, said Brad Smith, senior vp-gen. counsel and corp. secy.-law & corporate affairs.  Microsoft's proposal offered even greater interoperability and would have carried 3 competitors' media players, Smith said. Computer
& Communications Industry Assn. Pres. Ed Black told reporters, however, that if  Microsoft's proposed settlement "is so good for consumers," it "should on their own without compulsion" offer alternate media players bundled with it operating system.

Smith said the company's settlement agreement would have applied world-wide, not just to  Microsoft's European Economic Area (EEA). But Smith said Microsoft needed to make sure from the EC the ruling's scope is in fact limited to the EEA. Smith repeated Microsoft's claim that stripping Media Player code
from Windows would cause problems including that Web sites including those of the Italian Parliament and BSkYB "simply will not work. Black took issue with that argument as well. He said the ruling "dispels the myth that governmental authorities are either too slow or too weak-willed" to take on  Microsoft, and after this "more companies will come forward" to claim injury by  Microsoft.

The decision that  Microsoft abused its virtual monopoly power in PC operating systems in the markets for media players and work-group server operating systems wasn't made lightly, Monti said. It followed a
5-year investigation that included intense debate within the  Competition directorate, lengthy discussions with legal and economic experts, and talks with the 15 European Union member states, he said. The resulting decision is balanced, proportionate to the market abuses identified and in the best interest of innovators and European consumers, he said.

Monti outlined the rationale underlying the decision. Regarding  Microsoft's linking Media Player to its operating system, he said the finding of tying required proof: (1) The company dominates the product-tying market and is forcing its tied product on consumers. (2) There's separate demand for both its and others' media platforms. (3) The tying is harming consumers. (4) PC operating systems and media players are separate products. (5) PC manufacturers and consumers have no choice in media players. Monti stressed that the EC hasn't ruled tying illegal per se. The decision is based on a detailed analysis of  Microsoft's behavior, he said. The EC did as the court handling the U.S.  Microsoft case suggested and used the "rule of reason," he said. The Commission believes the decision will bring about the best result for consumers, Monti said, as "innovation will spring forth from many places," including  Microsoft itself.

The decision is precedent-setting in that it could provide a roadmap for handling further  antitrust allegations against  Microsoft, Monti said. Today's ruling allows people to "start getting the flavor of how cautious the EC has been in handling this complex case and how deep an analysis has been conducted," on the legal and economic sides.

Asked how the  fine was calculated, Monti said it took into account  Microsoft's EEA-wide turnover in the markets affected by its monopoly, the need to deter the company from future misbehavior, and the nature
Page 23 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of the market abuses.  Microsoft competitors weren't the driving force behind the decision, he said; the EC is trying to protect the process of  competition, not competitors. Although  Microsoft's products are available globally -- and the Commission could have made a decision of world-wide scope -- the EC
limited its ruling to the EEA in deference to U.S. and other countries'  competition authorities, Monti said. In particular, he said, the Commission has taken pains to avoid collision with the U.S. Dept. of Justice.

In addition to the  fine, remedies include: (1) Within 90 days  Microsoft must begin offering PC makers a version of Windows unbundled from Media Player. (2) Within 120 days the company must disclose "complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers." (3) Microsoft must refrain from technological, commercial and contractual measures that would make the unbundled version less attractive or functional. (4) A monitoring trustee will ensure interface disclosures are completed and the 2 versions of Windows are equivalent in performance.

RealNetworks, whose RealPlayer media platform competes with Microsoft's, called the decision "fundamentally significant" because the EC formally declared Microsoft's bundling strategy illegal and "established the guideposts for future bundling cases." The EC is the 3rd prominent legal body to find Microsoft abuses its monopoly power, said RealNetworks Vp-Gen. Counsel Bob Kimball. It "confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," he said. Following the EC's decision, Kimball said, RealNetworks will "vigorously pursue" its U.S. case.

Microsoft will ask the Court of First Instance to stay or suspend at least part of the sanctions, Smith said
-- particularly the provision requiring the company to produce Windows operating systems without Media
Player. Part of the basis for seeking legal review is that the EC is ordering the broadest invasion of
Microsoft's IP rights, Smith said -- a party can't be required to license something and then pull it back if it
wins on appeal. The code removal remedy is also a very broad compulsory license in and of itself, he said.
The purpose of a trademark is to allow consumers to associate a name with a product, and whatever the
EC is ordering Microsoft to produce, it's not Windows, because it won't have the full range of applications,
he said. The decision infringes  Microsoft's European trademark and copyright rights and violates the EC's
obligations under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, Smith said.

Microsoft hopes to resume talks with the EC, Smith said, though no activity is likely in the coming weeks. Microsoft thinks the European scenario will mirror that in the U.S., where settlement talks failed, the case went to trial, an appellate court clarified the issues, and then a final settlement was reached, he said. Meantime, the company's brief is in 70 days, launching what could be another 4-5 years of litigation, Smith said.

CCIA has led the fight against Microsoft on antitrust grounds for years and welcomed the decision. Black noted the EC would continue monitoring Microsoft. Software & Information Industry Assn. Pres. Ken Wasch called the action "historic," saying it benefited consumers: "The decision on Windows Media Player is critical to promoting a variety of platforms on which digital content can be delivered." But other software trade groups decried the EC decision. Computing Technology Industry Assn. (CompTIA) European Dir. Hugo Lueders called the ruling "an ominous change" that "sends a message that companies who compete aggressively and give consumers better products will be punished." Assn. for Competitive Technology
Pres. Jonathan Zuck said the EC's greatest punishment fell on "consumers and small technology companies." "The  European Commission is focusing on Media Player as an application, but forcing Microsoft to take the entire Media Player technology out of Windows removes the safety for programmers," he said. -- Dugie Standeford, Patrick Ross

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Wednesday that the world's biggest software maker would still try to resume discussions with the  European Commission to reach a mutual resolution.

"We worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European Commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers," Ballmer said.

TD
"We were really on the verge of an agreement that would resolve the issue in this case without the need for litigation," he told reporters in a teleconference.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined Microsoft Corp. a record 497 million euros (606 million US dollars) for breaking  antitrust law and ordered it to unbundle media software from its operating system.



Analysts say that move could lead to fundamental changes in how the world's biggest software maker does business.
EU
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the ruling aims to

assure anyone who develops new software had a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace and it was important to have a decision that would make it easier and quicker to act on future complaints.



But Ballmer described the EU action as "much riskier," saying the ruling offers little to consumers.
"We respect the Commission's authority, but we believe that our

settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers."
Microsoft had offered to include three rival media players in the Windows operating system,

Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of  Microsoft, said the company would appeal to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, which could delay action on the order for years.

Smith said he was "very optimistic" the court would suspend the EU orders. "We believe we have excellent arguments about how this would cause consumer confusion and disrupt the industry."

He noted a negotiated settlement would have yielded immediate action, but a protracted legal battle could drive them "on a path to get a result in 2009."



"We want to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, and we look forward to the possibility of continuing these discussions as this case moves forward," he said.
The

European  Commission gave Microsoft 90 days to unbundled its Windows Media Player, which it said has damaged such rivals as RealNetworks RealPlayer and Apple Computer Inc.'s Quicktime.
It also ordered Microsoft to allow makers of servers, the big computers that run networks, to view its software code so that they can make systems that are compatible with those running on Microsoft software.

NEW YORK, March 24 (Xinhua) - Wall Streets stocks closed mixed Wednesday after four days of declines as terrorism fears and European Union's ruling against  Microsoft Corp. offset upbeat economic news.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.41 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,048.23; the Standard & Poor's
500 index declined 2. 62 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,091.33; the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.68
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,909.48.

TD
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods rose 2.5 percent last month, more than double what economists expected. But terrorism fears and EU decision against Microsoft reduced the effect of upbeat economic news.

The European Commission fined Microsoft 613 million dollars for abusing its monopoly on the Windows operating system by bundling other software with it in an attempt to quash competition from other software makers. The  fine was the biggest imposed by the EU on a single company. Microsoft Corp. vowed to appeal EU's decision.

Also on Wednesday, a French railway worker had found a bomb under a passenger line between Paris and Basel, Switzerland. This reawakened fears over another wave of terrorist attacks and weighed on the market.
Applied Materials Inc. rose 41 cents to 20.77 dollars after the company said it planned to buy back up to
3 billion of its common stocks over the next three years.

Teva Pharmaceutical and Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. both closed higher after US Food and Drug Administration approved their new medicine. Teva climbed 56 cents to 61.80 dollars and Endo soared 2.55 dollars to 22.68 dollars.

AT&T Corp. gained 5 cents to 19.42 dollars after saying it planned to introduced new internet technology to its traditional phone service, and Linux distributor Red Hat Inc. rose 60 cents to 20.01 dollars after posting profits that met market expectations.


Microsoft Corp. also gained 26 cents to 24.41 dollars following the European Commission's decision.
On the NYSE, declining stocks outnumbered advancers 2 to 1, and the trading volume was moderate at 1.50 billion shares.

For Microsoft, life over the last five years has been a tale of two venues. Challenged by  antitrust
forces in Washington and in Europe,  Microsoft got off light at the hands of the Bush administration. But
the world's biggest computer software maker got slapped hard by the Europeans and was given a
record-setting  fine of more than $600 million.

What the sanctions say is that  Microsoft can no longer give away essentially what others invented or refined, which can throttle would-be competitors.

TD
Specifically, the ruling by the  European Commission requires Microsoft to cease imbedding in new computers its Windows Media Player; the practice, the EC found, prevents other similar products from RealNetworks Inc. and others from getting a toehold.

The huge fine means little to  Microsoft, which reportedly has some $50 billion in cash on hand, but being forced to unbundle and open the door for others has made the company bristle and appeal the decision to European courts. The European sanctions also include a requirement for  Microsoft to open its systems to other services who want to attach to computers, including servers.

By comparison, the  Microsoft competitors got little in litigation on the home front. The Bush administration settled for less, requiring  Microsoft merely to make other players available, while keeping the Windows Media Player tucked conveniently within the operating system.

The Europeans preserved the possibility for  competition and choices by consumers --- at least in Europe. Assuming the rulings withstand legal challenges, they hold out the possibility of promoting dynamic change in the industry, and that is good for business and consumers.

* Brussels

MARIO MONTI, the European Competition Commissioner, denied that anti-American feeling lay behind the EU's decision yesterday to fine Microsoft a record E497.2 million ($815.1 million) for anti-competitive behaviour.

TD
Mr Monti said the action was motivated by a desire to bolster consumer choice and promote innovation. "We do not take account of the nationality of a company. We are here to defend the welfare and interests of consumers on European territory," he said.
The commissioner pointed to other recent EU action against Michelin in France and Deutsche Post in
Germany, the latter in response to a complaint to Brussels from the American company UPS.

After a five-year investigation, the commission found that  Microsoft, whose operating systems equip more than 95 per cent of the world's personal computers, had abused its market power on two counts. The company had deliberately restricted interface between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft servers, and had bundled its Windows Media Player, where it faces  competition, in with the Windows
software.
The two practices penalised competitors and restricted consumer choice, the commission said. It used yesterday's decision to spell out the principles to be applied when considering the future
behaviour of any company with such a large market share.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation," Mr Monti said.
Legal experts said the ruling could open the floodgates to multi-million-dollar lawsuits against
Microsoft by rivals hurt by the software giant's anti-competitive practices.

Thomas Vinje, of the law firm Clifford Chance, said: "I would not be at all surprised if there were now private actions across Europe, including the UK."

Microsoft had argued in its defence against the ruling that the bundling of Windows benefited consumers. The commission has now given the company 90 days to offer a version of Windows to PC manufacturers without the inclusion of its Media Player.

Michael Reynolds, of the law firm Allen and Overy, which lodged the first complaint against  Microsoft on behalf of Sun Microsystems in December 1998, said: "This is an important and precedent-setting decision."

AFTER slapping a fine of Euro 497 million ($611 million)  fine on Microsoft Corporation, a top official of the European Commission said on Thursday that if required, it will defend its decision in court.

TD
"We are convinced that we have a case. We hope  Microsoft will take the right steps (and stop crushing rivals)... However, if the company challenges our decision in the court, we will defend our stand," the  European Commission Member, Mr Erkki Liikanen, told reporters here.

The European Commission had announced on Wednesday that it had slapped a  fine of Euro 497 million on Microsoft for violating  competition laws and indulging in illegal behaviour by leveraging its near monopoly in the markets for operating systems.

Microsoft had said that it would challenge the decision in the European Union courts at
Luxembourg.

In response to questions on outsourcing to India, Mr Liikanen said the  European Commission was in favour of an open trading system.

MICROSOFT'S competitors see a glimmer of hope in the  European Commission's ruling on Wednesday to change the way that new features are bundled into Windows, but analysts caution that such a fundamental shift may be far off or never happen at all.

The world's largest software maker was told by European Union regulators to pay a $497 million ($A817 million) fine, decouple Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system and provide information on how its server software for networked computers works.

TD
RealNetworks Inc, which makes the digital media software at the heart of the EC's ruling, applauded the EC decision, with deputy general counsel Dave Stewart calling the decision "fundamentally significant because the commission has clearly ruled that  Microsoft's strategy of bundling Windows Media Player into its software is illegal".
Yet the reaction among some of  Microsoft's competitors fell well short of jubilation.

Sun Microsystems, a long-time Microsoft adversary in the market for servers, said it was not sure whether the ruling would help competition or its own ongoing anti-trust case against  Microsoft.

"All of those are things that need to get resolved before we're going to be able to say anything definitive about what we're going to do based upon this momentary decision," Sun vice-president of legal affairs Lee Patch said.

Analysts point out that the US Government's anti-trust case over Netscape ultimately resulted in a settlement allowing  Microsoft to keep the Internet Explorer web browser as part of Windows. Netscape now has a minimal presence in that market.

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, who is leading Microsoft's charge into new markets, said in a conference call that the EC's decision not to settle with Microsoft was a "much riskier course of litigation" for Europe.
"We believe we should have the ability to improve our products," Mr Ballmer said.

When settlement talks broke down last week, legal experts noted that  Microsoft was essentially adopting the same strategy it did with the US Department of Justice, by slugging it out with authorities in courts and waiting for a more favourable political climate to reach a settlement.

In the US capital, lawmakers were quick to come to  Microsoft's defence, saying they would protest the EC's decision.

"I now fear that the US and the EU are heading toward a new trade war -- and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee, said.

If the EC's decision prevails in what is expected to be a lengthy court battle in European courts, that would create a precedent making it difficult for  Microsoft to bundle other features into its operating system software products.

"That's what  Microsoft is really worried about," said Matt Rosoff, analyst at Directions on  Microsoft, an independent research firm based in Kirkland, Washington.

Indeed, the breakdown in settlement talks between Mr Ballmer and EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti last week hinged on whether  Microsoft would agree on general rules over software bundling for future disputes. "That's why Monti was pressing so hard for a general rule," said Mr Rosoff. "They were almost ready to reach a settlement until this issue came up."

At stake in future disputes could be any of the markets where  Microsoft is hoping to make inroads, ranging from database and mobile phone software to speech software and applications for small and medium-sized businesses.

THE US Justice Department's anti-trust chief said yesterday the huge  fine European regulators imposed on Microsoft was "unfortunate" and other sanctions against the company could had "uninten-ded consequences".

While avoiding direct criticism of the European Commission, assistant Attorney-General Hewitt Pate warned against "protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it".

TD
Mr Pate's statement came after EU regulators ordered  Microsoft to pay a record fine for violating
EU anti-trust law and ordered it to change its business model to stop crushing rivals.

The European sanctions are stronger than those contained in a settlement US anti-trust enforcers at the Justice Department reached with  Microsoft in 2001.

"Sound anti-trust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by `dominant' companies," Mr Pate said. He expressed reservations about the size of the  fine imposed on Microsoft, noting it was the largest  antitrust fine ever imposed.

"For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the most notorious price-fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities," Mr Pate said.

Still, he said, the department would continue to work co-operatively with EU anti-trust enforcers and they still had an "overall strong and positive relationship".

PALO ALTO, Calif. (Dow Jones)--European  antitrust regulators took a comprehensive approach to restraining  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), but the impact of this week's  European Commission decision is not clear, Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) Chief Executive Scott McNealy said.

"We still have to wait and see," McNealy told a small group of journalists on Thursday. "We still don't know what the final deal is. There's still a lot of arguing" that remains.

TD
The EC announced Wednesday that it will  fine Microsoft $613 million and require it to produce a version of Windows without the Media Player software for music and video. The software maker also must release technical information in 120 days to make it easier for competitors to link their servers to Windows desktop computers.

Microsoft has said it will appeal the decision.

The commmission took "a more comprehensive and proactive position to providing choice" in the marketplace than U.S. regulators, McNealy said.
Not one new company has launched a product against  Microsoft as a result of the settlement
Microsoft reached with Department of Justice officials in 2002, he said. "Zero new  competition."
It was a "big swing and a miss," he said.

Asked if Microsoft's release of technical information would help Sun's servers communicate with Windows desktops, McNealy was circumspect. He said it will be difficult to know from just a cursory glance how complete the information is.

Sun played a pivotal role in triggering the European  antitrust investigation by filing a complaint against Microsoft in December 1998.

HD          Microsoft Plots EU Counterstrike Over Antitrust Ruling

BRUSSELS --  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to block a landmark  antitrust ruling against it, is preparing a counterattack that accuses European regulators of unfairly giving away the software company's research and development, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.

The initial battleground will be Europe's second-highest court, where  Microsoft will ask court President Bo Vesterdorf to suspend the European Union ruling that the company must share code and modify its dominant Windows operating system. At the same time,  Microsoft is considering trying to persuade the U.S. government to challenge the ruling at the World Trade Organization -- a long-shot move even if the Bush administration agrees to push for a case.

TD
Lawyers unconnected with the case say the court challenge is likely to be the most important for Microsoft -- and provide the most guidance on how much latitude European regulators enjoy in reining in what they see as market  abuse by multinational companies.

Microsoft has about 70 days to ask Mr. Vesterdorf to suspend the EU's Wednesday ruling, which concluded that the software titan was abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips. Regulators also  fined Microsoft the equivalent of about $613 million.

The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said  Microsoft needs to share its innovations and give rivals a better shot at the market.  Microsoft argues it should be allowed to develop its innovative products without being penalized for success.

HD        Hedge manager isn't ready to short yet: Too early to have large short position in U.S. stocks

The time is still not quite right to have a large short position in North American stocks, says Peter
Puccetti, chief investment officer at Goodwood Inc.., a long-short hedge fund manager.
"There is still too much fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, which is keeping the economies growing
and the bulk of companies continue to deliver ever-stronger earnings, he says. "There is no sign yet that
these earnings are topping out."

TD
His cautious approach to shorting stocks could change rapidly, he says, if these circumstance were altered. "We have a long list of names, including some technology stocks, that are ripe for shorting, based on valuations," says Toronto-based Puccetti, who founded Goodwood in October, 1996. Since then the funds he manages are up around 22% a year (net of fees), which is more than double the performance of the S&P/TSX composite index over that period. Last year, his fund was up 30.5% (net of fees), which was also better than the total return of the composite.

Goodwood's discipline is bottom up, value driven. "High valuations on their own do not precipitate a short signal for us," says Puccetti, as markets can trade at excess valuations for quite a while. Witness the technology boom. But clearly they do point to short opportunities.
On the long side, Puccetti is highlighting as a pick:

- Laidlaw International Inc. (LI/NYSE). It recently closed at US$13.85 and has a 52-week range o f US$15.30 to US$13.35. "This is an under-followed, out-of-favour stock suffering from the taint of the company's past bankruptcy and we have a big holding in it." This stock constitutes 8.3% of the total equity of the fund. This Naperville, Ill.-based company provides passenger services, including school busing and intercity and municipal transit services in Canada and the United States, ambulance services, and hospital emergency management services. Its operations include Greyhound bus services. The bulk of its business is in the United States.

The company emerged from two years of bankruptcy protection early last summer and the stock was recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It had previously traded over the counter in the United States. It also trades on the TSX under the ticker BUS. It recently closed in Toronto at $18.38 ($20.48 -
$10).

Puccetti notes that the company had filed for bankruptcy protection in June of 2001. It had been an aggressive acquisitor of companies and had built up a lot of debt on its balance sheet and was having trouble servicing this.

"It has restructured and emerged from bankruptcy with a stronger balance sheet," he says. Under new management, Laidlaw has been trimming costs and improving its efficiency in all its businesses.

Page 41 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Its ability to generate good free cash flow, thanks, in part, to an improving climate for some of its services, will, he says, allow the company to pay down its high-cost debt, which will greatly improve its profitability.

Also, he says, the new management team's compensation is structured so that it has a strong incentive to improve Laidlaw International's share price and will move to "unlock value in the various businesses." His call is that Laidlaw could be a US$20 stock. Goodwood bought the stock over the counter around US$12.70. On the first day of trading on the NYSE, it opened at US$15.
A big-cap U.S stock that has recently fallen from grace, but which the Goodwood team of Puccetti and
Rob Kittel, partner and senior analyst, see as a trading opportunity is:

- Microsoft Corp. (MSFT/NASDAQ) US$24.41 (US$30 - US$23.60). This stock currently represents 4% of the portfolio. The stock of this software giant has come under pressure because the  European          Commission imposed a huge fine on Microsoft for alleged abuse of its Windows monopoly. The European Union also required Microsoft to remedy this by offering computer manufacturers a version
of Windows without its built-in audiovisual software and to share proprietary information with rival server makers. The company is appealing the ruling. "The stock market is focusing on this event and giving Microsoft little credit for its strong balance sheet with huge cash and investments, representing some US$6.17 a share, and its ability to generate strong cash flow," says Puccetti.

The company currently has a modest dividend yield of 0.66% and could greatly enhance the attractiveness of its shares by boosting its dividend.
Goodwood, he says, has a main competitive advantage in analyzing smaller, under-followed
companies, but "in the case of  Microsoft and other very large cap companies, it sometimes pays to buy
on the bad news and wait." Puccetti believes  Microsoft could bounce 20% or more with an improved
dividend policy and the EU concerns minimized.
A Canadian company that the Goodwood team believes does have a competitive advantage is:

- Kingsway Financial Services Inc. (KFS/TSX) $14.88 ($19.60 - $11.75). This stock is Goodwood's biggest single holding at 10% of the total equity in the fund. Kingsway, a North American property and casualty insurer, was one of Puccetti's picks in this column on Oct. 23, when it traded at $13.05. This manager started buying stock in Kingsway in the spring of 2003 and continued to boost his holding, with an average cost of around $15 a share.

The firm had disappointed the Street by taking additional charges against earnings for business it had written in previous years. The Street "remains skeptical," but Puccetti thinks the worst is over.

In perspective, he says, since Kingsway went public in 1995, the company has increased its book value per share at an annual rate of approximately 27% -- a much faster pace than most Canadian companies. And this has been achieved despite recent difficulties, including the negative impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.

Also, he adds, "few predicted that the Ontario auto insurance business would have the problems that it did, which indicates that this was an industry problem, not a Kingsway-specific problem."
Consensus estimates call for Kingsway to generate earnings per share of $2 for 2004, whereas
Goodwood is looking for it to do better than that. "It could earn $3 a share."

- Another stock Goodwood bought when it was out of favour -- and which has since risen sharply, to the point where this hedge fund manager has been taking some profits -- is Dundee Bancorp Inc. (DBCa/TSX) $26.66 ($28 - $12.40). Based in Toronto, this company provides wealth management and financial services, mainly through its listed subsidiary, Dundee Wealth Management Inc. (DW/TSX)
$8.90 ($9.35 - $4.70), which both manages assets and has a national group of professional investment advisors. "This stock was a classic situation we look for -- it was under appreciated and very cheap."

Goodwood bought the stock some two years ago at an average cost of about $14 a share. At that average price, he says, the Street was putting a negative $2 per share value on Dundee Bancorp.'s stake in Dundee Wealth Management.

"CI Fund Management Inc.'s purchase of Assante Corp. with its large group of financial planners alerted investors to the value attached to Dundee Wealth Management's franchise, says Puccetti. "Also, the wealth management arm is doing better with more assets under management and improved stock markets and the stock took off." It currently represents 4.3% of the portfolio.

Tough remedies for  Microsoft

Microsoft received the business equivalent of a 'sound spanking' on Wednesday for what the
European Commission judged as "abuse" of its Windows monopoly in Europe.

TD
After five years of investigations, Mr Monti said the European Union decision to order  Microsoft to share technical information with rivals and offer a version of the Windows operating system without its Media Player program was taken "neither easily nor happily".
But rather than smoothing the path for other such cases against  Microsoft worldwide, the record
$612m fine and extensive remedies required of the group, incurred the wrath of the US Department of
Justice.

Despite acknowledging a strong and positive relationship with the EU, Hewitt Pate, head of  antitrust at the DoJ, said: "Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition, even by
'dominant' companies."

Microsoft itself was also none too happy about the ruling and said the Commission ruling would worsen transatlantic relations, infringe international trade law and violate its intellectual property.

Microsoft is seeking an appeal against the decision and an immediate stay of most of the Commission's measures. The fate of the ruling now rests in the hands of the European Court of First Instance and if things go  Microsoft's way the legal extravaganza could run on for yet another five years.
HP embraces Linux

Just as Mario Monti, europe's competition commissioner, reached a climax in his investigation based on the core assumption of Microsoft's monopoly share of the PC operating system market, along comes Hewlett-Packard and sets the cat among the pigeons.

The world's largest personal computer maker plans a global roll-out of PCs that run on the Linux open operating system - and HP's decision is thought to have the potential to alter the balance of power in the desktop operating system market.

Although Linux is the fastest growing operating system for corporate computers, until now it has had little success penetrating the desktop market, dominated by Windows.

Linux is used in less than 3 per cent of the 160m PCs sold worldwide annually. However researchers predict this could rise to 7-10 per cent of the overall market by the end of the decade.

But HPs new Linux PCs will not be setting the world alight in the immediate future. Initially designed for use by call centres and help-desk staff who don't require access to sophisticated PC software packages, the systems will mainly provide access to email and internet based applications.

HP hopes that the Linux range of products will help to pare down some of the costs associated with building products in the tightly squeezed PC market.

BT shakes up pricing

BT shook up the UK telecoms market this week as it lowered and simplified its fixed-line call tariffs, but upped standard-rate line rental charges, increasing the burden on rival operators which use its network.

The former monopoly announced it was cutting call charges for its standard rate and some of its "BT Together" packages, in a surprise move that could shave GBP25 off average BT bills.

BT's standard rate tariff plan will be phased out and customers moved to BT's Together Option 1, where daytime calls will fall from 7.9p to 3p a minute.

However, under the changes standard rate customers will see their line rental charges climb by GBP1 a month

This furrowed brows at BT's rivals and telecoms regulator Ofcom as it raises the amount customers must pay for services provided by other operators using BT's network.

Tele2, the up and coming pan-European operator, described the move as "anti-competitive and anti-consumer" and said it would report it to Ofcom.
With the latest tariff cuts, BT is responding to the challenge of the new operators, most notably
Carphone Warehouse's talktalk service, which are slashing the price of calls in a bid to win customers.

It is hoping to retain customers attracted to rival operators ahead of changes introduced in a few weeks which will allow BT's competitors to deliver one bill to users.

The separate BT rental charge has long been seen as one of the main disincentives for customers wishing to switch operators.

Meanwhile, Carphone Warehouse, which has been aiming its aggressive marketing at BT customers, reacted to the news by introducing a radical new scheme whereby calls made between TalkTalk customers will cost nothing.

This week also saw BT responding to the pressure of market forces, when it raised the charge for calls to its directory inquiries service from 25p to 40p, the third operator to do so since the deregulation of the market in August.

BT has lost its pre-deregulation pole position to The Number, which has benefited from its high-profile marketing campaign involving 1970s style runners.

However, most directories businesses are suffering from plunging demand as customers learn to work around a service that used to be free.

According to industry estimates, calls to directory inquiries have fallen as much as 40 per cent since last year's changes.
Infineon loses chief executive
Ulrich Schumacher, one of Germany's most prominent business leaders, resigned as chief executive of
Infineon, the chip manufacturer he has headed since it was spun out of Siemens five years ago.

Mr Schumacher was considered a rising star while at Siemens, but threats of relocating Infineon - a member of the blue-chip Dax index in Germany - have caused a great deal of controversy, and restructuring measures during difficult market conditions proved unpopular with the unions.

Although there was no official reason given for Mr Schumacher's departure, IG Metall, the trade union that has seats on the company's supervisory board, said he had clashed with fellow board members over his management style at a meeting to discuss strategy on Thursday.

Mr Schumacher's contract was not due to expire until 2007, and he will be replaced on a temporary basis by Max Dietrich Kley, chairman of Infineon's supervisory board.

US protests over the European Union's  antitrust action against  Microsoft have mounted, with politicians attacking the record Euros 497m (Pounds 330m)  fine and the ruling that the software group change its business practices.

At least 40 US congressmen and senators have criticised the  European Commission's decision. John Ensign, a Republican senator, said: "The Commission's ruling, if allowed to stand, will cost us thousands of jobs here in the US." The US Department of Justice has regretted the "divergence" from its own antitrust settlement with  Microsoft.

TD
An EU official said Robert Zoellick, US trade envoy, raised the issue of  Microsoft's intellectual property rights at a meeting with the Commission last month. Mr Zoellick asked Pascal Lamy, trade commissioner, to ensure the decision would not violate  Microsoft's rights under World Trade Organisation rules.  Microsoft alleges that the Commission's action violates WTO rules on intellectual property.

Mario Monti, the EU  competition commissioner, has sought to avert a dispute with the US and has been in contact with Hewitt Pate, the Department of Justice's  antitrust chief.

He reduced the scope of his calls for  Microsoft to share interface code with rivals and to offer Windows without its Media Player program. But he rejected a settlement offer by  Microsoft last week, saying it would not have constrained the company's future conduct.
According to a recent version of the Commission decision, the company will have to make its Euros
497m payment to account no. 001-3953713-69 at Fortis Bank, Rue Montagne du Parc 3, 1000,
Brussels. However, Microsoft will appeal against the decision. The  Microsoft verdict, Page 25 FT

The European Commission delivers its own rule book in an effort to transform the way the software giant conducts its worldwide business, write Daniel Dombey and Tobias Buck. Robert Zoellick, US trade representative, sought assurances about Europe's  antitrust case against Microsoft late last month, it emerged yesterday.

Mr Zoellick asked Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, to ensure any ruling against the software giant would not violate its intellectual property rights under World Trade Organisation rules.

TD
Details of their discussions have to come to light amid widespread criticism by US politicians of the EU's move this week to  fine Microsoft a record Euros 497m (Dollars 602m) and order it to change its business practices.
The Department of Justice has also noted that the action by Mario Monti, Europe's competition
commissioner, marks a "divergence" with the US own  antitrust settlement with Microsoft.
According to a recent version of the Commission decision, the company will have to make its Euros
497m payment to account number 001-3953713-69 at Fortis Bank, Rue Montagne du Parc 3, 1000,
Brussels.

Microsoft will appeal against almost all aspects of the decision and seek a suspension order of the Commission's demands. The legal fights over the 300-page ruling could shape  Microsoft's future. And, although the text is not yet public, a recent version has been seen by the Financial Times.
The document spells out in greater detail than was announced by the Commission this week, what
Brussels' arguments are and what  Microsoft has to do.

It cites interested parties - such as Time Warner, Lotus, Novell, RealNetworks and Sun Microsystems, the original complainant against  Microsoft.

The heart of the Commission's case has always been that, by leveraging its Windows virtual monopoly into other markets,  Microsoft damages prospects for innovation in the information technology sector.

It wants the company to share information to allow other companies' server systems to work better with Windows-driven PCs and has demanded that  Microsoft offer computer manufacturers in Europe a version of Windows without its Media Player program.

Microsoft says the interface information for servers is its intellectual property and that Media Player is an integral part of Windows. The text seen by the FT orders  Microsoft to license not only the protocols demanded by Sun in its 1998 complaint, but also those in "future generations of  Microsoft's products".

It says Microsoft has to be "reasonable" in allowing "potential beneficiaries" to evaluate whether to use its code ahead of their agreeing to do so, and forbids it to charge a price that reflects its market power.

Page 48 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission also details its call for the company to offer a version of Windows without Media Player
- a demand the US Department of Justice strongly disagrees with.

"Microsoft must not hinder the performance of rival media players through selective, inadequate, or untimely disclosure of Windows (interface codes)," it said.
In amove that could diminish the effectiveness of its remedies, the Commission has not ordered
Microsoft to charge less for the version of Windows without Media Player.

Microsoft is forbidden from giving Media Player "favourable treatment on Windows, for instance by providing on users' PCs for a Media Player download link while such a link is not provided for competitors' products". It adds that the decision "does not order  Microsoft to remove all media files in Windows but only the ones which constitute Media Player". The Commission says this would not affect features such as the "narrator function for the visually impaired" - something  Microsoft argued would be impossible on the stripped-down operating system.
The Commission says there should be a "monitoring trustee" with access to the Windows source code. "The competitive landscape will liven up (in the server market) . . . such competitive pressures can thus
be expected to have a positive impact on  Microsoft's own incentives to innovate."
It adds: "Through tying Media Player with Windows,  Microsoft ensures that Media Player is as
ubiquitous on personal computers worldwide as Windows is. No other distribution mechanism . . . attains
this universal distribution." And yet, it says, "the media player market is in fact a strategic gateway to a
range of related markets on some of which high revenues can be earned".

The war of words over the record euros 500m  fine imposed on Microsoft by the European                commission intensified yesterday as senior American politicians raised the spectre of a transatlantic trade war.
Bill Frist, the US Senate majority leader, attacked the move by EU  competition commissioner Mario
Monti to change the way  Microsoft does business as "preposterous".

TD
"I now fear that the US and the EU are heading towards a new trade war - and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," said the Republican senator.

US legislators are particularly incensed at the commission's demand that  Microsoft give its rivals access to the computer code that underlies its Windows operating system, found in 90% of all PCs. They view the decision as an infringement of the American company's intellectual property.

The company's rivals have consistently complained that they were unable to compete effectively in the software market for servers which connect PCs to a central network because of  Microsoft's
dominance on the desktop.

Leading the charge has been Sun Microsystems. Following Wednesday's record  fine there was speculation that Sun would launch a separate legal attack on  Microsoft for compensation.

Yesterday, however, Sun's legal advisers ruled out launching a separate European case because the company already has one running in the US which it believes will lead to substantial damages. Sun filed a case against  Microsoft two years ago in a court in San Jose, California, as a result of the department of justice's investigation into the software group.

* Apple yesterday announced that the worldwide release of a smaller and cheaper version of its highly successful iPod digital music player has been delayed by three months because of stronger than expected demand in the US that has left it short of stock.

The much anticipated gadget is likely to retail at about pounds 100, rather than the pounds 250 charged for the cheapest current player.

The European Commission issued an antitrust ruling against Microsoft yesterday that is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy of bundling new products into its Windows operating system, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.

The ruling imposed a $603 million  fine. It also required  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows.

TD
The impact on the future of the global software industry may well be greater than on the company's immediate business prospects.

The fine is pocket change for  Microsoft, which has more than $50 billion in cash in its corporate coffers. The sanctions, according to industry analysts, are not likely to have any significant
near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays music and videos sent over the Internet.

And Microsoft executives declared that there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.
The New York Times
EU ready to fight
The European Commission will defend its decision to impose 497 million euros  fine on Microsoft
in case the latter challenges the move.

The fine has been imposed after having concluded that  Microsoft has abused its market power and violated competition rules by making operating systems inoperable on group server operating systems and also for media players.

Speaking to newsmen on the eve of Euro India 2004 conclave, European Commissioner for enterprise and information society Erkki Liikanen said, "The commission will defend its decision in case the Microsoft approaches the court."

HD       For Microsoft, ruling  to mean tougher  scrutiny

The European Commission's antitrust ruling against Microsoft is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy. But the impact on the future of the global software industry may well be greater than on the company's immediate business prospects.

The ruling imposed a $603 million  fine on the company. It also required  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.

TD
The fine is pocket change for  Microsoft, which has more than $50 billion in its corporate coffers. The sanctions, according to industry analysts, are not likely to have any significant near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays music and videos sent over the Internet. And Microsoft executives declared that there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.

But the ruling could set profound new ground rules for  Microsoft in Europe, and perhaps in other markets around the world as well.

If upheld on appeal, it would leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts into future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. The  antitrust settlement that the company reached with the Bush administration in 2001, by contrast, merely gives personal computer manufacturers the ability to place rival software on the Windows desktop but does not require that  Microsoft's bundled software features be removed from Windows.

On its own, the European ruling might be seen largely as a nuisance to  Microsoft. Yet it comes as other forces are also weakening  Microsoft's grip on desktop computers.

Beyond the moves to open the Windows desktop to rivals,  Microsoft faces growing competition from Linux, an operating system that is distributed free. Even more important,  Microsoft's dominance is threatened by a shift from the personal computer to technologies like Internet-connected cell phones and Internet-based services offered by Google and similar companies.

The significance of Europe is not the decision itself, but it adds to the other pressures on  Microsoft, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Those pressures may be having some effect. There are signs that  Microsoft has altered its practices since the settlement with the Bush administration and the European ruling could provide a further prod.

Industry analysts say that work on the company's next generation of Windows, expected in 2006 or 2007, emphasizes programming code as building blocks, or modules, that can be removed and snapped into
the larger program.

This approach may be paving the way for the day when  Microsoft shifts away from its bundling approach. Skeptics, however, note that  Microsoft may be adopting this approach simply because it needs to be able to locate and combat security flaws in Windows more easily.

Page 54 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Other analysts say that the  Microsoft division responsible for MSN Web sites and not the Windows division is working to develop a Web search service to compete with Google. Of course, ultimately the new search product could still be folded into Windows.

Critics and competitors contend that the company, having long used the bundling strategy to protect and extend its Windows monopoly into other software products, will not significantly change its approach.

How do you really deter Microsoft from pursuing this bundling strategy when they have bet the company on it? asked Andrew Gavil, an antitrust expert at Howard University law school.

Timothy Bresnahan, a professor at Stanford University who was chief economist for the Justice Department's  antitrust division during the Clinton administration, said,  Microsoft sees a new product and says, 'We were about to invent that, too,' comes up with its version and bundles the software into
Windows. The result, he said, is that the early leader in some promising new technology is bundled out of the market.

Bundling was at the center of the federal  antitrust suit in the United States, filed in 1998 by the Clinton administration.  Microsoft lost the case, but a federal appeals court said the charge that the company engaged in anticompetitive tying should be reconsidered. The Bush administration decided not to revisit the tying claim and settled with  Microsoft in 2001.

For Microsoft, the immovable line in the sand is still its right to add whatever it wants to its dominant product, Windows. We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products in the interests of consumers, Steven Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters. We are protecting the fundamental principle of innovation.

Microsoft executives say that after the bundling issue was taken off the table in the United States, its competitors sought a more sympathetic audience in Europe.

This was the core issue during several years of judicial review in the United States, Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. The irony is that in Europe the claimants were the very same American companies that had their day in court in the United States.

Microsoft's leading competitor in media-playing software is RealNetworks, the early front-runner, whose market share has declined sharply since  Microsoft began bundling Windows Media Player into its operating system.

This would be a step in the right direction, helping to open up the industry further for  competition and innovation, said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. But even Glaser has modest expectations for the immediate impact of the European ruling.

Instead, he pointed to the long-run importance of challenging  Microsoft's bundling strategy. If the Windows operating system is seen as completely mutable something that anything can be put in that doesn't mean there won't be innovation in PC software, but it does tend to inhibit it, Glaser said. Under the ruling from Brussels, the pared-down Windows without the Media Player applies only to European markets and does not have to be sold for less than Windows with the Media Player. If there's no price difference, there will be no impact on PC makers' choices, said David Smith, an analyst at Gartner.

The ruling's demand that  Microsoft share more technical information with competitors in the server market like Sun Microsystems, IBM and others is intended to ensure that  Microsoft does not unfairly extend its monopoly beyond the desktop to the server market. The U.S. settlement also required that Microsoft share some technical information, but the European order requires that more information be shared.

Microsoft contends that the European order amounts to an unwarranted and sweeping grab of its intellectual property rights. It also says the unbundling ruling, if imposed, is an assault on its valuable Windows trademark.

It will be a derivative product that the  European Commission is designing, Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, said. It will cause confusion to consumers, and whatever it is, it's not Windows.

HD      EU hands Microsoft its stiffest challenge  Penalties aim at curbing future abuses

BRUSSELS:

Microsoft was handed its greatest legal defeat to date Wednesday when the  European Commission not only declared the software company an abusive monopolist, as the U.S. government did in 2000, but levied penalties designed to prevent similar abuses in the future.

TD
The ruling, anticipated for more than a week, orders  Microsoft to sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers of personal computers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Toshiba and Fujitsu Siemens. One of those versions must be sold without  Microsoft's audio- and video-playing software, called Media Player. The commission, the executive agency of the European Union, ordered Microsoft to produce the alternate version within 90 days. More than 95 percent of personal computers
in the world are powered by Windows software. The commission ruled that  Microsoft could not use such a dominant product to leverage its position in other markets.

The ruling also orders the company to divulge within 120 days previously proprietary information about the way Windows works, to allow rivals to make software suitable for Windows users. Sun Microsystems, whose complaint in 1998 sparked the commission's investigation, persuaded the European regulator that by holding back vital Windows code from competitors,  Microsoft was using its operating system dominance in the related market for server software that runs networks of PCs.

The commission also fined Microsoft 497.2 million, or $612.8 million. It is establishing a new advisory group to examine Microsoft's compliance.

Microsoft said Wednesday that it would appeal the ruling. Microsoft believes a settlement would have been better for European consumers, Tom Brookes, Microsoft spokesman in Brussels, told The Associated Press. At a press conference Wednesday, the European  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said, I am confident that we have produced here a decision that will stand before any appeal.

Media software like  Microsoft's allows PC users to download, listen to, organize and copy to hand-held players music that has been converted to digital form. Companies like RealNetworks and Apple Computer have tried to make money in this field, but they have complained of being held back by the proliferation of Media Player.

Consumers ought to be able to choose their media player, not  Microsoft, Monti said at the press conference. Media Player is a separate product. There is a separate demand for media players.

The commission is not requiring Microsoft to charge a lower price for a version of Windows sold without Media Player bundled in. Microsoft must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing, the commission statement said. It added that  Microsoft must not give PC makers a discount if they buy Windows with Media Player bundled in. We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace, Monti said.

Monti said he had decided to limit the order to Europe in deference to the  competition authorities of the United States and other countries, adding, We could legally have imposed explicitly a worldwide geographic scope, given the global nature of these markets. We have not done so. By going further than the U.S. Department of Justice in punishing  Microsoft, the European Commission is trying to build an image of being the toughest  antitrust regulator in the world. The sanctions eventually agreed to in Microsoft's settlement of the U.S. case are widely seen as being ineffectual.
According to some commentators, this is one reason why Monti decided to come down hard on
Microsoft.

Ironically, the remedies in the United States case against  Microsoft were so insubstantial that this probably added greater urgency in the European case, said a Washington-based  antitrust lawyer close to the Justice Department, who asked not to be named.

The antitrust problems in the European case emerged later than the issues dealt with in the United States. The Justice Department was investigating accusations that  Microsoft had effectively crushed the Internet browser Netscape by bundling in its own browser, Internet Explorer, into Windows. In the end, it settled with  Microsoft, allowing the company to escape with what many saw as only modest changes to the way it does business. The lawyer said that Justice's demands on  Microsoft were so weak, I wasn't surprised that the same problems continued after the U.S. case with newer technologies.

The part of the European case concerning Media Player is similar to that of Netscape, although the technology emerged later. By being found guilty of unfairly bundling again,  Microsoft has showed itself to be a repeat offender.

HD           Ruling is first shot in a new trade war. BY           Jamie Smyth, Technology Reporter

Mr Paku Khan, a case officer working at the  Competition Authority, found himself at the centre of one of the world's biggest  antitrust rulings this week.

The US lawyer, who joined the authority last year to beef up its investigative unit, spent most of Monday in Brussels outlining the  European Commission's draft ruling on  Microsoft to other European Union member-states

TD
As rapporteur of the European Council's advisory committee on restrictive practices and dominance, Mr Khan framed the questions put to the Commission by member-states on the ruling. He also voted Ireland's acceptance of the decision that could potentially undermine  Microsoft's iron grip on the software industry.

"The vote for the decision was unanimous," says Mr Khan, who acted as rapporteur because of Ireland's position as presidency of the  European Commission. "It is the role of the member-states to stress-test a draft decision, and Ireland had a unique role in this."

Microsoft, which is a major employer in the Republic, held regular briefings with the TÃ¡naiste and Taoiseach's officials in the lead-up to the Commission decision. But the Government denies the firm lobbied it to vote against the Commission's ruling. This ruling found that  Microsoft broke EU competition law by leveraging its near-monopoly position in the market for operating systems - the interface through which consumers interact with computers.

The Commission fined the software firm â¬497 million and proposed remedies in an attempt to level the playing field for rivals.

The remedies will force  Microsoft to reveal the interface codes that enable different types of software to talk to one another within 120 days to rivals such as Sun Microsystems. This should enable rival software makers' products to work better in conjunction with  Microsoft's server and operating system, Windows.

Microsoft will also have to provide computer manufacturers with stripped down versions of its dominant Windows software, which do not have its audio-visual product Media Player.

This should help firms such as Real Networks, which will be able to negotiate with computer manufacturers to have their own audio-visual software embedded into the Windows Systems. It could also set a precedent for the future by enabling the Commission to prevent  Microsoft from "tying" software releases into its ubiquitous Windows software.

Gartner, the global technology consultancy, issued a note to its clients yesterday claiming the decision would have little impact on  Microsoft customers. But it also highlighted that  Microsoft must now weather the uncertainty and threat of legal action if it bundles other functionality, such as telephony or antivirus software protection, into its popular Windows operating system.




Page 59 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr Joe Macri, Microsoft Ireland general manager, says he is "disappointed" by the ruling but it will not have any material impact on the firm's Irish-based operations. "What we have learnt from the past is that business as usual is the best approach," he says.

Despite Microsoft's attempt to play down the implications of the ruling, company insiders freely admit that the bad PR created by lengthy legal battles and the drain on management time will hurt the firm in the long term.
Therefore, it is no surprise that  Microsoft's rivals warmly welcomed the Commission ruling.

Real Networks general counsel Mr Dave Stewart described the decision as "fundamentally significant" as the Commission had ruled that  Microsoft's strategy of bundling Media Player into its software was illegal.

Mr Lee Patch, vice-president of legal affairs at Sun Microsystems - the firm which made the original complaint against  Microsoft to the Commission in 1998 - told The Irish Times the firm was very satisfied with the ruling.

But he warned that  Microsoft would attempt to delay the Commission decision as long as possible in an attempt to maintain its dominance in the market.

"I don't believe the culture of the firm has changed," said Mr Patch, who has spent most of the past decade fighting  Microsoft through the US court system.

Indeed, many experts remain cautious about the long-term implications of the Commission's decision for Microsoft because of the uncertainty that its imminent legal appeal will create.

"It is likely  Microsoft will request enforcement of the decision to be suspended pending an appeal," says Mr Philip Nolan, solicitor at Mason Hayes Curran. "It is also likely that the European Court of First Instance will take a pragmatic view and grant this application."

This type of appeal could take years to decide and, by that stage, software will have evolved in such a way that it could render parts of the judgment obsolete, according to Mr Nolan, a specialist in technology legislation.

The legal process is often particularly ill-suited to determine issues in the fast-moving world of technology. A good example of this is provided by the US Department of Justice's investigation of Microsoft's practice of "tying" Internet Explorer into Windows. By the time the investigation was eventually concluded, Netscape -  Microsoft's chief rival in the browser market, had been aggressively pushed out of the sector.
But Dr Gorecki, a director of the  Competition Authority who has worked on the Commission's
Microsoft case for three years, says the decision was carefully put together and well written.
It will also set a powerful precedent for "network industries" and technology in the field of  competition
law, he added.
Unsurprisingly, the ruling by the European  Competition Commissioner, Mr Mario Monti, against
Microsoft provoked criticism from across the Atlantic.

Senate Majority Leader Mr Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee, described the requirement that Microsoft change the way it designs and sells Windows as "preposterous". "I now fear that the US and the EU are heading toward a new trade war - and that the Commission's ruling against  Microsoft is the first shot."
Clearly, the Commission's ruling is just the first shot in what could become a very long battle.

HD          Mixed record when defending decisions before the EC courts. BY          Damian Collins

Under the leadership of Commissioner Mario Monti, the  Competition Directorate-General of the European Commission has had a mixed record in defending its decisions when they are challenged before the European courts. If a generalisation can be made, it might be that the Commission has a tendency to lose in high profile cases, but has a fairly good record of getting its more routine competition law decisions through the appeal process.

TD
Under Article 230 of the  European Commission treaty, a firm that is the subject of an adverse decision by the Commission can appeal to the Court of First Instance and seek a review of the legality of that decision. As far as the Commission's  competition law decisions are concerned, this appeal procedure means that the Court of First Instance can review decisions on the  abuse of dominant position, on cartels, on merger control and on State aid issues. Judgments of the Court of First Instance can be appealed to the Court of Justice. Both courts are located in Luxembourg.

For Commissioner Monti, his worst run of defeats at the hands of the Luxembourg judges came in the period June to October 2002 when the Court of First Instance struck down three important Commission merger control decisions, two of which were adopted on his watch.

In June 2002, the court heavily criticised the Commission's legal and economic reasoning in its decision to prohibit a merger between UK package tour operators Airtours and First Choice and annulled the Commission's decision.
Airtours (now called MyTravel) has subsequently filed proceedings against the Commission in the
Court of First Instance seeking compensation for the loss it suffered as a result of the derailment of the
proposed transaction. Although the amount claimed by MyTravel is confidential, some commentators
have suggested that it is seeking more than â¬ 500 million in compensation.

The Airtours judgment was bad, but for Commissioner Monti worse was to follow. In October 2002, the court reversed two more Commission merger prohibition decisions: the first in respect of a merger between French companies, Schneider and LeGrand, and the second in relation to a merger in the packaging sector between Tetra Laval and Sidel.

Although Commissioner Monti survived this run of defeats, it was followed by a thoroughgoing reorganisation of his  Competition Directorate-General which involved the transfer or departure of a number of high profile officials. The Commission's merger control rules were also substantially revised.

The next major reversal in a  competition case occurred in September 2003 when the Court of First Instance delivered its judgment on the Commission's TACA decision concerning a transatlantic liner conference.

In that decision (taken in September 1998 by Mr Monti's predecessor Commissioner Karel van Miert), the Commission had found TACA members guilty of the  abuse of a collective dominant position. Record fines totalling â¬273 million were imposed on the firms involved.

The court subsequently annulled these  fines, partly due to lack of evidence and to infringement of the firms' defence rights.

Page 62 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Since TACA, the Commission's record in the court has been reasonably positive. Its controversial rulings on the pricing policies of dominant firms were upheld in Michelin (September 2003) and British Airways (December 2003).

It has also succeeded in defending its decisions in a number of less prominent cartel and State aid cases.

There are, however, currently before the court a number of high profile cases, all of which involve decisions adopted since Commissioner Monti took over, which might disrupt this positive trend.

The addition of the  Microsoft case to this list will ensure that the Commission's lawyers will be busy for some time to come.

HD          Microsoft Plots EU Counterstrike --- Intellectual Property  Claim Is Seen as Firm's Best Bet; WTO Appeal a Long Shot

BRUSSELS --  Microsoft Corp., seeking to block a landmark  antitrust ruling against it, is preparing a counterattack that accuses European regulators of unfairly giving away the software company's research and development.

The initial battleground will be Europe's second-highest court, where  Microsoft will ask court President Bo Vesterdorf to suspend the European Union ruling that the company must share code and modify its dominant Windows operating system. At the same time,  Microsoft is considering trying to persuade
the U.S. government to challenge the ruling at the World Trade Organization -- a long-shot move even if the Bush administration agrees to push for a case.

TD
Lawyers unconnected with the case say the court challenge is likely to be the most important for Microsoft -- and provide the most guidance on how much latitude European regulators enjoy in reining in what they see as market  abuse by multinational companies.

"We view an appeal to the Court of First Instance as an important opportunity for further clarification of the commission's ability to compel dominant companies to license their intellectual-property rights,"
said Fiona Carlin, a partner at law firm Baker &McKenzie and chairwoman of the American Chamber of
Commerce's competition-policy committee here.

Microsoft has about 70 days to ask Mr. Vesterdorf to suspend the EU's Wednesday ruling, which concluded that the software titan was abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips. Regulators also  fined Microsoft the equivalent of about $613 million.

The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said  Microsoft needs to share its innovations and give rivals a better shot at the market.  Microsoft argues it should be allowed to develop its innovative products without being penalized for success. The EU's measures are "the broadest compulsory license of intellectual property since the European community was founded," said Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith.

Microsoft also plans to "raise these issues with the U.S. government" and explore the possibility of bringing "a case at the WTO," Mr. Smith added.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick in recent months raised the  Microsoft issue "on a number of occasions" with EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, according to Mr. Zoellick's spokesman, Richard Mills. "He stressed the importance of the case and its sensitivity," Mr. Mills said. U.S. trade officials declined to go into further details about Mr. Zoellick's message to his European counterpart. Other U.S. officials expressed doubt that the U.S. would pursue a trade case with Europe over the Microsoft dispute.

Some lawyers said the U.S. trade representative would be reluctant to bring a case. First, doing so might set a legal precedent counter to Washington's broader interests. "I think that there will be a reluctance to see the WTO quash legally binding decisions of a sovereign  antitrust body," said Michael Grenfell,  antitrust partner at the Norton Rose law firm in London. To bring a case at the WTO, the U.S.

Page 64 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would have to argue the company's intellectual-property rights were being threatened. Most of the 23 cases the WTO has heard on this issue are limited to areas such as patent protection.

Microsoft and its lawyers say their most potent grounds for appeal are European and international rules protecting firms' intellectual property.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti says his order -- which gives  Microsoft 90 days to offer a version of Windows stripped of its Media Player software for playing video and audio clips -- will level the playing field for media-software makers and give personal-computer makers more incentives to install products made by  Microsoft rivals. But  Microsoft says removing Media Player from Windows robs consumers of valuable functions such as voice prompts, which help blind and novice users of Windows.

Microsoft, arguing that it alone should control Windows and its derivatives, says regulators are overstepping copyright law by telling the company how to redesign and market its products.

HD         Microsoft might be stuck with EC sanctions ; History  shows other U.S. companies hit, too

SEATTLE -- If history is a guide,  Microsoft better get ready to swallow sanctions imposed this week by the European Commission.

The EC ordered  Microsoft to pay a $613 million  fine and alter the way it sells two key products -- media players and midsize computer servers -- as a remedy for abusing its Windows computing operating system monopoly.

TD
The software giant argues that Europe's sanctions extend unreasonably beyond restrictions already imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which ruled in 1999 that  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly.

"It is very unfortunate that the European Commission paid so little regard for all of the considered judgment of the U.S. government," says Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel.  Microsoft allies agree.

Painting European  antitrust regulators as protectionist, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., raised the specter of a trade war ignited by Microsoft's censure. "As if destroying Europe's economy were not enough, the European Commission has taken aim at  Microsoft, a company whose products and technology have been engines of global growth," he said in a statement. R. Hewitt Pate, assistant attorney general for  antitrust, warns that Europe's action could stifle innovation and  competition.

Much the same outcry erupted in July 2001 after the EC moved to block the U.S.-approved proposed merger of General Electric and Honeywell. U.S. senators and Justice officials accused Europe of protectionism and predicted a chilling effect on trans-Atlantic relations. Paul O'Neill, U.S. Treasury secretary then, labeled the ruling "off the wall." President Bush personally intervened.

GE ultimately called the merger off. Europe prevailed by relying on basic legal principles. "As a company, you are required to obey the law in all the jurisdictions where you do business," says Peter Morici, University of Maryland business professor and author of a book on global  antitrust laws.

In fact, since the EC's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, took office in 1999, Europe has issued scores of antitrust actions and made them stick against companies from the Americas, Asia and even its own backyard.

In 2000, for instance, the commission blocked the proposed merger of Swedish carmaker Volvo and rival truckmaker Scania. In 2001, it slapped Swiss drugmaker Hoffmann-La Roche and seven other companies with more than $752 million in  fines for maintaining a cartel to fix vitamin prices. And in
2002, it  fined Japanese video game maker Nintendo $147 million for colluding with European distributors to fix prices.

"This is not Europe going to war against America," says London- based tech industry analyst James Governor of research firm RedMonk. "It's an attempt to create structural remedies that will, in fact, enable competitive innovation on an ongoing basis."

Rumblings of a trade war between the US and Europe echoed through the halls of power in Washington DC last night as politicians rallied to condemn the  European Commission for the clobbering it gave  Microsoft in a swingeing antitrust judgement yesterday.

The EC found the world's largest software company, fiefdom of Bill Gates, the world's richest man, guilty of abusing its dominant market position.

TD
It is a judgment  Microsoft has also suffered on its home ground but this time the penalties are huge and painful.

The EC has levied its heaviest-ever  fine - â¬497 million ($A850 million) - and, worse, imposed restrictions on the Windows operating system designed to stop  Microsoft from swamping its competitors in the burgeoning multibillion-dollar online entertainment market.

Protests erupted in the US capital within minutes of the judgement, led by Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist who, with other politicians, complained that the sanctions violated US-EU trade agreements and should be resisted by President Bush.

"I fear that the US and the EU are heading towards a new trade war and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," Mr Frist said.

"If the US Government does not make a clear and strong objection to the EU actions, we will lose influence and credibility for years to come, to the detriment of the US economy and US consumers," he said.

Hewitt Pate, chief of the US Department of Justice's  antitrust office, described the huge  fine levied on Microsoft as "unfortunate". He said the European requirement that a version of Windows be marketed without Windows Media Player was a "chilling innovation".

But Douglas Melamed, chief of the DoJ's  antitrust division in the Clinton administration, said the EU's order made perfect sense.

"The commission did nothing that strikes me as outrageous or foolish," he said. The  fine was appropriate; a good deterrent that "enables you to focus yourself on deterring wrongful conduct rather than trying to regulate it after you find it."
While Windows is by far the dominant operating system in Europe, as in the rest of the world,
Microsoft's image, fair or not, is that of a bullying American monopoly.

The fine, although double most expectations, is essentially peanuts for a company with $US53 billion ($A71 billion) in the bank. More damaging is the ruling by European  competition commissioner Mario Monti, now ratified by the full 15-nation EU, that  Microsoft lay bare for rival companies some of the most important programming code in its Windows operating system.

The company says it will appeal in Europe's highest courts. The case could drag on for years while
Microsoft builds an unassailable position in online entertainment, as it did with its web browser.

Appeals are thought unlikely to succeed and, depending on the speed with which they are handled, Microsoft will have to start selling in Europe, a third of its global market, a version of Windows without WMP.
Real Networks, whose media player competes with WMP, and Sun Microsystems, long a  Microsoft
foe, both believe Europe's move would lead to lower prices and more variety for consumers.

Brussels, 25/03/2004 (Agence Europe) - The  European Commission decision to sanction  Microsoft has provoked much reaction. The US Justice Department has sharply criticised this decision which it describes as "unfortunate". Mr Hewitt Pate, in charge of competition at the ministry, stated that "sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant companies'". According to Pate, imposing a record fine in such a controversial and ambiguous area is a sensitive issue and "for this  fine to surpass even the fines levied against members of the most notorious price fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message" with regard to the Commission's priorities on application of the rules. Pate believes that the amicable agreement between  Microsoft and the US authorities was the safest alternative to destabilising the market as it provides clear and effective protection for  competition and consumers.

TD
The US Department of Justice considers, however, that this affair is not going to handicap the effective cooperation in EU/US relations and that it was important to highlight the overall strong and positive relationship between the US and EC on matters of cooperation policy. Several employers' associations have also criticised the  European Commission. They say that the decision of the latter will put innovation in peril. According to the Cato Institute, a Washington body, which is pro-free market, the "real costs" of
the decision will be "fewer jobs, less innovation, inferior quality products and higher prices". Citizens Against government Waste underlines that the "goal is to ensure international market stability.  Microsoft had already reached a fair settlement with the US courts which the  European Commission should have followed". Commentaries from the Association for Competitive Technology (CAGW), which helps SMEs in the technology sector declared that the Commission proposals will have a major impact on consumers and the technology sector and that the real winners would be the multibillionaire rivals of  Microsoft, like RealNetworks and Sun Micrososystem. It said that the worst effect would be that it sets a precedent that would make it more difficult for world leaders in the market to add new functions to their dominant
products. The CAGW also explained that it would now be more difficult to develop software for distance teaching applications for developing new products because it would not be able to depend on the certainty that the Media Player software was well integrated into Windows. It forecast that the disappearance of this safety net would produce higher costs for itself and consumers.

The Co-president of the Greens-EFA group at the European Parliament Daniel Cohn-Bendit "welcomed a measure that goes in the right direction" but asked what its real impact on the market would be in Europe. Cohn-Bendit thought that the obligation on  Microsoft to allow its competitors the necessary interfaces for providing interoperable products such as substitutes to Media Player was not sufficient without a guarantee of free and non-discriminatory licences on all patents or copyrights involved in the practical realisation of this inter-operability. He added that if in order to use this interface it was necessary to use a patent the competitor would be stuck. He pointed out that this would mean effectively going back to the practice of describing the nut while being in possession of a patent on the bolt and that the Greens were opposed to a software patent. British Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne said that he was delighted that the European Commission had adopted a hard and courageous stance on  Microsoft, whose abuse of market dominance made life difficult, indeed, impossible for many small competitors.

HD      Microsoft concedes  misstep  in search technology

REDMOND, Wash. (AP) - When  Microsoft Corp. entered the Internet browser war in the 1990s, Netscape Navigator was the early leader and  Microsoft's Internet Explorer the late-blooming upstart.
Now, Microsoft is gearing up for a similar battle in search technology.

TD
Chief executive Steve Ballmer conceded Thursday that one big misstep by  Microsoft over the past few years is that the company did not put resources toward in-house research and development of search technology.
"That's probably the thing I feel worst about over the last few years -- not making our own R&D
investment," Ballmer said at a conference for online advertisers held at  Microsoft's Redmond campus.

Instead, he said, the company had relied on outside sources for that technology. Joking that the pervasive software giant is often stereotyped as "doing it all," he said: "This is a case where we didn't do it all -- and
I wish we had."

But Microsoft is now turning its considerable might toward catching up. It's a move that puts  Microsoft head to head with Google, the world's most popular Web surfing vehicle, and Yahoo, the Internet's most popular destination, in what many see as an important, growing and lucrative market.
"I think you'll see some good  competition in this area," Ballmer said.

Ballmer mentioned the European Union's ruling against  Microsoft only in passing, when asked about rumors the company may be making some big acquisitions. He said he hadn't heard that; he'd been too busy paying attention to rumors coming out of Europe.

The European Commission slapped Microsoft with a $613 million  fine Wednesday for abusively wielding its near monopoly in desktop operating systems and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the company's antitrust settlement with the United States. The company has vowed to appeal.

About 114.5 million Americans, or 39 percent of the population, now use search engines, according to Nielsen NetRatings. Also, businesses spent an estimated $2 billion last year on search-related advertising and some analysts expect the market to triple during the next three years.

Microsoft -- which will spend nearly $7 billion this year on overall research and development -- hopes to have some of its own search technology development done in the next 12 months, Ballmer said. It will take longer to develop search technology focused on advertising, he told the advertising executives.

The software titan also has said that better search technology will be a big part of the next version of its dominant Windows operating system, which may not be released for a couple years or more.

At the conference,  Microsoft also unveiled a study on the effectiveness of online advertising. The company is using the study as the basis for an argument that companies spending about 1 percent of


Page 73 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
their advertising budget online should consider increasing that to 4 percent or 5 percent because people are spending more time online.

Ballmer said Microsoft spends about 12 percent of its media budget on online advertising, and that he orders his staff to "saturate" that market first and foremost.

"I want to make sure (a user) can't get through ... an online experience without hitting a  Microsoft ad," he said.

HD         It's an open and shut case, we can't let Gates unhinge  a competitive PC market. BY         By Phillip Whitehead MEP.

LP
As more and more of us become computer literate we all come to hear of Bill Gates, the American squillionaire who has shut us all away behind his Windows at  Microsoft.

We groan. We moan. We long for our tiny user-friendly Apple Macs of yesteryear. But Gates goes on opening and shutting as he chooses.

TD
Or at least he did until the  European Commission took a hand. On Wednesday it confirmed a Â£330 million fine on Gates for his aggressive monopolism.

Non-PC readers can best understand our exasperation with Gates from the following tart exchange, which is now on the Internet.
GATES recently mocked the sluggish technology of the automobile industry.

If it had developed at the pace of the computer industry, he said, we would all be driving 25,000 cars that achieved 1,000 miles to the gallon. It provoked discontented Windows users to click their reply buttons. What would a car designed by  Microsoft be like? Well, it would crash twice a day. Every time they replaced the signs and lines on the freeway you would have to buy a new car. If you did that you would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would be the same.

When your car lost power for no reason you would have to stop, close all the windows, shut down and wait until you had permission to restart. In an emergency the airbag would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.

Of course you could always turn to the market and buy an alternative model, the Macintosh. You would like its style, but it would only be permitted to run on five per cent of the roads. Every time you wanted to take it out a warning light would go on that read: "This car is performing an illegal operation." Am I joking? No, I am not. The European Commission has just performed one of the most valuable acts of its chequered existence by challenging Microsoft's ruthless domination of the PC world.

What has happened is this. Bill Gates's  Microsoft is a titanic force in the market, worth 260 billion. A fifth of that is in cash, and that increases at a rapid rate per hour. So it is not struggling to get by. It is market dominant. What it has been doing, for many years now, is systematically crushing any software competitor by 'bundling' its own versions in with its Windows operating system.

Time after time a  Microsoft package has appeared, sometimes as a free add-on for Windows, which undercut other alternatives, and drove them out of the market.

The European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, has now used the EU's critical mass to levy a fine of Â£330 million on Microsoft for its refusal to give other software producers a proper interface with Windows. Its method was to bundle its own operating system Windows Media Player with its desktop package, cutting out rival servers.  Microsoft's battery of sleek lawyers will have years to work the case through the courts.
They will argue that this threatens the company's future and its expensive software research.

Page 75 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The competition, Netscape, Apple, RealNetworks, argues that you ought to be able to use them on any PC journey, not on five per cent of them. Monti's decision is to force  Microsoft to offer a version of its products to the consumer without Media Player, so that other systems can use a common interface. This will punish Microsoft much more than a penalty  fine, which will be peanuts to it.

Predictably, the company is squealing foul. The usual home state senators and well-paid lobbyists are flooding into town. The Bush administration is yet again being told to get tough with these uppity Europeans. "This ruling is another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," growls Senator Patty Murray of Washington state.

Patty conveniently forgets that the US Justice Department also took anti-trust action against  Microsoft in 2001, until a deal was brokered. Monti has taken action against the American giants in the past over their activities in Europe - notably to block a merger between General Electric and Honeywell that might well have snuffed out Rolls Royce in the aircraft leasing market. But he has been equally tough with European firms like Tetra Pak and Hoffman-Laroche.

The consumer has everything to gain from  competition, much less from cartels and carve-ups. This week has been a good week for the Monti principle that anyone who develops new software has a right to compete in the market. It will embolden others to take action against the monopolists of the workstation.

WE are receiving complaints that the printers we all have to use with our PCs have embedded chips which prevent re-use of ink cartridges, or the substitution of cheaper alternatives.

Within two years of shifting the car manufacturer's grip on spare parts for their models the whole problem is recurring with computers.

Other constituents complain that their machines are deliberately sold without the necessary back-up disks if their hard drive malfunctions.

Me, I'm relatively new to all this. But I can't help noticing that the linked system we installed four years ago needs replacement, that servicing it is prohibitively expensive, and shopping around difficult.

So I hope that when Bill Gates next switches on his PC it will give him the message: "This system has been performing a restrictive act." And I don't want him to respond: "Are you sure?" on mine.

HD          Throwing Money out the Windows

As politicians, business leaders and consumers ponder the larger meaning of the EU's harsh  antitrust action against  Microsoft, including a record-high fine of 497 million euros, one question remains unanswered: What will the European Commission do with all that money?

Knowing that Brussels bureaucrats often need help figuring out ways to spend such large sums, I offer the following list of suggestions (and, thanks to a recent commission ruling on forced licensing of comedic intellectual property, I can freely adapt an innovation of talk show host David "dominant position" Letterman: the Top Ten List):

TD
10. Buy five million new, MediaPlayer-free copies of Windows for Commission computers. There would still be enough money left over for the nominal bandwidth charges related to downloading (free) versions of MediaPlayer.

9. Build half of a new Berlaymont. Remodeling the Commission's headquarters building in Brussels after an asbestos scare closed it down nearly a decade ago will end up costing taxpayers more than 1 billion euros. With 10 new nations joining the bloc in May, it might be worth using the  Microsoft loot to add a spiffy new east wing.

8. Pay some old legal bills. Two big European companies, Schneider Electric and MyTravel, are currently suing the Commission for pain and suffering they endured as a result of Mario Monti's efforts to block their separate attempts to merge with other firms. The European Court of Justice overturned the Commission's decisions in those cases and allowed the mergers to go forward. To quote a competition lawyer I know but can't identify, "This money can make their little problem go bye-bye."

7. Subsidize more farmers. It's only a drop in the milk bucket, but still, 497 million euro percent is about, well, 1% of the EU's annual budget for the Common Agricultural Policy. When you're trying to grow sugar beets in arctic climates, every little bit helps.

6. Help preserve France's key role in the EU. The European Parliament is forced to spend nearly 200 million euros per year to shuttle back and forth between its seats in Brussels and Strasbourg. This could help extend this noble tradition by . . . almost three years!

5. Ferraris for commission staff. The  fine would pay for a new Ferrari Modena ($180,000 MSRP) for each of the 600 officials working in the Commission's  Competition directorate. There'd be enough left over to buy 5,000 Smart cars. But don't think of it as the latest example of commission excess -- it's economic stimulus for central Italy.

4. Build new houses for members of the Commission. Bill Gates' ultra-modern lakefront home cost $50 million, so these would only be half as fancy as his. But it's a start. And there's still another  Microsoft investigation waiting in the wings.
3. Two words: EU Spacelab.

2. Finance a film project. Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson is available. Give him half the money to make a blockbuster trilogy on The Lisbon Process. Give the other half to Eurostat -- and watch it disappear!
Page 77 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
1. Boost innovation. The EU could finance development of a new computer operating system that seamlessly ties together various software programs in a dynamic, easy-to-use format. Oh, wait . . .

EU TAKES ON  MICROSOFT The European Commission slapped American software giant  Microsoft with an anti-trust ruling aimed at forcing the company to stop bundling new products into its Windows operating systems. The EC imposed an E497.2 million ($817.8 million)  fine. It required  Microsoft offer
a version of Windows without its Media Player, and divulge technical information. The New York Times said the fine was "pocket change" for the company. But the ruling could "leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder" scrutinising what it includes in Windows. Ten US congressmen protested to the EC, saying the US Government's own anti-trust settlement with the company already addressed the issues.

SUHARTO HOLDS GRAFT RECORD Former President Suharto of Indonesia had beaten a strong field to come in at the top of the all-time corruption league table, anti-graft group Transparency International said this week. Releasing its latest Global Corruption Report, the organisation said Suharto's alleged haul of up to $US35 billion ($47 billion) in 31 years of rule to 1998 showed how  abuse of power "undermines the hopes ... of developing countries". Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, and Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko, who both allegedly looted more than $US5 billion, were next on the list.

BUSINESS FOLLOWS BLAIR INTO LIBYA The Anglo-Dutch energy giant Shell signed a deal with Libya to re-enter the country's oil and gas industry. The BBC reported the agreement involved a strategic partnership with Libya's national oil company. According to Shell the deal envisaged the company participating in exploration and production and developing liquefied natural gas facilities. It
was struck as British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a historic visit to the North African country for talks with leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The Guardian described Shell as "leading a charge" by British business into Libya. UK company BAE Systems had begun "secret talks about multi-billion dollar deals with Libya more than five years ago", and was negotiating to supply commercial aircraft and build airports.

PARMALAT ON SLOW BOIL AN Italian judge refused a request by prosecutors of the Parmalat scandal for a fast-track trial of 29 executives and three companies accused of financial crimes. Judge Guido Piffer ruled investigators in Milan had not provided enough evidence to justify the request. Piffer said there was sufficient evidence only against eight of the accused, including Parmalat founder Calisto
Tanzi.

HD      COMPETITION: RECORD FINE AND SWEEPING REMEDIES FOR MICROSOFT WC    1,584 words

LP
The European Commission has slapped US software giant  Microsoft with a record-breaking  fine of Euro 497.2 million for breach of EU anti-trust rules. It has also instructed the company to take extensive corrective measures that could have a wide-ranging impact on its future business practices, in particular the next release of its Windows operating system, codenamed "Longhorn", that is currently in development.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti announced the ruling against  Microsoft on March
24, saying that he hoped it would curb similar anti-competitive abuses by dominant players in the software market in the future.
Biggest-ever  fine.

TD
The fine of Euro 497.2 million against  Microsoft is the largest ever imposed by the European Commission on a single company. Previously, the record was for the imposition of a fine of Euro 461 million on Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in November 2001.

Under EU anti-trust rules, the Commission can impose a  fine of to 10% of a company's annual world-wide turnover, although the actual amount levied tends to be far lower. In  Microsoft's case, Euro 497.2 million corresponds to just 1.62% of its world-wide turnover, or 8% of turnover in the Europe, Middle East and Africa area. In deciding how much to  fine a company, the Commission considers the severity of the infringement, how long it has been going, and the impact of the abuses on the economy and competitors.

Commissioner Monti stresses that the main benefit of the ruling was not to seek financial compensation from Microsoft, but to introduce changes that would improve the IT sector's competitiveness and to offer clarity on the EU's rules on  abuse of dominant market position.
The remedies.

The Commission has demanded  Microsoft to take corrective action in two key areas.  Microsoft will have to comply with these demands within the next three months, unless the Court of First Instance grants a suspension of the sanctions pending an appeal, which looks a definite possibility (see below).

- Media Player. Within 90 days,  Microsoft must be able to provide PC manufacturers a version of Windows without its proprietary audiovisual software, Media Player, tied in. Effectively, this means that, in Europe at least,  Microsoft will ship two versions of Windows - one with Media Player and one without, allowing manufacturers the choice of which version to install depending on consumer needs.  Microsoft must offer both versions at the same price, and cannot give PC manufacturers any discount or other incentives for buying Windows and Media Player together.

- Interoperability.  Microsoft will also be required, within 120 days, to disclose "complete and accurate" interface documentation for its Windows operating system. This is to allow rival vendors to develop products that are able to compete on a level playing field, especially in the development of server software that interfaces with Windows. Each time  Microsoft brings out a new version of the relevant products, it will have to simultaneously update the disclosed information.
The appeal.



Page 81 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft says that it will almost certainly lodge an appeal against the Commission's Decision, once it has a chance to study the 300-page ruling in detail. Under EU rules,  Microsoft has 60 days to appeal, and can apply to the Court of First Instance for part or all of the sanctions imposed to be lifted.

Brad Smith, acting for Microsoft's defence, told journalists at a news conference that he is confident the ruling against Microsoft will be overturned on appeal. "The  European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word", he said. The lawyer added that he expected to see something similar happen in Europe as happen in the United States. In the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) bought a successful conviction against  Microsoft, under which a break-up of the company was ordered. But, on appeal, this verdict was overturned and a settlement reached between the DoJ and Microsoft without the need for further legal action. Mr Smith believes that it is all a case of the need for greater clarity, which he hopes the EU Courts in Luxembourg will be able to provide.

In terms of suspension of remedies, Mr Smith believes that there is "a very good probability" that the Court will agree to postpone the obligation for  Microsoft to publish interface details, as this is something that, once published, cannot easily be reversed should an appeal be successful.

Microsoft reaction.

Microsoft has expressed huge disappointment with the Commission ruling and believes that it will ultimately harm consumer interests, which Mr Monti's department is sworn to protect, alongside fair competition.

In particular,  Microsoft stress that removing Media Player from Windows will break a number of components in Windows and other  Microsoft applications, as well as in third party software. "There are huge consumer benefits in integrated technology", says  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

To illustrate the point, Mr Smith noted that some standard  Microsoft applications make use of Media Player in supporting visually-impaired users, and this functionality will no longer work if Media Player is stripped out. Mr Smith is frustrated that the Commission was made aware of these problems, but chose to ignore them.

Mr Smith also highlights a number of Internet sites that will need to be updated in order to support a Windows that no longer carries Media Player, including the website of the Italian Government and that of the company BSkyB.
Competitor reactions.

By and large, competitors are happy that the Commission has ruled against  Microsoft, and believe that Mr Monti is on fairly solid legal ground with the Decision. But Ed Black, the President of the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which represents many of  Microsoft's competitors, expressed disappointment that the Commission's ruling didn't go further. "The important thing is that the decision sends a signal to  Microsoft and other dominant companies, but there are many more abuses that the company is still carrying on", he said.

Thomas Vinje, acting on behalf of the CCIA, commented: "This case will provide a very useful precedent for addressing that much wider range of anti-competitive conduct by  Microsoft in the future."

The Commission is currently looking at a separate complaint against  Microsoft, lodged by the CCIA, which contains some elements that are similar to the probe that has just been included. In particular, the CCIA complaint insists that  Microsoft should, in the interests of interoperability, be forced to disclose details of its proprietary file formats for applications such as Word and Excel. In terms of bundling, the CCIA complains that a number of additional applications are bundled into Windows XP, including Internet Explorer and Microsoft Outlook, which squeeze out  competition. But, despite these similar elements, the Commission is reserving judgement on the case before it. Mr Monti said that each issue would need
to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

In welcoming the Commission ruling,  Microsoft competitor RealNetworks said that it reaffirmed the validity of the  Microsoft case in the US. "Building on the Commissionâs factual findings establishing Microsoftâs illegal conduct, we intend to vigorously pursue our case in the US to obtain injunctive relief sufficient to stop all of  Microsoftâs illegal conduct as well as to secure compensation for the harm Microsoft has done to our business", said Vice-President Bob Kimball.
A US backlash?

In asking Microsoft to unbundle Media Player and publish interface details for Windows, European anti-trust regulators have gone far beyond what US prosecutors ultimately agreed to accept from the company. This has provoked much speculation about a "US backlash", and prompted memories of the

Page 82 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
2001 EU decision to block the merger of General Electrics and Honeywell, after US authorities had approved it. This even led to US President George Bush voicing his concern at the way in which the EU regulates American companies.

Lawyers who have been involved in the European side of the  Microsoft case believe that the key difference between EU and US law lies in what the two jurisdictions believe will be good for consumers. Europe, said one lawyer, looks more at the impact of a case on competitors, believing that if competitors are squeezed out of the market this will harm consumers. The US, on the other hand, looks at other factors, such as the impact that untying Media Player might have on the end user.  Microsoft insists that stripping out Media Player will break a number of features in Windows, and therefore make its operating system less usable.

The Assistant Attorney-General for Anti-trust in the US Department of Justice, Hewitt Pate, believes that the remedies imposed by the EU have gone too far. In respect of the unbundling of Media Player, Mr Pate said: "The best anti-trust remedies eliminate impediments to the healthy functioning of competitive
markets without hindering successful competitors or imposing burdens on third parties, which may result from the EC's remedy". Mr Pate also raised concerns over the excessive level of  fine that Microsoft has now been asked to pay: "For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the most notorious price-fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities." Mr Pate is a little less critical when considering the "interoperability" requirements that the Commission has imposed, saying that the EU and US approaches in this area are very similar.

HD       Three still in running for top IMF job. BY        By RAPHAEL MINDER

Europe's finance ministers will next week try to pick a candidate to head the International Monetary Fund from a probable shortlist of three.

Rodrigo Rato, Spain's outgoing conservative finance minister who was previously viewed as the clear frontrunner, is still in the race in spite of the change of government in Madrid. But his chances may have been affected by the appointment on Thursday of a fellow Spaniard to the vacancy on the board of the European Central Bank. Some of Europe's smaller states are annoyed that the top jobs are dominated by candidates from the big countries.

TD
Jean Lemierre, the French head of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, is also making a strong showing, according to EU finance officials.

But a third contender could also enter the field in the final week, after Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, said that he would propose an Italian candidate. Appearing to dismiss Mr Rato's chances, Mr Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels yesterday: "The candidate was only proposed by us after Spain's candidate was sidelined."

The summit of EU leaders and finance ministers in Brussels which ended yesterday has thrown up even more uncertainty about Europe's nomination.

In Washington, the executive directors of the developing countries on the IMF board, known as the G11 group, are considering proposing several candidates from different regions.

The G11 directors, supported by the representatives of Russia, Australia and Switzerland, have already issued a statement calling for the selection of Horst Kohler's replacement to be an open and transparent process in which the best candidate is picked regardless of nationality.

By convention, Europe chooses the head of the IMF while the US appoints the president of the World Bank. US Treasury officials have made no public comment other than to say the US will support the most qualified candidate. It is thought that the US is happy to wait and see who Europe proposes, and that both Mr Rato and Mr Lemierre are seen as acceptable candidates.

Mr Berlusconi refused to disclose his candidate's identity, but speculation has focused on the highly regarded Mario Draghi, 56, a former director general of the Italian treasury, who worked from 1984 to
1990 at the World Bank.

Mario Monti, the Italian who runs the  European Commission's competition department, has also been tipped. Mr Monti, a former economics professor, may be unpalatable to the US, especially after his controversial decision this week to impose a record  antitrust fine of Euros 497m (Dollars 603m, Pounds
334m) on Microsoft.

European finance ministers gave an undertaking on Thursday there would be no linkage between their choice for the ECB and the IMF job.

HD       For Microsoft, ruling  to mean tougher  scrutiny

The European Commission's antitrust ruling against Microsoft is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy. But the impact on the future of the global software industry may well be greater than on the company's immediate business prospects.

The ruling imposed a $603 million  fine on the company. It also required  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.

TD
The fine is pocket change for  Microsoft, which has more than $50 billion in its corporate coffers. The sanctions, according to industry analysts, are not likely to have any significant near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays music and videos sent over the Internet. And Microsoft executives declared that there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.

But the ruling could set profound new ground rules for  Microsoft in Europe, and perhaps in other markets around the world as well.

If upheld on appeal, it would leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts into future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. The  antitrust settlement that the company reached with the Bush administration in 2001, by contrast, merely gives personal computer manufacturers the ability to place rival software on the Windows desktop but does not require that  Microsoft's bundled software features be removed from Windows.

On its own, the European ruling might be seen largely as a nuisance to  Microsoft. Yet it comes as other forces are also weakening  Microsoft's grip on desktop computers.

Beyond the moves to open the Windows desktop to rivals,  Microsoft faces growing competition from Linux, an operating system that is distributed free. Even more important,  Microsoft's dominance is threatened by a shift from the personal computer to technologies like Internet-connected cell phones and Internet-based services offered by Google and similar companies.

The significance of Europe is not the decision itself, but it adds to the other pressures on  Microsoft, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Those pressures may be having some effect. There are signs that  Microsoft has altered its practices since the settlement with the Bush administration and the European ruling could provide a further prod.

Industry analysts say that work on the company's next generation of Windows, expected in 2006 or 2007, emphasizes programming code as building blocks, or modules, that can be removed and snapped into
the larger program.

This approach may be paving the way for the day when  Microsoft shifts away from its bundling approach. Skeptics, however, note that  Microsoft may be adopting this approach simply because it needs to be able to locate and combat security flaws in Windows more easily.

Page 86 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Other analysts say that the  Microsoft division responsible for MSN Web sites and not the Windows division is working to develop a Web search service to compete with Google. Of course, ultimately the new search product could still be folded into Windows.

Critics and competitors contend that the company, having long used the bundling strategy to protect and extend its Windows monopoly into other software products, will not significantly change its approach.

How do you really deter Microsoft from pursuing this bundling strategy when they have bet the company on it? asked Andrew Gavil, an antitrust expert at Howard University law school.

Timothy Bresnahan, a professor at Stanford University who was chief economist for the Justice Department's  antitrust division during the Clinton administration, said,  Microsoft sees a new product and says, 'We were about to invent that, too,' comes up with its version and bundles the software into
Windows. The result, he said, is that the early leader in some promising new technology is bundled out of the market.

Bundling was at the center of the federal  antitrust suit in the United States, filed in 1998 by the Clinton administration.  Microsoft lost the case, but a federal appeals court said the charge that the company engaged in anticompetitive tying should be reconsidered. The Bush administration decided not to revisit the tying claim and settled with  Microsoft in 2001.

For Microsoft, the immovable line in the sand is still its right to add whatever it wants to its dominant product, Windows. We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products in the interests of consumers, Steven Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters. We are protecting the fundamental principle of innovation.

Microsoft executives say that after the bundling issue was taken off the table in the United States, its competitors sought a more sympathetic audience in Europe.

This was the core issue during several years of judicial review in the United States, Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. The irony is that in Europe the claimants were the very same American companies that had their day in court in the United States.

Microsoft's leading competitor in media-playing software is RealNetworks, the early front-runner, whose market share has declined sharply since  Microsoft began bundling Windows Media Player into its operating system.

This would be a step in the right direction, helping to open up the industry further for  competition and innovation, said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. But even Glaser has modest expectations for the immediate impact of the European ruling.

Instead, he pointed to the long-run importance of challenging  Microsoft's bundling strategy. If the Windows operating system is seen as completely mutable something that anything can be put in that doesn't mean there won't be innovation in PC software, but it does tend to inhibit it, Glaser said. Under the ruling from Brussels, the pared-down Windows without the Media Player applies only to European markets and does not have to be sold for less than Windows with the Media Player. If there's no price difference, there will be no impact on PC makers' choices, said David Smith, an analyst at Gartner.

The ruling's demand that  Microsoft share more technical information with competitors in the server market like Sun Microsystems, IBM and others is intended to ensure that  Microsoft does not unfairly extend its monopoly beyond the desktop to the server market. The U.S. settlement also required that Microsoft share some technical information, but the European order requires that more information be shared.

Microsoft contends that the European order amounts to an unwarranted and sweeping grab of its intellectual property rights. It also says the unbundling ruling, if imposed, is an assault on its valuable Windows trademark.

It will be a derivative product that the  European Commission is designing, Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, said. It will cause confusion to consumers, and whatever it is, it's not Windows.

ANNOUNCER: From New York City, America's financial capital, this is IN THE MONEY.
SUSAN LISOVICZ, GUEST HOST: Welcome to IN THE MONEY.

TD
I'm Susan Lisovicz. Jack and Andy are off today.

Coming up today's program, sting like a bee in the fight against terrorism. Nature could have a better battle plan. We will look at a tactic that starts with thinking fast and loose.

Plus smooth operators. We might say sleazy, too. Find out how some doctors and patients are feeding the high cost of health care.

And hot water. Dasani was supposed to be Coke's big new brand in Europe. What went wrong and what does it mean for the stock?
Joining me today, "LOU DOBBS TONIGHT'S" Christine Romans, and money.com managing editor, Allen
Wastler.
Great to see both of you.
CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi Susan.

LISOVICZ: For two days Washington virtually came to a standstill. The ultimate insiders, names like Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright and a man named, new author, Richard Clarke. Everything stood still as they detailed what the government knew, what it did not know prior to 9/11.
More heat than light?

ROMANS: I was glued to this. Sometimes it sounded like a big massive free book promotional tour. Other times it sounded like it was rewriting history or trying to rewrite history. I kind was interested. But people think it's just political grandstanding.

ALLAN WASTLER, MONEY.COM, MANAGING EDITOR: Which is what I thought. I thought it was a circus for the sake of having a circus. I mean, yes.
LISOVICZ: You have to have hearings.

WASTLER: Yes, we want to find out what went wrong, but it got into you Democrats did, and you Republicans did this. LISOVICZ: Meanwhile the families are there holding pictures of their loved ones. I'd have to say a stellar moment is when Richard Clarke was the only one who apologized.

ROMANS: He said we failed you. Our country failed you. I failed you. That was a moving moment. You are right about the families of the September 11th victims, you have to wonder how they feel when you start to sense politics might be creeping in to all of the discussions, trying to figure out what went wrong. Making sure it does not happen again. But again, as in everything that happens in front of television cameras, and in an election year...

WASTLER: Clarke's entire -- we're sorry and everything. I think it's just -- he is trying to sell a book. So, of course he wants to come across as sympathetic. I thought, nah.

Page 89 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LISOVICZ: More to come. Condoleezza Rice, that chapter has not closed yet.
ROMANS: You are right.

LISOVICZ: We have been hearing a lot about going after terror suspects, everybody from the top al Qaeda guys to the founder of Hamas. Overwhelming fire power and a top down hierarchy might not be the answer to stopping a terrorist group. For that it might be time for a new tactic. Bees do it and than maybe he can, too. It's called swarming. For more about that we are joined from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) California by John Arquilla. He's an associate professor at the naval post graduate school in Monterey and a consultant at Rand. Welcome.
JOHN ARQUILLA, SENIOR CONSULTANT, RAND: Good to be with you.

LISOVICZ: I guess your theory is that since these al Qaeda for instance is not just a bunch of criminals in Afghanistan, they are world-wide, quite literally that we need to go after these cells one by one and then destroy them one by one?
Is that what you mean by swarming?
ARQUILLA: Well, al Qaeda is distributed in about 60 different countries around the world in small units.
And when they decide to attack they come together from different parts of the world and arrive at the same
place and same time and either take over planes or plant bombs on trains in Spain. And if we are going to
defeat them we will not do it with area bombing or conquering countries, we are going to do it by building
our own swarming forces that can come together quickly on those occasions when we can get intelligence
about them. And this we have done in few places around the world.

ROMANS: So they swarm us. Now it's our turn to switch our intelligence and combat mechanism to swarm them back, right?

ARQUILLA: Yes, the old saying was it's the -- the best defense is a good offense. And I think now the best way to defeat a swarm is with one of your own. And we are getting a little bit better at this. It means good intelligence, cooperation, and it means understanding that we are less about destruction now and much more about disruption. We are like antibodies, if you will, if you want to use a metaphor from biology. The antibody will converge from all parts of your body on the intruder in you're system. That's how we have to behave against terror now.

WASTLER: Professor, I'm sort of hip to the idea from attacking from multiple different points, and what not, but I'm worried.

Doesn't this kind of theory, and if you put it into practice, won't it lead to more friendly-fire incidents or intelligence agencies working cross-purposes?
Isn't there more room for messing up of it, frankly?

ARQUILLA: The hall mark of a swarm is that it is synchronized but without central leadership just as the antibodies in our bodies or the swarms of bees that go after some objective. And you are quite right, that there are operational risks that attend it. On the other hand swarms can move with much smaller numbers. The costs and risks are far lower for example than sending in a quarter of a million man field army into a country looking for terrorists or weapons of mass destruction that are not there. Either approach you use has its own risk. And I would argue swarming entails far fewer risks than the older approach we've taken to try to deal with terror.

LISOVICZ: Now, professor, I'm sure you watched the 9/11 Commission hearings this week. As the testimony made abundantly clear, the intelligence community in the U.S. has not played well with each other, never mind plenty of worldwide operations. Isn't this biting off a little bit more than we can chew?

I'm sure everyone wants to destroy al Qaeda, but executing it, isn't that close to impossible what your proposing?

ARQUILLA: We are talking about a kind of nimbleness that does not come to a classic hierarchy. It requires networking. And I think these 9/11 Commission hearings have suggested that 9/11 was an organizational failure, not a failure of intelligence. There was a lot of information in the system, but it wasn't properly used. As my colleague from Rand, David Ronfeldt, and I have said for years it takes a network to fight a network. Now, we have to think about the war on terror in these terms. We have to break down the barriers between what's civil and what's military, what is federal and local and what's foreign and domestic. I think, in many cases, our European and other allies around the world understand this better than we. War against terror has no leader, but we are all part of the same network working for the same goal.


Page 90 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ROMANS: From what you have seen, is there a switch in momentum in Washington and among intelligence communities to start addressing terrorism this way?

Is there much, you know, agreement in Washington that a swarm mentality is what we need to take as well?

ARQUILLA: I think there's a lot of traction for the swarming idea, particularly in the military, our special forces use this explicitly as their doctrine now. I think in the intelligence realm there is indeed a great appreciation of the need for better networking. We are swimming upstream, however. In the past few years we created a new hierarchy, the Department of Homeland Security, which has no intelligence assets of its own and must rely on the kindness of other spies for the information it might get. But I have been speaking with a few members of the 9/11 Commission, and I think, this is something we will see if their final reports
or recommendations for waging this war on terror in a more efficient way in the years to come.
LISOVICZ: All right. John Arquilla, we'll leave it at that. Professor of defense analyst at the Naval Post
Graduate School, also a senior consultant at Rand, thanks for you very much for your, insight.
ARQUILLA: My pleasure.

LISOVICZ: Up next on IN THE MONEY, operating costs. Find out why the feds are out to bust an insurance scam where the doctor pays the patient.
And later Coke on ice. The company froze its plan to launch Dasani in Europe. We'll tell if the stock breaking a sweat?
What's French for pay up. With the EU demanding an  antitrust fine from Microsoft, see if the company is writing a check.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

ROMANS: If the Feds are right some medical patients on the west coast have been getting poked, prodded and probed all to make their bank balances healthier. Federal officials this week seized files and computers from three surgery centers in California. Doctors there allegedly paid patents to undergo procedures they didn't need, and than over billed insurance companies for work. The scam is known as rent a patient.
And for a look at how it works, we are joined by Bill Mahon. He's the president of the National Healthcare
Anti-Fraud Association.

Bill, I don't know what is worse being so desperate you got to have somebody cut you open so you can get some money or being the kind of doctor that would do it to overbill medical insurance companies.

BILL MAHON, NATIONAL HEALTH CARE ANTI-FRAUD ASSOCIATION: It's pretty extreme in both cases, Susan. And this is a phenomenon we have seen in the health insurance side for between two and three years now. And it's gotten to a degree of magnitude that for the last year it's been the subject of very intense attention and investigative activity in the private health insurance industries anti-fraud units and in federal law enforcement.

WASTLER: Mr. Mahon, Allen Wastler here what kind of doctor -- I go to my doctor, educated, all the degrees, fine upstanding citizen of the United States, then you hear about stories like this.
Is this your typical doctor or sort of maybe, you know, a sleaze -- sleazier kind of doctor?

MAHON: I wouldn't characterize any one of them but I would say like you, I almost never met a doctor I did not like and respect as a hard-working ethical person dedicated to patients. But in any system this large, this complicated, you are going to have some bad apples. And the suspicion here that been pretty well documented in some respects is that the surgery centers themselves are paying recruiters throughout the country to recruit patients from throughout the country who are willing to let doctors subject them to
invasive tests such as colonoscopies, other procedures, biopsies in you digestive system, even surgeries, sweaty palm surgery is a big ticket item in these schemes, in exchange for cash.

The patient gets typically $800 to $,1200 in cash, the recruiter might get between $1,000 and $2,000 for every patient he sucks into the center. The recruiters coach the patients on what symptoms to describe to the physician when they go in. Based on those phony symptoms that they don't have the physician then goes ahead and performs the given procedure. And I can't say in a given case how conscious the doctor is, how complicit a doctor might be in it, but most of these things happen on Saturday's and Sundays. And you have to question why are all these elective procedures done on weekends.

LISOVICZ: There's so many questions to ask. But I guess as revolting as this scam is, at least it seems to be centered on two area's and does not seem to be nationwide from what I understand. Southern California and Florida, is that right, and why is that?

MAHON: The outpatient surgery center activity that is being looked at is all centered in the Southern California area, in Greater Los Angeles and Orange County. The recruitment activity has drawn patients from almost all 50 states, about 49 states have had people go to California for these bogus procedures.
Why California?

California is sort of tied with south Florida for the title of the health care fraud capital of the country. For many, many years there have been very ambitious health care fraud schemes coming out of Southern California. Some involving cross border treatments in Mexico. You know, bogus unapproved cancer treatments that are disguised as legitimate treatments performed on the U.S. side of the border. Cosmetic surgery schemes have been very big in the Los Angeles area from the mid '90s on. And the bottom of it, this is where these particular operators have decided to set up shop.

ROMANS: I'm wondering if these recruiters are taking advantage of people who might be really poor, who might not speak great English, who might really be looking for a way to get by.

What kind of people are walking into the clinics to have elective surgery they don't need? MAHON: That's what makes the scheme so bad. These are not lawyers or architects or CEOs or other professionals being sucked in. These are wage-earners, low wage earners, non-English speaking people. There's a great deal of patient traffic from the Vietnamese community for example, from the Hispanic-American community. Recent immigrants who have health insurance because you wouldn't expect to be knowledgeable about how it all works, and who are willing to subject themselves to that sort of thing for $800 or $1,200. That's a lot of money to some people.
OK, Bill, thanks so much for joining us. President National Healthcare Anti-Fraud Association. We have to step out for a minute.
But up next, Coke's plans to sell bottled water overseas are all wet. We will talk about whether the drink giant is a good investment now.
And talk about unnecessary surgery. Our fun site of the week lets you improve on the Mona Lisa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Vera Wang is saying I do to more than fashion. Known for modern bridal wear, Wang continues to challenge herself as a designer by adding fragrance, eye wear, China, crystal, and silver flatware giftware to her Multimillion dollar empire.

VERA WANG, DESIGNER: Because design goes by so quickly. And things are old by the time they get to market. You have to be very vigilant about what is going on around you.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wang says her job is tireless because she is fulfilling a life long dream.

WANG: I think one of the most important things in any career is to feel passionate about what you do. And that makes the effort that much easier. And let's face it, it is very much that effort.
(END VIDEO CLIP) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
LISOVICZ: Now for a look at the week's top stories in our "Money Minutes."

The European Commission fined Microsoft about $613 million for  antitrust violations. The commission says the main problem is Microsoft's continued bundling of its media player with its operating system. Microsoft is vowing to fight the fine but fears of a tech trade war are growing.

Another week, another record high for U.S. gas prices. The average cost of a gallon of gas is about $1.73. And the U.S. Energy Department expects prices to spike another dime per gallon in the next two months. Just in time for the peak driving season.

And there's mixed news about Americans and debt. More Americans paid their mortgages and car loans down in the last three months of 2003, but at the same time the American Bankers Association says the number of credit card accounts going past due soared to a new record high.

ROMANS: And Europe is becoming an unfriendly place for Coca-Cola this these days. The soft drink giant pulled it's Dasani brand bottled water from shelves in Britain after questions about its purity. And that's jeopardizing plans to launch Dasani in France, and Germany as well.
This all comes as Coca-Cola searches for a new CEO to replace the departing Doug Daft. Coke is our
stock of the week. A stodgy old company. It doesn't like to give earnings guidances for the quarter because
it really likes to look broadly at how well it's going to be doing. And now a little bit of a stumbling block in
Europe. Some European commentators are calling it Coke's Waterloo.
LISOVICZ: Is that like the new Coke?
Remember what a disaster that was when Coke launched a new formula?

WASTLER: I think that's part of the -- Coke is such a big company and a big part of America, when it makes a misstep everybody wants to leap on it and go ahahaha.

ROMANS: But the water strategy is important for Coke. The water war, as they call it. This is -- you've got Pepsi in it, you've got Nestle in it. A lot of big players are in the water business. And Europeans are big consumers of bottled water. They have been long before U.S. companies were selling bottled water.

LISOVICZ: Another thing, it goes to integrity. Coca-Cola is one of the best known brands in the world, next to say Disney and the Marlboro man. What's more pure -- supposed to be more pure than water?

This is not some mom and pop operation. When you're questioning Coke to get the water clean for safe consumption, that's something that can taint the brand.

WASTLER: It also hurts it because international markets are important to Coke. Seventy percent of their revenue comes from overseas. And the soda pop is sort of flat and they are making all these...
ROMANS: Soda pop is flat. Very good. WASTLER: Cute, huh?
They are going more to health drinks, the big energy drinks...

ROMANS: And the water, the bottled water, is something I think, 50 percent growth rate over the past three years, it accounts for some 8 percent of the bottom line of Coke. We should talk about Coke's CEO as well.
(CROSSTALK)
WASTLER: That would be a bigger problem at this point.
ROMANS: A lot of people are wondering if this will be an insider coming in?

Are they going to find -- led by Warren Buffett, who of course, is on the board and a big share holder. Are they going to find someone from the outside. What's this person going to look like?
Coke is a very big brand. I think the number one recognized brand in the world.

LISOVICZ: Right. If they can't get their succession plans straight, then you wonder about so many other companies.
WASTLER: So, you know, big successor candidate inside is Steve Hire, a former Turner executive. ROMANS: Is that so?
WASLTER: Yes. Used to be are big boss.
LISOVICZ: Right, because CNN started out in Atlanta. Coke started out in Atlanta.

WASLTER: There you go. OK, earlier we talked about the growing surgery for hire scandal. But for our fun site of the week we thought we would show you a place where you can do unnecessary surgery of your own for free -- on one of the most famous masterpieces of our time. Look at Mona there. You just want to botox those lips a little bit?

Yes, you know, get collagen, botox the wrinkles. And you know, she needs to be augmented down there, so a little surgery there.
LISOVICZ: Art majors. Art majors, art lovers around the world are horrified.

Page 93 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ROMANS: I got on this thing, and I've got to tell you it only takes about three or four clicks, and it looks like
Angelina Jolie.
WASLTER: No kidding.
ROMANS: I'm not kidding. Try it yourself. WASLTER: I'll go back and visit again.
LISOVICZ: OK. That's the fun site of the week. As always, fun and very funny, Allan.

WASLTER: We try. LISOVICZ: That's it for this week. Join us next week at 1:00 P.M. on Saturday, 3:00 p.m. on Sunday. Thanks to money.com's managing editor Allen Wastler, fun sites always a high light of the show. And thanks as well, to the hard-working "LOU DOBBS TONIGHT" correspondent and my office roommate Christine Romans.

Up next, Andy Serwer will host our special look at 50 years of the "Fortune 500." You won't miss it. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

Liberal Democrat delegates at the party's spring conference in Southport voted in favour of 16 year olds being allowed to appear in explicit pornography and of doctors being allowed to assist suicides. Mr Charles Kennedy broke into a sweat during his speech to the conference, following his sudden absence
during the budget debate the week before with a stomach disorder. Mr Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, flew to Madrid for a requiem Mass for those killed in the train bombings. He then flew for talks with President Gaddafi of Libya. A Nottingham brain surgeon was suspended while an investigation was ordered into allegations that he had failed to pay for an extra helping of croutons for his soup in the hospital canteen. Shell cut figures for its oil and gas reserves for a second time on discovering that they had been erroneous; its annual general meeting was delayed by two months.

The office of Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, fiddled with planning policies to give
out-of-town shopping centres a better chance of being built. Of children given classes in mathematics
intended to help them make up ground lost at primary school, less than half reached the level expected at
the age of 11 by the end of their first year at secondary school, according to Ofsted. Lifeboatmen had to
rescue 34 people from the Thames when a rowing  competition on the Boat Race course was hit by a
sudden storm. A survey on behalf of the Surrey trading standards department found that 57 per cent of the
county's curry houses were using illegal levels of dye in their chicken tikka masala.

In a helicopter missile attack, Israel killed Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, as he was being brought home in his wheelchair from a mosque in Gaza City early in the morning. Huge crowds of Palestinians protested angrily at the assassination; seven other people were killed in the attack. Mr Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, called the assassination an 'unlawful killing, which we condemn'. 'It is unacceptable, ' he added, 'unjust and very unlikely to achieve its objectives.' In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of shares fell by 1.9 per cent in a day after the assassination; on Wall Street the Dow Jones index fell by 1.2 per cent. President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan was re-elected with a
30,000 majority out of 13 million votes. A day earlier he had been slightly wounded after being shot in the stomach in an assassination attempt; the vice-president was shot in the knee. Thousands of Pakistani soldiers went into action against positions in south Waziristan suspected of sheltering followers of
al-Qa'eda. The Afghan aviation minister, Mr Mirwais Sadiq, was killed by soldiers loyal to a local commander, setting off fighting which left 100 dead. Twenty-eight people died and 3,600 Serbs were made homeless during clashes between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo after the drowning of two
Albanian boys in a river. Spanish police arrested more suspects in connection with the bombing of trains in Madrid, which killed 202, bringing the number held to 14. Mr Leszek Miller, the Prime Minister of Poland, which, together with Spain, blocked agreement last December on a constitution for the European Union, appeared to have come to an arrangement with Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Chancellor of Germany, to let plans be activated again while Ireland retains the presidency of the EU, which it relinquishes at the end of June. The  European Commission fined Microsoft 497 million euros because of the way it was using its Windows monopoly. Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, who was Queen from 1948 to 1980, when she abdicated, died, aged 94. The roving machine on Mars, Opportunity, found sediment with ripple patterns that indicated it had been formed in salt water.

One would be tempted to think the presidential election was seven days away and not seven months, judging from the way politics overshadowed finance this week. Issues ranging from job exportation to the week's televised hearings of the so-called 9/11 Commission became infused with charges, countercharges and a general air of partisanship. Having to compete for attention were such dramatic news as the European Union's  antitrust ruling against Microsoft, the sentencing of a former Dynegy executive to nearly a quarter-century behind bars, and some fairly bizarre developments in the trial of former Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swarz. And the main U.S. stock indexes did little to seize the spotlight for Wall Street. The broad S&P 500 edged lower by less than 2 points, or 0.1 percent, on the week, while the blue-chip Dow industrials inched 0.2 percent higher.

TD
By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite was hyperactive, climbing a full 1 percent this week, even though only two of its five sessions were winners. Stay tuned to CBS MarketWatch this weekend. Our weekly, aired on, looks at the innovators in airport security and their investment prospects. Our online weekend posits that quality-rated large caps look set to outperform small caps and midcaps.

Tim Rostan, assistant managing editor E.U. slams  Microsoft The European Commission hit Microsoft with a record fine Wednesday of 497.2 million euros, or nearly $612 million, and ordered sanctions to thwart the company's "near monopoly," setting the stage for a lengthy and costly legal battle.

Kerry maps incentives to create, keep jobs in U.S. Vowing to create as many as 10 million jobs, and keep them from being shipped overseas, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry is proposing a restructuring of the corporate tax code that he says will encourage companies to invest in the United States.

LP
This week, Europe's  competition czar, Mario Monti, slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a  fine of unprecedented size, along with the toughest set of regulatory demands the company has yet seen.

Europe's determination, in marked contrast to the Bush administration's surrender to the world's most powerful software company three years ago, could mark a watershed in the long, failed battle by anti-trust authorities to curb  Microsoft.

TD
It's the first time in years that consumers have some reason to believe competition might eventually break out in the market for personal-computer applications. Monti has ruled that Microsoft must never again use the practice of bundling computer applications to squash competition, as it did in the case of Internet browsers and, more recently, media players.

But nothing will happen until several more steps are taken. The coming months will see the struggle shift from the European Commission's competition enforcers to the courts and, perhaps more ominously, to the U.S. political arena, where Microsoft enjoys considerable support, and where pressure could be put on Europe with the threat of trade retaliation.

In an indication of the Bush administration's sympathies, even the ostensibly apolitical, pro-competition assistant attorney-general in charge of the U.S. Justice Department's anti-trust division is concerned for Microsoft.
The Justice Department official said that "sound anti-trust policy must avoid chilling innovation and
competition, even by "dominant" companies.

How amusing. Microsoft's assault on  competition and innovation was the basis for the Justice Department's own anti-trust case against the company, a case that petered out when the U.S. government finally settled for empty promises that  Microsoft's behaviour would change.

However, it is instructive to look at how  Microsoft manages to pose as a source of innovation even as most outside analysts find that it is actually a powerful obstacle to innovation and  competition.

Although its Windows operating system began as an inconspicuous layer of software that merely transmitted instructions to the computer from individual add-on applications like word-processing programs or Internet browsers, it is now much more.

Today, Windows includes a number of applications that consumers would once have had to buy and load separately.  Microsoft portrays this as a major benefit to Windows users. Many accept this claim. And if these applications were free and they were the best applications available, this would be true. But neither is the case.

The applications are bundled together with Windows at a price that makes  Microsoft one of the most profitable companies in the world. If the applications are "free," then Windows must be grossly overpriced.

And the bundling practice enables  Microsoft to control what applications consumers will buy, since they must go to considerable work to add an independent firm's application on top of the ones they have already been forced to buy from  Microsoft.

Here's an analogy. If you owned the only grocery store in a town 50 miles away from any  competition, you might decide to start throwing in a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter with every litre of milk. The bread and peanut butter would be free, but the milk would cost $10.

And with no  competition, you might decide to boost profitability by offering only your own brands of bread and peanut butter. Customers would be welcome to buy other brands, but they'd have to drive 50 miles
for them, and they'd still be forced to take your brands if they wanted a convenient source of milk.

If you were like  Microsoft, you might even claim to be a big booster of "innovation" because you added a couple of brands of peanut butter and bread to those already on the market.

This would be one heck of a profitable grocery store, just as  Microsoft is one heck of a profitable technology company.

A comparison yesterday by Bloomberg News found  Microsoft's profit margin was a fabulous 31 cents on every dollar of sales, twice as high as that of SAP, the world's biggest maker of business software, and more than three times as high as that of IBM, the world's biggest computer maker. That gives  Microsoft plenty of money, and plenty of incentive, to fight this battle to the bitter end.

HD       EC ruling  - What's in store for Microsoft? BY       By Pratap Ravindran.

Pune, March 27

THE European Commission's anti-trust ruling which says that  Microsoft violated European Union law by abusing its "near monopoly" market power in the workgroup server and media player markets has a large number of ramifications all of which are not entirely clear at this point of time, partly because only its summary has been released.

TD
What is known for certain now is that the EC requires the software giant to create "complete and accurate documentation" within 120 days which will enable the workgroup servers of other companies to be fully interoperable with Windows and to create a version of the Windows PC operating system which does not include the Media Player and to make this version available to computer makers within 90
days. In addition,  Microsoft will have to pay a fine of approximately $613 million. It is further known that Microsoft can appeal - the company has, in fact, said that it will do so - and that the first round of appeals will go to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. If dissatisfied with the outcome, the company can move the European Court of Justice, Europe's highest court.

What is somewhat less clear is whether the EC ruling has global application - an important issue given the fact that, historically,  Microsoft has had a unified global practice. While the commissions ruling
made no mention of the scope of applicability,  Microsoft has taken the position that the EC's actions will necessarily be confined to the European Union's borders. It is amusing to note that geo-political borders apparently continue to have a role to play in this age of headlong globalisation....instances in which their existence is of benefit to large and powerful corporations.

While the ambiguities that mark the ruling now will, undoubtedly, be ironed out with its release in full and in the course of the appeals process, it bears noting that, a full six years after the US Department of Justice initiated a lawsuit to "put an end to  Microsoft's unlawful campaign to eliminate  competition, deter innovation and restrict consumer choice," there is no discernible change in the company's
hard-charging business practices.

It may be recalled that, in 1998, US federal officials serving the Clinton Administration had filed a sweeping anti-trust suit against  Microsoft the outcome of which, they believed, would change the way in which the American computer industry worked. However, the scope of the lawsuit had been substantially reduced by a federal appeals court and the 2002 settlement and, when the dust had settled, it had been found that the initiative had made no dent whatsoever on the Windows monopoly.

And yet, it is important to note that the fight between  Microsoft and the Government in the country of its domicile is not over quite yet: A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., is looking into whether the
2002 settlement should be tossed out in favour of the considerably stiffer remedies sought by the state of
Massachusetts. And then again, there are other actions which are still pending.

Consumers in Minnesota, in a class action, are seeking damages of $425 million. The case - the first to be brought before a jury - is in the trial stage and the proceedings are expected to go on for another three months or so. In Nebraska, a private  antitrust claim on behalf of Windows 98 users, which had earlier been dismissed, has been revived again recently by the Nebraska Supreme Court. And then there is the Sun Microsystems' suit filed in March 2002, charging  Microsoft with anti-trust, unfair
competition and copyright violations. Sun had initially secured a broad injunction against  Microsoft but,

Page 103 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
subsequently, an appeals court had whittled down the scope of the injunction by ruling that  Microsoft need only stop distributing its own Java Virtual Machine. This case is scheduled to go to trial next year. And then again, in December 2003, RealNetworks had sued  Microsoft for anti-trust violations and had sought damages in excess of $1 billion. A recent  Microsoft request to have the case moved from San Jose, California, to Seattle, has been turned down and the matter is now in the pre-trial discovery phase.
And, finally, there is the 2002 Burst.com case in which the company had accused  Microsoft of
elbow-twisting customers into abandoning their use of the video-streaming technology from Burst.com.
This case is still in the pre-trial discovery and motions phase and a trial date is yet to be set.

The Microsoft Chief Executive, Mr Steve Ballmer, has said the company will fight the EC ruling and has put forward the argument that all companies, including those with a near monopoly, have the right to improve their products. He has been quoted by the media as saying: "There is an important principle at stake in this case: We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers. We recognise the sort of special position our company has, but nonetheless we think we should have that ability to improve our products, subject to the appropriate guidelines."

These fighting words notwithstanding, Mr Balmer has observed that while  Microsoft and the European Union are squared off right now, the company expects an opportunity to settle the case. Obviously, he is falling back on the  Microsoft experience in the US - which may or may not be relevant.

HD       Oracle will try to ease fears over PeopleSoft. BY       BY DANIEL DOMBEY IN BRUSSELS

Oracle will this week seek to rebut the  European Commission's concerns over its $9.4bn hostile bid for software rival PeopleSoft, in an attempt to stop the Brussels body from delivering a fatal blow to the transaction.

The US justice department moved to block the technology deal last month, but its decision will be subject to a court case that is unlikely to be completed before late July.

TD
By contrast, the Commission's ruling is due by May 11 and could be decisive. Oracle has only six weeks to rebut the Commission's objections or meet its concerns.

Mario Monti,  competition commissioner in Brussels, may not relish having to decide on an all-US merger so soon after his decision last week to  fine Microsoft E497m ($601m) and order it to change its business practices. But given the justice department's stance, there is little chance of another divergence with the US.

Oracle will deliver its response to the Commission as early as today and will face its critics at a closed-door hearing on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Commission says the merger would reduce from three to two the number of "key players" that sell finance and human resources software to big companies. Brussels' formal objections to the merger argue not only that it could lead to collusion between Oracle and SAP of Germany, but also that Oracle might be able to squeeze its clients even without collaborating with its rival.

One problem for the Commission is that EU courts have established strict criteria for banning a merger because of possible future collusion between companies. The Commission may also be constrained by current rules, which do not explicitly permit it to ban mergers that could give rise to "non-collusive oligopolies", such as the one Brussels suspects may arise between Oracle and SAP. New regulations to fill this perceived gap have been approved, but will not apply to the current deal.

But Oracle's critics say the certainty of a duopoly in the relevant market is reason enough to block the deal. "The fundamental issue is three companies in this market coming down to two," said a person close to PeopleSoft.

Is the European commission's decision to slap sanctions and a E497m  fine on Microsoft good news or bad news for consumers? The judgment delivered by Mario Monti, the commission's competition czar, states that Microsoft "abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft group servers, and by tying its Windows Media Player, a product where it faced competition, with its ubiquitous Windows operating system".

Microsoft says the requirement that it reveals code from its desktop operating systems that will help the server software of its competitors is akin to ordering a Hollywood film studio to hand its scripts over to rival companies. Sun Microsystems, which led the European campaign against  Microsoft, is
cock-a-hoop at the decision and not at all perturbed at the implication it might have for intellectual property rights.

TD
The bundling issue strikes us as much ado about nothing. Online music and video looks pretty much the same whether it is downloaded on Media Player, Quicktime or Real Networks. The good news is
that the commission does not intend to employ crack troops to undertake house-to-house searches and delete Media Players that exist on current Windows systems. Instead,  Microsoft has been given 90 days to reorganise its business, offering PC manufacturers a Media Player-free version of Windows.

This means that, for the same price, European consumers can buy a PC with Media Player or a competing product bundled with an alternative. Bad news for  Microsoft but pretty much as you were as far as consumers are concerned.

IF AND when Bill Gates sits down to write a cheque for euros 497 million (pounds 330m) payable to the European Commission, he will doubtless have a moment to reflect on why the EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, imposed the large  fine on his company, Microsoft. The money itself won't hurt - the company has $53 billion in cash - but it will add to any sense of persecution the convicted US monopolist already harbours.

The Commission ruled against the company last week for the relatively minor infraction of bundling Media Player into the Windows operating system - and thus breaking the law by using its 'near monopoly' in operating systems to squeeze out rivals in other kinds of software. The European verdict may have greater consequences than the long US  antitrust case brought against  Microsoft in the late Nineties.  Microsoft, which intends to appeal, sees a Europe that will no longer be so friendly to it in future. Ditto for Asia, though for different reasons.

TD
'This is the largest  antitrust fine ever imposed by the EU so it sends a big message,' says Simon Yates, senior analyst at Forrester Research. 'In the short term it's a major inconvenience because it's going to require them to deliver two different products - the full  Microsoft software with the Windows media player, and another with other vendors' software in it.'

But it's the long term that worries  Microsoft. The company fears the precedent set by being forced to unbundle Windows could be applied to its next generation of operating systems, codenamed Longhorn. The failure, despite chief executive Steve Ballmer's last-minute concessions, to establish an agreement between the EU and  Microsoft that would govern how the company uses Windows to deliver new technologies against competitors leaves the company open to EU regulation.

Longhorn, which will require a whole new chipset and will contain much closer integration between the operating system and applications, is expected to include integrated web services and a new file structure. There will also be a search engine that can learn what the user is interested in and associate that with related things. 'That gets into a lot of privacy concerns down the road,' says Yates. 'People will ask: "Do I want  Microsoft to know what I'm interested in - and what are they going to do with that information?" '

For Microsoft, the release of Longhorn is crucial. There has not been a completely new operating system since Windows was first introduced. But  Microsoft doesn't merely want to be an operating and productivity systems company, and the EC ruling could put a serious crimp in the plan to maintain market dominance and extend its reach into the market for video games, mobile devices, smart cellphones, online music, and TV set-top boxes.

Delving into new technologies is regarded by  Microsoft as a bridging strategy until Longhorn is ready for release. The company believes the desktop is the centre of the consumers' information life, but different devices need to be linked before the concept of the 'digital home' can be realised. Yates says:
'Microsoft is pursuing a way to wire all different consumer electronics gadgets together and put the PC
at the centre of gravity.

Page 107 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
'But Europe and Asia are risky territory for  Microsoft. In Asia, and particularly in China, the [free] Linux operating system has a much better chance of establishing market dominance than  Microsoft can with Windows because Windows is too expensive and their needs can be met more effectively with cheap hardware, a free operating system and applications.'

Last week, in a symbolic and perhaps prophetic move, Hewlett-Packard announced the worldwide rollout of PCs installed with Linux. The fork in the road may come when Longhorn is released. In emerging markets the cost-effectiveness of adopting Longhorn may be even less attractive because it will require new hardware systems to run it. To offset the threat of Linux,  Microsoft is already offering software tiered in functionality and priced to what the Asian markets can bear.

Not surprisingly, and given that technology represents a large proportion of American foreign earnings, Republican politicians responded unfavourably to the EC ruling. US Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist thundered that it 'threatens the vitality of America's IT industry' and accused the Commission of showing
'complete indifference to the negative impact of its ruling on American jobs, American consumers, and the US economy.'

He added: 'I now fear that the US and the EU are heading toward a new trade war - and that the Commission's ruling against  Microsoft is the first shot.' The US Justice Department, too, strongly criticised the EU, believing its own remedy for Microsoft's monopolistic practices was the correct one.
'Antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition, even by "dominant" companies,' a senior official remarked.

The Commission ruling virtually negates the US-Microsoft settlement. Moreover, the EC's action is widely interpreted by the US Administration as another example of post-Iraq anti-US meddling.

According to Laura DiDio, an analyst at the Yankee Group, paranoia has descended on the Redmond, Washington, company. The rise of Linux; the DoJ lawsuit; the EC ruling; the problems the company has had with licensing software; the lengthening lifecycle of software; the army of  Microsoft bashers and detractors - have all put the company on the defensive.

The result, she says, has been to make  Microsoft more agile and quick-witted. 'There are only two voices at the company that count,' DiDio says. 'Gates and Ballmer are at their best when they are challenged. For the last 18 months, their modus operandi is to not try to defend an indefensible position or a losing hand.'
Last winter, Ballmer made a sudden trip to Munich to try to dissuade Bavarian city officials from
switching from Windows to Linux. He failed and the city decided to go open-source. But what hap pened
in Germany is a harbinger of the change that is sweeping the $200 billion-a-year software industry.

DiDio believes Ballmer's last-minute trip to Brussels was an honest effort to reach agreement. According to  Microsoft, the failure to establish guidelines led to the collapse of settlement talks. 'He would not have got on a plane, or offered to incorporate three rival browsers and open up the source code to developers, if it was not genuine,' she says.

Microsoft's anger at the EC ruling is partly justified, DiDio adds. After all, the bundling of Windows Media Player was not an  abuse of position to the same degree as when  Microsoft crushed Netscape. But, Didio says, Gates may still have trouble understanding it.

'He's an easy target because he's the world's richest man. Has he gone out and squashed the competition like a bug? Yes. But he doesn't view it as wrongdoing. He's Darwinian in his approach; he believes the strong should survive.'

But the irony of the ruling is not lost on US observers. After all, it does not help European software manufacturers as much as it will help  Microsoft's American rivals. 'If you are going to nail  Microsoft, nail them for what they're guilty of. . . being a monopoly and abusing that power.'

Still, DiDio and others believe the challenges  Microsoft faces have changed the company for the better and are requiring it to be more innovative.

'They can no longer just show up with a product and expect everyone to buy it. That's why they're going to go from an evolutionary software model to a revolutionary model again. They want to imbue much more functionality into the computer, and the EU is setting the stage to limit the scope of what it can deliver in terms of functionality. That's why  Microsoft will fight tooth-and-nail to prevent this from happening.'

Apple Computer and RealNetworks are looking to boost the numbers of users of their multimedia-player software after the European Union imposed heavy penalties on  Microsoft for anticompetitive behaviour (see full report on page 13). The EU has ordered  Microsoft to unbundle its Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system used in 90 per cent of personal computers. In future  Microsoft will have
to offer PC makers a choice of two versions of Windows: one with the media player and another without - allowing the manufacturers to install QuickTime or RealPlayer on their machines instead. Strictly speaking, the EU order applies only to PCs made in Europe but  Microsoft will be under pressure to
adopt it world-wide.  Microsoft was ordered also to reveal previously secret code from its Windows desktop operating systems to help software rivals such as Sun Microsystems create competing server software - and it was  fined the best part of a billion dollars - an EU record.

TD
The European Commission's antitrust commissioner, Mario Monti, said the ruling was ''proportionate'' and ''balanced''. ''We are not expropriating  Microsoft's intellectual property,'' he added. ''We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace.'' Maybe so - but Microsoft said last week that it would appeal against the decision. The company's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, warned that consumers would rue the day Windows Media Player was removed.
''Even if one takes away the multimedia code and, as RealNetworks has suggested, instals [its] player in its place, there will remain over 20 features in the Windows operating system that will not function,'' he said, and, ''there will remain many European web sites that will not function properly''. - David Frith

HD        Microsoft Partners React -- EC ruling  could penalize sales, market share, say channel players

Channel partners had mixed reactions over the  antitrust penalties leveled last week against  Microsoft
by the European Commission.

The Redmond, Wash., company said it would appeal within 70 days the $613 million  fine, the order to ship within 90 days a stripped-down version of Windows without Windows Media Player and another order to offer up more APIs and interoperability code to competitors within 120 days.

TD
Predictably, partners of Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer and RealNetworks, as well as Linux advocates, backed the suggested remedies as a corrective force.

"Looking at this from my CEO seat, I see  Microsoft's legal negotiations and  antitrust suits are spilling over and steadily eroding their market share and sales in America," said Marc Maselli, CEO of Back Bay Technologies, a Boston-area Sun partner that recently built a service offering on a Linux desktop as an alternative to Windows and Office.

On the other side of the fence,  Microsoft partners say removing features from Windows and having two different Windows code bases on the market will not help anyone.

Per Werngren, CEO of IDE Natverkskonsulterna, a  Microsoft partner in Stockholm, Sweden, said the EC's decision was motivated by strong anti-U.S. feeling and not consumer benefit. "Most Europeans in the IT business see that this is something that might increase costs, because it is always better to include as much as possible in a standard package like Windows XP," he said.

"The market will take care of  Microsoft," said Brad Murphy, senior vice president at Valtech, a systems integrator headquartered in Paris. "It doesn't mean  Microsoft should be able to monopolize things, but the market-not what EC regulators say-will determine what is good for the consumer."

Despite reports that the Windows XP Reloaded project is under way in part to fulfill the suggested remedy, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer insisted last week that there are no changes on the table planned for Windows XP or for the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, until all appellate efforts are exhausted.

"The Media Player issue was considered. Nobody considered it an  abuse of any position to include the Media Player in Windows," Ballmer told reporters last week. "We think the guidance given by the consent decree in the U.S. and by the appellate court in the U.S. are still the guiding principles for us as we design kind of new versions of Windows.

"Where they got off on the remedies is very confusing to me," Ballmer said. "But certainly we're not doing anything different than we were doing yesterday in terms of how we think about new design."

It's old news by now: The  European Commission has slapped Microsoft with a fine of 497 million euros and given the company a few months to strip its Media Player out of Windows and disclose the Windows server interfaces (see story, page 1). Heck, it was already old news even before the official
announcement, since word leaked out almost a week early.

The short-term word to corporate IT departments is old news, too: When a vendor is under fire, negotiate for better terms. If you can, leverage  Microsoft's troubles to get a sweeter deal.

TD
Is that a brutally tactical view? Sure. Is it in  Microsoft's best interest? Maybe not. But you're not working for Microsoft. And Microsoft -- or any other vendor -- would soak you if the situation was reversed.

You're not willing to negotiate hard with  Microsoft at a time like this? Then don't complain about Microsoft's prices or terms. That's true of every other vendor, too -- IBM, Dell, SAP, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, Cisco, Sun, right down to the smallest players. Either you take your opportunities, or you accept what vendors dictate.

OK, that's the story for the short term. But what does the Europeans' decision to slap  Microsoft mean a little further out?
It might not mean anything. It might mean a seismic shift in the balance of power in the software business
(but it won't). Or it might mean good news for  Microsoft and all its customers.
What if  Microsoft appeals and wins? Nothing changes. No impact.
Or what if Microsoft just has to pay the  fine but doesn't have to limit what it bundles into Windows? The
fine is about 1% of Microsoft's current pile of cash. No impact.
What if Microsoft loses and, instead of knuckling under, decides to walk away from Europe? Huge impact
-- Microsoft's revenue would immediately drop by 30%. But that won't happen, if only because Linux
would instantly become the de facto standard in Europe.  Microsoft would pay any fine and gut Windows
of any bundling rather than cede a third of the world to Linux.
Or -- here's a wild idea -- what if  Microsoft loses and then gets serious about competing?
It could happen. True,  Microsoft's business strategy for almost 30 years has been based on bundling.
First it was  Microsoft Basic bundled with early desktop computers. Then customized versions of MS-DOS
bundled with early PC-not-quite-compatibles. Then MS-DOS bundled with virtually every PC, then
Windows and Office bundled with PCs, then Web browsers and media players bundled with Windows.

Microsoft has searched for new business lines for years. But there's never been any urgency -- everyone in Redmond knows that only Windows and Office have to make money. Anything else can be bundled or piggybacked or "integrated" with those products.

But what if  Microsoft decided to light a fire under its employees and cut the legs out from under its antitrust foes with a single stroke? What if  Microsoft abandoned integration and simply made great add-on products that worked better than those of its competitors?


Page 113 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Suddenly, every product group in Redmond would be under the gun to get it right the first time. And leapfrog the  competition. And listen to customers. And market like crazy.

Stripped of that bundling cushion,  Microsoft products would have to get a lot better, a lot faster, on their own. Competitors would have to get better faster, too. The whole industry would have to get sharper.

The culture of  Microsoft would be revolutionized.  Microsoft employees would become aggressive competitors instead of defensive monopolists. They'd have to -- or they'd be gone.
And with no more bundling, the biggest  antitrust accusation against  Microsoft would be gone, too. Best of all, IT shops would get the benefit of all those better,  competition-honed products.
That would be news. 45743 Frank Hayes, Computerworld's senior news columnist, has covered IT for more than 20 years. Contact him at frank_hayes@computerworld.com.

HD         INTERVIEW: Japan FTC Watching  EU Moves Against  Microsoft

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--The head of the Japan Fair Trade Commission said Monday that his organization is studying European Union regulators' tough sanctions against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to see if similar governmental action is needed in Japan.

"While we haven't decided to start any specific action, from now, we want to hear the E.U.'s position and see what will happen in America," said Kazuhiko Takeshima, chairman of the fair trade watchdog.

TD
"If there are the same problems in the Japanese market, of course, there will be the issue that we can't let them continue" and "there will be a need for Japan to take the necessary action," Takeshima told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.

Last week the  European Commission, judging that the U.S. software giant was abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips, ordered the company to reveal code from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals' competing server software. Unless  Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with the disclosure requirement.

In the other major part of the penalties, the U.S. company will have 90 days to offer PC makers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play audio and video.
E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also  fined Microsoft EUR497 million.

Takeshima, while saying the European  Microsoft case could take years to reach a conclusion, said Japan's fair trade regulator has bilateral cooperation agreements with counterparts in the U.S. and the E.U. and he wants to exchange as much information as possible on the E.C. action with them.

Microsoft has said it will appeal to the E.U.'s Court of First Instance, saying the E.C. decision oversteps European and international law.

Aki Araki, a  Microsoft spokeswoman in Tokyo, said she couldn't comment on Takeshima's remarks, as nothing has happened in Japan on the issues raised by the E.C. Araki also said the company believes it is compliance with the Japanese Anti-Monopoly Law.



Want Probe On Japan
Microsoft Wrapped Up Quickly

Separately, the Japanese fair trade watchdog is looking into  Microsoft's Japanese operations for possible legal violations regarding certain wording in its contracts with domestic computer makers, Takeshima said.

He said he wanted to wrap up the probe into  Microsoft Co. Ltd., which started last month, as quickly as possible. "I don't think it ought to take that much time," he said.

Page 115 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Microsoft spokeswoman said the company will drop the patent-related provision under scrutiny by the JFTC in new contracts later this year, a decision made before the investigation. She said the provision had already passed muster with authorities in the E.U. and the U.S. and the company
believes it is legal under Japanese law as well.

Takeshima, a former finance ministry official, headed the domestic policy office in the prime minister's office until appointed to his current job in 2002. Since taking his post, he has aggressively pushed to strengthen the powers of the commission, which critics have derided as a "toothless watchdog."

The JFTC is trying to submit legislation to increase  fines for cartels and bid rigging and allow leniency for whistleblowers. But in the face of strong opposition from industry groups, politicians and ministries that oversee certain business sectors, there are concerns that these may not be deliberated in the parliamentary session that ends June 16.

Indeed, the commission dropped a whole section that would have lowered the hurdles and speeded up the remedies for firms and new companies unfairly restricted by incumbent corporations. In Japan's energy, telecommunications and airline sectors especially, necessary facilities are controlled by the incumbents and new entrants have a hard time competing.

Those changes would have also applied to companies that control de facto standards, such as operating software.

HD     Another  EC case against Microsoft waits in the wings -- Historic antitrust ruling  bolsters CCIA's complaint on Windows  XP, backers say

Paris - Apparently, Europe has not yet begun to fight. On the heels of the European Commission's historic antitrust ruling, including a  fine of $613 million, last week, Microsoft Corp.'s next European headache is the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), among whose members is mobile-phone giant Nokia Corp.

The Washington-based computer and communication industry lobby group (  www.ccianet.org), which filed a complaint with the EC about  Microsoft's Windows XP operating system a year ago, has vowed to "turn up the heat" on the U.S. software giant to bolster its own case.

TD
According to an attorney working for the CCIA, last week's  antitrust ruling "provides a solid framework and allocates a precedent" to the mobile-phone sector. That industry has been suffering from  Microsoft's "illegal and abusive behavior," said Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based lawyer at Clifford Chance. Vinje said the Commission's decision can bring the CCIA's case-thus far under low-level investigation at the EC antitrust department-"from simmering to boil." He added, "We will pursue this case more vigorously, by updating our complaint and providing further evidence."

An EC spokeswoman confirmed that the CCIA's case against  Microsoft is "still on the table" and "under investigation," but declined to say how quickly the EC would move on it. The Commission is not bound by any legal time frame unless it's working on merger cases.
Case is extensive

The pending CCIA case, which deals with the entire Windows XP operating system, is more extensive than previous cases against Microsoft. It follows up on both of the basic issues behind the EC's decision. The plaintiffs claim that XP allows Microsoft to preserve an existing monopoly situation, making it easier for Microsoft to leverage its dominance into new markets.

Abuses alleged in the complaint include  Microsoft's bundling of products such as Instant Messenger, Outlook Express and Movie Player onto Windows XP. In a specific reference related to the mobile sector, the industry group accuses  Microsoft of "leveraging [its] existing dominant position to the markets for handheld computing devices and smart phone software through bundling, failure to supply interface information and the use of proprietary formats and protocols."

Sources close to Nokia confirmed that there is "a concrete problem with obtaining information from Microsoft." This occurred when Nokia tried to make its mobile-handset applications-such as calendar software-work seamlessly with the Windows desktop operating system for exchanging information.

Attorney Vinje said he is hopeful that the Commission will bring a speedy resolution to the CCIA's case. Now that the EC has a team "up to speed with all the technical and legal issues" involved in the  Microsoft case, Vinje said, "The resources are already there. They can hit the ground running." While the EC's latest case against Microsoft took five years, a decision on the CCIA complaint "within two years would be realistic," he said.

Besides Nokia, other members of CCIA include AOL, Fujitsu, Kodak, Oki, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and
Verizon.

"Although  Microsoft tries to discredit anyone who is against them, including us, we are not a bunch of Microsoft opponents who got together to file a complaint," said Vinje. Rather, the group advocates open markets, open systems and open networks.
Hold the phone

Trade group, to which Nokia belongs, claims that XP allows  Microsoft to preserve a monopoly and ride it into new markets.
EC confirms case is "under investigation," but is silent on time frame.

The latest setback for  Microsoft casts a shadow over the companyâs future growth prospects

The European Commissionâs decision to fine Microsoft US$612m for monopolist behaviour hardly amounts to a serious blow against the worldâs largest software company. With cash reserves of more than US$50bn, the company can easily afford to pay up. Despite  Microsoftâs enormous financial strength, however, the Commissionâs decision casts a distinct shadow over its future growth prospects.

TD
The ruling is likely to influence a number of similar cases pending against  Microsoft. The company successfully settled an  antitrust action brought by the US government in 2001, so it had high hopes that it could do the same with the EU. Indeed, as late as last week  Microsoft was still proposing settlement options. Instead, after four years of investigations, Mario Monti, the EU  competition commissioner, found the company in violation of  antitrust law by failing to give rivals the information they needed to compete fairly in the market for server software. He also accused  Microsoft of stifling  competition in the market
for media player software, which is used to play video and music.

Although the company intends to appeal, it now seems likely that Mr Montiâs ruling can only result in further legal losses for the company in other venues. These may or may not result in fines, but cumulatively they will damage the companyâs reputation around the world. In the US, Microsoft is still awaiting a US appeals court ruling on whether the settlement it reached with the government in 2001 was proper. It is also facing a lawsuit in Minnesota which alleges the company overcharged customers between 1994 and 2001. Microsoft is also being sued by RealNetworks, the software company the EU said was the victim of Microsoftâs uncompetitive behaviour in Europe.
Under pressure

Pressures are building in Asia as well. In February Japanese officials raided  Microsoftâs offices on suspicion of monopolistic practices. In particular, the government is investigating complaints that the company attached restrictive conditions to its sales of software to computer makers. Although  Microsoft says it no longer engages in such activities, it is co-operating with authorities. In the wake of the EUâs decision, it now seems clear that many more such cases will be emerging around the world.

At the heart of  Microsoftâs anti-competitive behaviour, according to the Commission, is its practice of âbundlingâ new products into its dominant operating system, guaranteeing an instant market for those products. Because the price of the new software is hidden in the cost of a new computer, critics assert, consumers canât compare the product with the  competition. The Commission, in response, has ruled that Microsoft must make its Windows software in two versions -- with its media player and without.

This poses a real dilemma for the company; it must now decide whether to design the next version of Windows, dubbed Longhorn and due in 2006, with integrated extras. Given that  Microsoftâs sales growth has slowed recently, the company has high hopes for Longhorn. But if the product is eventually released without the extras that consumers have come to expect, it may not be well-received. The Commissionâs recent ruling forces the company to unbundle its wares in Europe, but  Microsoft could face a backlash elsewhere from consumers who have come to depend on the bundled extras. That could mean selling different versions of its product in different markets -- in effect, building integrated and unintegrated versions of Longhorn, which will be costly.

Further to fall
Over the last six months  Microsoftâs stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 by 23%. Over the last
12 months, while the share prices of most technology companies have been rising,  Microsoftâs has
dropped by 8%. It has also lost its position as the worldâs most valuable company, as measured by market
capitalisation. It handed the crown to General Electric (GE) at the end of the third quarter last year and is
now the worldâs third most valuable company, trailing GE and Exxon Mobil. Given its parsimonious
approach to paying out dividends, on the one hand, and its growing business and legal worries, on the
other, Microsoftâs stock -- both in terms of equity and reputation -- could have further to fall.

Microsoft was fined a record Â£331 million by the  European Commission earlier this week - a financial flea bite for the computer giant, but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft's sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm's Media Player program.

TD
The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by 'bundling' its own software and other services with its Windows system.

That made it difficult for other software makers to compete - particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft claimed that the information was its own property, and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy.
The strategy worked well - more than 90 per cent of personal computers run on  Microsoft software. Today's ruling in Brussels followed a four-year investigation led by  Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti, who said: "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future
conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position."  Microsoft is appealing against the  fine to
the European Court of Justice, and Mr Gates will also challenge the Commission's contention that the
company which made him the world's richest man is an 'abusive monopolist.'.

BRUSSELS - Oracle Corp. will this week seek to address the  European Commission's concerns over its US$9.4-billion hostile bid for software rival PeopleSoft Inc., in an attempt to stop the Brussels body from delivering a fatal blow to the transaction.

The U.S. Justice Department moved to block the technology deal last month, but its decision will be subject to a court case that is unlikely to be completed before late July.

TD
By contrast, the commission's ruling is due by May 11 and could be decisive. Oracle has only six weeks to rebut the commission's objections or meet its concerns.

Mario Monti,  competition commissioner in Brussels, may not relish having to decide on an all-U.S. merger so soon after his decision last week to  fine Microsoft 497-million (US$601-million) and order it to change its business practices. But given the Justice Department's stance, there is little chance of another divergence with the United States.

Oracle will deliver its response to the commission as early as today and will face its critics at a closed-door hearing on Wednesday and Thursday.

The Commission says the merger would reduce from three to two the number of "key players" that sell finance and human resources software to big companies. Brussels' formal objections to the merger
argue not only that it could lead to collusion between Oracle and SAP of Germany, but that Oracle might be able to squeeze its clients even without collaborating with its rival.

One problem for the Commission is that EU courts have established strict criteria for banning a merger because of possible future collusion between companies. The Commission may also be constrained by current rules, which do not explicitly permit it to ban mergers that could give rise to "non-collusive oligopolies", such as the one Brussels suspects may arise between Oracle and SAP. New regulations to fill this perceived gap have been approved, but will not apply to the current deal.

But Oracle's critics say the certainty of a duopoly in the relevant market is reason enough to block the deal.

HD        Europe goes too far in its Microsoft ruling

Should a thriving, innovative private company be forced to deliberately make its products less appealing to consumers, in hopes of making life easier for lesser competitors?

The European Commission, as evidenced by its $612.9-million (U.S.)  fine and anti-competition judgment against Microsoft Corp. last week, believes the answer is yes. Common sense and basic economics dictate the answer should be no.  Microsoft was given 70 days to appeal the judgment, and intends to do so. Good.

TD
To be clear: No one should defend state-protected monopolies. They are inefficient, slow to adapt and innovate, prone to take suppliers and clients alike for granted. Consider old-economy stalwart Air Canada. Though the airline can no longer be said to have an absolute monopoly on Canadian air passenger travel â Westjet and other regional airlines are making inroads â it held a market share of
65 per cent as recently as the third quarter of last year. And because Ottawa continues to maintain barriers to foreign  competition â no foreign air carrier can acquire more than 25 per cent of a Canadian airline, or offer point-to-point flights within Canada â consumers are limited in their range of
choice. Ultimately, this may serve Ottawa's political ends, but it does consumers a disservice. The same applied when the big telephone companies held regulated monopolies, which is why deregulation was a good idea.

In Microsoft's case, the parameters are different. The computer industry is not regulated (though the EC appears to want to change that) and never has been.  Microsoft has acquired 95-per-cent market share in the global operating system market, yes â but it has done so by virtue of free consumer choice. Even so, the U.S. Justice Department found the company was taking unfair advantage of its huge dominance when it âbundledâ within the Windows operating system new applications that competed with those of much smaller firms. As a remedy, computer makers were given the option of âmaskingâ Microsoft applications attached to the Windows operating system â though consumers could turn them on again.

The EC went substantially further. It ordered  Microsoft to develop a version of its operating system without the Windows Media Player application, and offer it to PC makers within 90 days. The company has also been ordered to turn over proprietary technical information that will allow makers of server software â most notably Sun Microsystems â to better compete with  Microsoft's own offerings.
The philosophical precedent here is striking. For the first time, a high-tech firm has been ordered to
âun-developâ a product that has found favour with consumers in an open market. The anti-trust division
of the U.S. Justice Department, no great fan of Microsoft, had this to say in response: âSound anti-trust
policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by dominant companies. A contrary
approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation
and the consumers [who] benefit from it.â That's exactly right.

Ah, but might the EC's judgment have positive benefits on the ground? Might it help create a more robust, variegated global software industry? Probably not. For one thing,  Microsoft intends to appeal for a stay in the articles of the judgment while its appeal is heard. This could take up to five years. For another, the  fine â though one of the largest such penalties in history â amounts to three weeks of the software giant's profit. For a company with a $53-billion cash hoard, $613-million is a rounding error.

More to the point, the EC's demand for an abridged operating system did not include a directive on price. This means  Microsoft will be able to charge equal amounts for both versions â one with media player, one without. If you were a computer maker, which would you buy? The market will have its way.

In which case, why bother? Could it be because Bill Gates's  Microsoft is a potent symbol of American economic might, and the  European Commission â for reasons that have more to do with transatlantic political tensions than any given company â decided to beard the lion? If so, that would be shoddy policy-making indeed.

Microsoft has overpowered the  competition to rule the world of PCs, and now it aims to do the same in the home entertainment market. Kate Bulkley reports. A  European Commission ruling last week
against Microsoft has brought back into focus the fight over control of how we see, use and, increasingly, pay for our digital entertainment. This battle is pitting  Microsoft, Sony, Dell, Apple,
Motorola, BSkyB, Nokia and a plethora of other media giants against each other as they vie for control of the future of the much-heralded home entertainment space.
Last week the Commission fined Microsoft for using its dominant position in the PC market to flatten
the competition. Under the ruling, Microsoft is forbidden from giving its Media Player (which allows PC
users to play videos from the internet) "favourable treatment on Windows", its operating system software
that runs 90% of the world's PCs.

TD
But the ruling only touches on the underlying question of who is going to rule the home entertainment space as convergence of household electronic gadgets begins to take effect. After years of talk, this converged world vision has the PC, the TV, DVD players, video games machines, portable devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart mobile phones and gadgets such as the new iPod all linking together. The only question seems to be which companies are going to do the linking.

Late last year,  Microsoft made the first major strike with the launch of its new Media Centre products in Europe - nearly a year after devices were available in the US. After some unsteady steps in the pay TV business, the Media Centre is  Microsoft founder Bill Gates's first major step into the home entertainment space that seems to have a chance. Media Centre basically soups up a PC so that it
organises music, videos, photos and can be linked by a wire to any TV screen in the house. It also has a personal video recorder so you can hook it up to your TV and organise your night's viewing without having to rent a Sky Plus box from BSkyB. And, say retailers, because it includes a remote control as part of the package, it is easy for even computer-illiterate people to run.

Two weeks ago,  Microsoft announced the rollout of what it is calling the Media Centre Extender which, when it starts selling in Europe early next year, will let consumers wirelessly connect their Media Centre PC to their TV. Next year,  Microsoft's Xbox console will include "Extender" functions too. Also unveiled at the Cebit technology fair in Germany earlier this month was a portable version of  Microsoft Media Centre (MMC) that lets you organise all your digital media (from DVDs to music to information downloaded from the internet) and take it with you.

The digital cognoscenti have already given this portable product, which should be on sale at the end of this year, the nickname "iPod killer". Not only does it do all the things that the iPod does - download, store and organise music, plus synching with your PC calendar and contacts list - it has a screen as well, so it will play DVDs and other video. So far there is no crossover announced between the forthcoming portable Media Centre and  Microsoft software-powered digital smart phones, but it would be a logical next step.

High street outlets like Dixons and PC World are moving the original MMC-enabled PCs faster than anyone wishes to tell you and head of marketing at PC World (part of the Dixons Group) Chris Matthews says the reason they are selling is all about ease of use. "We do demos in our 125 stores on MMC and if

you give someone the remote control, in five minutes they will be able to download CDs, record TV, listen to radio, download album covers - all through the remote. It makes it very simple."
But while Microsoft is pushing consumers to convergence via the PC, Sony and the rest of the
competition are trying to dominate digital media with their own products.

Sony's campaign is led by the PSX, which is basically a next-generation PlayStation. When attached to the TV, the PSX stores and plays back the user's movies, photos, music and videos. It also burns CDs and can be used to play games. The next version will also include PVR functions and next year Sony will launch PSP, a portable version of the PlayStation, which will do all the things the portable  Microsoft Media Centre does as well as playing sophisticated video games.

Both Sony and  Microsoft (and others) are looking to be the home entertainment hub, but they come at it from different areas of strength. For Sony, the PlayStation, the world's dominant gaming device, is the obvious place to start. For  Microsoft it's the PC, as Gates's software runs the vast majority of the
world's computers.

In a speech earlier this month in London at the FT New Media and Broadcasting conference, the chairman and CEO of Sony Corp America Howard Stringer called 2004 "the year of convergence". If this is true, it opens up important new possibilities for Sony. "With all these broadband connected TVs,
PVRs, PlayStations, cellphones, MP3 players and more, we will no longer need a permit from the gatekeepers when we want to reach the consumer. We'll use our ongoing dialogue with the customer to develop greater loyalty and to offer new tools to create and share content," said Stringer.

There may be everything to win but there is also a lot to lose as well, particularly for companies like Sony which also own large swaths of content from music (through its record company) to movies (through its Hollywood studio). Both have already seen increasingly big losses from online and off-line piracy as digital technology makes it easier to steal content.
Not everyone agrees that  Microsoft has the right approach, though.

"You are talking about putting a PVR and a DVD and other functions all on one device, on the assumption that people want one device," says Brian Sullivan, director of new product development and sales at BSkyB. "It sounds logical. But when you pick it apart there are elements that aren't necessarily consumer friendly. What happens if you are using a Media Centre and the processor on the computer goes bad? You are not going to just lose your computer, you are going to lose your TV and your music and everything."

Reining in the ambitions of  Microsoft with its deep pockets and its entrenched position in the PC market is no easy thing, although many, including the  European Commission, have tried. Perhaps allowing Microsoft to bundle its Media Player would actually be better for consumers, since so much content is being encoded using Microsoft's software (optimising it for play on the  Microsoft player).

In fact, an analyst for the Ovum consultancy in London thinks that the Commission made a "tactical error" by focusing on the desktop when  Microsoft's overall strategy has shifted to services and devices beyond the desktop. "Microsoft has to some extent built its own insurance policy against rulings like this," says Neil Ward-Dutton, principal analyst at Ovum, "in that it has moved a lot of its real intellectual property invention focus away from the desktop and towards other types of devices and network services. So in terms of  Microsoft's wider intent to leverage its dominance on the desktop to other domains, this [ruling] doesn't really affect any of that at all."
Stay tuned for more appearances by  Microsoft on entertainment devices everywhere, then.

HD       Network Week - Microsoft fights  EC ruling. BY        By Peter Williams.

Microsoft is to seek a suspension of a $497m (Â£331m)  fine and other penalties imposed on it last week by the European Commission, pending a full appeal.
The EC ruled that  Microsoft broke the law "by leveraging its near-monopoly in the market for PC
operating systems onto the markets for workgroup servers and for media players". The firm has until 2
June to appeal to the European Court.

TD
Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel and corporate secretary, said his firm was most concerned by the EC's ruling that it must produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player within 120 days, and must reveal networking code to competitors within 90 days. "You cannot ask (a company) to put something out under licence and then pull it (back again) if it wins on appeal," he argued.
Smith warned that the case could drag on for four or five years. Paula Barrett, a partner at law firm
Eversheds, said the case could last up to three years.

Neil Ward-Dutton of analyst company Ovum said the ruling would not affect  Microsoft's activities with other types of devices. "Microsoft is two steps ahead of this ruling," he added. "It has already made big strides in ensuring that the Windows Media format, and its associated server products and creation tools, are widely adopted by content and service providers.

If (the EC) really wanted to deal with the Windows Media issue, (it) should have focused on server APIs, codecs and protocols rather than the desktop domain."

Before the ruling,  Microsoft had offered to include three rival media players in Windows, according to Smith. The eleventh-hour suggestions were rejected by EC  antitrust chief Mario Monti. David Smith of analyst Gartner said the offer to bundle rival software might have "better addressed what consumers wanted". He added that the impact of the ruling may be limited, as the EC had not insisted on a reduced price for versions without the disputed Windows features.

Paul Jackson of analyst Forrester said the ruling could affect Windows Longhorn. "It may have to come in two versions to appease the EC: one with all the  Microsoft bells and whistles, and one bare-boned version for other vendors to dress up," he said.

HD     Up For a Fight -- The European Union, product delays, and Linux momentum test Microsoft, but they also may drive its competitive spirit

What a month for  Microsoft. The stiff  fine and tough new measures imposed by the European Union last week were merely the capper in a series of setbacks to hit the company in recent weeks.  Microsoft revealed that key products have fallen behind schedule, including patch-management software that's central to its security push. And its next-generation Windows operating system, code-named Longhorn, may be getting bogged down, too.

In addition,  Microsoft continues to wrestle with the encroachment of Linux and other open-source products. "A lot of different forces are coming to bear on  Microsoft," says Michael Cherry, an analyst with Directions On  Microsoft.

TD
On March 22, only 36 hours before the European Commission's crackdown was announced, and knowing what was coming, CEO Steve Ballmer insisted that Microsoft is on the right track. "We think we have all the opportunities in the world," he said during an interview at Microsoft's headquarters.

Ballmer argues the EU has gone too far with its mandate that Microsoft create a version of Windows with its media software removed, disclose Windows server APIs, and more. Microsoft has been down this
path before, and Ballmer maintains that the  antitrust agreement reached 18 months ago with the Justice Department should be enough to regulate the company's actions at home and abroad. "The question is, will the standards be different outside the United States than inside the United States?" Ballmer says. "We went through a long and arduous process in the United States. We think it's quite an adequate
framework."

On March 16, Ballmer flew to Brussels with  Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith in an effort to reach a compromise. After two days of negotiations-and a visit to the grammar school he once attended
there-Ballmer left without a deal. The talks broke down when EU negotiators insisted on guidelines that would have restricted how  Microsoft packages future products.

The EU's verdict that  Microsoft must pay a $613 million  fine and create a Media Player-free version of Windows, while opening its closely guarded server APIs, cuts at the heart of  Microsoft's ability to keep adding new features to its operating system.  Microsoft plans to appeal the EU's decision. But if the sanctions stick, they could limit the company's product decisions and embolden competitors to register new complaints, says analyst Dwight Davis at Summit Strategies.

All this comes at a time when Microsoft itself is trying to figure out what features to include in future releases of Windows. In recent weeks, Microsoft product managers have begun talking about fuzzy concepts called "Windows XP Reloaded" and "Windows Server 2003 Update." The company is looking for ways to deliver new Windows features before Longhorn's release, but it's unsure how to package them.

That Microsoft is mulling these options at all is a sign that Longhorn's development is taking longer than expected, which Ballmer confirms. "We have more in our initial Longhorn conceptualization than we probably need," he says. "We've probably got more work than we wanted."


Page 134 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That means  Microsoft may "cut back a little bit on the boldness" of Longhorn-the centerpiece in the company's future product line-to get it done more quickly. Even then, Ballmer says, "the Longhorn release that comes out will probably still be a little bit later than I would have hoped initially."  Microsoft officials
still aren't saying when Longhorn will ship, though some analysts estimate it will be 2007 or later.

Ballmer says there's no plan for an interim PC operating system between now and Longhorn. However, a pre-Longhorn server release remains a possibility.

Freedom to design Windows the way  Microsoft wants is especially important as it builds technology into Longhorn. For example, the Speech Server 2004, introduced last week in San Francisco, could lead to future products hitched to Longhorn's development. "Eventually, we'll think of the PC and the phone as devices we can talk to," chairman Bill Gates said at the product's introduction. "The screen and speech shouldn't be separate worlds."

During a March 24 teleconference to discuss the EU decision, Ballmer said  Microsoft's long-term product strategy won't change as a result of the ruling. But its product road map is anything but static. Upgrades to the company's database, developer toolset, and patch-management system have all been bumped into future quarters. The shifting dates, along with uncertainty about future Windows releases, make planning difficult.
"Their road map seems like a moving target," says Tim Stettheimer, VP and CIO at St. Vincent's Medical
Center, a hospital in Birmingham, Ala., with about 1,500 Windows PCs. "We're scratching our heads."

Damien Bean, VP of corporate systems at Hilton Hotels Corp., says, "They have to tell me what building blocks I can rely on."

The delay in Microsoft's Windows Update Services, which promises to make it easier for businesses to download and install Microsoft-issued software patches, was a big miss, given the high priority the company has placed on improved patch management.

But Ballmer touts what  Microsoft has accomplished: monthly patch distributions that make life more predictable for systems administrators and an almost-ready security update for Windows XP. "I think we're doing a very good job on the [security] action plans we laid forward," he says. Ironically, the Windows XP work is partly to blame for the Windows Update Services delay;  Microsoft deemed Windows XP a higher priority and shifted its resources there.

As Microsoft confronts the growing open-source threat, it's also paying closer attention to how it might turn things to its advantage in China, which has open-source initiatives under way. China is "getting more and more comfortable with Windows as part of their infrastructure," Ballmer asserts.  Microsoft last year hired Tim Chen, the former head of Motorola Inc.'s Chinese operations, to spearhead its work there. Ballmer points to a recent deal with the China Ministry of Information Industry to establish technology labs equipped with Microsoft software as a sign of progress.

With pirated versions of Windows widely available in China, Ballmer jokes that the acquisition costs are comparable to Linux. And illegally acquired software gives  Microsoft a wide base from which to grow. "Our market share relative to Linux is better in China than almost any other country in the world," he says.

So much for bowing to the pressure. Rather than set  Microsoft back, analyst Cherry says hard-to-solve problems tend to fuel the company's competitive drive. "I think they see these challenges as an opportunity," Cherry says. "If you solve these challenges, then there's unlimited opportunity ahead of you."

Among the opportunities  Microsoft wants to seize are more deals with manufacturing companies. It's sketching out plans to create sales teams that target the aerospace, chemical, consumer
packaged-goods, high-tech manufacturing, and oil and gas industries. It also intends to deliver more job-specific software for employees in finance, sales, and other roles.
But first,  Microsoft has to get past the current mix of challenges. And that's going to require more than
Ballmer's can-do attitude. -With Aaron Ricadela

The software developers in this week's list, many of which sell on international markets, are great
examples of Hungarians' legendary flair for IT innovation. Such companies should be pleased by the ruling
against Microsoft's market dominance that was announced last week by EU anti-trust boss Mario Monti.
Or should they? Let's look closer at what the  European Commission's punishment of the global software
giant, with a EUR497 million  fine and restrictions on its practices, really shows about the club that this
nation of IT experts is about to join. First, the EU does not respect a company's prerogative to give
customers a more valuable product. It said  Microsoft must no longer automatically include its own media
player with PCs, but must also offer ones without this feature. Second, the EU doesn't understand
innovation. It told  Microsoft to share codes so that other firms can more easily develop products to run on
its desktops.

TD
But in seeking to prevent Microsoft from having all the cake, it is assuming that cakes never grow or multiply. In fact, Microsoft's dominance of certain areas of IT has never prevented new companies springing up in other fields fields that never existed, perhaps not even in Bill Gates' mind, until those companies sprang up. For all we know, innovators may soon come up with a totally new product that competes with the PC itself. In some ways, mobile phones are already doing just that. It is in the very nature of innovators that they spot opportunities and needs for new things, working from present possibilities. That's what Gates did and he didn't ask regulators to make a nice level field for him first.
Third, the EU does not respect intellectual property. It seems to think that any company that has reached a certain size should be made into a public utility. By preventing a company from reaping the benefits of its own breakthroughs, the latest decision discourages innovation. What incentive is there for companies to create new things, or for venture capitalists to invest in them, if a few years down the line officials will bar them from claiming the profits? Finally, EU  competition rules actually work against  competition. They
are based on a desire to create an equal situation for all players and protect them from the rigors of the market regardless of whether or not they possess the brilliance that got  Microsoft where it is today. Apparently, the regulators have never heard of Linux, the open-source system many software developers and PC makers are now working with. The Linux comunity is growing fast, and may soon be a serious threat to  Microsoft. We only hope the day will not come when authorities stand in its way, too. Because the existence of Linux is excellent evidence that a free market, not a strong regulator, is the friend of innovation.

After being slapped with a record $611 million  fine last week by the  European Commission for violating European Union anti-trust laws, Microsoft said it would appeal the ruling, a process that could take five years. The EU ordered Microsoft to unbundle Windows Media Player within 90 days and make certain server protocols available to competitors. "We believe every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers," said  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. He expressed disappointment that the EU decided to pursue the "riskier course of litigation" instead of agreeing to a settlement, which he said is still a possibility.

TD
EU competition commissioner Mario Monti used similar language in defending the ruling, saying, "Our decision is about protecting consumer choice and innovation." With the  fine representing just more than
1% of Microsoft's $53 billion in cash reserves, Goldman Sachs said it appears the decision will not have a significant effect on  Microsoft's business but potentially could constrain the company from adding major features to Windows in the future.

The Witty Worm, originally discovered by eEye Digital Security, recently began spreading to attack and compromise the intrusion-protection products BlackIce and RealSecure from Internet Security Systems just two days after ISS disclosed the vulnerability associated with these products. This fast turnaround time in transforming a publicly disclosed vulnerability into an actual worm-based exploit caught the
attention of security experts, especially because the Witty Worm seeks to destroy the hard drive by writing nonsense code to it. William Boni, Motorola's vice president and chief information security officer, even
had cause to allude to the Witty Worm in his keynote address last week at the InfoSec World conference (see related stories on pages 8 and 16). Motorola uses ISS products and had to rapidly upgrade with a patch to prevent worm infections.

HP has filed a lawsuit against Gateway that accuses HP's rival of violating six technology patents relating to desktop, notebook and server computer systems. The suit, which was filed last week in federal district court in San Diego, alleges that Gateway violated HP's patents in areas including graphics, power management and notebook design, says Joe Beyers, vice president of intellectual property licensing at HP. Gateway previously had licensed some of the patents in question, Beyers says. "Many of these were licensed to Gateway from 1994 to 1999," he says. "They then refused to renew that license going forward after 1999." Gateway vowed to fight the suit. Last year, HP formed an intellectual property licensing
division to expand and oversee licensing of the company's patent portfolio. Wednesday's lawsuit is the first to emerge from the division, which helped increase HP's revenue from royalties by 50% in 2003,
according to Beyers.

The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice has acted to halt a fake-Web and e-mail "phishing" scam that had conned hundreds of users into giving credit card and bank account numbers to Web sites that looked like those of AOL and PayPal. The FTC charged Zachary Keith Hill of Houston with deceptive and unfair practices, and the Justice Department named Hill as a defendant in a criminal case it filed in Virginia.

Telecom operators will be the next to benefit from the cost savings and enhanced services made possible by moving operations overseas, according to a new Deloitte Research survey. However, the researcher warned that operation complexity, loss of control, language, cultural barriers and objections from home country groups that do not want to see local jobs go overseas present obstacles. Global operators are expected to "offshore" 5% of the industry's 5.5 million-strong labor force, or 275,000 jobs, by 2008, the

professional services and advice organization said last week. What's more, the industry is expected to reap cost savings of $14 billion per year by 2008 from improved call center capabilities and enhanced broadband and mobile data services, the research group says. Call centers, IT services, application service development, and accounting and finance will be among some of the top offshore processes, the research group said, adding that India, Argentina and Estonia will be destinations of choice.

Morgan, Lewis & Bockius' Jeffrey Kingston, a San Francisco  antitrust partner, traveled all the way to Brussels to sue  Microsoft Corp. on behalf of Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1998. This week, Sun claimed victory in one of the largest  antitrust cases in the history of the European Union.
Sun's aim, Kingston said, was to get  Microsoft to stop sabotaging competitors.

"If what you really want is a lot of money, the U.S. is the place you go. If you're looking to reform business behavior, you go to Europe," he said.
The European Commission, the administrative arm of the EU, found that  Microsoft broke European
competition law by using its Windows monopoly to muscle into markets for server operating systems.

The commission fined Microsoft $613 million and required the company to turn over technical information within 120 days to rivals to allow their competing server software to work smoothly with Windows.

The sanctions were more severe than those of the U.S. government's 2001 antitrust settlement with Microsoft in which the company had to make a series of promises to curb its competition-crushing behavior.
"The [Department of Justice's] behavioral remedies are a failure, an embarrassment," said Kingston. "I
mean Martha Stewart was punished worse than  Microsoft."

Kingston said the European system relies more heavily on documentary evidence, rather than witnesses, making its adjudication more time-consuming, but also more sophisticated.

"More companies will be asking the question about whether Europe would be the right venue to bring antitrust complaints," he said. "Until now, most lawyers here in Silicon Valley would think about Alameda County or federal court here in San Francisco. EC wasn't on the list."

A bird in the hand ...
The Man is trying to crack down on the Bushman, but the Bushman may have a legal ace in the hole: the
Wilson brothers.

The identical twins, both San Francisco trial lawyers, are considering teaming up to help the shrub-toting street entertainer.

One of the brothers, Jacque Wilson, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender's office, already represents the Bushman, having been assigned his case at random a few months ago.
"Some people think he's a little cuckoo, but I don't," Wilson says of his client, whom he calls a San
Francisco icon.


Page 140 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Last week, Wilson persuaded a San Francisco jury to find the Bushman not guilty of four public nuisance charges. The Bushman, aka David Johnson, faced not only a possible three-year jail sentence, but an injunction barring him from the Fisherman's Wharf sidewalk where he has plied his trade for 25 years.

One of the Wharf's most popular acts, the Bushman spooks unwary tourists by rattling the small tree branch he hides behind as they pass by.
"If he had been convicted, they would have been able to put the Bushman out of business," says Wilson. Even now, Wilson says, the police continue to harass his client - he was slapped with two littering tickets a
few days after his courtroom vindication.

That's where Jacq Wilson comes in. The similarly named twin, a personal injury and product liability lawyer at San Francisco's Schuman & Associates, may bring a civil action on the Bushman's behalf seeking either a cease-and-desist order or a restraining order for the police department.
It would be the first time Jacq and Jacque have paired up to defend a client.

Brother Jacq says he's looking into the matter. While going up against a government entity like the city of San Francisco can be a lot of work, he says the case seems interesting and could be worth it for the publicity.

Revenge of the trial lawyersâ 

Assemblyman Robert Pacheco, R-Walnut, a frequent, outspoken opponent of the plaintiffs bar, lost his seat on the Assembly Judiciary Committee last week.

Newly elected Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, D-Los Angeles, said the bump was part of a larger effort to reduce the size of committees and make the Legislature more efficient. The speaker also axed Democrat Loni Hancock of Berkeley from the committee and got rid of a vacant Democratic seat.

Pacheco said he hadn't had the chance to talk to Nunez about the move, but admitted that he couldn't help but think his well-known opposition to the trial lawyers might have had something to do with his getting bounced.

The committee is chaired by trial-lawyer ally Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro, who bumped heads with Pacheco last year over, among other things, efforts to change the state's unfair  competition law. Pacheco has another bill on the subject pending this year.
Nunez's office said neither the trial lawyers nor the unfair  competition statute had anything to do with
Pacheco's ouster.

Even so, Pacheco said he'd like to talk to Nunez about the possibility of getting back on board. In the meantime, he'll have to count on the remaining Republicans on the committee to help him out with his unfair competition bill. Nunez left the minority party in control of three of judiciary's 11 seats.

Sharon Arkin, president-elect of Consumer Attorneys of California, laughed at the idea that her group had that kind of juice.
"We had absolutely nothing to do with it. It was a shock to me," Arkin said.

Asked if she thought it would change the flavor of the debate in Judiciary, Arkin joked that committee meetings would likely be shorter without Pacheco, who she said is known for taking his time vetting things.

Uneasy in Oakland
There was nothing ordinary about the March 19 arraignment at Alameda's branch courthouse.

For starters, the defendant was Oakland Judge Jackson "Jack" Gifford, who was accused of trying to buy sex from a police decoy during a videotaped sting early this month. The 76-year-old judge, who did not appear in court that day, ultimately pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace, paying a $270  fine. Gifford may still face discipline from the Commission on Judicial Performance, a state judicial watchdog agency.



Page 141 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The arraignment yielded more awkwardness for court leaders. Similar cases would normally be heard at the Wiley W. Manuel Courthouse, but Gifford's couldn't be done there because that's where the accused judge normally presides. Instead of using a local jurist, retired Marin County Judge Peter White handled the case.

Another uncomfortable moment came when White asked Gifford's lawyer if he'd advised his client about the legal implications of the no-contest plea.

Walnut Creek attorney Michael Cardoza replied that he had, but felt "a little funny" giving such legal advice to a judge.

Later, Cardoza apologized to White on Gifford's behalf. His client realized it's difficult for a judge to preside over a colleague's criminal case, Cardoza said.
"It's not an easy thing for a judge to do," he said.

HD           Enormous fine is merely small change to software  giant

The {euro}497 million (about HK$4.75 billion)  fine the European Commission plans to slap on Microsoft is not a small chunk of change. In fact, it is the biggest antitrust levy ever applied to a single company in Europe.

Half a billion euros would be just about enough to cover the external debt of the tiny southern African kingdom Lesotho, but in the rarefied confines of Silicon Valley (or Seattle, for that matter), half a billion is chump change.

TD
Many companies, Microsoft included, have spent that kind of cash in the past just to buy up and close down competitors. Microsoft has a US$272 billion market cap and made gross profits of $26.5 billion last year, of which the EU's fine need not touch a cent.

Microsoft has US$53 billion in spare cash, much of which it was holding on to precisely to pay off court cases like this one. And as we have seen before, $53 billion can help draw out appeals for years.

Whatever the outcome, Microsoft will still have a monopoly that it will continue to wield in order to bludgeon its competition.
Meanwhile, the cases have done little to hurt  Microsoft on the public relations front. For the millions
of normal people around the world who have no interest in the trials and tribulations of the technology
industry, the lengthy legal battles have been a puzzling bore. And while the technical aspects of the
case will mean nothing to them, many will see the  fine as unfairly large.

This is an advantage that  Microsoft has played to its advantage. A lot of Americans, including some judges and politicians, saw the lawsuit against the firm as somehow anti-American; an assault on the right to innovate that has made their country great. So when  Microsoft dragged out its appeal until a more friendly administration came along, the coalition of litigating states collapsed, their electorates unwilling to finance more appeals. Only one state is still bothering with what looks like a completely futile suit.

Microsoft will try to pull the same stunt in Europe, by enlisting the help of the cash-strapped new members of the European Union. At the same time, it will use its influence in Washington to lobby against European interference in American Free Enterprise.

This has already begun. US senator Patty Murray described last week's ruling as "yet another example of the European Union assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth".

There will be a lot more where that came from. But while all of this sounds familiar, we have not seen it all before.

The commission also ordered that  Microsoft "disclose to competitors, within 120 days, the interfaces required for their products to be able to 'talk' to the ubiquitous Windows OS.  Microsoft is also required, within 90 days, to offer a version of its Windows OS without Windows Media Player".

Page 143 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That sentence could have far wider ramifications than the  fine. When the Department of Justice began its suit against  Microsoft, Netscape was winning the browser wars.

By the time the case reached appeal, Netscape was effectively dead. Windows Media Player does not yet control the market, and its unbundling, if the EU is successful, will benefit hundreds of software companies.

Microsoft's digital rights management system and Windows Media Audio (WMA) format are fast becoming industry standards among pay-to-download music sites. If left long enough, they may well have become the only standard. They still could.

This would force third-party software firms such as Apple, RealNetworks or MusicMatch to either pay licensing fees to  Microsoft or, more likely, to find themselves another business. It would also boost Microsoft's share in the market for servers and high-end workstations needed to serve WMA files and handle rights management.

As free software such as Linux and Apache have taken an increasing share of the server market, one of Microsoft's defences has been the difficulty many systems have with connecting to  Microsoft servers and workgroups. The commission's insistence that  Microsoft release more of its code to
rivals means it could become easier for companies to mix and match their technologies.

There may be reasons for businesses to prefer heterogeneous software environments, but that decision should be made by choice, not by force.

To give Microsoft some credit, most of its rivals would behave the same way, given the chance. Any firm given a monopoly will  abuse that position - whether it is selling air tickets, vitamins or cars. But vitamin and car manufacturers who have come under Mario Monti's scrutiny have operated in more competitive markets. The question in  Microsoft's case is, given its extraordinary dominance, whether it will ever be possible to redress the market through legislation.

The European Commission ruling last Wednesday, which slapped Microsoft with a record-breaking fine of {euro}497.2 million (HK$4.75 billion), might strengthen the antitrust investigation being conducted by Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) against the software giant.

"The EC ruling will likely give more strength to the Japanese  antitrust case from a simple perspective that there is a stronger ruling somewhere else," said Dion Wiggins, research director at Gartner Hong Kong.

TD
"The Japanese  antitrust investigators may deem that reason enough to dig deeper and be a bit bolder themselves."

Although the hefty financial penalty is not likely to make a dent in  Microsoft's US$53 billion cash reserves, the EC ruling (under appeal) requires that the company unbundle its Media Player from Windows and give information that would allow rivals to develop software that interfaces smoothly with Windows-based PCs and servers.

Last month, a team from Japan's FTC raided the company's Tokyo headquarters in search of documents to support its investigation. The case has grown from complaints made by Japanese PC makers who have protested against a provision in their original equipment manufacturer (OEM) contracts to pre-install the Windows operating system in their machines. The provision prevents them from suing Microsoft if they find that the company has used their patented technology.

Microsoft has promised to fully co-operate with the FTC investigation. While it continues to assert no wrongdoing and that the "patent technology provision is lawful under Japanese, US and EU law", Microsoft said last month that it would drop the offensive provision from the next round of its OEM contracts.

Far from "improving customer satisfaction", which is cited by  Microsoft as the reason for deleting this contract detail, many suspect it is applying a lesson learnt from previous  antitrust battles and is trying to placate the Japanese FTC before the case gets out of hand.

Indeed, Sony first argued against this same patent-related provision in 2002, and the complaint fell on deaf ears. Given its present anti-competition troubles in Europe,  Microsoft is not likely to want to engage in similar legal battles in Asia.

"Microsoft should consider the [Japanese] FTC's action a serious warning that practices such as these face increasing government scrutiny," Mr Wiggins said.

Meanwhile, it is too early to assess the impact of the EC ruling on Asia, especially in the shaping of anticompetition laws for the information technology industry.

"What happens in Europe should not have much bearing in Asia," said Wilvin Chee, associate director, Asia/Pacific Sofware Research at International Data Corp.

He said Microsoft had been working amicably with various Asian governments to boost IT adoption in the region, particularly in repackaging Windows to suit local requirements.

"The industry here is more concerned about combating piracy. Furthermore, it has strongly embraced open-source development. There are a lot of activities to be busy with, rather than focusing on an anticompetition case," Mr Chee said.

Still, many Asian governments are bristling over  Microsoft's dominance of the desktop computer market, which has allowed the company for many years to use its muscle to maintain a single, global pricing strategy.

Such a strategy has made legitimate software prohibitively expensive for the region's poor. Several governments have taken steps to reduce their dependence on  Microsoft software.

Last August, China imposed a policy directing all government ministries to buy only locally-produced software until 2010. Chinese software developer Kingsoft once had a 90 per cent share of the market with its Chinese word processing tool but has lost virtually all of that share to  Microsoft Word since the early 1990s.

Thailand looked at the Linux alternative when it launched a programme last year to install one million budget PCs to low-income households in the country. Gartner Group estimates that 40 per cent of PCs shipped in Thailand in the second half of last year were loaded with licensed copies of Windows.

But Microsoft is also quick to react to market conditions. Faced with the prospect of one million desktops operating Linux in Thailand, the company dropped the price of the Thai edition of its software.

And when the Malaysian government announced a similar initiative early this month under its "One Home, One PC" programme,  Microsoft was aboard from the onset, providing a scaled-down, Malay version of Windows.

"We respect the role of governments to ensure fair trade and  competition in their marketplaces. We have in the past and we will continue to work co-operatively with them as they carry out their duties," said Tom Robertson,  Microsoft's Tokyo-based director for government affairs in Asia.

Being a dominant global player,  Microsoft finds it hard to escape the anticompetition radar. And it was expected to fight vigorously against the EC ruling out of fear the decision made in Europe would set a precedent that could affect the company's prospects in other parts of the world, Gartner's Dion Wiggins said.
"At this point, I do not think the EC ruling has any effect in Asia," he said.

"But we have to look at the bigger picture. If the EU is successful in what they are trying to do, the ramifications will be global."

HD        Underlining the dominance of Windows  - DECISION ON MICROSOFT. BY        By DANIEL DOMBEY

The virtual monopoly of  Microsoft's Windows operating system guarantees much of the software company's success in other markets.

This is the picture painted in the  European Commission's 300-page decision against the company, the landmark ruling that imposed a Euros 497m (Dollars 604m)  fine and ordered a change of behaviour. A recent version has been seen by the FT.

TD
The document also offers glimpses of  Microsoft's point of view. These include the arguments that the
Commission's concerns are greatly exaggerated, if not downright misconceived.

The text draws on a wide range of sources, including internal e-mails from the mid-1990s to correspondence between the Commission and the company in January and February this year. The Commission hopes this approach will cover every angle when the decision is brought to court this summer. Microsoft is likely to argue it is inconsistent and, in places, outdated.

The Commission's central case is that  Microsoft has leveraged its Windows monopoly into the markets for media player programs and for server systems that perform "the core everyday services required by client PC users".

It makes references to the alleged drawbacks of early  Microsoft products in the two markets, where the company has since taken the lead. And it quotes the company's own submissions to argue that even today the products are not the most highly rated available.

This implies that  Microsoft owes its success in the two markets to its "abuse" of competition law. So, the Commission demands that  Microsoft offer PC manufacturers a version of Windows without its own Media Player and share interface information with rivals such as Sun Microsystems, the original complainant.

Microsoft contests both the argument and the proposed remedies. "The inter-operability information requested by Sun constitutes valuable intellectual property protected by copyright, trade secret law and patents,"  Microsoft argued in 2003.

According to the Commission text: "Since the relevant specifications are not available for scrutiny it is not possible for the Commission to determine to what extent  Microsoft's claims relating to various intellectual property rights are justified."
Instead, the Commission talks of "the balancing of intellectual property rights and inter-operability".

In October 2003,  Microsoft presented a study by Mercer, the management consultant, that argued that factors other than inter-operability accounted for more than 90 per cent of purchases in the relevant market. But the Commission says that "does not explain the . .. expand ing lead that  Microsoft enjoys" - especially because Microsoft does not have the highest rated product.

Page 147 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company also argued that: "Requiring  Microsoft to create specifications for Windows client and server operating systems that do not exist and then to license those specifications to competitors would .
.. facilitate the cloning of  Microsoft's operating system."

The Commission replied that rivals would still labour under a disadvantage. Since  Microsoft controls the relevant specifications and there would be an unavoidable time lag before competitors could replicate them, they would have to provide "additional value . .. if they want such products to be commercially viable".

In the media player case the Commission says that, in  Microsoft's own submission, its rival RealNetworks' media player came top in eight reviews out of 15, while Media Player came first only twice.

The internet's top search engine has built an enviably strong brand. But can it cope with  competition from Microsoft? Walking into the office of a business school professor the other day, I was startled to discover quite how much he knew about me. "I Googled you," he replied.

Of course he did: that is how a lot of clued-in people find their information these days. Google, the internet search engine that started six years ago in a back room of Stanford University, has ballooned into a global phenomenon, voted best-loved brand in an Interbrand survey. It is in that select list of brands that enter the language as a synonym for their product, such as Hoover, Xerox and Portakabin.

TD
Google handles more than 200m queries a day. It is the world's top search engine, boasting an estimated
50 per cent share in December 2003 of internet search referrals worldwide, according to StatMarket.
(This includes searches via the likes of AOL, which uses Google, as well as Google's own-branded
websites.) If a rumoured flotation goes ahead this year, it may value the company as high as Dollars
15bn (Pounds 8.3bn), recalling the heady days of the dotcom boom.

Unlike the dotcom start-up or indeed conventional businesses, Google has built a worldwide customer base without a marketing budget of any size. Its only advertising has run in trade publications and direct to corporate marketing departments.

Cindy McCaffrey is nominally vice-president for marketing, but her job bears little resemblance to most marketing posts. As a privately-owned company, Google jealously guards all its financial data. So it is difficult to know what the company's revenues are, though analysts' estimates converge on about Dollars
1bn a year. (SEC rules, however, mean that because it has reached a certain size, it will have to make some filings later this spring, though it could float on the stock market first.)
The marketing budget, McCaffrey indicates, is a tiny fraction of revenues. She will agree only that it is
"less than 5 per cent", though her readiness suggests it might be much less.

"We do not need it," she explains. The money that in other companies would go on publicity in Google pours straight into research and technical development instead, she says. "Our focus is totally on the product."
Google was not always so dead against advertising spend. "We rang lots of advertising agencies (in
1999), but none of them returned our calls," says McCaffrey. Had they not been too busy with a bunch of
other dotcoms, now mainly folded, those agencies might have cashed in on an astonishing
money-spinning machine. And the Google story might have been very different.

As it was, Google fell back on its own resources. The company grew by word of mouth, spreading from academic circles to techie users to internet journalists to the wider world. When McCaffrey joined in 1999, she was handed a thick file of press clippings. Though the company had no PR budget, journalists had begun to use the engine for their researches, and then wrote articles praising the technology, thus garnering more users for the site.

Page 149 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Google's founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, quickly identified three requirements for their search engine. It had to rank sites to be of most relevance to the user; it had to be fast; it had to be easy to use.

"It's about purity," says McCaffrey. Purity of intent, in eschewing the model of other search engines where companies pay to be listed in the results thrown up by the search engine. Purity of design, which means there is no advertising on the Google site, just a box for users to type in their search terms and a large Google logo. And purity of purpose, in a single-minded focus on technology and the service to the user to the exclusion of all else. Google resisted the urge to become an all-purpose portal in the manner of Yahoo, MSN and AOL.

After a few years when Google's main business model was licensing its technology to other companies, the company tried a different tack. The bulk of its revenues in future will come from its paid listings service. These services allow advertisers to have their sites displayed in a clearly demarcated box at the top of the screen if a word or phrase they have bought from Google is typed in by the user. Though Google sells keywords to advertisers, it corrals their sites into a corner of the screen, allowing the rest of the sites which have not paid to take centre stage.

Advertisers have flocked to the model because it gives them instant leads, and because most people now use search engines to find their way round the internet, rather than relying on portals. Companies such as Overture and Espotting led this market, but Google has caught up fast. US Bancorp Piper Jaffray estimates the market will be worth Dollars 7bn by 2007. Such growth forecasts led Yahoo to buy
Overture last year and Inktomi, a search technology specialist. Yahoo has begun rolling out its own
search technology to rival Google's. The potential riches also caught  Microsoft's eye; the company plans
to launch its first internet search engine, though it declines to say when.
How will Google cope with this new  competition? McCaffrey says: "We can't predict what will happen,
but we will continue to invest in our technology and maintain focus. We have five-and-a-half-years' lead in
search technology. We haven't been standing still."

The company will also rely heavily on its brand. This might be its best strategy, according to Jez Frampton, chief executive of Interbrand in the UK: "Google has fulfilled the first requisite of a great brand: providing products that people really want and keeping the promises made to people. They have maintained a consistent identity and been unswerving in their focus. There may be other search engines that are faster or more accurate, but Google has the trust."

In this way, the company has built up a strong relationship with consumers. Although its appeal would seem to be mainly functional, users can develop emotional ties. McCaffrey cites the story of a man who regularly sends in pictures of his dog, Ben. When Ben fell sick, the vet was flummoxed. Its owner fed the symptoms into Google, bringing up a page on Lyme's disease. This turned out to be the dog's ailment, and it was treated. The owner has been sending updates on Ben's health ever since. In Google's offices sits a noticeboard overflowing with similar stories.

Frampton says Google also taps something more commonplace: laziness. "Unless someone comes up with another search engine of interstellar proportions, people get only marginal benefits from going to the competition. Who cares if the competitor is .001 seconds faster? People are used to Google."

Yet for all its brand equity, Google remains vulnerable.  Microsoft retains a huge advantage in that it owns the operating system and the browser through which people access the internet. If it were to build its search engine into its existing products, for instance through a desktop icon on Windows or a button on its browser, that might be enough to make lazy users switch. The company also has huge marketing might to back up any bundling strategy.

Robin Kellett, UK search manager at  Microsoft, refuses to answer whether the company would bundle search with its existing products. Bundling is a hot issue, given the  European Commission's recent E497m (Pounds 334m)  fine of the software group.  Microsoft has smashed enough past competitors, from Word Perfect and Novell to Netscape. Google chiefs probably do not need reminding: several are ex- Netscapers.

Even if bundling does not happen, the biggest risk is probably the launch of a technically superior rival. Remember AltaVista? It was once market leader, too. As George Colony, chief of Forrester Research, observes: "There are no walls protecting Google's position. What was the search engine you used before Google? How long did it take you to switch to Google? Seconds. How long will it take to switch out of Google? Seconds."

Selected editorial excerpts from the Japanese press:
U.S. SOFTWARE GIANT MUST ACCEPT FAIR  COMPETITION (IHT/Asahi as translated from the
Japanese-language Asahi Shimbun's editorial published March 29)

TD
The European Commission has ordered U.S. software giant  Microsoft Corp. to pay a huge
65-billion-yen fine for violating the European Union  antitrust law by stifling fair  competition.

The EU antitrust regulators claim the company is improperly bundling its own audiovisual player into the popular Windows operating system, which dominates the market. This practice, the regulators have decided, is virtually robbing consumers of the opportunity to select from a variety of rival audiovisual software products for the Windows system currently on the market.

Microsoft has said it will appeal the ruling to the European Court of Justice. Meanwhile, the U.S. government and Congress have cried foul over the EU decision, raising concern that this could escalate into another trans-Atlantic trade row.

The EU's  antitrust case against Microsoft recalls a similar campaign launched by the U.S. Justice Department, which claimed the software titan was guilty of illegally wrapping its Internet Explorer Web browser into its Windows software. That suit, however, ended in a settlement.

Japan's Fair Trade Commission also raided  Microsoft's Japanese unit in February on suspicion of violating the Anti-monopoly Law. This action was taken over allegations that  Microsoft had
strong-armed Japanese personal computer makers into pledging not to file patent infringement suits against the U.S. company even if its software was similar to the makers' own. This contract was seen by the Japanese authorities as constituting an anti-competitive practice.

One of the reasons for the repeated  antitrust offensives against  Microsoft around the world is obviously its near monopoly on the market for PC operating systems, the basic software on which a computer runs. Much of the blame, however, falls on the company for its aggressive and questionable marketing strategy aimed at dominating the market for important applications as well.

Separate applications are needed to perform such tasks on a computer as drafting documents, sending and receiving e-mail and playing videos.

There are, of course, some consumers who want all these necessary applications packed into the operating system rather than having to buy them one by one. But there are also people who prefer selecting each application according to their preferences. The practice of bundling applications into the operating system is inconsiderate of such consumers.

That's not all. If many applications are bundled together with the dominant operating system, software developers will have little incentive to offer alternatives, thus curbing  competition. As a result, better programs would not be developed and prices of existing applications would tend to rise.

The market for applications will continue to grow along with the spread of personal computers. The court battle with the EU will probably force  Microsoft to change its business model radically in the

coming years. The  antitrust authorities of industrialized countries should keep a close watch on the firm's business practices to ensure fair  competition.

Unfettered  competition on a level playing field has been the principal driving force of technological innovation, especially in the area of information technology.  Microsoft should learn to live with this competitive dynamic of a free market and act in a manner that befits the leading player in the field. (March 30).

The U.S. State Department has quietly expressed its concerns to European regulators about last week's decision to levy harsh penalties and a $613 million  fine on Microsoft.

The quiet protest from the Bush administration comes as concern is growing on Capitol Hill over the  European    Commission's penalties, which came after the Justice Department agreed to a consent decree that includes ongoing federal court oversight of  Microsoft's business practices.

TD
"The State Department has been involved in an
off-the-record attempt to focus their attention" on the
harm the decision could bring about, a U.S. government
official, who has direct knowledge of the concerns
communicated to EU regulators, told CNET News.com
on condition of anonymity. A State Department
representative declined to comment.

U.S. politicians gave at least six speeches over a three-day period last week on the floor of the Senate and House of Representatives, all of which condemned European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's ruling that Microsoft violated antitrust laws and would have to unbundle Media Player from Windows.

The strongest denunciation came from Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who said, "I now fear that the United States and EU are heading toward a new trade war--and that the commission's ruling against  Microsoft is the first shot.

"In imposing this anticonsumer, anti-innovation penalty, the commission has blatantly undercut the settlement that was so carefully and painstakingly crafted with Microsoft by the U.S. Department of Justice and several state  antitrust authorities. The commission's
complete indifference to the negative impact of its ruling on American jobs, American consumers and the U.S. economy, and its total disregard of the Department of Justice, are intolerable."


Page 154 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This is not the first time that the United States and the Europeans have clashed over  antitrust enforcement. Hostilities erupted after the European Union vetoed the proposed General Electric-Honeywell merger, which U.S. regulators had already approved. President Bush publicly criticized the veto, which was widely viewed as a protectionist move designed to help European competitors such as Airbus and Lufthansa at the expense of U.S. companies.

Another point of contention is that U.S. officials sometimes view Europeans as unabashed fans of big government. In November 2001, William Kolasky, deputy assistant attorney general at the time, complained in a speech that the "European Union comes from a more statist tradition that places greater confidence in the utility of governmental intervention in markets."

Ten members of the House International Relations Committee--five Democrats and five Republicans--have written a letter to Monti protesting the sanctions on Microsoft. They claimed the decision violated the spirit of a 1991 "comity agreement" the Clinton administration renewed in 1998, which generally says that the United States should take the lead in overseeing U.S. companies.

He grew up a black American in segregated Mississippi and knew first-hand the sting of
government-sanctioned racism -- the separate drinking fountains and restrooms that for most younger
Americans are today only a classroom history lesson. Yet State Sen. Ed Jones also understood that
race-based preferences and favoritism didn't disappear from statute books with the end of the Old South;
they've since lived on under the virtuous guise of affirmative action.

TD
He realized that, for all its good intentions, affirmative action -- those hiring and college admissions programs intended to give minorities a special advantage in the name of "leveling the playing field" --
ended in stigmatizing entire classes. For each black man or Asian woman who landed a job or a seat in law school through the government's new-found altruism, he realized, many others who shared their skin color or gender now also shared the burden of proving they could succeed in their own endeavors without such special assistance.

That's why Jones set about trying to remove this last vestige of government-sanctioned discrimination from state law, introducing legislation in Denver that would bar government agencies and state supported schools from using race as a factor in admissions, hiring and contracting. Last Friday, Jones' bill fell short by one vote, although all but one of his fellow Republicans came through in support of the measure. Not a
single Democrat in the Senate had the courage to vote with Jones. Now, his fight to make public policy truly colorblind will have to be put off until next session.

In spite of the narrow loss, we think Jones deserves credit for having the political and personal courage to challenge the paternalism and condescension of such government quotas, as well as the interest groups and individuals who reflexively defend them and attack any who question them -- reserving special vitriol for those skeptics who happen to be black. Jones spoke openly of how affirmative action demeaned the very people it purported to help. And as some of his fellow lawmakers squirmed in discomfort at such talk,
attempting to wave him off with assurances that affirmative action was needed to combat persistent racism, Jones pointed out that the policy in fact reinforced racism.

"We do not deny that racism and discrimination exist," Jones said in Senate debate Friday. "But we do not stop racism with more discrimination." That straightforward wisdom was lost not only on those who sincerely believe that inequity somehow can lead to equity but also, we suspect, on many others who simply would rather leave well enough alone.

It's easy enough to see how, in the heady days of the civil rights movement decades ago, elected officials might stumble into such flawed attempts to make things right. What's a lot harder to fathom is how this approach, which constitutes government- sanctioned reverse discrimination, could still sustain such rabid support in the 21st century.

Our prediction -- and hope -- is that this debate stands to become moot in another generation. Eventually, young Americans of all races will look at characteristics such as skin color as we now look at hair color or freckles -- a cosmetic curiosity, nothing more. We trust that reasonable Americans on both sides of this issue long for that day. We just wish more Americans could understand, as Jones does, that policies such as affirmative action today have become an unnecessary and counterproductive detour.

Microsoft bashing, European-style

Despite the settlement in 2001 of the U.S.  antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., the European Union is continuing the attack on the software firm. In the U.S. case, Microsoft was allowed to continue
Page 156 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"bundling," or combining new software into its Windows operating system. But in the ruling released last week, the  European Commission "not only declared the software company an abusive monopolist, but levied penalties designed to prevent similar abuses in the future," according to The New York Times.

"The ruling orders  Microsoft to sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers of personal computers," according to the report. "One version must remove  Microsoft's audio-video playing software, called Media Player. The ruling ordered the company to produce the alternate version within 90 days." Microsoft, which is appealing the decision, was  fined 497 million euros (about $613 million).

This is the computer equivalent of ordering automakers to sell cars without transmissions, which then could be bought from another company. The ruling also forces the company to divulge previously proprietary information about the way Windows works, in order to allow rivals the chance of making software suitable for Windows users. Companies spend billions of dollars on research and development. To mandate that they open their discoveries to the world would decrease their incentive to invest in new products in the future.

Robert Levy, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, said the lawsuit in Europe, as with the federal lawsuit in the United States, was instigated by  Microsoft's American rivals, especially Sun Microsystems. "The EU ruling sends the following message," he said: " 'If you don't make it in the marketplace, go to the federal government. If that doesn't work, go to the state governments, then the Europeans, then to Japan."

The Clinton administration should continue to be blamed for starting the  antitrust roller coaster moving in the first place against  Microsoft in 1998. The EU action might never have happened without the U.S. precedent. And the EU action now could potentially hurt any American company that does well in the international marketplace.

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) challenged European regulators' resistance to its hostile takeover of PeopleSoft Inc. (PSFT), raising the spectre that the regulators' nemesis  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) could eventually conquer its market if the merger is blocked.

TD
But antitrust officials, who recently ruled  Microsoft was abusing a monopoly to gain an edge in new businesses, were more concerned about Oracle's reach in a closed-door hearing Wednesday.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

Regulators in both the U.S. and the European Union object to Oracle's $9.4 billion bid to enhance its position in the market for back-office software for governments and large corporations. Europe is due to make its decision in the case by May 11, a month before the Justice Department's suit goes to trial in the U.S., so the European decision could effectively preempt the U.S. court case.

Regulators argue that the deal would undermine  competition in a market with only three full-service players, including SAP AG (SAP) of Germany, the market leader. The elimination of one player in the market could hurt innovation and drive up prices, they say. Both the Justice Department and the European Commission have signaled their intention to block the deal.

Oracle isn't giving up, though, and is using a two-day hearing with European regulators here to defend its view. The company argues that adding PeopleSoft would leave it far short of dominant in the market, because it would trail SAP around the world and by an especially large margin in Europe. The company also argues regulators should take into account several other players who make some
software and serve part of the market, though not the largest clients. Among them is  Microsoft, which made acquisitions in the last four years to gain a foothold in the market and plans its own products.

Oracle, PeopleSoft and the  European Commission, the chief  antitrust authority in the European Union, declined to comment on the content of Wednesday's hearing. But people familiar with the situation said Oracle found little sympathy for its view that  Microsoft presented a credible threat to a two-firm dominance of the market.

"Microsoft is interested in this market but is finding it extremely difficult to penetrate it," said one person familiar with European regulators' thinking. "It's not in the same league."

The hearings come a week after the commission found  Microsoft guilty of violating European antitrust law and ordered the Redmond, Wash.-based company to pay a record  fine of EUR497.2 million and change the way it does business.  Microsoft said it plans to appeal, a process that could take up to five years.

Analysts say  Microsoft is unlikely to threaten Oracle, SAP or PeopleSoft anytime soon in the market for big-ticket software for human resources planning, customer relationship management and financial management.

"Microsoft doesn't currently have the technical scalability or functionality to address large enterprise financial and human-resource application needs," says Paul Hamerman, vice president for enterprise software at Forrester Research Inc. "They're developing a new generation of software, but that's at least three years out and they don't intend to focus on the large enterprise market," he said.

Most big companies - including  Microsoft - don't use  Microsoft software for the kinds of tasks in which SAP, Oracle and PeopleSoft specialize. A spokesman confirmed that  Microsoft uses SAP software "for specific applications and instances" in which its own software doesn't make the grade.

HD         Oracle Tries To Save PeopleSoft  Takeover At EU Hearing

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Oracle Corp. (ORCL) Wednesday battled in a closed-door hearing to keep
European regulators from rejecting its $9.4 billion hostile bid for PeopleSoft Inc. (PSFT).

The U.S. Department of Justice already moved to block the deal last month and European regulators seem poised to follow suit. Sources close to the case say the European review is still important, both because of its timing and because it could set a precedent for future consolidation in the business software market.

TD
Both E.U. and company officials declined to comment on the proceeding, which is expected to wrap up
Thursday. The procedure is only advisory and won't result in a verdict like a court case.
"The hearing isn't definitive. It just gives each side some idea of how much wiggle room they have to
get the deal through," says Mark Powell, an  antitrust lawyer at White & Case in Brussels. The firm isn't
involved in the case. "Once its done, each side can look if they need to put something on the table"
such as divestments or sell-offs.

The timing is important. A U.S. veto must be approved by a court and hearings on the case aren't scheduled until June, with no verdict expected before July.
By contrast, European regulators are scheduled to rule by May 11. The deadline could be extended for
a couple of days by either party, Powell said, but the decision should come long before the U.S. verdict.

So far, the case hasn't provoked the kind of transatlantic tensions seen in other high-profile cases. The E.U.'s decision to  fine Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) EUR497 million and demand that it change its business model earlier this month provoked an outcry in Washington. And when General Electric Co.'s (GE) tried to takeover Honeywell Inc. (HON), the U.S. approved the deal, while the Europeans blocked it.

This time, both regulatory authorities seem skeptical about Oracle's overtures towards PeopleSoft. They fear it will reduce the number of major competitors in human resources and financial software from
three to two.

"The combination of two of the largest competitors in the market merits further analysis," the European Union Commission said in a statement last November. It said the deal would leave SAP AG (SAP.XE) of Germany as Oracle's only competitor in some business software markets.

PeopleSoft agrees with this analysis. It has rejected Oracle's offers, saying it believes they undervalue the company and because the tie-up would never receive regulatory approval.

Oracle contests both allegations. It says both PeopleSoft and regulators are weighing the wrong market. Instead of the narrow financial and human resources software supplied to large companies, worth only about $150 million, it says the probe should focus on the entire $10 billion business software market. It says many serious competitors plan to enter the market, including  Microsoft.

In Europe regulators will have to be careful before blocking a merger simply because it reduces the number of "key players" in a field from three to two. They must prove that this narrowing of  competition would lead to higher prices and encourage cartel-like behavior.

In 2002, the European Court of First Instance overturned a decision blocking Britain's My Travel Group (formerly Airtours) from merging with First Choice. Regulators argued there, too, that the merger would have restricted  competition by reducing the number of major British travel agencies from four to three. My Travel subsequently went bankrupt and its administrators are suing the  European Commission for almost EUR1 billion in damages.

"If the argument is just going from three to two competitors, the Commission must be careful," warns one source close to Oracle. Beyond the fate of PeopleSoft deal, the company fears a negative decision would enshrine market definitions that set a precedent which would not allow consolidation of the business software market.

MONTREAL
MONTREAL - Last week, Europe's  competition czar, Mario Monti, slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a  fine
of unprecedented size, along with the toughest set of regulatory demands the company has yet seen.

TD
Europe's determination, in marked contrast to the Bush administration's surrender to the world's most powerful software company three years ago, could mark a watershed in the long, failed battle by anti-trust authorities to curb  Microsoft.

It's the first time in years that consumers have some reason to believe that competition might eventually break out in the market for personal computer applications. Monti has ruled that Microsoft must never again use the practice of bundling computer applications to squash competition, as it did in the case of Internet browsers and, more recently, media players.

But nothing will happen soon. The coming months will see the struggle shift from the  European                Commission's competition enforcers to the courts and, perhaps more ominously, to the U.S. political arena, where Microsoft enjoys considerable support, and where pressure could be put on Europe
through the threat of trade retaliation.
In an indication of the Bush administration's sympathies, even the ostensibly apolitical assistant
attorney-general in charge of the U.S. Justice Department's anti-trust division is concerned for  Microsoft,
saying that "sound anti-trust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition, even by 'dominant'
companies."

How amusing. Microsoft's assault on  competition and innovation was the basis for the Justice Department's own anti-trust case against the company, a case that petered out when the U.S. government finally settled for empty promises that  Microsoft's behaviour would change.

However it is instructive to look at how  Microsoft manages to pose as a source of innovation even as most outside analysts find that it is actually a powerful obstacle to innovation and  competition.

Although its Windows operating system began as an inconspicuous layer of software that merely transmitted instructions to the computer from individual add-on applications like word-processing programs or Internet browsers, it is now much more.

Today, Windows includes a number of applications that consumers once would have had to buy and load separately.  Microsoft portrays this as a major benefit to Windows users. Many accept this claim. And if these applications were free and they were the best applications available, this would be true. But neither is the case.

Page 164 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The applications are bundled together with Windows at a price that makes  Microsoft one of the most profitable companies in the world. If the applications are "free," then Windows must be grossly overpriced.

And the bundling practice enables  Microsoft to control what applications consumers will buy, since they must go to considerable work to add an independent firm's application on top of the ones they have already been forced to buy from  Microsoft.

Here's an analogy. If you owned the only grocery store in a town 50 miles away from any  competition, you might decide to start throwing in a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter with every litre of milk. The bread and peanut butter would be free, but the milk would cost $10.

And with no  competition, you might decide to boost profitability by offering only your own brands of bread and peanut butter. Customers would be welcome to buy other brands, but they'd have to drive 50 miles
for them, and they'd still be forced to take your brands if they wanted a convenient source of milk.

If you were like  Microsoft, you might even claim to be a big booster of "innovation" because you added a couple of brands of peanut butter and bread to those already on the market.

This would be one heck of a profitable grocery store, just as  Microsoft is one heck of a profitable technology company.

A comparison by Bloomberg News found  Microsoft's profit margin was a fabulous 31 cents on every dollar of sales, twice as high as that of SAP, the world's biggest maker of business software, and more than three times as high as that of IBM, the world's biggest computer maker.
That gives  Microsoft plenty of money, and plenty of incentive, to fight this battle to the bitter end.

A new anti-cartel law comes into force on April 1 which grants the Swiss  Competition Commission (Comco) the power to impose direct sanctions, including  fines equivalent to up to ten percent of a firm's turnover.

"The effect will be felt immediately. It's serious and companies must understand that it is serious," Comco head Walter Stoffel told AFP.

Until now, the  competition framework in Switzerland -- which is not an EU member -- has been heavily criticised for being weak and allowing price-fixing cartels or monopolies to thrive behind-the-scenes in the country without being effectively challenged.

The Swiss authority had the ability to investigate abusive practices, and to declare them illicit under the existing 1995 law.

But officials said the framework did little to discourage market distortions because they could only seek sanctions in a second procedure.
"That was too cumbersome and it never happened," Stoffel said.
The Swiss authority had ruled out action against  Microsoft even though the US giant was challenged by
US and EU  competition authorities for abusing its dominant position on the software.

"We didn't open an investigation because we knew we couldn't have done much except state that its behaviour was illicit," Stoffel said.

"And by the time we did so, everything would have changed, there would have been a new operating system, software, on the market and we would just have been too late," he added.

Microsoft faced anti-trust action in the United States in 2001, while the  European Commission last week imposed a record 497 million euro (613 million dollar)  fine on the company and changes to its Windows operating system.

Computing takes a closer look at the  European Commission's ruling on Microsoft's trade practices.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti last week told  Microsoft to pay a fine of nearly half a billion euros for its anti-competitive behaviour in Europe.

TD
The amount is more symbolic than punitive - it may be the biggest the Commission has ever issued, but the software giant has more than $50bn (Â£27.6bn) of loose change in its corporate pocket.
The significance of the guilty verdict lies in Monti's determination to set a precedent that will force
Microsoft to change the way it sells its products.

What does the ruling mean for Bill Gates and his colleagues? And more importantly, what are the implications for users?
Why has the Commission been investigating  Microsoft?

Following complaints from some of  Microsoft's rivals, the Commission looked into two areas of Redmond's business - the bundling of Windows Media Player and the interoperability of Windows-based PCs with competitors' server products.

The question Monti spent four years trying to answer was whether  Microsoft was unfairly leveraging its dominant position in PC operating systems to stifle  competition in related markets.
What does the Commission want  Microsoft to do? The ruling stipulated two punitive measures:
- The company must offer a separate version of Windows without Media Player, for a lower price. The
Commission believes this will stimulate  competition in the market for PC home entertainment software

- Microsoft must license parts of its source code to rivals to allow their server software to interoperate with Windows PCs as well as Windows own server products do.  Microsoft will be allowed to impose a
'reasonable' charge for such a licence.
So what?

Microsoft's business model is based on two fundamental principles - the ability to develop new functions for Windows to enhance its capability and value for money, and rigorous protection of its source code, which is guarded as strictly as Coca-Cola's secret recipe. The ruling calls on  Microsoft to change both of these practices.

The significance of Monti's decision is not the slap on the wrist for past behaviour, but the precedent it sets.
Monti wants the unbundling of Media Player to become normal practice for additional software.


Page 168 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Whenever Microsoft develops functions that rival suppliers offer - or may offer - it will have to sell them separately from the core operating system.

Monti is trying to treat Windows as a utility product - since practically all PCs are sold with Windows as standard, he wants to create and protect a distinct market for software that runs on Windows PCs.
And he wants  Microsoft to compete on an equal footing in that market.

It's a little like the way BT is regulated in the UK to treat its telephone network infrastructure as a separate entity from the services it sells on that network.
Hasn't  Microsoft already been judged in the US?
The ruling goes much further than the final US judgement - at least until further legal battles take place. Some US politicians believe it is wrong of the Commission to pass judgement on a company that has
already been judged in its home country.
What is Microsoft's response?

Microsoft tried to reach a last-minute settlement that would have seen rival media software bundled into Windows.

But Monti turned down the offer because it was focused only on one product sector, and would not set a precedent.

Chief executive Steve Ballmer claims that all  Microsoft wants to do is to offer more features for customers and that the ruling will ultimately harm IT buyers.

Microsoft says it will appeal - a process that could take up to seven years, according to legal experts.

It will first try to convince the courts that the measures imposed by the Commission should not become effective until the end of the appeals process. If this claim is successful,  Microsoft will not have to change any of its practices for years.
What does this mean for  Microsoft's customers?
The Commission hopes that the ruling will lead to greater  competition, which will drive down prices.

Microsoft's critics say it will ensure wider choice and prevent a repeat of the actions that saw
Netscape crushed by Internet Explorer in the web browser market in the 1990s.

For business customers, rivals such as Sun Microsystems or Linux providers may be able to develop products that integrate more closely with Windows PCs, giving IT directors more choice of server suppliers. Some experts say there is already plenty of  competition in this market.
For PC users, the ruling could accelerate the downward spiral in prices.

But it may also create greater complexity - instead of buying a PC with all the necessary functions included, users will have to choose which additional software they wish to buy, and select a product and supplier.
Will it make any difference?

Many experts think not. 'Even if the ruling comes into force, it would be unlikely to have a material effect on  Microsoft's business,' says Neil Ward-Dutton, principal analyst at Ovum.
'Should  Microsoft be treated as a utility and regulated as such?' he asks.

'This would be completely unmanageable, and  Microsoft would be justified in complaining of undue and unbalanced interference in its business. Why?
Because much of what  Microsoft does continues to be innovative and to deliver value to customers.' Gartner analyst David Mitchell Smith says: 'The ruling will have little impact on customers or PC
manufacturers ... The inability to come to a legal, fair and effective ruling is no surprise. It's easy to
declare Microsoft guilty of holding or abusing a monopoly, but it's hard to determine remedies.'
Critics of the ruling point out that, even if enforced, it does not affect  Microsoft's business in non-PC
platforms, such as PDAs and smartphones.
Page 169 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Also, Microsoft has struck deals with content providers such as Disney to adopt the Windows Media
Player format, which would compel users to select the  Microsoft product.
And the Commission has said it will only enforce the decision within the EU - so customers in the US or
Far East will still be sold fully-bundled versions of Windows.
What happens next?

Microsoft will make its appeal. Many observers expect that the courts will grant a stay of execution on the punitive measures, so customers will see no difference in the short term.

If both parties are determined to see the case through, it will be years before a final decision is reached.
Monti appears to want to make an example of  Microsoft - but he is expected to retire soon.

Microsoft still has the right to negotiate an out-of-court settlement, and it is feasible - perhaps even likely - that once the initial posturing on both sides has subsided, a compromise will be reached.
Does anybody win from all this?
The Commission believes customers will ultimately benefit.  Microsoft believes they will be harmed. Some of Microsoft's rivals will be rubbing their hands with glee to see Redmond dragged through the
mud again, whether the ruling is upheld or not.
And the lawyers will be checking out the price of a new private jet. SEE ALSO

HD             Comment - Commission fails to level playing  field. BY              By Jaap Favier, research director at Forrester Research.

European anti-trust ruling will have little effect on  Microsoft's market dominance, says Jaap Favier.

The European Commission was clear in its judgement that  Microsoft had broken anti-trust laws - but will the ruling make any difference?

TD
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti reminded us of  Microsoft's dominance, with 95 per cent of the PC operating system market, and said it should have supplied connectivity information to third parties.
He also accused Microsoft of 'tieing' - effectively forcing consumers to buy Windows Media Player
(WMP).

The fine of EUR497m (Â£335m) to the EU, the equivalent of EUR4 (Â£2.70) per online PC in Europe, looks huge.

But with a war chest of $51bn (Â£28.3bn), Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer - who will appeal - won't be losing any sleep over the  fine.
But how will this affect  Microsoft's market position?

Original equipment manufacturers can now offer preinstalled alternatives to WMP - HP is doing this with iTunes.

Apple and Real Networks will be on manufacturers' doorsteps to offer QuickTime and RealPlayer respectively.

This could hurt  Microsoft as consumers start to turn their home PCs into entertainment centres that play music downloads and video clips.
But Microsoft need not worry too much.
Regardless of the strides made by RealPlayer, QuickTime and DivX, content companies - including
Disney and Napster - have already committed to MS DRM and WMP.
If the EC had given its ruling two years ago, the likes of Apple and Real would have had a chance. Now it is too late - especially as an appeal will give  Microsoft the opportunity to buy another few
years of undisturbed WMP sales.

Consumers will continue to vote with their browser by (unknowingly) downloading WMP with their first bit of licensed content - just as happened with Explorer a few years ago.
If the ruling doesn't change the dominance of WMP, why did the Commission bother? He also stated that he wanted to set 'principles for future conduct'. There's the rub.


Page 171 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This ruling is really about Longhorn -  Microsoft's next major consumer operating system, scheduled for release in 2006.

Rather than trying to correct  Microsoft for the same offences through a meticulous but slow process in 2008, the Commission is launching a pre-emptive strike.

Monti wants Microsoft to develop two versions of Longhorn: a standard one shrink-wrapped with all the Microsoft bells and whistles, and a bare-boned version that other vendors can dress up.

This measure would create the level playing field that the EC is looking for, to give consumers a real choice of applications such as browsers, streamers and even spreadsheets.
But will the playing field be level? Forrester believes not.

First, platoons of experienced programmers will be working together in Redmond to create the integrated pack, while tens of scattered vendors will be struggling to decipher  Microsoft's integration manual.
Guess who will be first to market, with the best integrated package?

Second, consumers don't care -  Microsoft has a 71 per cent brand recognition among Europeans, and 27 per cent trust the brand.

These consumers will have to choose between a full-blown package from their trusted supplier, or a patchwork of products from unknown and distrusted vendors. Tough choice.

The pre-emptive strike won't work either. As long as the PC maintains its position as the generic utility for work, communication and fun,  Microsoft will maintain its dominance.

Only when these functions are spread across devices such as mobiles and set top boxes (forget intelligent fridges), will other vendors get a chance.

The eventual contenders will be Sony and Symbian - and they'll be moving in fast. Monti's pre-emptive strike might even be unnecessary.
And the European consumer? Well, we'll have saved ourselves EUR497m in European taxes. What do you think? If you have an opinion about issues raised in Computing, email us at

HD     EU - Competition Rules: Microsoft ordered to mend its ways

In the highest-profile antitrust case since it vetoed the GE-Honeywell merger three years ago, the European Commission last week brought to a climax its five-year investigation of Microsoft by slapping a record â¬497m (US$613m)  fine and imposing tough sanctions on the US software giant for abuse of its dominant position in personal computer operating systems. But  Microsoft immediately confirmed that it would appeal to the EUâs Court of First Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg, which could take up to another five years to hand down its ruling.

TD
According to the Commission,  Microsoft violated the EU competition rules âby deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft work group servers, and by tying its Windows Media Player (WMP), a product where it faced competition, with its ubiquitous Windows operating systemâ. To restore a level playing field, it ordered Microsoft to disclose âcomplete and accurate interface documentationâ to manufacturers of rival servers, and to offer PC manufacturers a version of Windows without WMP bundled in.  Microsoft will be entitled to charge a âreasonable remunerationâ for any
interface information that is protected by intellectual property rights, and must refrain from any tactics that would make the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing.

For both sides, the heavy  fine -- which represents less than 2% of  Microsoftâs global turnover and 8% of its sales in Europe -- is less important than the âremediesâ, forcing it to change its business practices in Europe, and the setting of a precedent on which possible future cases could be based. (Following Microsoftâs bundling of a web browser and later a media player into Windows, the next expected addition is an Internet search engine.) As the Commission put it: âMicrosoftâs tying of WMP is an example of a more general business model which, given  Microsoftâs virtual monopoly in PC operating systems, deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take interest in and tie with Windows in the future.â

The company maintained that the settlement it had offered a week before the ruling would have been âa much better solution for consumers and for the software industryâ. However, EU commissioner Mario Monti said the settlement that he had been seeking âwould set clear principles concerning the future conduct of  Microsoft, to avoid going back to these sort of abuses. We had to realise that they were not prepared to do this.â

But Microsoftâs decision to launch a court appeal -- and to seek an injunction suspending the remedies imposed on it in the meantime -- has raised doubts as to whether the Commissionâs decision will have the intended effect. Said Brad Smith, the US firmâs general counsel: âThe  European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word.â If the CFI does grant an injunction, by the time that last word has been heard it could be too late to prevent  Microsoft once again leveraging its dominance into new technologies at the expense of more innovative rivals.

HD           Buying  outside  the Microsoft box.
BY            By ALVIN PANG FOR THE STRAITS TIMES.

LP
LAST week, Microsoft was handed another red card for its monopolistic practices, this time by the European Union's antitrust authority. In its ruling against  Microsoft, the European Commission imposed a US$613 million (S$1.04 billion) fine and demanded that certain software components be unbundled from its flagship Windows product. Microsoft was also compelled to divulge part of its Windows source code in order to allow competitors to develop software more compatible with Windows-based computers.

In the near term, the ruling is unlikely to have a significant effect, either on the software giant's fortunes or those of the IT industry as a whole.  Microsoft, with a decade of experience in fending off US federal regulators, has already launched a legal appeal against the EU ruling that could bog the case down for years.

TD
Given the speed of technological development relative to the glacial pace of the legal process, any punitive measures specific to current software standards would be obsolete by the time a final settlement is reached.

Pundits have pointed out that the ruling could raise the cost of computing for European businesses and consumers, if users have to separately purchase software once bundled into their Windows systems. And the fine - pocket change for  Microsoft - is at any rate likely to end up in further purchases of Microsoft's ubiquitous products, as part of the EU's IT spending.

There is little to suggest that the EU, accounting for only 20 per cent of  Microsoft's global market, could reverse the software giant's market domination. But the case is indicative of the growing institutional discontent worldwide over  Microsoft products, particularly in the wake of serious security vulnerabilities exposed by online attacks in recent months.

Still,  competition in the long term cannot be generated through legislation; it must arise from alternatives with superior value propositions.

The motivation and the means now exist. The pervasiveness of the Internet - which was not so ubiquitous when  Microsoft first conquered the IT industry in the 80s and 90s - demands that different computers around the world work with one another seamlessly. This 'interoperability' principle means that users now have far more viable options in meeting common IT needs without tying themselves down to one platform or vendor.

The Internet has also fuelled the rise of the 'open source' movement, where industry-strength software is co-developed and released publicly by an open community of users rather than licensed from proprietary patent owners like  Microsoft.
Many open source products (which include the Linux operating system that powers much of the
Internet) have gained converts among mainstream government and business users worldwide.
The decisive battleground could be Asia's emerging markets. In most of the region,  Microsoft flexes
its monopolistic muscle unchallenged, enjoying strong bastions of support in, for instance, Singapore's
government-led IT sector, and helping to drive the early years of the IT boom in India.


Page 175 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Yet Microsoft's sales penetration into the region has been dampened by rampant software piracy. Ironically, its efforts to curb piracy also slow down the adoption of its software as the de facto standard in emerging economies.

Burgeoning markets like China - eagerly courted with technical and financial sweeteners by the technology giant - have also been coy to its advances, leaning instead towards home-grown solutions such as RedFlag Linux and RedOffice (a free alternative to  Microsoft Office).

At present, these immature Asian software offerings are unlikely to displace  Microsoft's flagship products. But a more confident China and India, harnessing their growing technological know-how and massive domestic market, may well have the wherewithal to drive widespread adoption of alternative technologies within their expanding spheres of influence.

Several factors are at play: the cost-effectiveness of home-grown or open source solutions for cash-strapped start-ups in developing economies; superior support for local languages and administrative practices; even a nascent nationalistic instinct.

Singapore has benefited as a preferential partner and regional base for Microsoft over the years. As a relatively small if spunky player, it can hardly afford to buck the current Microsoft hegemony over the global IT industry on its own.

Still, there is no need for our allegiances to be so absolute. With its advanced infrastructure, business expertise and tech-savvy population, Singapore is an ideal hotbed for contributing to and testing open source technologies, particularly those with a view to servicing the Asian market.

The Asian Enterprise Open Source Conference held here in October last year, sponsored by IDA (Infocomm Development Authority) and EDB (Economic Development Board), was a quiet nod in this direction.

Most government agencies still shy away from employing open source or other non-conventional solutions - even those with a sound track record in the market. But certain sectors have a history of buying outside the box. The creative industries have long been investing in the Apple Macintosh platform. The IT industry is conversant with Open Source software such as Linux, Php and MySQL - arcane-sounding options, no doubt, but costing tens or even hundreds of times less than proprietary equivalents.

Small and medium-sized enterprises stand to gain most by considering IT alternatives that may give them a bigger leg up per dollar without compromising their business needs.

As the comfort level with their use rises in mainstream business, companies should prioritise business needs and costs over big-brand software in their IT investments. The market can then speak for itself, perhaps opening a window of opportunity for Singapore to spot and shape an Asian successor to take on the American giant from Redmond.
The writer works in the communication, design and IT sectors.

From: Anne Owers, HM Inspectorate of Prisons, Ashley House, Monck Street London.

FURTHER to the article "Jail staff hit back at inspection report" (Yorkshire Post, March 26), treating all prisoners with decency and respect isn't just my agenda.

TD
It's part of the Prison Service's own aims, posted up in every prison in the country: and both the current and past director-general have made it an absolute commitment. It's my job to check this in every prison I inspect, just as my predecessors did.

I've inspected all the high security prisons, like Wakefield, that hold the most serious and high-risk offenders. All of them are, and need to be, secure and controlled places (and we also check that); but they also need to treat prisoners properly and professionally. Our inspections have shown that other
high-security prisons have achieved this balance.

You mention the prisoners' survey. First, we did in fact survey all elderly prisoners. Two-thirds of them said they felt unsafe and half said that they were victimised by staff.

Secondly, we check the survey with what we see for ourselves and hear from prisoners while we are in the prison; and Wakefield was noticeably different from other high security prisons, holding equally serious offenders.

You are right to point out that these prisons hold some dangerous men, some too dangerous ever to be released. A handful, like Robert Mawdsley, have to be held in especially secure close-supervision centres and we do not inspect those along with the prison, because they are quite different and, of course, more controlled. But the great majority of Wakefield's prisoners will come out eventually; and it must be the job of prisons to work with them to change their behaviour and reduce the risk of offending again.
If they don't do this, we are all less safe. In the wrong
From: Barrie Frost, Watson's Lane, Reighton, Filey.

IN THE Strangeways prison riots of 1989, a protesting inmate standing on the roof of the prison carried a banner proclaiming "Treat us with respect". He was a convicted rapist. Nevertheless, the taxpayer had to pick up the bill for the damage caused by the riots of many hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The protesters' message, however, apparently did not go unheard.

It seems Anne Owers, chief inspector of prisons, was very receptive to its message, for not only rapists but heinous murderers, child killers and those whose behaviour is even beyond minds that have become accustomed to unbelievable evil, are not receiving the respect they deserve.

The facilities of modern prisons do not deter criminals, prison overcrowding confirms this to everyone with a modicum of common sense but, now, however, Anne Owers tells us that those whose violent and perverse behaviour caused unbelievable sickening grief are not receiving sufficient respect from prison authorities.

The normal, well-adjusted huge majority of British people cannot possibly understand how a person with the ability of Anne Owers can obtain the high position she has and make such ill-conceived comments.

This is exacerbated when they realise they are compelled through their taxes to pay her salary and expenses.

NOT only have we buffoons running the BBC, as proven during the Hutton and Kilroy sagas, but also it would appear they are also running the prison service.

The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, complains that not enough respect is shown toward prisoners and convicts. How much respect did murderers Sutcliffe, Nilsson, Black, Whitely, Huntley, and the rest of these animals, including rapists, muggers and child abusers, show to their
victims?

Anne Owers, obviously another do-gooder living in an ivory tower, deserves to be locked away with these people she thinks so much about.
EU action gave consumers a better deal
From: Richard Corbett, Labour MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, Blenheim Terrace, Leeds. THE recent decision by the  European Commission to put a stop to  Microsoft's anti-competitive
behaviour is an example of where we in Europe can achieve far more together than individual countries
could ever achieve alone.
An EU investigation found that  Microsoft had abused its dominant market position, stifling  competition
and innovation, and deliberately skewed the market to the detriment of its rivals.

So now, as well as handing down the largest  fine in EU anti-trust history, the Commission has demanded "more transparent Windows". This means that the corporation will have to disclose parts of its code to competitors - a move that will bring down software prices, and improve both quality and choice for consumers.

It's no coincidence that anti-trust law suits in the US have been pursued against  Microsoft for years with very little effect. And, indeed, individual European countries would have been equally powerless to take on the might of one of the world's biggest corporations. But by pooling our resources in the EU, we have been able to take action and this ruling will make a real difference to consumers everywhere. Perhaps the Eurosceptic isolationists would like to explain how we could have achieved this without the EU's legal
co-operative framework?
Fallen idols
From: Les Brotherton, Caroline Street, Saltaire, Shipley.

WHY is it the media think we readily accept the opinions of people whose comments exceed their intelligence? Who of us listens to Vanessa Feltz? Who is influenced by the banal Davina McCall? With his track record of perpetual failure under Margaret Thatcher, who has confidence in Michael Howard? Reading, or listening to Norman Tebbit, or Bernard Ingham, on economics, is an insult to our intelligence.

Bernard Ingham, a gamekeeper Tory, reviles Chancellor Gordon Brown while upholding Margaret Thatcher's 11 years of iron rule, which saw two failed Chancellors, two major recessions, divisions within society not seen for decades and the destruction of large parts of British industry. I despair seeing the regular appearance on TV of George Best, Britain's resident drunk. I refuse to watch Richard Whiteley, a joke when working on Calendar. David Jason now appears to be trying to emulate the 80-year-old Jack Warner (PC Dixon), while ex-EastEnders appear increasingly in a series of incongruous roles.
Finally, I note that once again TV producers are increasingly finding roles for second-rate Australian actors
(Casualty, The Bill etc), while talented British actors are resting.
Smoking toll

From: David Reed, campaign director, Yorkshire ASH, Royd Farm, Long Tongue Scrog Lane, Houses Hill, Huddersfield.

SHEENA Hastings makes a well-timed plea (March 30) that the protection just given to Irish workers against the carcinogens in tobacco smoke pollution should also be given to British workers. How right she is.
In one important and horrifying way she is, unfortunately, wrong. The number of people killed by smoking in
UK is not 13 per day as she claims. The true figure is 13 people per hour - 300 per day.

This scale of human misery is obviously so vast that even she cannot believe it. There would be huge controversy if the rail industry killed even three people per day. But when the tobacco industry kills 300 people per day we mostly seem to accept it - until it happens to one of our loved ones.
BBC bigotry
From: William Snowdon, Butterbowl Gardens, Cow Close, Leeds.

MICHAEL Crick epitomises all that is rank and rotten within the BBC: presumptuous, arrogant and unctuously hypocritical. Mr Crick, through the auspices of the BBC, accused Iain Duncan-Smith of misappropriating public funds by allegedly paying Betsy Duncan-Smith for secretarial work that she had not carried out. After a long and formal investigation, however, the charges have been found to be groundless.

Was Mr Crick suitably chastened? Was he contrite? Did he apologise? Oh no, not he! He had the effrontery to declare, in a very self-righteous manner, that Mr Duncan-Smith had brought it all upon himself by not
co-operating with Mr Crick's investigation. In Mr Crick's warped sense of natural justice, Iain Duncan-Smith was deemed guilty until proven innocent.

It is shameful that a public corporation, founded by Royal Charter and funded by compulsory licence fee, should indulge in such political bigotry.
True picture
From: Coun Anthony Wallis, Weetworth Avenue, Castleford.

AS A parent, school governor and local councillor I am disappointed with your front page story of March 27 ("Labour's failing generation").

Even if the one local survey quoted is typical it does show that the majority of young people are well-behaved and leading healthy lifestyles.
Adults find the anti-social behaviour of some youths an irritant and occasionally frightening.

Most young people, who are just developing their coping skills, encounter this behaviour more often and find it extremely intimidating.
These decent youths need help rather than being stereotyped with the minority troublemakers. As for blame, most people put this on parents rather than the Government.
There is a growing view that television, films and advertising should also take a lot of the blame. These media seem quick to show casual sex and excessive drinking but shy away from portraying their unsocial consequences.
Plea to prevent Mansion changes
From: MJ Keene, Davies Avenue, Roundhay, Leeds.

I WRITE to you regarding the sheer vandalism of Leeds City Council in relation to the two planning applications to change the use of The Mansion, in the city's Roundhay Park, to an information centre and offices. I ask for your assistance to call a halt to these applications until some proper consultation has taken place.

This facility has been the venue for tens of thousands of people in Leeds and surrounding areas for all manner of functions for many decades.

There is a fast-growing anger in almost everyone I speak to that the council has ridden roughshod over the views of the people of Leeds. The whole sorry events have taken place in the utmost secrecy.
I feel that the council's plans should have a far wider audience and hope that you may provide this.

It is most important that any objections to these plans are received by the chief planning officer in Leeds before April 7.
Doctors still in the dark over earnings in new contract
From: Dr Paul Charlson, Westfield Park, Brough, Nr Hull.

THERE has been considerable coverage of the lack of NHS dentists in parts of Yorkshire. The problem is not confined to dentists. General Practitioners are in short supply and recruitment in the inner cities is now impossible.

Today, a new contract for GPs comes into force which has been negotiated over the past two years. As I write this, with less than one week to go, doctors are still uncertain what they will be earning. To make matters worse some Primary Care Trusts are expecting practices to provide some services free of charge until they can take them over. Other neighbouring trusts are funding the same services.
Practices do not want to withdraw services but many feel that they have been pushed to the limit by the
Government and are forced to take this action.

The problems with the contract, the inconsistency of payments and the Government's attitude will further affect recruitment of GPs.
The situation we have seen in Scarborough recently with NHS dentists may soon by happening with GP
practices locally.
Scottish lesson as costs spiral
From: Robert Collinson, Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Keighley, Keighley and Ilkley
Conservative Association, Churchill House, North Street,
Keighley.

THE Fraser Inquiry into the spiralling costs of the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood has been told that more than 15,000 design changes have been made to the scheme since the project began in 1999 and that the cost of all the delays, disruption and wasted time caused by mismanagement has amounted to the "wrong end of Â£100m".

The original cost of Holyrood was supposed to be Â£40m. The cost now exceeds Â£400m - a tenfold increase.
The Â£100m wasted by mismanagement bought not a single brick nor toilet roll, not a flooring tile nor a light bulb.
Other extravagances include the installation of a refrigerated mini-bar in every MSP's office costing
Â£22,300.
The Scottish Parliament building should have been a monument to devolution.

Instead, it has become a symbol of waste and vanity, political incompetence and contempt for the taxpayers of Britain.

No doubt we can expect more of the same if the Government succeeds in pushing through its plans to set up a regional assembly for Yorkshire.
Points
Archbishop right on TV criticism
From: Doreen Whitaker, Godfrey Road, Halifax.

I support the right of the Archbishop of Canterbury to speak out against the TV series Footballers' Wives. I have never watched it but have a pretty good idea of what it's about from excerpts on TV and comments in Radio Times magazine.

Television producers are pushing the boundaries all the time. I have often seen letters from people complaining of unsuitable programme content before the 9pm watershed.
But are their complaints heeded? I think not.
People grumble when the Church doesn't speak out and yet - as in this instant - complain when it does. I think the Archbishop was right to say what he did and
I hope we shall hear him again.
I am glad he is a man who is not afraid to speak his mind.

Lessons from the ancients
From: WD Jordan, New Street, Rawfolds, Cleckheaton.

LOOKING through some old papers I was intrigued to find this quotation from Caius Petronius, AD66: "We trained hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganised.

"I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganising, and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralisation." I wonder if any of our political leaders, from the Prime Minister downwards, may find these ancient writings valuable?
Does anybody care about Sven?
John Watson, Littlecroft, Hutton Hill, Leyburn.

WHAT a state we are in. With all that is going on in this turbulent world of ours, a substantial part of the main evening news on Saturday was taken up with the fact that our national football coach was thinking of signing up with a Premier league club. Does anybody care? I don't.
Linked?
From: Jeremy Kilner, Choppards Mill, Holmfirth.

IS IT not ironic that in the same week that the minimum earnings level for teenagers was increased, pub licensing hours were extended?

Lipponen on the horizon

The starting gun in the race to be the next  European Commission president has been fired and out of the gate lumbers Paavo Lipponen, Finland's bear-like ex-premier.

TD
Lipponen, 62, is speaker of the Finnish parliament but has not hidden his ambition to succeed Romano
Prodi.

Though aides deny he's campaigning for the post, he is criss-crossing Europe building support and delivering lectures about his vision for Europe (he wants a horizontal Commission, not a vertical one).

Thursday found him in London for talks with prime minister Tony Blair and he is off to Sweden, Brussels and Strasbourg in the next few weeks.

Lipponen has lots of the right credentials: he's a former premier (the idea of a technocrat appears to have gone out of favour), favours a stronger Commission, and is keen on engaging with Russia and modernising the EU.

While in the rotating presidency he oversaw the launch of the Tampere process on immigration/asylum/justice co-ordination and threw open the doors to enlargement at the Helsinki summit.
One drawback: he's a social democrat, so might not get rightwing backing. "I'm an optimist," he says. Even if horse-trading costs him the top job, he could end up as economic co-ordinator or new-style
president of the council of ministers.
Fuming Juncker

Luxembourg premier Jean-Claude Juncker is warning that he will be "in a very bad mood" at this weekend's meeting of finance ministers in Ireland - and, for once, it is not because of any complaint from colleagues about the Grand Duchy's privileged tax status.

Instead, what really bothers the chain-smoking Juncker is having to deal with Ireland's new smoking ban. Clutching his packet of Ducal, he promised: "I will do everything possible to appear in Irish papers with a cigarette in my mouth."

Defying the ban on lighting up in pubs and restaurants has already cost one politician his job. Irish opposition MP John Deasy was stripped of his post as  Fine Gael justice spokesman after puffing in the members' bar at the Dublin parliament.
So is Juncker playing with fire? Fortunately, as he disavows all ambition to become the next
Commission president, he has no need for Irish support.
Day at the races

Irish finance minister Charlie McCreevy's chosen venue for the finance ministers' gathering - a new E15m equestrian centre at Punchestown racecourse in county Kildare - has brought fierce attack from colleagues in the Irish parliament.

Page 182 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A report from the cross-party public accounts committee found the cost of the centre had not been properly evaluated. One deputy quipped that almost the only event last year was Santa's Kingdom, a sleigh and reindeer extravaganza replete with fake snow that attracted families at Christmas.

It is McCreevy who will be playing Santa this week, at least as far as the Kildare Hunt, owner of the centre, is concerned. The state is paying E60,000 to stage the session.
Fund of talent

So who will get the nod from Europe's finance ministers on Saturday to be their official candidate to run the International Monetary Fund?
The shortlist is the kind that might prompt Americans to wonder whether to end the tradition that the
Europeans always head the IMF, while they get to run the World Bank.

Jean Lemierre is highly regarded, but DC hawks will surely notice that the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is French.

Rodrigo Rato, Spain's outgoing finance minister, is still fancied by some smaller countries, but the latest name to enter the fray will really set alarm bells ringing in Washington.

"Mario Monti has all the necessary requirements," opines Rocco Buttiglione, Italy's Europe minister. "It would be prestigious for Italy."

Would that be the Mario Monti who infuriated the US by blocking the GE/Honeywell merger in 2001 and who last month imposed a record  fine on Microsoft for abuse of market power?
Monod tone

Though invisible throughout the latest electoral debacle of the French right and this week's cabinet reshuffle, one man has been ever-present - Jerome Monod. As President Jacques Chirac's personal adviser, the 74-year-old former boss of Lyonnais des Eaux has helped orchestrate the game of musical chairs.

Monod, a contemporary of Chirac, has a special office in a garden wing of the Elysee and is regarded as the one person in the presidential entourage willing to contradict the head of state.

However, his idea to recruit steelman Francis Mer as finance minister in 2002 was no big success. Monod's advice also seems increasingly defensive.

Like Chirac, he is intent on ring-fencing the ambitions of Nicholas Sarkozy, now moved from the interior to finance. Hence most of the portfolios in the new government of premier Jean-Pierre Raffarin have gone to faithful Chiraquiens.

Monod mutters about retirement and is setting up a think-tank for the French right. But Chirac is reluctant to lose his eminence grise.
After Schumacher

For a week now, the sudden departure of Ulrich Schumacher, the flamboyant and occasionally provocative chief executive of chipmaker Infineon, has been a puzzle. He is remembered for turning up to its stock market launch in a Porsche and racing gear and, another time, threatening to move the Munich-based group to Switzerland.

What went against Schumacher at last week's supervisory board meeting? German eyes were on Max Dietrich Kley, the former BASF finance chief who has stepped in as interim leader at Infineon, to shed light: Kley was due to give a speech in Frankfurt on Thursday and is known for making the odd provocative comment himself.
Alas, he didn't get there, blaming traffic delays. Perhaps Kley needs a Porsche. observer@ft.com

HD         Oracle Challenges  EU on PeopleSoft  --- Regulators' Resistance  To Takeover Raises Concerns
About Microsoft Rivalry
BY         By Brandon Mitchener

LP
BRUSSELS -- Oracle Corp. challenged European regulators' resistance to its hostile takeover of PeopleSoft Inc., raising the specter that the authorities' nemesis,  Microsoft Corp., could conquer Oracle's market if the merger is blocked.

But antitrust officials, who recently ruled  Microsoft was abusing a monopoly to gain an edge in new businesses, were more concerned about Oracle's reach, in a closed-door hearing yesterday.

TD
Regulators in the U.S. and the European Union object to Oracle's $9.4 billion bid to enhance its position in the market for back-office software for governments and large corporations. Europe is due to make its decision in the case by May 11, a month before the U.S. Justice Department's suit challenging the deal
is scheduled for trial, so the European decision could effectively pre-empt the U.S. court case.
Regulators argue that the deal would undermine  competition in a market that has only three
full-service players, including SAP AG of Germany, the market leader. The elimination of one player in
the market could hurt innovation and drive up prices, they say. Both the U.S. Justice Department and
the European Commission have signaled their intention to block the deal.

Oracle isn't giving up, though, and is using a two-day hearing with European regulators here to defend its view. The company argues that adding PeopleSoft would leave it far short of dominant in the market, because it would trail SAP around the world and by an especially large margin in Europe. The company also argues that regulators should take into account several other players who make software and
serve part of the market, though not the largest clients. Among them is  Microsoft, which made acquisitions in the last four years to gain a foothold in the market.

Oracle, PeopleSoft and the  European Commission, the chief  antitrust authority in the EU, declined to comment on yesterday's hearing. But people familiar with the situation said Oracle found little sympathy for its view that  Microsoft presented a credible threat.

"Microsoft is interested in this market but is finding it extremely difficult to penetrate it," said one person familiar with European regulators' thinking. "It's not in the same league."

The hearings come a week after the commission found Microsoft guilty of violating European  antitrust law and ordered the Redmond, Wash., company to pay a record fine of 497.2 million euros ($605.2 million) and change the way it does business.  Microsoft has said it plans to appeal, a process that could take up to five years.

Analysts say  Microsoft is unlikely to threaten Oracle, SAP or PeopleSoft anytime soon in the market for big-ticket software for human-resources planning, customer-relationship management and financial management. "Microsoft doesn't currently have the technical scalability or functionality to address
large-enterprise financial and human-resource application needs," said Paul Hamerman, vice president for enterprise software at Forrester Research Inc. "They're developing a new generation of software, but that's at least three years out and they don't intend to focus on the large-enterprise market," he said.

Most big companies -- including  Microsoft -- don't use  Microsoft software for the kinds of tasks in which SAP, Oracle and PeopleSoft specialize. A spokesman confirmed that  Microsoft uses SAP software "for specific applications and instances" in which its own software doesn't make the grade.

It's been more than a decade since the first anti-trust allegations were leveled against  Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash. While most of these cases have now become footnotes in the annals of corporate America, the European Union (EU) pledges to continue its pursuit against the software giant.

In a meeting held in Brussels last month,  competition experts from 15 EU states unanimously decided to support the  European Commission's decision to bring charges that the company broke anti-trust laws with respect to how it bundled its multimedia software, Media Player. The Commission alleges that Microsoft unfairly packaged Media Player into Windows OS, leaving PC manufacturers and consumers with limited options. The report issued by the member states calls for a Media Player-free Windows OS to be offered to manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.

TD
For its part, Tom Bookes,  Microsoft spokesman, says that the company was still working to find a settlement with the Commission.

The European Commission, the EU's top  antitrust authority, was expected to impose a record $613 million fine at the end of March and tough sanctions against the company for imposing its market power in servers and multimedia software.

Why George W. Bush takes orders from Pascal Lamy.

TD
Pascal Lamy, the European Union Trade Commissioner, is a 57-year-old Frenchman, a graduate of Paris' elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and a longtime member of the French Socialist Party. he smokes cheroots, works tirelessly on behalf of France and Europe, and his aggressive-some would say
ruthless-personal style has earned him the nickname "Exocet," after a French-built missile. He is not exactly George W Bush's or Tom DeLay's kind of guy.

In late February, Lamy paid a visit to Washington to meet with senior members of Congress and delivered an audacious demand: If Congress did not eliminate a large tax break for American exporters by March 1, the European Union would slap $4 billion in retaliatory trade sanctions against the United States. When it comes to taxes, President Bush hasn't been swayed by angry Democrats, a burgeoning federal deficit, worried economists, a stagnant job market, or moderates of his own party. But faced with Lamy's threat,
he caved. A few days after the Exocet's visit, the president called upon Congress to quickly bring America's tax code in line with the EU. Commissioner's demands. House Speaker Dennis Hastert summed up his reaction to the pressured legislative changes at an earlier news conference: "My gut feeling about this is we fought a revolution 230 years ago to stop Europeans from telling us how we have
to tax in this country, and it puts the hair up on the back of my neck that we have to consider this at all. But we have to do it."

Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg has popularized the phrase "cheese-eating surrender monkeys" to deride the French, but on one economic issue after another, it has been the United States that has raised the white flag. In December 2003, the Bush administration lifted tariffs on imported steel after Lamy threatened $2 billion in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, targeting especially those produced in critical election states, such as oranges from Florida. Early this year, the administration had to back away from its unilateral demand for armed sky marshals on flights from Europe after strong resistance from EU. member states.

Increasingly, decisions made in Washington are being overturned by bureaucrats in Brussels. Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger of U.S.-based G.E. and Honeywell, only to
watch the E.U.'s  competition commissioner effectively block the deal. The EU. claimed jurisdiction because the combined business sold more than $225 million annually in Europe. The trustbusters argued that if the businesses combined, the new company would potentially dominate some sectors of the global aerospace industry, which would have hurt European competitors. Now the  European Commission is at it again. In late March, it was expected to levy a  fine and require Microsoft to do something that the U.S. government couldn't, or wouldn't: force the company to change its dominant Windows operating system. Where the United States ultimately failed to get  Microsoft to give its customers equal access to
non-Microsoft browser software, the European Union reportedly wants a version of Windows that gives customers access to competitors of the company's Media Player software.

The war in Iraq taught a clear lesson: Unilateral foreign policy, especially one that ignores Europe, doesn't work. In the run-up to the invasion, the Bush administration gambled that it could isolate France and Germany and garner the support of the rest of the UN. Security Council. Instead, "Old Europe" won the support of most of the other members, and America found itself fighting a bloody guerrilla war in Iraq largely alone. The same lesson now increasingly applies in the economic realm. More than previous administrations, the Bush White House has tried to make economic policy unilaterally, as if the only

powers it need worry about are American opinion polls and Beltway trade groups. Yet from trade to taxation,  antitrust to safety rules, the Europeans are proving to be powerful competitors who can work against our interests if we ignore theirs.

This simple truth has yet to fully sink in for many in Washington. But it will soon enough. Next month, the European Union will expand from 15 to 25 member nations, to create an entity that encompasses 450 million people. That's half again the size of the United States, and bigger even than the North American free trade zone. In all of human history, it has rarely been the case that a smaller state could get away for long with telling a larger state what to do, given similar levels of technological development. Indeed, it has usually been the other way around. Which is why, more and more, the power barons of Washington are going to have to leave their comfortable K Street steakhouses and learn the murky, frustrating, rule-bound ways of a certain dull city on the Senne River in Belgium.
Brussels scouts
No one claims that Brussels is among the most stunning of European capitals. The weather is bleak
year-round, and the neighborhood where the European Union is headquartered is a soulless collection of
modern office buildings. The city boasts only a few quaint old squares. Down the block from the most
impressive, the Grand Place, is the underwhelming, if not downright odd, symbol of the city: a tiny
fountain-statue of a little boy, all of a foot high, urinating. Residents enjoy dressing the statue in hundreds
of different costumes. If the boy's garb can be seen as representing the various nationalities in the Union,
his actions might symbolize the way in which the Union is increasingly able to treat the United States.

Last January, for instance, the European Union shut down efforts by Homeland security secretary Tom Ridge to negotiate with individual European countries to station U.S. Customs agents in their ports to better inspect cargo containers bound for America. The problem wasn't with Ridge's request per se, he was told, but with the way he was negotiating: bilaterally, country-by-country. If he wanted permission, sniffed the European Union, he would have to go through Brussels (which he did, eventually getting what he wanted).

The failure of many in Washington to understand that the rules of America's relationship with Europe have changed is a source of frustration to U.S. officials whose task it is to maintain that relationship. U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Rockwell Schnabel, notes that it has often been difficult to convince Washington powerbrokers to pay attention to the European Union instead of the bilateral relationships they had known for decades. "Some days you get the feeling that maybe we are fighting battles but the people back [in Washington] don't fully understand the battles that we're fighting," observes Schnabel, sitting in
his office of the cramped, overcrowded building that houses the U.S. Mission to the European Union. There are signs that some administration officials get it. On the day I visited him, the ambassador had the pleasure of hosting the chairman of the securities and Exchange Commission, William Donaldson. Such visits, said Schnabel, almost never happened until recently. Yet Schnabel's organization itself symbolizes the inertia of Washington's long indifference to Brussels. The U.S. mission employs a staff of 95 to manage relations with an entity (the European Union) of several hundred million people. Next door is the U.S. embassy to Belgium, which employs a staff of 440 to manage relations with a country of 10.3 million.

It's said that if you want to know which celebrities are most popular, follow the paparazzi. Similarly, if you want to know which capitals are the most powerful, follow the lawyers. By that measure, Brussels' day has arrived: More and more American attorneys are packing up and moving there. "You ignore it at your
clients' peril," warns Bill Baer, of the Washington-based law firm Arnold & Porter, which opened its Brussels offices in September. Because he now spends a week there each month, Baer has rented an apartment near Luxembourg Square. Among other interests, Arnold & Porter represents GE, which suffered the previously mentioned Honeywell debacle, and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer, whose $60 billion acquisition of Pharmacia was approved last year by the commission.

It's not just fear that leads American companies to deploy their lawyers and lobbyists to Brussels, but opportunity. Under the Bush administration, Washington has taken a much more laissez-faire attitude towards corporate mergers than Europe. So U.S. firms that want to block mergers of their competitors turn to Brussels in search of more favorable rulings- just as smart defense lawyers "forum shop" for the most sympathetic judges. Sun Microsystems, for instance, sent its lobbyists to Brussels to urge the European Union to look at the "bundling" practices of its competitor  Microsoft, while Disney fought the AOL-Time Warner merger before the European Union, helping to scuttle Time Warner's plan to combine its music business with record company EMI in the process.

"Every company of a certain size has a Washington representative. Increasingly the same is true of Brussels," says Raymond S. Calamaro, partner at Hogan & Hartson LLP in Washington, who travels to Brussels to work on trade and  competition matters. In meetings with E.U. officials, he recommends modifications to proposed laws and regulations on behalf of his clients, in areas ranging from agriculture to financial services. His experience shows some of the surprising curve balls of transAtlantic regulation.

Page 189 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Calamaro had to lobby the commission over its mad-cow regulations not on behalf of cattle ranchers but for medical-device manufacturers, because their devices included bovine collagen and consequently fell under the food regulations.

Despite the significance of the work being done in Brussels, the city has yet to exert an allure equal to its importance in the eyes of Washington's heaviest hitters. Part of this is the entrenched bilateral mindset-the idea that the important action happens between nations. Even among foreign-service officers, an
economic affairs slot in Brussels is still considered less prestigious than a political or national security assignment almost anywhere, especially in such attractive cities as London or Paris. Part of it is also the allure of bigger, more exciting cities; Brussels is to Paris what Albany is to New York City. One
London-based lobbyist I spoke to says she tries to avoid even staying overnight when she has to go to Brussels. Other visitors joked that its biggest advantage was its proximity to Paris. It's hard to blame them. Beau Phillips of Chlopak, Leonarcl, Schechter & Associates, a Washington, D.C., public-relations agency, was in town last fall on behalf of a technology trade association for meetings on the  Microsoft case. he explained the dreary impression that many Americans have of the city: "You will often see little more than the inside of a drab government building, the inside of your hotel room, the inside of the law or lobbying firm conference room you are working from, and the view from the taxi between the three."

Still, the lawyers keep coming. Every week, says Bill Drozdiak, executive director of the nonprofit German Marshall Fund's Transatlantic Center in Brussels, he receives a fresh invitation to a grand opening of some firm's new branch. "Sidley Austin Brown & Wood invite you to the opening of their new Brussels office," he reads aloud from an invitation lying on his desk. After a moment thinking, he adds, "There are more American lawyers now in Brussels than any other capital in Europe."
Payback time

If the European Union has only recently been able to exert power over Washington, it has been quietly accumulating the strength to do so for years. The union began in 1950 as an effort by Germany and France to pool management of their respective coal and steel industries. By the 1980s it had grown into a Common Market for goods and services encompassing more than 12 nations. After the Berlin Wall fell in
1989, Europeans could focus less on threats from the east and even more on their own integration. Under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the nations of Europe committed themselves to giving up one bit of sovereignty after another, with authority over everything from tariffs to environmental regulations to fiscal and monetary policy migrating to the European Union.

This pooling of authority in a single entity is the first big reason why the European Union has become an economic counterweight to the United States. The second is that the United States was fast becoming more dependent on the European market. Trade in goods between the United States and the EU. has doubled from $187 billion in 1990 to $392 billion in 2003, a sum exceeded only by U.S. trade with its NAFTA neighbors. But when the economic activities of U.S. subsidiaries incorporated in EU countries are counted, Europe is by far our biggest commercial partner. For instance, during the 1990s, U.S. firms invested nearly twice as much in the Netherlands, $65.7 billion, as in Mexico, $34.1 billion, according to the Center for Transatlantic Relations.

A third lever of power came the European Union's way in 1995, when the international community created the World Trade Organization, of which the European Union and the United States are members. The
WTO provides an independent forum to adjudicate trade disputes, and its rulings give the winners the right to impose fines and other sanctions on the losers. The European Union has been aggressive in charging the United States with trade violations, and equally aggressive turning WTO decisions to its advantage as Pascal Lamy's threats of sanctions over steel tariffs and tax breaks show.

The European Union gained a fourth means of influence in 1999, when most of its member states began the process (completed in 2002) of abandoning their national currencies in favor of a common one, the euro. By tying the fates of European economies more closely together, the common currency encouraged member states to present a much more united front on key economic issues than was the case before. "Boy, has it strengthened their hands on things like trade; they're much more willing to act together," said Barry Bosworth, an international economist at the Brookings Institution. Although the new currency showed signs of weakness after its debut, it is arguably now poised to make a run at the greenback's status as the world's premier reserve currency. The European Union now has its own Alan Greenspan, Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank based in Frankfurt. Though he's even less of a household name in Washington than Pascal Lamy, a strongly worded statement from Trichet can cause drastic shifts in the dollar-euro exchange rate-making, for instance, American exports more or less competitive on world markets.
The Bush administration inadvertently handed the European Union a fifth source of power with its
my-way-or-the-highway foreign policy. From invading Iraq to pulling out of the Kyoto climate change treaty,
Bush's decisions have so inflamed European public opinion that European Union officials feel obliged to

Page 190 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
take a much tougher line with America on economic issues than they might have otherwise. Some in Washington, for instance, had hoped the European Union would postpone sanctioning the United States over its export tax breaks, but thanks to Iraq, that didn't happen. "Political leaders now have an interest in standing up to us," notes Brookings Institution senior fellow Philip Gordon, former director of European affairs in the Clinton White House. Adds Gordon: "There's a bit of payback there."

Of course, it's not as if Washington never wins battles with Brussels. A few years ago, for instance, the United States hammered Europe with $200 million in WTO-approved trade sanctions until the continent dropped its barriers to importing bananas from United States-owned firms. And after the European Union vetoed the proposed merger between GE and Honey-well, the Bush administration's  antitrust officials worked with Brussels to bring Europe's  competition laws more in line with those in the United States.
But in one component of power, the ability to absorb punishment, Europe seems to have an edge. While
Washington abandoned its steel tariffs in the face of costly sanctions from Brussels, Europe has been
will-ingly paying over $100 million annually in WTOsanctioned penalties rather than give in to U.S.
demands to import hormone-treated American beef. What explains Europe's tough hide? Partly it's that the
bureaucrats who run the commission are unelected, insulating them from some of the demands placed on
representatives who have to face voters every few years. Europeans are also more will-ing to pay a little
extra to keep their food pure, and more comfortable allowing their bureaucrats to intervene in the free
market.
Backdoor Kyoto

Last December, attempts by Europe to agree on a common political constitution col-lapsed-a major blow to the dreams of European integra-tionists, but probably a tempo-rary one. For decades, Europe has managed to overcome obstacles to unity. The betting is that closer political union is only a matter of time.

In any event, Europe's clout will certainly grow after the European Union expands next month, for the simple reason that big markets tend to set the rules for everybody. In America, for instance, book publishers tend to bow to the preferences of their biggest customers, which means that schools in small states have to buy textbooks that reflect the conservative or liberal biases of educational commissions in Texas and California. Similarly, American consumers may soon have to get used to buying products tailored to the demands of .Brussels. The European Union, for example, has long forced U.S. automakers to improve their emissions standards for cars sold in the European market. Might they go a step further, and pressure firms like GM and Ford to improve their records worldwide? It's hypothetical, but Europeans would be thrilled if they could pull off a backdoor Kyoto, declaring that, since pol-lution is a global issue, only firms whose vehicle fleets meet worldwide standards could sell in the European market.

Or imagine what would happen if the WTO were to rule that Europe's current ban on genetically modified corn-currently a contentious issue-was permissible. U.S. agribusinesses that sell GM com would not only have to kiss the European market goodbye, but lose access to markets in Africa, Latin America, and Asia as well, says University of Maryland business professor Peter Morici. And farmers won't grow strains of food that the big global manufactures aren't buying.

Privacy is shaping up to be another major battle-ground of the future between U.S. and E.U. regulations. European citizens are much less willing to give up their personal information than Americans. Software companies have learned that tough privacy regulations written to protect E.U. con-sumers often are easiest or cheapest to implement by improving standards for all users around the globe. When  Microsoft struck a deal with the commission last year to improve consumer privacy-giving users more control over where and how their personal data was shared -many of the changes ulti-mately were made for all Microsoft users worldwide.

The degree to which Europe may soon he dictat-ing economic tenus to Amer-ica has not yet dawned on most of official Washington, but it will soon, and it will come as a shock. Why, politi-cians will ask, should the decisions of a hunch of bureaucrats in Hrussels force our companies to raise fuel standards, rewrite food labels, or strengthen software priva-cy protections? Think tanks will host conferences to denounce the high regulatory costs of complying with Europe's standards. Newspaper columnists will demand that
the president show some hackhone and tight for American economic freedom. After much heated rhetoric, it will dawn on Washington that we face a choice: stand forthrightly behind our principles of independence, or sell our products and services abroad. In the end, we will decide that in economics, as in for-eign
affairs, it is more in our interests to work with the Europeans than against them. For a proud and power-ful nation like ours, it will not be easy. But as Dennis Hastert said, we'll just have to do it

The degree to which Europe may soon be dictating economic terms to America has not yet dawned on most of official Washington, but it will soon.

Kulish discusses the relationship between Pascal Lamy, the European Union Trade Commissioner, and Pres George W. Bush. He says that the degree to which Europe may soon be dictating economic terms to America from trade to taxation and from  antitrust to safety rules, has not yet dawned on most of the Washington's officials, but it will soon, and it will come as a shock to the country's interests.

US pressure group Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) has expressed outrage over the European Commission's 'draconian punishment' of  Microsoft for violating  antitrust laws, according to our sister publication Computing. The commission has ordered  Microsoft to unbundle its software and pay a record EUR497m (Â£331m)  fine. 'The decision by the EC will have a global impact of negative consequence,' said Tom Schatz, president of CAGW, in a statement.

'In most international  antitrust cases, courts will rely on precedent if a decision has been made in another jurisdiction. The EC should not be making decisions that are best left to the marketplace. Attempting to restrict the future design of software is unprecedented and has been rejected by the US courts.'

Schatz also warned that forcing  Microsoft to give up intellectual property rights would be a setback for innovation, as sharing information would reduce companies' motivation for designing new products.

SUMMARY

The law provides adequate protection of property and contractual rights, including guarantees against expropriation, but institutions for enforcement are weak. This is especially apparent in commercial law, with judges demonstrating little grasp of new laws. The reform of the judicial system has yet to guarantee the independence of the judiciary, which is compromised by executive interference. The risk of foreign investors being subject to discrimination is low, but public procurement procedures have suffered from a lack of transparency that has benefited domestic companies. The adoption of new public procurement procedures and the introduction of a right of appeal in the award of public contracts will help. The legal framework of  competition policy is almost complete, but enforcement is inadequate. The risk of price
controls being re-imposed is small. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index will continue to fall as the energy sector is deregulated, restructured and privatised in 2004-05.
ANALYSIS
â Red tape is pervasive and a major impediment to business (High risk).

The bureaucracy and the difficulties of dealing with it can vary greatly between regions and sectors, but overall Romania is one of the most difficult countries in the region in which to do business without
resorting to bribery. It can take from 49 to 102 days to register a new company: 83 pages of forms have to be completed (in the US it takes a day and 7 pages). It can take an excessive amount of time to secure
the necessary zoning permits, property titles, licenses and utility connections. Regulations change frequently and without advance notice. These changes can add significantly to costs and make it difficult
to develop effective business plans. The bureaucracy can be a significant burden for foreign investors, but it can be handled by following a few rules of thumb. It is helpful to work with a local Romanian partner to alleviate some of these problems. Investors can also be selective about where they locate: Timisoara in Transylvania has become a favoured location for foreign business and Bucharest has improved under the present City Hall regime. The mayor of Bucharest, Traian Basescu, has opened a one-stop shop for investors in City Hall: previously investors needed 13 permits, collected in person from 13 different offices, to operate in Bucharest.

â Foreign investors are disadvantaged by a lack of transparency in forthcoming major privatisations (High risk).

The state privatisation agency, APAPS, faces thousands of court challenges in disputes arising from previous privatisations. The numbers reflect the ease with which interested parties, including workers and

Page 194 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
managers as well as buyers, can take legal action. More than one hundred of these cases involve serious attempts to cancel privatisation contracts. There have been a number of recent controversial cases of cancelled privatisations involving foreign investors, as well as instances in which the process has been less than transparent. The government is under pressure from the IMF to change its overall attitude towards privatisation, and to avoid imposing conditions to preserve employment or rapidly increase investments in privatised companies. Checking commitments on employment and investment, and suing non-performing firms, has become one of the main activities of the state privatisation agency. Frequent
delays in privatisation deals and changes in the terms of privatisation in other cases, have also heightened concerns about transparency. Although the law guarantees equal treatment to domestic and foreign investors, in practice the lack of transparency of the regulatory system has often worked against
non-locals. Investors should insist that forthcoming sales be handled in a transparent way and in line with international standards.
BACKGROUND
(Background material is updated twice yearly. Last update: March 22nd, 2004) Enforceability of Contracts
Most of the legal framework of a market economy is in place in Romania. However, the institutions to implement or enforce it are either weak or have not yet been established. Romanian law thus affords adequate protection of property and contractual rights, but the legal system is unable to arbitrate effectively property rights and contractual disputes. Foreign companies often express concern about the
lack of international commercial experience of Romanian courts. Judges generally have little experience of the functioning of a market economy, international business methods or the application of new commercial laws. The weakness of the judicial system is particularly apparent with regard to commercial law. Romania's bankruptcy law contains provisions for the liquidation of bankrupt enterprises that are
consistent with Western legal standards, but the lack of qualified personnel hampers the application of
law. Although it is possible to pursue administrative liquidation as an alternative to bankruptcy--thus saving
the company and creditors a lengthy and costly judicial process--the lack of legal personnel means it is
hard to get these cases into court and to obtain consistent judgements.

Other problems reflect the failure to determine who are the legal owners of assets--this is a particular problem with regard to land--and the continued failure to settle property-restitution claims dating from before the communist period. There are a large number of outstanding cases involving property nationalised during the communist period, with Romania having done less to resolve these claims than any other non-Soviet Eastern-bloc country. This undoubtedly causes some uncertainty, but it is of limited concern to foreign investors: since the collapse of the communist regime in 1989 there have no cases of foreign assets being expropriated. The Stimulation of Direct Investment Law includes a guarantee against nationalisation and expropriation of assets, and allows investors to choose the court or arbitration body they want to settle any potential legal action.
Independence of the Judiciary

Romania has made progress in reforming its legal system in recent years, but much remains to be done to improve the independence of the judiciary. The involvement of the executive in judicial affairs continues to be a problem. For example, in March 2001 the Ministry of Justice sent a circular letter to courts asking them to pay attention to the social consequences in cases involving the restitution of nationalised houses. The Ministry of Justice also wields great influence over the Superior Council of Magistracy, which makes decisions about the transfer or removal of judges, as the former appoints one-third of Council members
and the Minister chairs its meetings. During the first half of 2001 a number of court presidents and
vice-presidents were removed from their posts without clear reasons being given. Also, the Constitutional
Courtâs decisions may be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the parliament, which constitutes a serious
infringement of judicial independence.

Measures have been taken by the government to improve the efficiency of the judicial system. A revised version of the Civil Procedure Code came into force in April 2001, aimed at speeding up legal proceedings and improving the enforcement of judicial decisions, with disciplinary action now a possibility where unexplained delays take place. In a separate measure, the government made it necessary for judges to publish a reasoning for all their decisions (previously this was necessary only in cases involving appeals to higher courts).

However, a few of the changes in the Civil Procedure Code have raised concern. The overburdened Supreme Court has been given additional tasks (hearing appeals in commercially significant cases) and the process of simplifying procedures has restricted greatly the right to appeal in certain cases. Also of concern is the extension of the Prosecutor-Generalâs right to introduce extraordinary appeals against judicial decisions. This provision already existed in Romanian law but an Emergency Ordinance extends

Page 195 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the period (from six months to one year) during which extraordinary appeals can be brought; allows extraordinary appeals to be made before all other legal avenues have been exhausted; and makes the right to introduce such appeals more discretionary (they can now be exercised against âobviously ungrounded judicial decisionsâ, an ill-defined criterion). This is a concern as the extension of such extraordinary procedures risks undermining the principle of legal certainty.

The lack of competence of many members of the judiciary and their relatively low status is another concern. Magistrates continue to rank among the best paid public officials, but changes in the wages policy means that this preference is being eroded. Unlike other public employees, magistrates did not receive a wage adjustment in 2001 to compensate for inflation. Low wages make judges susceptible to bribery. Training for judges is improving: the initial training period has been extended to two years with effect from academic year 2001/02 and the training programmes broadened-âbut attention needs to be given to intensifying training in the specific fields of anti-trust and state aid legislation. Preserving the National Institute of Magistracy as the sole entry point for a career as a judge and granting it
self-governing status are important in developing an independent and professional judiciary.

Corruption is a widespread and systemic problem that undermines the legal system, the economy and public confidence in government. A study published by the World Bank in March 2001 found that corruption and bribery have become institutionalised in Romania and Transparency International ranked Romania 69 out of 90 countries in 2001 (with the 90th country being the most corrupt). Frequent changes
in legal regulations and their discretionary interpretation by public officials encourages corruption. The civil service is over-staffed and underpaid and highly susceptible to corruption, with a culture of bribe-taking being pervasive. In a recent survey, 51% of Romanian companies revealed that they frequently had to provide bribes to run their business. Reports on the funding of all political parties have indicated that expenditure (especially election expenditure) is substantially higher than declared revenue. In order to address this potential source of corruption, Romania needs to adopt a fully transparent system of party funding.

Despite a general recognition of the seriousness of the problem, and its negative impact on the business environment, measures to tackle the problem by successive governments have been limited and ineffective. A new law on the prevention and punishment of acts of corruption came into force in May
2000, designed to penalise corrupt behaviour in the private sector that distorts  competition. A special
Anti-Corruption and Organised Crime Unit was set up within the Prosecutor-Generalâs office in October
2000, with the task of leading the fight against corruption. However, it has never functioned due to a lack
of staff and equipment. Secondary legislation detailing institutional arrangements for the anti-corruption
section has not yet been adopted and as a result there has been virtually no progress in implementing the
anti-corruption law. Out of 38 posts for prosecutors, less than half are filled. The division of tasks among
the various bodies involved in tackling corruption remains unclear, and co-ordination among them needs
to be improved. Just about the only positive development in the fight against corruption was the adoption,
in April 2001, of an ordinance introducing public procurement procedures and establishing the right to
appeal against the award of public contracts.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

The foreign investment regime is liberal and foreign companies are subject to little active discrimination. The law commits Romania to equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors, provides protection against nationalisation and expropriation and guarantees the right of foreign investors to repatriate profits. Foreign investors may participate in privatisation bids and there are no limits set on the level of permitted foreign participation in commercial companies.
Although there are no specific restrictions on inward direct investment, the law is ambiguous and
open-ended regarding âsensitiveâ sectors where prior authorisation can be imposed through âspecial laws.â
The constitution forbids the purchase of real estate by non-nationals. However, companies established in
the country, even if wholly foreign-owned, can purchase land for the purposes of business, although they
are prohibited from purchasing agricultural land. In law, domestic and foreign enterprises are treated
equally in terms of public procurement, but in practice bidding procedures have suffered from a lack of
transparency. Sales of state assets to foreigners have often been stymied by vested interests or become
subject to political wrangling within government. The adoption, in April 2001, of an ordinance introducing
public procurement procedures and establishing the right to appeal against the award of public contracts
should alleviate some of these problems.

Following an agreement with the international financial institutions, discretionary incentives for foreign investors were abolished in 1999, but investors were compensated with the introduction of major tax cuts in corporate tax (reduced from 38% to 25%), VAT (reduced to 19% from a standard rate of 22%) and excise duty (revised and still at a lower level than minimum rates in the EU) at the start of 2000. However, several tax initiatives aimed at promoting investment have been introduced, and in July 2001 a law on the promotion of investments came into force. The law covers large-scale investments and grants tax
Page 196 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
exemptions and fiscal facilities for cash greenfield projects that exceed US$1m, and includes other measures to improve the business environment.

As well as the incentives for large investors, Romaniaâs six free-trade zones all offer customs and tax incentives. These include unrestricted entry and re-export of goods, as well as exemption from customs duties and value-added tax. They also include an exemption from profit taxes for the duration of a companyâs operations in free-trade zones. There are also concessions made in âdisadvantaged zonesâ (regions with high unemployment), including full restitution of import duties for depreciable goods; exemption from profit tax; exemption from any fees associated with re-zoning of agricultural land for industrial purposes; and access to a special development fund for stimulating exports, guaranteeing external credits, and financing special programmes and state-sponsored equity investments.

The most significant impediment to foreign investors is Romania's unpredictable legal and regulatory system. Excessive red tape makes any investment unnecessarily time-consuming and costly. There is now a robust framework of  competition law, which forbids price fixing,  abuse of market position and lays
down guidelines for the behaviour of monopolies. However, the lack of regulatory transparency, combined with the lack of transparency in the privatisation of state assets, continues to work against the interests of foreign investors. Some improvement can be expected given that the government is prioritising investment promotion as part of its national industrial strategy, in particular through the simplification of legal and administrative procedures. The authorities have created a new government department for relations with foreign investors, which will act as a one-stop shop for investments above US$10m.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Romania has made great progress in creating a legal framework in the area of  competition policy that is broadly aligned with the EUâs aquis communautaire (the body of EU law). However, the legal framework is still incomplete and enforcement is inadequate.

After more than a decade of transition, the private sector is still under-developed and state enterprises continue to play a major role in many sectors of the economy, such as the utilities, finance and manufacturing. State support for loss-making state enterprises continues to distort the investment environment and prevents the efficient allocation of capital. A new law on state aid came into effect in January 2000, aimed at regulating and controlling the provision of state aid (in the form of direct state subsidies, debt rescheduling and favourable prices). However, implementation of the law has been slow, and the granting of preferential debt rescheduling for state-owned enterprises continues to undermine attempts to create a more competitive business environment. The existing legislation covers the basic principles of state aid control, but the field of application of the law is not comprehensive and numerous state aid measures are not notified to the  competition authorities. The national state aid monitoring authority is the  Competition Office, which operates under the authority of the Ministry of Public Finance. The investigative and decision-making body is the Competition Council, which dealt with 72 state aid cases in 2000, and has broad powers to enforce competition rules. However, the state aid authorities were not consulted systematically on all state aid measures and in some cases their opinions were not observed by the government. Romania needs to adopt the required secondary legislation on state aids (now under preparation) as a precondition for effective enforcement activity. A large number of unaligned state aid schemes remains, such as the profit tax rate of 6% on export earnings and the law on direct investment promotion. Implementation of state aid policy in sensitive areas is still at an early stage.

In the field of anti-trust law, Romaniaâs legislation is largely in line with, and covers most of, the acquis provisions. However, further secondary legislation still needs to be adopted. The enforcement record of the Competition Council has improved. In 2000, the Council Board handled 437 cases, including two prohibition decisions concerning vertical restraints and horizontal co-operation agreements. However, the Council needs to focus its resources more effectively on cases that present the most serious distortion to competition. A more deterrent sanctioning policy is also necessary. General transparency, including improved public access to relevant documents, needs to increase.
Intellectual Property Rights

Romania has enacted legislation protecting patents, trademarks and copyrights, but the unlicensed use of intellectual property--in particular the piracy of compact discs and CD-ROMs--remains a problem due to weak enforcement. Romania fails to provide its border and other authorities sufficient legal authority, resources and tools to combat the widespread piracy of copyrighted works. This inadequate enforcement against copyright piracy led to Romania being placed on the US governmentâs Special 301 Watch List in
2002. The  European Commission has repeatedly criticised Romaniaâs record on safeguarding intellectual property rights, as has the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA).
There has been some improvement in recent years. The video piracy rate, which was once estimated at
100%, has fallen to about 60% due to more vigorous police action and the entry of legitimate businesses

Page 197 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
into the market in 2000. Since the implementation of copyright law, the piracy rate for business software is estimated to have declined from a high of 95% in the early 1990s. According to the Global Piracy Report
of the Business Software Alliance, a private-sector industry group supported by  Microsoft and other major players, 70% of software in use in Romania was not licensed. In dollar terms, this amounted to an estimated US$25.5m in lost revenue to the software makers. However, Romanian criminal courts have concluded very few cases concerning copyright and related rights. Furthermore, the deterrence effect of
the financial penalties for non-compliance is limited because they are constantly being eroded by inflation. A new bill under consideration by the Romanian Copyright Office (ORDA) will provide for higher  fines of US$500-5,000, grant a sui generis right to database producers for 15 years, extend the software copyright protection period from 50 to 70 years and introduce special regulations regarding intellectual property rights for materials available on the Internet.
Price Controls

There is little threat of price controls being imposed. Most price controls were abolished in 1997, and the government will resist calls for their reinstatement unless there is a severe economic crisis. The share of regulated prices in the consumer price index is 18%, of which 9% are energy prices. These remaining price controls create large distortions, which can be costly to the economy. Thus the decision by the previous government to cap energy prices at their August 2000 levels had a deleterious impact on enterprise sector financial discipline. In order to bring energy prices above cost recovery levels, electricity and energy prices for household consumption increased by 6% and 15% in April and July 2001, respectively. Under its agreement with the IMF, the government is committed to a series of further adjustments in energy prices in 2002-03, which are required to reduce the losses of the main
thermoelectric power producer. The deregulation, restructuring and privatisation of the energy sector is the centrepiece of the governmentâs stand-by programme with the IMF, which aims gradually to eliminate
state subsidies and improve tariff collection.

The fixed-line telephony market was liberalised on January 1st 2003, breaking the monopoly of the national operator, Romtelecom, in which the Greek company OTE has a 53% stake, after acquiring an additional 18% share in November 2002. Twenty operators (including companies from Europe, the US and Asia) and four state-owned operators, including Romania Post, are interested in entering the market. Romtelecomâs monopoly position had contributed to high tariffs, low levels of penetration, and a consequent high level of usage of mobile phones, particularly on long-distance calls, where charges were comparable with fixed-line charges. Increased  competition forced Romtelecom to reduce tariffs for
long-distance calls in early 2003, although it increased charges for local calls. Liberalisation is expected to result in a fall in tariffs of at least 30% (and perhaps up to 50%) in 23 major cities, and an increase in telephone-line density.

The record fine and sanctions imposed on  Microsoft by the European Commission (EC) will not affect consumers, according to industry expert Gartner.

The EC argued that  Microsoft had abused its dominant market position to squeeze out  competition in the media player market, a charge that echoed earlier controversy over how it tied Internet Explorer to Windows.

TD
The company has been  fined a record EUR490m (Â£331m), about one per cent of its cash reserves.
It has been ordered to sell two versions of Windows - one with Media Player and one without - in future.

Microsoft will also have to disclose some of the Windows program code, so that competitors can make sure their media players are compatible with it.

But industry expert Gartner said the EC was simply trying to save face after its lengthy action against the company. "Few purchasers will choose to buy a less functional product when they can get greater functionality for the same price," said Gartner.

"Dual versions of Windows would also have little impact on original equipment manufacturers, which can already pre-install alternative media players and set them as the default option. In our view, the primary motivation for continuing this action is the need to maintain credibility and declare victory."

About 55 of the internet music stores worldwide, among them Napster and most European services, are designed to be used with Windows Media Player.
Very few, such as Apple's iTunes Music Store, remain entirely outside the Media Player orbit.

I. A TRANSATLANTIC CLASH

In every corner of the Western world, writers proclaim "privacy" as a supremely important human good, as a value somehow at the core of what makes life worth living. Without our privacy, we lose "our very integrity as persons," Charles Fried declared over thirty-five years ago.1 Many others have since agreed that privacy is somehow fundamental to our "personhood."2 It is a commonplace, moreover, that our privacy is peculiarly menaced by the evolution of modern society, with its burgeoning technologies of surveillance and inquiry. Commentators paint this menace in very dark colors: Invasions of our privacy are said to portend a society of "horror,"3 to "injure [us] in [our] very humanity,"4 or even to threaten "totalitarianism,"5 and the establishment of law protecting privacy is accordingly declared to be a matter of fundamental rights.6 It is the rare privacy advocate who resists citing Orwell when describing these dangers.

At the same time, honest advocates of privacy protections are forced to admit that the concept of privacy is embarrassingly difficult to define.7 "[N]obody," writes Judith Jarvis Thomson dryly, "seems to have any very clear idea what [it] is."8 Not every author is as skeptical as Thomson, but many of them feel obliged to concede that privacy, fundamentally important though it may be, is an unusually slippery concept. In particular, the sense of what must be kept "private," of what must be hidden before the eyes of others, seems to differ strangely from society to society. This is a point that is frequently made by citing the literature of ethnography, which tells us that there are some societies in which people cheerfully defecate
in full view of others, and at least a few in which the same is true of having sex.9 But the same point can be made by citing a large historical literature, which shows how remarkably ideas of privacy have shifted and mutated over time.10 Anyone who wants a vivid example can visit the ruins of Ephesus, where the modem tourist can set himself down on one of numerous ancient toilet seats in a public hall where
well-to-do Ephesians gathered to commune, two thousand years ago, as they collectively emptied their bowels.11

If privacy is a universal human need that gives rise to a fundamental human right, why does it take such disconcertingly diverse forms? This is a hard problem for privacy advocates who want to talk about the values of "personhood," harder than they typically acknowledge. It is a hard problem because of the way they usually try to make their case: Overwhelmingly, privacy advocates rely on what moral philosophers call "intuitionist" arguments.12 In their crude form, these sorts of arguments suppose that human beings have a direct, intuitive grasp of right and wrong-an intuitive grasp that can guide us in our ordinary ethical decisionmaking. Privacy advocates evidently suppose the same thing. Thus, the typical privacy article rests its case precisely on an appeal to its reader's intuitions and anxieties about the evils of privacy violations. Imagine invasions of your privacy, the argument runs. Do they not seem like violations of your very personhood? Since violations of privacy seem intuitively horrible to everybody, the argument continues, safeguarding privacy must be a legal imperative, just as safeguarding property or contract is a legal imperative. Indeed, privacy matters so much to us that laws protecting it must be a basic element of human rights.

This kind of argument can certainly make a powerful impression on first reading, since it is true that we can all imagine some violation of our privacy that seems very horrible. This is especially so when the writings in question are composed by scholars with a real literary gift, like Fried. Nevertheless, no matter how anxiety-inducing it may be to read these authors, their arguments only carry real weight if it is true that the intuitions they evoke are shared by all human beings. Yet all the evidence seems to suggest that
Page 200 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
human intuitions and anxieties about privacy differ. We do not need to refer to the practices of exotic ancient or modern cultures to demonstrate as much: It is true even as between the familiar societies of the modern West. In fact, we are in the midst of significant privacy conflicts between the United States and the countries of Western Europe-conflicts that reflect unmistakable differences in sensibilities about what
ought to be kept "private."

To the Europeans, indeed, it often seems obvious that Americans do not understand the imperative demands of privacy at all. The Monica Lewinsky investigation, in particular, with its numerous and lewd disclosures, led many Europeans to that conclusion.13 But the Lewinsky business is not the only example: There are plenty of other aspects of American life that seem to Europeans to prove the same thing. Let me offer a variety of examples from France and Germany, two countries that have been my focus in recent research, and that are my focus in this Article as well.14 Some of the things that bother French and German observers involve what Americans will think of as trivialities of everyday behavior. For example, visitors from both countries are taken aback by the ill-bred way in which Americans talk about themselves. As a French article warns visitors to the United States, America is a place where strangers suddenly share information with you about their "private activities" in a way that is "difficult to imagine" for northern Europeans or Asians.15 Americans have a particularly embarrassing habit, continental Europeans believe, of talking about salaries. It is "normal in America," an Internet site informs German tourists, for your host at dinner to ask "not just how much you earn, but even what your net worth is"16-topics ordinarily quite
off-limits under the rules of European etiquette.17 Talking about salaries is not quite like defecating in public, but it can seem very off-putting to many Europeans nevertheless.

But it is not just a matter of the boorish American lack of privacy etiquette. It is also a matter of American law. Continental law is avidly protective of many kinds of "privacy" in many realms of life, whether the issue is consumer data,18 credit reporting,19 workplace privacy,20 discovery in civil litigation,21 the dissemination of nude images on the Internet,22 or shielding criminal offenders from public exposure.23
To people accustomed to the continental way of doing things, American law seems to tolerate relentless and brutal violations of privacy in all these areas of law. I have seen Europeans grow visibly angry, for example, when they learn about routine American practices like credit reporting. How, they ask, can merchants be permitted access to the entire credit history of customers who have never defaulted on their debts? Is it not obvious that this is a violation of privacy and personhood, which must be prohibited by law?

These are clashes in attitude that go well beyond the occasional social misunderstanding. In fact, they have provoked some tense and costly transatlantic legal and trade battles over the last decade and a half. Thus, the European Union and the United States slid into a major trade conflict over the protection of consumer data in the 1990s, only problematically resolved by a 2000 "safe harbor" agreement.24
Europeans still constantly complain that Americans do not accept the importance of protecting consumer privacy.25 Those tensions have only grown in the aftermath of September 11.26 Something similar has happened with regard to discovery in civil procedure: American law allows parties to rummage around in each other's records in a way that seems obnoxious and manifestly unacceptable to Europeans. The result, in recent decades, has been a seething little war over discovery.27 The circulation of the nude photos of celebrities on the Internet has produced another such conflict, with Europeans acting alone to penalize Internet service providers.28

For sensitive Europeans, indeed, a tour through American law may be an experience something like a visit to the latrines of Ephesus. Correspondingly, it has become common for Europeans to maintain that they respect a "fundamental right to privacy" that is either weak or wholly absent in the "cultural context" of the United States.29 Here, Europeans point with pride to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects "the right to respect for private and family life,"30 and to the European Union's new Charter of Fundamental Rights, which demonstratively features articles on both "Respect for Private and Family Life" and "Protection of Personal Data."31 By the standards of those great documents, American privacy law seems, from the European point of view, simply to have "failed."32

But it is not just that Europeans resent and distrust the American approach to privacy: The reverse is also true. Anyone who has lived in the United States knows that Americans can be just as obsessively attached to their "privacy" as Europeans, sometimes defending it by resort to firearms. As for American law, it too is obsessed with privacy. Indeed, some of the most violently controversial American social issues are conceived of as privacy matters. This has been true of abortion for thirty years.33 With the Supreme
Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, it is now true of homosexuality as well.34 It is simply false to say that privacy doesn't matter to Americans.

In fact, let us make no mistake about it: When it comes to privacy, there are plenty of European practices that seem intuitively objectionable to Americans. Some of these have to do with seemingly minor aspects of the anthropology of everyday life, most especially involving nudity. If the Europeans are puzzled by the
ill-bred way in which Americans casually talk about themselves, Americans are puzzled by the ill-bred way in which Europeans casually take off their clothes. Phenomena like public nudity in the parks of German cities are particularly baffling to Americans, but so are phenomena like the presence of female attendants
Page 201 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in men's washrooms. It is genital nudity that Americans find most bizarre: One's genitalia are "privates" in the full sense of the word in America, and one does not ordinarily expose them in public, and certainly not before the opposite sex. Even breasts are supposed to be kept covered in the United States-as the occasional female European tourist has discovered, when arrested (or even jailed!) for sunbathing topless on an American beach. ("Those Americans are Out of their Minds!" howls a headline from a Swiss tabloid reporting one such incident from Florida.)35 Even American advertising, which doesn't stop at much, doesn't show bare breasts.

Public nudity may seem little more thin a curiosity (though we shall see that it raises revealing problems in the European law of privacy). But here again, it is not just a matter of norms of everyday behavior; it is a matter of law, There are numerous aspects of European law that can seem not only ridiculous, but somewhat shocking to Americans. For example, continental governments assert the authority to decide what names parents will be permitted to give their children-a practice affirmed by the European Court of Human Rights as recently as 1996.36 This is an application of State power that Americans will view with complete astonishment, as a manifest violation of proper norms of the protection of privacy and personhood. How can the state tell you what you are allowed to call your baby? Nor does it end there: In Germany, everybody must be formally registered with the police at all times.37 In both Germany and France, inspectors have the power to arrive at your door to investigate whether you have an unlicensed television.38 Evidence that Americans would regard as illegally seized is routinely considered in continental adjudication.39 In France and Germany, according to a recent study, telephones are tapped at ten to thirty times the rate they are tapped in the United States-and in the Netherlands and Italy, at 130 to
150 times the rate.40 All of this will make many an American snigger at the claim that Europeans have a superior grasp of privacy. What kind of "privacy" is there, Americans will ask, in countries where people prance around naked out of doors while allowing the state to keep tabs on their whereabouts, convict them on the basis of unfair police investigations, peer into their living rooms, tap their phones, and even dictate what names they can give to their babies?

Evidently, Americans and continental Europeans perceive privacy differently. Privacy advocates sometimes try to downplay these differences. The felt need for privacy, they insist, is in fact universal, and the only real difference is that American protections are the product of piecemeal legislation, less systematically developed than European protections as yet, but nevertheless evolving in a European direction.41 There is certainly some truth in this: There are indeed important resemblances between the systems on either side of the Atlantic. Any proper account of comparative privacy law will have to explain many similarities as well as many differences.

Nevertheless, when all is said and done, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Americans and Europeans are, as the Americans would put it, coming from different places. At least as far as the law goes, we do not seem to possess general "human" intuitions about the "horror" of privacy violations. We possess
something more complicated than that: We possess American intuitions-or, as the case may be, Dutch, Italian, French, or German intuitions. We must make some effort to explain this fact before we start proclaiming universal norms of privacy protection. In particular, we will not do justice to our transatlantic conflicts if we begin by declaring that American privacy law has "failed" while European privacy law has "succeeded." That is hogwash. What we must acknowledge, instead, is that there are, on the two sides of the Atlantic, two different cultures of privacy, which are home to different intuitive sensibilities, and which have produced two significantly different laws of privacy.
II. DIGNITY VERSUS LIBERTY

So why do these sensibilities differ? Why is it that French people won't talk about their salaries, but will take off their bikini tops? Why is it that Americans comply with court discovery orders that open essentially all of their documents for inspection, but refuse to carry identity cards? Why is it that Europeans tolerate state meddling in their choice of baby names? Why is it that Americans submit to extensive credit reporting without rebelling?

These are not questions we can answer by assuming that all human beings share the same raw intuitions about privacy. We do not have the same intuitions, as anybody who has lived in more than one country ought to know. What we typically have is something else: We have intuitions that are shaped by the prevailing legal and social values of the societies in which we live. In particular, we have, if I may use a clumsy phrase, juridified intuitions-intuitions that reflect our knowledge of, and commitment to, the basic legal values of our culture.

Indeed, to get a handle on our transatlantic privacy conflicts, we must begin by recognizing that continental European and American sensibilities about privacy grow out of much larger and much older differences over basic legal values, rooted in much larger and much older differences in social and political traditions. The fundamental contrast, in my view, is not difficult to identify. In one form or another, it is a contrast that has been noticed by observers of the transatlantic scene for a century.42 It is the contrast between two

Page 202 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
conceptions of privacy most recently distinguished by Robert Post: between privacy as an aspect of dignity and privacy as an aspect of liberty.43

Continental privacy protections are, at their core, a form of protection of a right to respect and personal dignity. The core continental privacy rights are rights to one's image, name, and reputation,44 and what Germans call the right to informational self-determination-the right to control the sorts of information disclosed about oneself.45 These are closely linked forms of the same basic right: They are all rights to control your public image-rights to guarantee that people see you the way you want to be seen. They are, as it were, rights to be shielded against unwanted public exposure-to be spared embarrassment or humiliation. The prime enemy of our privacy, according to this continental conception, is the media, which always threatens to broadcast unsavory information about us in ways that endanger our public dignity. But of course, this concern does not end with media exposure. Any other agent that gathers and disseminates information can also pose such dangers. In its focus on shielding us from public indignity, the continental conception is typical of the continental legal world much more broadly: On the Continent, the protection of personal dignity has been a consuming concern for many generations.

By contrast, America, in this as in so many things, is much more oriented toward values of liberty, and especially liberty against the state. At its conceptual core, the American right to privacy still takes much the form that it took in the eighteenth century: It is the right to freedom from intrusions by the state, especially
in one's own home.46 The prime danger, from the American point of view, is that "the sanctity of [our] home[s]," in the words of a leading nineteenth-century Supreme Court opinion on privacy, will be breached by government actors.47 American anxieties thus focus comparatively little on the media. Instead, they tend to be anxieties about maintaining a kind of private sovereignty within our own walls.

Such is the contrast that lies at the base of our divergent sensibilities about what counts as a "privacy" violation. On the one hand, we have an Old World in which it seems fundamentally important not to lose public face; on the other, a New World in which it seems fundamentally important to preserve the home as a citadel of individual sovereignty. What Europeans miss in Americans is a sense of the demands of public face; indeed, Europeans have been denouncing American law on that ground since at least 1903.48 When Americans seem to continental Europeans to violate norms of privacy, it is because they seem to display
an embarrassing lack of concern for public dignity-whether the issue is the public indignity inflicted upon Monica Lewinsky by the media, or the self-inflicted indignity of an American who boasts about his salary. Conversely, when continental Europeans seem to Americans to violate norms of privacy, it is because
they seem to show a supine lack of resistance to invasions of the realm of private sovereignty whose main citadel is the home-whether the issue is wiretapping or baby names. The question of public nudity
presents the contrast in piquant form. To the continental way of seeing things, what matters is the right to control your public image-and that right may include the right to present yourself proudly nude, if you so choose. To the American mind, by contrast, what matters is sovereignty within one's own home; and people who have shucked the protection of clothing are like people who have shucked the protection of the walls of their homes, only more so. They are people who have surrendered any "reasonable expectation of privacy."49

Now, let me emphasize that this contrast is not absolute. These are complex societies, which are home to a variety of sensibilities, concerns, traditions, and mutual influences. There are certainly some Americans who find the European idea of dignity appealing. This is notably true of Justice Kennedy, whose opinion for the Court in Lawrence v. Texas expresses admiration for European approaches, and who tries
energetically to found his opinion on ideals of both liberty and dignity.50 For that matter, there are no doubt Europeans who find the characteristic American approach appealing. Moreover, it is certainly the case that both forms of the protection of privacy are in force to some extent on both sides of the Atlantic: There are some protections against the media and the like in the United States, and there are certainly some American tort cases protecting people's public image.51 As for Europe: There are certainly some quite farreaching protections against the state there, and there is certainly law protecting people within the bounds of the home.52

So it would be wrong to say that there is some absolute difference between American and continental European law. But the issue is not whether there is an absolute difference. Comparative law is the study of relative differences. Indeed, it is the great methodological advantage of comparative law that it can explore relative differences. No absolute generalization about any legal system is ever true. It would be false, for example, to say that American law is hostile to the social welfare state: It is easy to think of exceptions to that generalization. But what is true is that American law is more hostile to the social welfare state than continental law-and that is a statement that is not only true, but highly important to understanding the world in which we live.

In comparative privacy law, too, it is the relative differences that matter. Americans and Europeans certainly do sometimes arrive at the same conclusions. Nevertheless, they have different starting points and different ultimate understandings of what counts as a just society. If I may use a cosmological metaphor: American privacy law is a body caught in the gravitational orbit of liberty values, while European
Page 203 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
law is caught in the orbit of dignity. There are certainly times when the two bodies of law approach each other more or less nearly. Yet they are consistently pulled in different directions, and the consequence is that these two legal orders really do meaningfully differ: Continental Europeans are consistently more drawn to problems touching on public dignity, while Americans are consistently more drawn to problems touching on the depredations of the state. Indeed, as our many transatlantic conflicts suggest, the distances between us can often stretch into the unbridgeable.

It should be obvious enough that this is not a contrast that we can understand by reflecting on the supposed universal intuitive imperatives of "personhood," or of "the integrity of the person." One's sense of personhood can be grounded just as much in an attachment to liberty as in an attachment to dignity.
Maybe Europeans feel that their personhood is confirmed by the fact that their bosses are obliged to respect their privacy in the workplace, or by the fact that they can freely strip and sun themselves in
central Berlin. That does not prevent Americans from feeling that their personhood is confirmed when they sit at home, a shotgun across their knees, determined to resist taxation.

No, the issue is not that one side of the Atlantic has discovered true "personhood," while the other lags behind. Something else is going on. The only way to think straight about these differences is to reflect on the core social values of dignity or liberty. The comparative law of privacy is not about the intuitive preconditions of personhood, but about contrasting political and social ideals. In the United States those political and social ideals revolve, as they have for generations, primarily around our suspicions of the police and other officials, while on the Continent they revolve unmistakably around one's position in society, one's "dignity" and "honor."

Such is the contrast this Article explores. Its focus is primarily on the Continent, whose world is too little known among Americans, with only an abbreviated sketch of American law. But I hope that even a sketch of American law will stand out in much bolder and more revealing relief when placed against the continental background.
III. THE EUROPEAN TRADITION OF DIGNITY: LEVELING UP

The political and social values of "dignity" and "honor" are indeed what is at stake in the continental concept of privacy, in ways that we can only understand if we dig deeply into continental traditions. That is what I propose to do in the next few Parts of this Article, focusing, as I have done in a series of related publications, on Germany and France, the two dominant legal traditions of the Continent. Here I must begin by summarizing work I have published on a variety of aspects of European "dignity."

Where do the peculiar continental anxieties about "privacy" come from? To understand the continental law of privacy, we must start by recognizing how deeply "dignity" and "honor" matter in continental law more broadly. Privacy is not the only area in which continental law aims to protect people from shame and humiliation, from loss of public dignity. The law of privacy, in these continental countries, is only one member of a much wider class of legal protections for interpersonal respect. The importance of the value
of respect in continental law is most familiar to Americans from one body of law in particular: the
continental law of hate speech, which protects minorities against disrespectful epithets. But the continental
attachment to norms of respect goes well beyond hate speech. Minorities are not the only ones protected
against disrespectful epithets on the Continent. Everybody is protected against disrespect, through the
continental law of "insult," a very old body of law that protects the individual right to "personal honor."53
Nor does it end there. Continental law protects the right of workers to respectful treatment by their bosses
and coworkers, through what is called the law of "mobbing" or "moral harassment." This is law that
protects employees against being addressed disrespectfully, shunned, or even assigned humiliating tasks
like xeroxing.54 Continental law also protects the right of women to respectful treatment through its
version of the law of sexual harassment. It even tries to protect the right of prison inmates to respectful
treatment, as I have noted in a recent book, to a degree almost unimaginable for Americans.55

Why does continental law work so hard to guarantee norms of "respect," "dignity," and "personal honor" in so many walks of life? This is a question to which I believe we must give a different answer from the one Europeans themselves commonly give. Europeans generally give a dramatic explanation for why dignity figures so prominently in their law: They assert that contemporary continental dignity is the product of a reaction against fascism, and especially against Nazism.56 Having experienced the horrific indignities of the 1930s and 1940s, continental societies, Europeans say, have mended their ways. Europe has dignity today because Europe was traumatized seventy years ago. This is an answer that is often embraced by Americans, too-most notably Robert Kagan, in his recent bestseller Of Paradise and Power.57

And indeed, it is hard to resist a story with so much natural drama. But I have tried to demonstrate that the real story is different, and much more complicated. The European culture of dignity is not well-understood as any kind of simple reaction against fascism; even the place of fascism in the making of European
dignity is more ambiguous than one might suppose. In fact, the history of the continental law of dignity begins long before the postwar period. It begins in the eighteenth, and even the seventeenth, centuries.

The continental societies that we see today are the descendants of the sharply hierarchical societies that existed two or two-and-a-half centuries ago-of the aristocratic and monarchical societies of which the France of Louis XIV was the model. In point of fact, continental law has enforced norms of respect and dignity for a very long time. In earlier centuries, though, only persons of high social status could expect their right to respect to be protected in court. Indeed, well into the twentieth century, only high-status persons could expect to be treated respectfully in the daily life of Germany or France, and only high-status persons could expect their "personal honor" to be protected in continental courts. Members of the lower orders-the vast majority of the population-certainly had no meaningful right to respect. Quite the contrary.58

What we see in continental law today is the result of a centuries-long, slow-maturing revolt against that style of status privilege. Over time, it has come to seem unacceptable that only certain persons should enjoy legal protections for their "dignity." Indeed, the rise of norms of respect for everybody-even minorities, even prison inmates-represents a great social transformation on the Continent. Everybody is now supposed to be treated in ways that only highly placed and wealthy people were treated a couple of centuries ago. Germany and France have been the theater of a leveling up, of an extension of historically high-status norms throughout the population. As the French sociologist Philippe d'Iribarne has elegantly put it, the promise of modern continental society is the promise that, where there were once masters and slaves, now "you shall all be masters!"59

The uncomfortable paradox, as I have tried to show, is that much of this leveling up took place during the fascist period, for fascist politics involved precisely the promise that all members of the nation-state would be equal in "honor"-that all racial Germans, for example, would be "masters."60 For that very reason, some of the fundamental institutions of the continental law of dignity experienced significant development
under the star of fascism. In fact, the fascist period, seen in proper sociological perspective, was one stage in a continuous history of the extension of honor throughout all echelons of continental society.
This long-term secular leveling-up tendency has shaped continental law in a very fundamental way.61
Contemporary continental hate speech protections, for example, can be traced back to dueling law: In the
nineteenth century, continental courts protected the right to respect only of the dueling classes. Today they
protect everybody's right to respect; indeed, the rules of dueling have had a striking influence in the
Continent, sometimes being imported bodily into the law. Contemporary protections for prison inmates
have a very similar history: In the eighteenth century, continental law maintained sharp distinctions
between high- and low-status punishments. If executed, high-status offenders were beheaded, while
low-status offenders were hanged; if spared, high-status offenders were housed in comfortable
apartments, while low-status offenders were subjected to degrading penal slavery. In the two centuries
since the French Revolution, the old high-status forms of punishment have gradually been generalized to
all: All inmates are now treated according to a regime of imprisonment that was once reserved to figures
like Voltaire.62

Such has been the history of the continental law of respect. It is a history, as I have tried to show, that has always been closely linked with the history of continental etiquette, which also began as a set of rules for courtiers, only to be generalized to the entire population. Indeed, the rules of etiquette, like the rules of dueling, have sometimes exercised a direct influence on the making of the European law of respect, which is often concerned with matters like the legal right to be addressed as "vous" or "Sie."63

This world of continental respect is also the world of continental privacy. When continental lawyers speak of "privacy" as a set of rights over the control of one's image, name, and reputation, and over the public disclosure of information about oneself, they are speaking to these selfsame continental sensibilities. To be sure, they are talking about privacy in a way that many Americans also talk about it. The idea that privacy is really about the control of one's public image has long appealed to the most philosophically sophisticated American commentators, from Alan Westin,64 to Charles Fried,65 to Jeffrey Rosen,66 to
Thomas Nagel.67 In its most compelling form, the claim has come from Robert Post: For Post, privacy law protects norms of dignity that are "civility rules," just like the norms of etiquette; and without the protection of such norms, he argues, no society can maintain any form of community.68 Moreover, similar ideas can already be found in the most famous of American articles, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis's 1890 The Right to Privacy.69 All of these American writers have viewed the danger in the violation of our "privacy"
as the danger that we will lose the capacity to control what Erving Goffman famously called our "presentation of self-our image before the eyes of others in society.70 All of them have thought of our right to privacy, perhaps a shade paradoxically, as our right to a public image of our own making, as the right to control our public face. Indeed, it is precisely for that reason that they have insisted on the connection between privacy and personhood.

So the prevailing continental conception is also the one that most thoughtful American commentators on privacy and "personhood" have found the wisest and most sophisticated. But if this conception has triumphed in continental law, it is not because European lawyers possess any unique measure of wisdom or sophistication. Nor is it because they alone recognize the norms that are necessary for the maintenance
Page 205 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of community. Human communities can be founded on the widest variety of norms. As for law: It is not about the worldly realization of wisdom or sophistication as such. Law is about what works, what seems appealing and appropriate in a given society, and the conception of privacy as control of one's "image" has succeeded because it fits into continental social traditions, and into a quotidian continental culture of respect. Continental privacy is "continental" in much the way that continental hate speech law is "continental," and in much the way that continental prison law is "continental." For that matter, it is "continental" in much the way that continental etiquette is "continental"-for, pace Professor Post, the norms of "civility," far from being universal, vary dramatically from community to community.

Indeed, etiquette makes, as so often, a striking example of the social roots of European dignitary law. It is not an accident that both etiquette and privacy law show the same anxious preoccupation with "public image." Thus, it is common for continental etiquette guides to open with a section called "how we present ourselves before the world";71 or "the politesse of appearances";72 or more broadly a section on how to maintain the correct external look and manners.73 Rules about how to dress and how to wear makeup are part of continental etiquette just as are rules about how to comport oneself on the street, at the table, or in the workplace.74 Continental etiquette is indeed overwhelmingly about "the presentation of self in
everyday life," just like continental privacy law. In fact, continental authors sometimes consciously present etiquette and privacy law as related subjects: For example, you can buy a book for German journalists, published by the leading German newspaper, called Kleiner Knigge des Presserechts-a little etiquette book of press law-which treats all of the standard questions of privacy as questions of good manners.75

But it is not just that the conception of privacy as control over one's image fits into the traditions of continental etiquette. It fits into the continental traditions of dignity, respect, and personal honor more broadly.76 As we shall see shortly, continental privacy law, like most continental law of respect, developed largely from the law of insult. It even has connections with dueling. It has a Nazi history. Most generally, it fits within the tradition of status revolution that has shaped so much of continental law-the revolution of leveling up. Indeed, as I want to insist in this Article, continental privacy protections offer perhaps the paradigmatic example of high-status norms that have been generalized to the wider population. For as we can all instantly recognize, the conception of privacy as control over one's public image is a conception originally and primarily concerned with the doings of very high-status persons.

Indeed, critics have always insisted that a notion of privacy as a right to control one's "image" is a notion primarily of interest to people of very high status-to personages like the Warrens of Boston, or for that matter like Princess Caroline of Monaco, whose affairs still provide constant grist for the continental privacy mill. The conception of privacy as control of one's image rests, at base, on the idea that one ought to be able to keep one's name and picture out of the newspapers. This is obviously a conception that matters primarily to members of "society" as the term is used in the phrase "society pages."

And that is just what we see in continental privacy law: a high-status conception of privacy, a "society" conception of privacy. In fact, it is almost comical to read off the names in the captions of the leading postwar continental cases. Open a book on comparative privacy law, and here are the names you will see: Princess Soraya of Iran,77 Princess Caroline of Monaco,78 Prince Ernst August of Hanover.79 There is a remarkable disproportion of royalty in continental privacy thinking. Down to this day, in fact, German texts list royalty first among the classes of "public figures" who require special treatment in the law of privacy,80 while French texts, the product of a deeper democratic tradition, only list royalty second, after
politicians.81 "Members of the aristocracy"82 too are presented as classes that had to be specially
treated. These are textbooks written in worlds that remain very different from ours. Even the nonroyals and
nonaristocrats involved in the leading European privacy cases are often very prominent persons indeed:
Hjalmar Schacht, former Nazi finance minister,83 Robert Barcia, longtime eminence grise of the French
Trotskyite party.84 Indeed, an American cynic who wants to mock the vaunted continental commitment to
privacy will point gleefully at these names. At core, the American will sneer, the continental protection for
privacy grants everyone alike the right to be safe from paparazzi. Does this really have anything to do with
the values of a true democracy? At best, continental privacy law is not a form of protection for universal
human "personhood," but a means of regulating the relations between celebrities and the rest of us.

Nevertheless, as I want to insist, to take that mocking attitude would be to underestimate the moral claims of European leveling up, as it expresses itself in privacy law. There is more to the law than its practical impact. The law also aims to express social values-the continental law of privacy as much as or more than any other body of law. What the continental law of privacy expresses is the fundamental social importance of a commitment to extend royal treatment to everyone. Indeed, we cannot understand our transatlantic conflicts if we do not recognize the authentically wide social application of "society" privacy in continental law. Over the past several generations, the basic commitment to control of one's public image has been extended well beyond its origins in the problems of the Princess Carolines of the world, in ways that do indeed affect the lives of ordinary people. This is most especially true of the areas where the conflicts between continental and American norms are most heated-areas like consumer data, credit reporting, public nudity, and the dignity of criminal offenders. These are all realms of life in which continental law has forcefully extended privacy protections to noncelebrities and nonroyals. Control of one's "image," in the
Page 206 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
continental mind, now includes more than everybody's right to keep one's names out of the newspapers. It also includes everybody's right to control the use of one's consumer data and the like, everybody's right to privacy in the workplace, everybody's right (if one should need it) to respectful imprisonment, and more. Continental privacy law is, as it were, "society" privacy for everybody.

One recent German popular guide to the law proudly puts it in this way, in language that deserves to be underlined. Privacy rights, the book explains, are part of a larger law of the "defense of personal honor," and nowadays it's not just the "royal houses" whose image is threatened; "everybody is in danger."85 Silly enough-but also truly appealing in its way. Of course it matters to insist that everybody counts the same way royalty does, from racial minorities and prison inmates on up through the ranks of society.
IV. THE RISE OF FRENCH PRIVACY LAW

There is no better way to grasp this continental social ideal than to trace its historical development, from its origins in the nineteenth-century world of dueling, through the Nazi period, and on into its modern forms. Continental jurists have always tried to understand "privacy" as a species of personal honor. In particular, going back to the nineteenth century, continental thinking has always treated privacy as a value primarily threatened by two forces: the excesses of the free press and the excesses of the free market. From the point of view of the nineteenth-century continental tradition, there were two things that peculiarly menaced
a respectable person's "honor": loose talk, and the grubbiness of the world of buying and selling. Continental privacy law has been shaped by a longstanding battle waged against both. Indeed, the history of continental privacy law has been, in essence, the history of the resistance, in the name of "honor," to
two of the fundamental values of American liberty: the value of free speech, and the value of private property as distributed through the market.

French law developed mostly over the period of 1790 to 1900, while German law developed later, from about 1880 to 1960. The two traditions have peculiar emphases. French law has had to struggle in a distinctive way with France's recurrent periods of sexual license, and German law was peculiarly formed by the events of the Nazi period and after. Nevertheless, both remain recognizably continental, and
recognizably different from American law. In particular, in both countries, the law of privacy protection was built using the doctrinal resources of the classic continental law of personal honor-the law of insult-in tandem with the law of artistic and intellectual property.

Let us begin with France. French ideas about the protection of "private life" date at least to the early modern period. High-status families have always sought to protect their privacy in France, and they have sometimes succeeded. For example, for several centuries the French nobility successfully fought off efforts to require public registration of the mortgages on their real property, which would have exposed their finances for inspection.86 There were other ways, too, in which high-status ancien regime Frenchmen sought to protect their privacy.87

But the modern history of French privacy protection, which has been sadly neglected,88 begins with the Revolution, and most particularly with the introduction of freedom of the press. Freedom of the press has always made leading French observers nervous, even ones with very liberal beliefs. Thus, the first French effort to create constitutional protections for freedom of the press was already accompanied by a proviso intended to guarantee that "private life," as an integral part of personal "honor," would not be subject to press depredations. The Constitution of 1791, the first detailed revolutionary blueprint for a new kind of European liberal society, included extensive protections for freedom of the press. But at the same time, it added protections against "calumnies and insults relative to private life."89 One of the draftsmen of the Constitution, the Jacobin Jerome Petion, speaking during the flush of revolutionary excitement in August of
1791, explained the intent of the new document in this way: A vigorous free press was unconditionally necessary for the maintenance of liberal government.90 Nevertheless, it was true that those very press liberties threatened the "private person."91 For that reason, it was important to confer upon persons whose private lives had been violated some legal recourse against "insults." To do so would not
undermine the freedoms gained in the Revolution. On the contrary, it would achieve a revolutionary end. In fact, the "new doctrine," with its emphasis on the rights of ordinary private persons, directly "contradicted the ideas of the ancien regime."92 After all:

[In the ancien regime] the least offense given to what would be called the honor of a man of position was a serious crime, which could not be punished severely enough, while an offense to a simple citizen hardly received any attention on the part of the law; but for that very reason, the new doctrine is all the more correct and in conformity with the principles of the new order of things.93

The first manifestation of "privacy" in French law thus came in the form of a classic statement of the ambition to bring everybody up in status. The introduction of privacy protections was indeed akin to contemporary developments like the introduction of the guillotine. The guillotine arrived shortly after Petion gave this speech, as a means of extending the high-status privilege of beheading to all persons.94 It too belonged to a "new order of things" in which everybody's honor was to be protected.

These remained the characteristic ideas of French privacy law thereafter-notably in 1819, the year of the passage of the first post-Napoleonic law lifting press censorship. As the Restoration successfully established its authority, the government of Louis Philippe consented to tolerate a freer press. But the idea of press freedom continued to trouble even liberally minded Frenchmen, and the classic
nineteenth-century statement of the importance of privacy emerged as soon as press censorship was even partially lifted. In fact, it came once again from a leading advocate of press reform: Pierre-Paul
Royer-Collard, a leading politician, professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, and hero of French liberalism. Royer-Collard, even as he defended press liberalization, gave a famous speech warning that private life had to be "walled off ("muree") against the danger of "calomnie," insult. The press, he said, had to be free, but the only proper realm for press freedom was the public sphere, and even true facts about private life could not be lawfully published.95 In the course of his speechifying, Royer-Collard produced a classic morsel of French metaphoric oratory-"private life must be walled off!"-that established itself as a standard continental slogan, repeated well into the twentieth century.96

To be sure, what Royer-Collard produced was an oration, not a law, and for several decades thereafter there was little by way of protection for privacy in the letter of French law. For that reason, French legal historians treat the period of the 1820s through the 1840s as a time when there was simply no protection for private life.97 But it is a real mistake to conclude from the absence of law about privacy that no protection existed. In this period, one's private affairs remained a matter of one's honor, and one's honor remained a thing more precious, as French authors regularly declared, than life itself. During the decades after 1819, the primary means of protecting one's honor was through the duel, and "private life" was defended, at least sometimes, in exactly that way. Thus, the dueling literature listed "the delicacy of private life" among the aspects of "honor" that demanded protection.98 And it was indeed so protected, as we can see from the example of one of the most famous dueling incidents in French history, the case of the Duchess of Berry. The Duchess was a leading royalist agitator and mother of the Comte de Chambord,
the pretender to the throne. While she was being held prisoner in a fortress in 1833, after an attempt to foment rebellion, it was publicly revealed that she was pregnant-even though she had been widowed for some years. As Louis Blanc described the resulting scandal, the Duchess's "intimate life" was "exposed to the insulting commentaries of the multitude"; "[i]n vain," he added, "had she counted upon that solidarity of honor that reigns among relatives, even ones of obscure social condition, and that, protecting families, saves them from scandal by keeping secrets."99 Her family did not defend her, but several royalists did: This famous violation of royal privacy caused more than one duel between royalists and
republicans-including one in which several royalist journalists challenged several republican ones to a gigantic duello,100 and another in which the eminent General Bugeaud killed a member of the Chamber of Deputies.101 The honor of "private life" was not protected by the law in the 1830s, but it was defended.

By the mid-nineteenth century, though, this extravagant world of dueling honor began slowly to fade, and questions of private life began to migrate into the law. In part this reflected uneasiness about the traditions of dueling, as commentators demanded that questions of honor be settled in court.102 But it also reflected shifting patterns of both political and sexual liberation. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the claims
of the free press became more insistent, and public morality became less strait-laced. Both developments created privacy problems for French law.

Already in the 1850s, some famous cases affirmed the core privacy right that would come to be known in French law as the "right to one's image." These first cases involved deathbed photographs-in two cases, deathbed photographs of celebrity beauties, and in one case the deathbed photograph of a kind of
Mother-Teresa-type street missionary.103 But it was the following decades that saw the most striking developments-in particular, developments that involved the comparatively unbuttoned sexual atmosphere of later-nineteenth-century Paris. Sexual license and the law of privacy have always gone hand in hand; and France had been famous for its relatively loose morals since at least the eighteenth century, the aristocratic age of Watteau, Boucher, and Fragonard. This tradition revived in the mid-nineteenth century, the age of the cancan, and it gave rise to numerous "privacy" issues, as cultures of sexual liberation tend to do. Especially beginning in the gay years of the 1860s, "right to one's image" cases began to multiply.
A particularly famous 1867 case involved Alexandre Dumas pere, the author of The Three
Musketeers-itself an important document of nineteenth-century French dueling culture. Dumas pere, then
well on in years, became involved in a love affair with Adah Isaacs Menken, a thirty-two-year-old Texas
actress and horsewoman, famous for appearing on stage dressed only in a body stocking. Obviously
reveling in their rejection of bourgeois values, the scandalous Menken and Dumas posed (together with
Menken's mother!) for several more or less salacious photographs. Some of them showed Menken in her
underwear. Others showed her in amorous poses with Dumas, who was not wearing a jacket. Dumas,
whether through inadvertence or sheer glorious indifference, did not enter into any express agreement
with the photographer about the rights to publish the photos. Seizing his chance, the photographer tried to
register his copyright in what were highly marketable images. In responding to the photographer's
application, the copyright officials were not entirely without delicacy: They forbade him to display the

photos showing Miss Menken in her underwear.104 With regard to the other photos, though, they gave the photographer free rein, and he marketed them widely, causing an international scandal.

Dumas, perhaps under pressure from his family, sued.105 But could any objection be raised in law? This was a difficult question in the 1860s. The photographer had a property right, the copyright in the photographs. Indeed, Dumas admitted in open court that he had sold the rights.106 This was the
mid-nineteenth century, and property rights were generally regarded as something close to sacred in the legal cosmos of the day.107 Nevertheless, adventurous legal thinkers were beginning to challenge the sanctity of private property,108 and the Dumas court did the same. If Dumas did not have the property right, was there any countervailing "right" that he could claim? In a seminal decision, the Paris appeals court answered that question by holding that he had a new kind of "right to privacy," which qualified the absolute claims of the law of property. The court adopted Royer-Collard's famous 1819 language about "private life": Even if a person had tacitly consented to the publication of embarrassing photos, that person must retain the right to withdraw his consent. "The very publication" of such photos could put such a
person on notice "that he had forgotten to take care for his dignity, and remind him that private life must be walled off m the interest of individuals, and often in the interest of good morals as well."109 The court accordingly rendered the photographer's property right effectively meaningless, ordering him to sell all rights in the photographs to Dumas.

Privacy, the court had effectively held, must sometimes be allowed to trump property, at least where lascivious images were involved: One's privacy, like other aspects of one's honor, was not a market commodity that could simply be definitively sold. Any sale by a person who had momentarily "forgotten his dignity" had to remain effectively voidable. In subsequent cases, involving some of the most famous artists of the day, this sort of thinking began to gel into a developing right to one's image-an important part of the French law of privacy, understood as an aspect of the law of artistic and intellectual property.110 One memorable 1877 dispute, for example, involved Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, the brilliant history painter and portraitist. The cult of nude figure drawing was at its height in mid-nineteenth-century France, and Ingres frequently found it difficult to capture the ladies who sat for him unless he had first sketched them nude. Of course his society clients would not agree to sit nude themselves, so Ingres hired models with appropriate body types, and did nude sketches to which he added the recognizable heads of his clients. It was a consequence of this louche artistic practice that a nude sketch of one of his sitters, Madame Moitessier, appeared among his effects at his death in 1868. When his executor tried to sell the drawing, Monsieur Moitessier sued. The court hearing the case, like the Dumas court, assigned the property right in the sketch to Ingres's successors. But, again like the Dumas court, the court held that Monsieur Moitessier had a privacy right, a right to his wife's "image," which served to limit the artist's property right. The court held that

property itself recognizes limits established not only by positive law, but also by social norms [les convenances sociales]; that the first of these norms consists in the respect owed to the inviolability of the domestic hearth; that that inviolability would be offended if the image of the mere de famille could be surrendered to the publicity of a banal public auction.111

The court accordingly ordered the dealer in possession of the sketch to sell it to Monsieur Moitessier. The same basic analvsis was confirmed in yet further high-profile cases over the following decades, which established the principle that we have a "sacred and inalienable right over ourselves, and consequently over the reproduction of our image."112 The most famous of these was the 1900 lawsuit between James Whistler and the Baronet
Eden, which Whistler himself chronicled in his little screed The Baronet and the Butterfly.113

In part, French privacy law was thus the product of the culture of the Paris art world, with its nude models, defiant immoralism, and large artistic egos. The cases that grew out of that world generally concluded that there was a right to one's "image" that was distinct from, and in tension with, rights of property. But that was only one of the strains in the making of French privacy law. The other had to do with the free press, and it reflected exactly the same anxieties that had accompanied press liberalization in 1791 and 1819.

Indeed, it was in the tradition of uneasiness about the free press that privacy received its first formal statutory protection of the nineteenth century, in 1868, during the waning years of Napoleon III's imperial regime. Over the course of the 1860s, the period of the so-called "Liberal Empire," Napoleon III granted increasing civil rights in France. This included the creation of a new press policy in 1868, which, with some limitations, allowed effective freedom of the press. The French press, meanwhile, had been experiencing a small renaissance of critical and satirical reportage, as well as a renaissance of French caricature in the work of artists like Honore Daumier.114 Attitudes had not changed since 1819, though, and the new law aimed to guarantee that freedom of the press would not open the door to insulting intrusions into the lives
of respectable people. Thus, it carefully provided that, though the press was in principle free, every publication in a periodical of "a fact of private life" was a criminal offense-a punishable contravention, just as other insults were contraventions.115 An interpretive circular of the Ministry of Justice added that while
Page 209 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
there was of course room for criticism of artists and other public figures, even the latter were (as they would continue to be) protected against "defamation and insult."116 Concerns about the care of one's dignity thus continued to shadow press liberalization, just as they had in 1791.117

With the fall of Napoleon III, the climate certainly changed, and when the Third Republic turned to the regulation of the press, in 1881, its new statute said nothing about "privacy" as such.118 Nevertheless, courts continued to insist on the sacred character of "la vie privee"-for example, in forbidding a writer to base a novel on events revealed in the course of a criminal trial.119 All told, France was, by the 1870s and
1880s, the home of a very visible law of the protection of privacy.120 The reigning French view was captured by a characteristic account that appeared in 1888, two years before the publication of Warren and Brandeis's Right to Privacy. In that year, Emile Beaussire, an eminent legal philosopher of the day, summarized several decades of French development in the following way: The right to privacy was to be ranked among the rights to honor more broadly. This of course raised doubts about its place in the law. For understandably, Beaussire wrote, people viewed their "honor" as something that should be preserved through dueling, not through law: "When my honor is attacked, I gain nothing by filing suit against my calumniators."121 Nevertheless, in the modern world, even persons of honor had to have recourse to the law, and the law had to occupy itself with persons of honor. This was the right context for understanding
the right to privacy, for violations of privacy involved nothing less than the revelation of "infamous secrets," which could destroy the honor of such persons as a respected "pere de famille."122 And outside the most exceptional circumstances, the law could not allow such violations:

[P]rivate honor, whatever its value per se and whatever its source, must be protected from all offenses.

Similar accounts of the right to privacy as a right to "honor" made their way into other textbook accounts by the end of the nineteenth century as well,124 and the importance of the protection of "honorable" privacy was something close to orthodoxy in France by the 1890s.
V. THE RISE OF GERMAN PRIVACY LAW

In Germany, similar developments were underway by the late nineteenth century. The world of the developing German law of privacy was not the overheated world of Paris high art, though, with its nude models and lascivious photos. Instead, it was the heady world of the German philosophy of free will. Moreover, German privacy law developed more slowly than French law, not really establishing itself before the middle of the twentieth century. And when German privacy law did establish itself, it was in connection with the painful experience of Nazism.

The German tradition of privacy protections is perhaps easiest to understand if we emphasize one point: German privacy law grew in large part out of an effort to create a richer German alternative to the ideas of liberty that grew up west of the Rhine, and especially to English ideas of liberty. The protection of privacy in the German tradition is regarded as an aspect of the protection of one of the most baffling of German juristic creations: "personality." Personality is a characteristically dense German concept, with roots in the
philosophies of Kant, Humboldt, and Hegel. Standard texts describe this concept in the daunting language of continental philosophy. As one recent author explains, the German law of personality is a law of
freedom-the law of the Inner Space, "'in which . . . [humans] develop freely and self-responsibly their personalities.'"125 Standard texts also lodge the concept in the drama of modern German history: This law of freedom, they tell us, has especially flourished since the 1950s, when Germans applied the lessons
they had learned from the Nazi disaster.126 Clearly "personality" is somehow central to German legal culture. But the concept is likely to seem elusive to most readers. What is the "Inner Space"? How does guaranteeing the freedom of the "Inner Space" represent an antidote to Nazism?

To get a firmer handle on these difficult ideas, we must dig deeper into German intellectual history, and even into German theology. Personality is indeed a concept that Germans have often invoked where Americans would invoke liberty, and like liberty it does involve a kind of freedom. But from the beginning it was never quite the same as American freedom. Where Americans often think of "freedom" as opposed primarily to tyranny, nineteenth-century Germans often thought of "freedom" as opposed primarily to determinism. To be free was, in the first instance, not to be free from government control, nor to be free to engage in market transactions. Instead, to be free was to exercise free will, and the defining characteristic of creatures with free will was that they were unpredictably individual, creatures whom no science of mechanics or biology could ever capture in their full richness. For Germans who thought of things in this way, the purpose of "freedom" was to allow each individual fully to realize his potential as an individual: to give full expression to his peculiar capacities and powers.

This idea of "free" self-realization is as old as Leibniz, or even Erasmus. Indeed, its sources lie unmistakably in Christian Humanism.127 But in its modern form, it is an idea that was especially championed by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the early nineteenth century.128 The early nineteenth century was a period when Germans were struggling with the economic liberalism of Adam Smith, trying to learn the lessons of Smith while preserving some role for a managed economy as well as for ideals of freedom that were not defined by the market.129 For writers of the period like Humboldt, it seemed essential to insist that human flourishing required the pursuit of individual fulfillment in forms the market could not provide. The paradigmatic free actor, for such German philosophers, was commonly the artist more than the consumer. The German philosophical tradition on the subject of freedom was thus close in spirit to the German tradition of socalled "national" economics, a school critical of free trade and in many ways of the free market more broadly. That does not mean that German philosophers (or German economists) did not believe in the freedom to buy and sell, of course. Nor does it mean that there have never been English or American writers who have found the German approach wise and beautiful.130 It means only that the German tradition always put less of an emphasis on consumer sovereignty, and more of an emphasis on unfettered creation, than the Anglo-American tradition did-and most especially on the unfettered creation
of the self, on the fashioning of one's image and the realization of one's potentialities. This approach to the problem of freedom formed a fundamental part of what Leonard Krieger, writing in the wake of the Nazi experience, famously called "The German Idea of Freedom":131 an idea different from Anglo-American ideas of liberty-an idea focused much more on inward self-realization, and consequently much more open to the exercise of state power and regulation of the market.

Now these are philosophical ideas that are both vague and grandiose, and they are not obviously easy to translate into law. Certainly, they do not seem as easy to translate into law as the ideas of an Adam Smith. Nevertheless, they were embraced by German jurists of the second half of the nineteenth century, and particularly of the 1880s. This was the period when German public policy began to turn away from
Smithian laissez-faire ideas, endorsing social insurance, cartelization, and protectionist policies. It was also the period when German philosophers turned strongly toward neo-Kantianism, a philosophical style fascinated with the tension between free will and determinism. It was during this same period that German lawyers began to turn away from seemingly crass Western ideas of personal liberty, endorsing the theory of personality as the true theory of freedom. Inspired by both Kant and Hegel, a number of leading legal thinkers set out to create a German law that would match the German philosophy of personality in depth and subtlety. In particular, they developed a German tradition that treated the protection of privacy simply as one aspect of the protection of personality more broadly: Privacy, for Germans, became one part of "free self-realization."

Like their French predecessors of several decades earlier, German jurists in and after the 1880s perceived their problem as a problem of honor, to be dealt with through the law of insult, in coordination with the law of artistic property. German society, like French society of the same period, was strongly attached to
norms of respectability and honor, notably as asserted through dueling. It was also a society in which the law of insult played a correspondingly large role in legal thinking.132 But the French way of talking about the problem was not very satisfactory to German scholars. When French authors like Royer-Collard or Beaussire spoke of "insults," they based their arguments on clumsily drafted modern statutes and vague "social norms."133 German scholars preferred a more solid juristic foundation, with citations to authoritative ancient texts and explorations of basic problems in legal philosophy. Rather than talking about ill-defined social norms, German jurists accordingly embarked on an impressive reinterpretation of one of the most confusing bodies of traditional law: the ancient Roman law of insult, which they combined
with the law of artistic property to create a new body of personality law. This German reinterpretation of the ancient law of insult is one of the  finest examples of nineteenth-century juristic virtuosity, and one of the most famous. It deserves to be described, even if only briefly, not least because it exercised an important influence on American scholars like Warren and Brandeis.

Let us then follow nineteenth-century German reasoning. The ancient Roman law of insult was by no means easy to use as a basis for a modern law of personality. The ancient Roman texts were extremely muddy. In very early Roman law, which produced a cryptic statute on the matter, the law of
insult-injuria-seemed to cover certain injuries to a person's possessions. In addition, there were early Roman sanctions against casting spells, engaging in certain now-mysterious forms of public insults, and inflicting bodily injury.134 Very gradually, over the long course of Roman history, this early grabbag of legal prohibitions also came to cover various kinds of disrespectful and insulting speech and treatment. In particular, as the confusing texts of the Digest of Justinian seem to show, it came to protect respectable women against lewd comments, and to guarantee to a certain extent that low-status persons would show proper deference to their betters, as well as that high-status persons would not insult their inferiors.135 A variety of other interferences with the rights of other persons also apparently came to be considered "injuria."136 Nowhere did the Roman jurists explain how they thought that physical "injuries" to persons and their possessions were related to verbal "injuries" directed at respectable women by mashers and the like, or give any account of what social purposes, if any, the Roman law of injuries was thought to serve.

This was not easy stuff to work with, but German scholars went to work with a will. In particular, they worked in the Hegelian tradition. Hegelian legal historians brought a characteristic approach to the understanding of legal evolution-an approach founded on Hegel's account of the history of punishment. According to the Hegelian view, the history of punishment was one in which the primitive talionic rule of "eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth," had gradually given way to more sophisticated concepts of proportionality. This was an evolution, as Hegelians saw it, in which a naive view of the world obsessed with things-eyes and teeth-had gradually evolved into a view of the world capable of grasping larger immaterial values.137

The creators of the German law of "personality" interpreted the development of the ancient Roman law of insult in the same way-as an evolution of the "spirit" of Roman law, as Rudolf von Jhering, the most brilliant of German law professors, called it,138 from the material to the immaterial. The argument ran as follows: Honor had always been at stake in the law of insult, even in the earliest periods. At first, the
Romans, still obsessed with things, had thought that the law could only vindicate monetizable rights, mere material rights. But as sensibilities about honor grew richer and deeper, these early legal protections gradually ripened, until the law grew to cover all aspects of honor, protecting also against verbal insults and other shows of disrespect.139 The evolution of the law of honor, like the evolution of the law of punishment, was thus an evolution in the "spirit of the times"-one in which primitive protections for merely monetizable interests had gradually matured into sophisticated protections for "noneconomic"
interests.140 That slow evolution, from the material to the immaterial, was moreover continuing in the modern world: The modern world was now producing what Jhering called, in a famous 1885 article, the law of "insulting tortious injuries." In particular, modern protections were now evolving beyond protections
against immaterial verbal insults, to include the protection of such immaterial goods as one's name141 and one's photographed image,142 one's control of one's correspondence,143 as well as access to modern amenities such as the telegraph and the tram.144

Jhering was one of a number of German scholars to make this sort of argument, some relying on ancient Roman law, some drawing on Germanic sources.145 This Hegelianized law of insult was one main strand in the new German law of personality. The other was the law of Urheberrecht, creators' rights. The rights
of an artistic or intellectual creator, in German law, were partly rights of copyright. But they also were beginning to extend beyond mere copyright to include a broader right to control the use of one's work, in the name of protecting one's reputation as an artist-what in continental law is today called "droit moral de l'auteur."146 For German scholars who thought of "personality" as the right to free self-creation, the law of artistic and intellectual property was a natural source, to be exploited alongside the law of insult.147 After all, personality was precisely about self-creation. And of course, protection of the creative rights of the artist, a nineteenth-century innovation, was a classic example of the new modem sensitivity to immaterial interests.

The law of insult, united with the law of artistic creation, thus made for what seemed to Germans a solid foundation for a law of personality. The idea that personality was really about an amalgam of personal honor and artists' rights was popularized beginning in the late 1870s by an influential writer named Karl Gareis.148 Related approaches were developed in particular by the most deeply learned and intellectually adventurous of turn-of-the-century legal thinkers, Josef Kohler.149 Some important cases came into this German line of thinking as well: In particular, there was a case that prohibited the distribution of photographs of Otto von Bismarck on his deathbed.150 As always in the continental tradition, the hunger
of the press for images of highly placed persons drove the law onward.

These were very influential ideas in the developing German social order of the late nineteenth century. By the early twentieth century, German law had incorporated a wide variety of personality rights into its statutory schemes. The scandal over Bismarck's deathbed photos led, in 1907, to the introduction of statutory protections for one's image, as part of a larger scheme regulating rights in works of art.151
Meanwhile, the German Civil Code, which went into force in 1900, included protections against the appropriation of one's name152 and the impairment of one's credit,153 alongside protections for life, body, health, and liberty.154 The 1909 law on unfair  competition included a characteristically German provision protecting enterprises against untrue statements that harmed their operations or their credit,155 and the Bismarck-era law on freedom of the press granted a right to respond.156 Perhaps most importantly, the Criminal Code included a prohibition on insults.157 All of this added up to protections that were hardly insignificant by the eve of World War I. The Weimar era saw a number of further important cases, particularly involving members of the formerly imperial Hohenzollern family and like personages.158

In short, there were plenty of "personality" protections in German law by the early part of the twentieth century. Nevertheless, the Civil Code itself, which went into force in 1900, did not endorse an unbounded right of personality159-much to the dismay of many legal scholars. Indeed, it is an important part of German legal lore that personality was neglected in the Civil Code. This peculiarly German form of freedom, German lore tells us, was not embraced by the Code, which instead endorsed crassly
market-oriented values.160 The German literature routinely declares that personality was only fully protected in the 1950s, as a consequence of the new commitment to freedom and dignity that took hold in
Page 212 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the wake of Nazism. Indeed, the protection of personality is widely presented as the core institution of a German private law shaped by the reaction against Nazism-"one of the most essential achievements," as a standard textbook says, "of the post-war period."161

This is not, however, correct. With this we come to a delicate point, which I have touched on before and now must touch on again. Here, as elsewhere, contemporary German institutions of dignity have a Nazi history. In point of fact, the Nazis too were committed to the protection of personality.162 This German form of freedom was one that appealed to the Nazis just as it appealed to the later makers of the twentieth-century social welfare state. The story is entirely typical of the history I have recounted
elsewhere.163 The Nazi regime, like other fascist regimes, made great efforts to proclaim the importance of "honor"-and most especially the importance of the honor of low-status persons, as long as they were racially German. This led the regime to insist on norms of respect for workers in the workplace, and in everyday life as well.164 In just the same way, it led the regime to insist that all Germans, whatever their social station, had a right to the protection of their personality. Otto Palandt's standard commentary to the Civil Code explained it this way in the early 1940s:

The "right of personality" did not receive any definitive regulation in the Civil Code. Life, body, health, and freedom are protected through Â§ 823 I, and so is the right to one's name . . . . A general right of personality is alien to the Civil Code. However, there is nothing in the Code that excludes it. National Socialist legal feeling [National-sozialistisches Rechtsempfinden] regards the Volk-comrade as a member of the Volk community, who fulfills the demands of his legal position in the service of the Volk community, and who as such has a claim that the legal position that has been conferred upon him be safeguarded and protected against attacks of any kind. In this sense, it can be said that the Volk-comrade has a general right of personality that ought to be recognized, one whose content extends beyond the above-mentioned personality interests listed [in the Code], including in particular a right to join in the common labor of the community and a right to recognition, respect, and honor . . . .165

The draft Nazi Civil Code, never enacted, was even more assertive in its insistence on a universal German right to protection of personality.166 The Nazis presented themselves as protecting honor to its fullest extent, in return for the sacrifices demanded of the German Volk. Of course the insistence on honor for Germans was paired with an insistence on the dishonor of others-of persons who were "sick or
foreign."167 Like all Nazi extensions of "honor" to the lower orders, this too belonged to the politics of the most vicious kind of exclusion. It is for that very reason that the rare historian who deigns even to talk about the Nazi period insists that there is no connection between Nazi ideas and the doctrines of the
postwar period.168 Nevertheless, it is much too simple to dismiss the Nazi experience as a rejection of the traditions of German personality law-whether we are talking about the history of legal doctrine, or about
the social history of the law. As a matter of doctrine, the Nazis did endorse the general right of personality. As a matter of social history, the Nazis did guarantee, here as elsewhere, the claim to honor of low-status Germans. Ordinary Germans who would come to pride themselves on their "dignity" in the 1950s and
1960s were Germans who had been taught to pride themselves on their "honor" twenty years earlier.

The consequence, painful as it is to acknowledge, is that Nazi law directly prefigured the law of postwar Germany. By the 1950s and 1960s, to be sure, the standard commentary to the Civil Code was no longer grounding the "general right of personality" in "National Socialist legal feeling" and the requirement that the "Volk-comrade" work for and with the community, as it had done in the 1940s. Instead it was (rather reluctantly) grounding it in the constitutional right to "free self-realization."169 But in both eras, the commentary talked a lot about "honor,"170 and the net result was that the German civil law acknowledged a "general personality right" in each. In point of fact, the protection of personality is not a product of
postwar reforms, as German scholars must have known perfectly well during the 1950s.171 It has grown in tandem with the German social welfare state, and the downward social extension of a claim to honor, throughout the twentieth century.
Be that as it may, the protection of personality has especially flourished since the 1950s. The Basic Law of
1949 did embrace the German tradition of personality protection in its famous Article II, which guarantees
that "[e]very person has the right to free development of his personality, insofar as he does not injure the
rights of others."172 This was a forceful restatement of the German idea of freedom. In subsequent years,
Article II has indeed come to stand at the foundation of the extensive German protection of privacy, among
other personality interests. A number of cases of the 1950s established the principle that the Civil Code
had to be understood in light of this constitutional provision, as guaranteeing a right to the protection of
personality.173 The postwar law of personality is now a central institution of German dignity in the
(perhaps endangered) world of German market socialism.
VI. CONTEMPORARY CONTINENTAL LAW: PROTECTING THE AVERAGE PERSON'S PUBLIC IMAGE The old traditions described above have remained strong down to the present postwar day, in both
Germany and France. Postwar developments were more tentative in France than in Germany. Protections
for "privacy" were proclaimed by de Gaulle's government in exile shortly before D-Day, presumably in the
Page 213 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
effort to win over former collaborators.174 Nevertheless, lasting change had to wait until 1970, when the Civil Code was amended to introduce new protections.175 Still, today protections for privacy are a proud part of the law in both countries-and in both, they have retained much of their nineteenth-century coloration.176 To be sure, the law of privacy in both countries is today regarded as distinct from the law of insult.177 Nevertheless, traditional nineteenth-century values, with their honor-oriented, suspicious attitude toward the free press and the free market, have continued to make themselves felt, even in a world in
which the privacy of ordinary folks is vigorously protected.

The continental chariness about the free market shows, for example, in the treatment of consumer credit reporting and other consumer data. Credit reporting is an especially revealing example. Here the basic continental rules grow out of longstanding continental traditions. Historically, as a matter of etiquette, one's financial affairs were very much one's own affairs. One did not talk about money matters unless absolutely necessary: Indeed, money, as a standard etiquette guide will tell you, was simply "a taboo subject" among respectable people.178 The only persons whose finances were routinely revealed to the public were insolvents and bankrupts. That attitude has had a marked influence on European privacy law-most notably in the traditional French rule that made it a per se violation of privacy rights to reveal another person's salary.179 (Indeed, a French text on the law of privacy will still casually list "health, love, sex and earnings" as the areas of life self-evidently in need of privacy protections.)180

The same attitude has had an influence on the continental law of credit reporting. In France in particular, consumer credit reports are provided only by official sources, and they are provided only in the case of persons experiencing serious financial difficulty. They offer, as it were, only a watch list of persons who are proven credit risks. Anything else, to the French mind, would represent an intrusion into financial privacy.181 One's financial information is information "of a personal character," over which one must have control just as one must have control over one's image.182

The German approach is less directly interventionist. Credit reporting is provided not by government agencies, but by industry collectives known as "Schufas." Even in Germany, though, there is significant regulation: Consumers must sign a contractual clause expressly permitting lenders to share data about them, and before any data is shared, the law requires a careful balancing of the privacy interest of consumers against the interests of financial entities, theoretically in every individual case. As in France, moreover, German reporting focuses on classic sorts of negative information associated with insolvency and default.183 European credit reporting is thus the direct descendant of the old European law of bankruptcy: It is law that stigmatizes the dishonorable failure to pay one's debts, not law that allows merchants to pry into the buying habits of honorable, solvent persons. Certainly anything like the American practice of compiling an accessible record of any individual's credit history seems like a dangerous exposure of private life to most Europeans.

All very continental-but at what cost? As any American law professor will surmise, it inevitably means that consumer credit is less easily available in continental Europe than it is in the United States. Indeed, these privacy norms must contribute significantly to the making of a continental world in which credit cards have made much slower progress than they have in the United States-a world that in general is not founded on the system of consumer credit. It may be difficult for Americans to understand why continental Europeans should resist our well-developed credit-reporting practices. In the long run, good credit reporting ought to make life easier for everybody, and indeed make everybody richer. But, for the continental legal tradition, the basic issue is of course not just one of market efficiency. Consumers need more than credit. They need dignity. The idea that any random merchant might have access to the "image" of your financial history is simply too intuitively distasteful to people brought up in the continental world.

The protection of consumer data reflects in many ways the same clash of attitudes. Europeans have aggressively condemned traffic in consumer data: It is, European lawyers believe, a serious potential violation of the privacy rights of the consumer if marketers can purchase data about his or her preferences, and regulation is thus imperative. The resulting protections are embodied in the  European Commission's forceful Privacy Directive of 1995,184 under which Europeans claim the authority, as the Wall Street Journal puts it, to play "Privacy Cop to the World."185 Americans have of course been much slower and more hesitant to regulate, with the resulting battles that I have already described.186 And indeed, the continental attitude is not easy for Americans to understand. After all, there is a benefit in the traffic in consumer data. If marketers can learn more easily what my preferences are, they can provide me more easily with the goods and services I seek. To put it in the language of American law and economics, trafficking in consumer data lowers search costs: It makes it easier for buyers and sellers to find each
other, creating sales that would otherwise not have been made, and thereby enhances the efficiency of the market.187

Not all Americans would approve of the theories of law and economics, of course. Nevertheless, on some level, the relaxed attitude of law-and-economics scholars toward the market is clearly widely shared
among American policymakers. This does not mean that Americans do not experience some anxiety about the traffic in their "private" information. But it does mean that American law has been far less categorical in
Page 214 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
its condemnations than European law. Whereas European law allows the collection of consumer data only for limited purposes and limited times, upon explicit consent of the affected person, and under government supervision,188 Americans are much more willing to tolerate industry self-regulation.189 Most of all, when they do propose regulation, they tend, in a characteristically American way, to favor "market-based solutions to personal data protection," as Pamela Samuelson writes, "over the strict comprehensive regulatory regime adopted . . . in Europe."190

Indeed. Europeans have a harder time seeing the benefits of free-market solutions. As another leading scholar puts it, Europeans "trust government more than the private sector with personal information."191
Why is this? It is not hard to understand if we keep in mind the continental traditions I have described. Privacy is an aspect of personal dignity within the continental tradition, and personal dignity is never satisfactorily safeguarded by market mechanisms. Ever since the case of Dumas pere, continental law has resisted the notion that one can definitively alienate one's "dignity."192 Dignity, to this way of thinking, simply must be treated differently from property. As one French scholar insists, contrasting the American attitude with the French, one can freely dispose of one's liberty, but one can never be permitted to freely dispose of one's dignity.193 If one accepts that premise, one should accept the proposition that any consumer's consent to the sale of his or her data should have only limited effect at best. After all, "the importance of one's image," as a recent French article puts it, is greater than ever "in the information society."194

Here again, consumers need more than cheap goods and services, just as they need more than easy credit. They need dignity. If your consumer profile is floating around somewhere in cyberspace, you are not in control of your image. A just world, from this point of view, is a world in which everybody's
respectability is carefully protected.195 This sort of thinking has far less resonance in America than it does in Germany and France. We will never quite share the intuitions that fuel the continental conviction that trading in consumer data must be prevented, or at least sharply limited by law.

As these examples suggest, continental privacy is not just for Princess Caroline, Princess Soraya, or Prince Ernst August. It is for the ordinary person as well, in his or her guise as consumer. It is also for the ordinary person in his or her guise as worker. Continental law has made considerable efforts to guarantee the privacy of workers in the workplace, at least within the limits of the possible.196 Worker e-mails, for example, are vigorously protected in a way that is not the case in America.197 There are protections for workers' other private documents, guarantees against video surveillance, and rights to use telephones for personal calls-all in the name of maintaining a certain "personal sphere."198 It goes well beyond e-mails and the like, too, to cover a wide range of issues touching questions of workplace dignity. One striking French decision, for example, found it a violation of dignity rights when an employer in a retail store required that employees show a receipt for merchandise that they wished to take home. Treating workers with that sort of suspiciousness was regarded by the court as a violation of their expectation to be treated as honorable persons.199

The contrast with American approaches to the workplace is telling. American privacy protections, at their metaphoric core, are the sorts of protections afforded by the walls of one's home. They have been extended beyond the literal home, of course, since the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, it remains the case that American protections become progressively weaker the further the affected person is from
home. This is particularly true when courts apply the "reasonable expectation of privacy" test developed in the Fourth Amendment context.200 The primary locus of one's "reasonable expectation of privacy" is of course in the home, and persons outside the home have correspondingly few privacy protections. This applies to workers as well, whose expectation of privacy in the workplace, according to the American cases, is sometimes close to nil.201

The same contrast holds in one of the most striking aspects of the comparative law of privacy: the treatment of criminal offenders, including accused persons and prison inmates. Continental privacy protections extend to these classes of persons as well. Continental privacy law has been strongly concerned with the privacy rights of persons caught up in the toils of the justice system. In Germany, modern personality protection grows preeminently out of a 1976 case involving a homosexual prison inmate convicted of an act of terrorism.202 In that case, Lebach, the German Constitutional Court found that it would be a violation of the inmate's personality rights to broadcast a made-for-television movie about him. Lebach has been regarded since as the font of late-twentieth-century personality doctrine. French law too has made strong efforts to guarantee the privacy of accused persons as a fundamental aspect of the presumption of innocence,203 and more broadly of the "honorability" of the accused.204 In line with this, both Germany and France make considerable efforts to guarantee that prison inmates will
enjoy protections for their privacy, in ways that are unimaginable for Americans.205 All persons haled into the criminal justice system enjoy, at least in principle, protections that are not available to their American counterparts.
VII. CONTEMPORARY CONTINENTAL LAW: FREE EXPRESSION AND PUBLIC NUDITY

Page 215 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Differences in cultural tradition, in short, have made for palpable differences in law. The differences are most striking, and most categorical, where the values of free speech are involved. Here it is above all the classic problems of privacy law-sex and nudity-that provide the most revealing examples. They are my topic in this last Part discussing continental law.

With regard to France, some of the striking contrasts in the law were traced by Jeanne Hauch in a 1994 article with the wonderful title Protecting Private Facts in France: The Warren & Brandeis Tort Is Alive and Well and Flourishing in Paris.206 Hauch offers, among others, the example of Oliver Sipple.207 Sipple was the unfortunate man who thwarted the attempt of Sara Jane Moore to assassinate President Gerald Ford. He was homosexual-a fact that he very much wanted kept out of the press. This proved to be impossible under the American law of "public figures." Of course, in any democracy the private doings of
at least some public figures are a matter of legitimate public interest, and every democratic system recognizes that.208 Since the 1960s, though, the American "newsworthiness" exception has grown mightily, and peculiarly, in scope.209 Freedom of expression is a value of constitutional magnitude in the United States, whereas the protection of personal honor is not, which means that freedom of expression almost always wins out. That is what doomed Oliver Sipple's effort to keep his homosexuality out of the papers. Although Sipple's entry into the public eye was the result only of his heroism in a moment of danger, the California Court of Appeal held that there was a legitimate public interest in his private life. In any case, the court held, "he did not make a secret" of his sexual orientation, at least in San Francisco.210
Sipple (whose family in the Midwest had known nothing of his California life) eventually committed suicide.211

It is precisely cases like this that Europeans see differently. The right of free expression that protects the press is always balanced in continental Europe against an individual right to "dignity," "honor," or "personality,"212 which implies a right to personal privacy-as was shown by a 1985 French case that Hauch uses as a foil to the Sipple decision.213 The case involved a man who attended a gay pride parade in Paris, dressed in a way that made it clear that he was himself gay. His image was captured in a news photo. Continental law has long held that persons appearing in public may be photographed, but that no photograph may be published that focuses on them as individuals, unless they consent. Moreover, to the French way of thinking, the fact that one has revealed oneself to a restricted public-say, the gay
community of Paris-does not imply that one has lost all protections before the larger public. These principles matter, and the French court accordingly acknowledged the plaintiff's right to oppose publication of his image.214

The contrast between the treatment of Sipple and the treatment of this French victim of publicity is typical of a much deeper contrast in attitude, which one commentator on the supposed "failure" of American privacy law describes this way:

[P]rivacy is not the only cherished American value. We also cherish information, and candour, and freedom of speech. We expect to be free to discover and discuss the secrets of our neighbours, celebrities, and public officials. We expect government to conduct its business publicly, even if that
infringes the privacy of those caught up in the matter. Most of all, we expect the media to uncover the truth and report it-not merely the truth about government and public affairs, but the truth about people.

The law protects these expectations too-and when they collide with expectations of privacy, privacy almost always loses.215

In Europe, by contrast, personal honor very often wins out. As one German author put it in 1959-a time when Germans began to reassert their own distinctive national traditions-there is simply an inevitable tension between the worldview of a Goethe, for whom the development of "personality" was "the greatest blessing of the children of the earth," and the worldview of a Jefferson, for whom press liberty was the indispensable foundation of a free society.216 Europeans are by no means completely deaf to the pleas of Jefferson, but the attitude of Goethe always haunts their thinking too. That does not mean that Europeans are doctrinaire. They have their own doctrine of "public figures." But that doctrine cuts far less deeply, as numerous cases indicate. And even when the courts allow "intrusions" into the lives of "public figures," commentators grumble.217
Many more examples can be offered-most especially involving nudity, and most especially involving the
Internet. In German and French legal culture, we still find much the same attitude that we found in the
1877 decision regarding Ingres's nude sketch of Madame Moitessier: One ought to have control over one's
nude image. This means, of course, that one can sell the rights to an image, just as one can in
America218-at least provisionally. Nevertheless, there are limits. In one 1974 case, for example, a French
actress was permitted to suppress movie scenes in which she had willingly appeared naked: One's nude
image is simply not definitively alienable under continental norms.219 In other cases, models have been
able to suppress the republication of their nude photos in magazines other than the ones they posed for-a
matter in which "French law," a commentator observes approvingly, "is . . . totally opposed to American
law."220 The same sort of attitude has also affected both continental cyberlaw and the continental law of

public nudity. The Internet has produced two recent leading cases in particular, one in Germany and one in France, in both of which courts imposed liability on Internet service providers that housed nude images of celebrities. In the German decision, Steffi Graf, the former tennis star, successfully sued  Microsoft for its refusal to guarantee that it would prevent dissemination of a "fake"-a picture of her head superimposed on the nude body of another woman.221 The leading French case involved the model Estelle Hallyday, who similarly sued a service provider-this time a free service provider-for housing her nude image. Hallyday's suit put the provider in question out of business.222 There have been a number of such French cases since.223 Indeed, there has been criminal liability: One young man who published nude photos of his exgirlfriend on the Internet (with commentary) received a suspended sentence of eight months' imprisonment and a fine of 25,000 francs-a serious sentence in France.224 These cases do not establish an unconditional right. In particular, here again, European law does understand how to make exceptions
for public figures.225 There is no absolute control over the dissemination of one's nude image in continental law. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the continental courts are on the watch.

The situation is different in America. Theoretically, the same rights exist in some form in American law. Nevertheless, both culture and practice differ. Congress has passed legislation that aims to forbid imposing liability on Internet service providers as such.226 Perhaps more strikingly, unlike the European courts, American courts see little point in issuing injunctions once images have been irrevocably diffused over the Internet.227 Such was the fate, for example, of Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a well-known conservative radio commentator, who posed for some cheesy nude photos for a man who was her boyfriend and mentor in the 1960s. In 1998, Dr. Schlessinger's (now ex-) boyfriend sold the photos to Internet Entertainment Group (IEG), an organization that specialized in putting exactly such nude photos
of celebrities online. IEG promptly put the photos on display. Indeed, in a show of almost parodic contempt for norms of privacy, the IEG site was equipped with technology that allowed paying viewers to zoom in on any part of Dr. Schlessinger's anatomy.228

There is little doubt that any continental court would have enjoined an outfit like this from distributing the photos. Even in America, Dr. Schlessinger did succeed in obtaining an injunction for a time.229 After a few weeks, though, the court lifted the injunction on the ground that the photos were already widely available
on the Internet.230 From a certain point of view, of course, the real result of Dr. Schlessinger's suit was no different from the real result in the cases of Steffi Graf or Estelle Hallyday: The curious can still find the relevant nude pictures of all of these unfortunate celebrities online. (Indeed, critics of the Hallyday decision loudly complained that her nude images remained available on at least twenty sites.)231 But European courts still feel obliged to forbid the circulation of those pictures, even when it is futile to do so, in order to express the importance of protecting "private life." Moreover, European courts feel obliged to penalize the persons responsible, be they Internet service providers or delinquent ex-boyfriends.232 American law is, our French commentator observes, "radically different."233

This is not, let me emphasize, because Europeans are more squeamish about nudity than Americans. Quite the contrary. Germans in particular appear fully nude in places like public parks (in the summer) and public coed saunas (in the winter) with a sans-gene that Americans can hardly fathom; and French women go topless, not only on the beach, but also on the banks of the Seine. There are certainly limits: For example, one German court recently held that jogging in the raw went a bit too far.234 Nevertheless, as I began by observing, it is most assuredly the Americans who are most troubled, and even put off, by nudity.235 The difference is not that Europeans refuse to be seen nude, but that they insist that they want to be the ones who should determine when and under what circumstances they will be seen nude. The difference is that the decision to appear nude, for Europeans, belongs to their control of their image.

Indeed, even when they appear nude in public, individual Europeans have sometimes tried to claim a right not to be shown naked by the media. Scenes of naked bodies, whether on the beach or in the parks, are
of course irresistibly tempting to journalists. Photographs are inevitably published, and the persons portrayed sometimes sue. Such suits are indeed the ultimate test of the continental notion that people should have absolute control over the diffusion of their image. These suits have failed in France.236 But German courts are less categorical. Under the German law of the right to one's image, the control of pictures of the naked body belongs "exclusively to the individual."237 This was the rule at stake in the case of a Munich man who filed suit after newspaper photos were published showing him naked in the
Englischer Garten. The court took his claim seriously enough to hold that he had in principle suffered harm to his "personality" rights, though it ruled against his claim for damages. Even in ruling against his claim for damages, though, the court emphasized that his genitals were not exposed in the photo.238 Had his genitals been exposed, the case might have come out differently.239 The German court thus found it important to state the principle that nude persons have a right to control their public face, just as clothed people do. In this, the law only tracks German sensibilities more broadly, and in particular the German etiquette of public nudity. Indeed, any serious scholar's research into continental privacy norms should include a good stint on a German Liegewiese. As any German there will tell you, it is a matter of ordinary politeness that nude people have a right not to be stared at. Taking off all your clothes, even in a public park, does not constitute a surrender of your privacy.

Such is the sort of attitude that we must grasp if we want to understand continental law: We must understand that there could be such a thing as private public nudity. It is an attitude that American law simply does not comprehend, as we can see most strikingly from the Supreme Court's 1995 decision in Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton.240 This was a case that presented the question of whether high school athletes could be subjected to mandatory drug testing. In holding that they could, the Supreme Court offered, among others, an argument that took the following form: Athletes regularly shower together in the nude. Since they voluntarily expose themselves through this "communal undress," they have a "reduced expectation of privacy" with regard to whether their urine will be tested for the presence of drugs: Once a person appears nude in public-even before a highly restricted public-he has, in the eyes of the Court, at least partly surrendered his claim to privacy.241 To the continental ear, this is a bizarre non sequitur. The fact that students have willingly appeared naked in one circumstance says strictly nothing about whether they have broadly surrendered their right to control access to data about them, and
certainly nothing about whether they have consented to a urine test.242 For Americans, by contrast, the right to privacy is, at its metaphoric core, a right to hide behind the walls of one's own home. Those who have abandoned the protection of the home, and a fortiori the protection of clothing, have at best a diminished claim to privacy.
VIII. WARREN AND BRANDEIS REVISITED

Indeed, continental ideas of privacy are just not much at home in American legal culture. To be sure, there is certainly American law on the books that sounds something like what we find on the books of Germany or France. American law has its famous four forms of the privacy tort, as analyzed by William Prosser in
1960: intrusion upon seclusion,243 appropriation of the name or likeness of another,244 public disclosure of private facts "not of legitimate concern to the public,"245 and disclosure of private facts in such a way as to portray victims in a "false light."246 There is considerable legislation too, like the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1987,247 passed in reaction to journalistic investigations of Robert Bork, and various other acts and bills, both state and federal. American legislatures do pass privacy protection statutes of various kinds248-especially, as Jeffrey Rosen has observed, in the wake of "heartstring-tugging" scandals.249 While many of these statutes treat the government as the principal threat to privacy, not all of them do. Though less than a third of the states have general laws on the protection of privacy, there certainly are state protections.250 There are even state constitutional protections for privacy.251 There are decisions giving protection to one's image-notably cases involving the nude or sexually charged images of young women who did not intentionally pose in a provocative way, or who are the victims of sexual assaults,253 or who otherwise seem to be living "a life of rectitude."254 There are cases involving nongovernmental invasions of the "privacy of [the] home,"255 and especially of the privacy of the bedroom:256 Where the walls of the home are breached Americans can be sensitive. There is a lot of American scholarship that vigorously defends the European point of view.257 And of course, there is the famous article of Warren and Brandeis.

Nevertheless, as our many and heated conflicts with Europe suggest, the American attitude remains different. It is not true that American law is absolutely different from European law. No generalization about any legal system is ever absolutely correct: Law is always something of a jumble, and there are always exceptions to any general description. The differences that we can see are always comparative
differences, not absolute ones. Nevertheless, the American climate of values remains basically inhospitable to the European way of looking at things. We do find patches of more or less continental law in America, just as patches of snow sometimes survive in a hollow on an early spring day. But over time, most efforts to make American law look more continental tend to melt away.
This is indeed how we should understand the fate of "that most influential law review article of all,"258
Warren and Brandeis's The Right to Privacy.259 Warren and Brandeis undertook the seminal, and still
most cited, effort to introduce a continental-style right of privacy into American law. In theory, their right is
still part of the law almost everywhere in America. Nevertheless, it is generally conceded that, after a
century of legal history, it amounts to little in American practice today.260 The story of the relative failure
of Warren and Brandeis is precisely a study in how poorly continental ideas do in the American climate.

In fact, it is best to think of the Warren and Brandeis tort not as a great American innovation, but as an unsuccessful continental transplant. For, though commentators have failed to recognize it, what the two authors set out to do was precisely to introduce the continental protection of privacy into America. It is hardly news that Warren and Brandeis worked in a world of Boston respectability closely akin to the high society of late-nineteenth-century Europe. Warren was a Boston Brahmin, a child of one of the socially dominant families of the city. Brandeis was the son of Bohemian-Jewish immigrants who had fled to America after 1848.261 Their article was written in a fit of outrage over newspaper reports of a party given by the Warrens,262 and its main target was the gossip pages of the "yellow press," which Warren and Brandeis were convinced represented a new phenomenon.263 Like a number of authors of the period,264 they were upset by these press intrusions. "The press," the coauthors complained, "is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. . . . To occupy the indolent, column upon
column is filled with idle gossip, which can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle."265 The
Page 218 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
only answer to the challenge, they argued, was to insist on a "right to privacy." This would protect individuals not only against the press, but also against intrusive photographers and the like. Nor would the new right be confined to high-status people like the Warrens:

The design of the law must be to protect those persons with whose affairs the community has no legitimate concern, from being dragged into an undesirable and undesired publicity and to protect all persons, whatsoever[] their position or station, from having matters which they may properly prefer to keep private, made public against their will.266

All of this was obviously much in the continental style, up to and including its desire to level up, to guarantee the right of all citizens "whatsoever" to be safe from "undesirable and undesired publicity." The high-status tenor of the Warren and Brandeis article is indeed something any reader can see immediately, and critics of Warren and Brandeis have said so.267 But if we look closely at the article we can see something else: We can see that Warren and Brandeis took continental law as their starting point.

In fact, it is not difficult to retrace the research steps that Warren and Brandeis took. Like the authors of any law review article, they looked for authority for their position. The first and most natural place to look
for their right to privacy, the two authors strikingly observed, lay in the protection of "honor" through the law of insult. And in the law of insult, they rightly noted, there were already lively traditions to draw upon in
both France and Germany by the end of the nineteenth century. As we have seen,268 by 1890, when
Warren and Brandeis wrote, the right to privacy was a longstanding topic of study and discussion within
the continental traditions of the law of insult. Indeed, continental discussions were reaching a fever point in
the 1880s. Warren and Brandeis were perfectly familiar with this. They cited the French privacy legislation
of 1868 at length, and admiringly.269 They also cited German scholarship on the law of insult-in particular
Carl Salkowski's standard Institutes and History of Roman Private Law,270 a very German text, which
interpreted ancient Roman law through the lens of German philosophy:

Iniuria in the narrower sense is every intentional and illegal violation of honour, i.e., the whole personality of another. . . . This may be committed by insulting oral or written words or signs (so-called verbal and symbolic injuries), by deeds (so-called real injuries), by slander, and speeches and acts which cast suspicion upon, or are prejudicial to, the social or pecuniary position of any one, or other acts interfering with the right of personality.271

From Salkowski, or from some other German source, Warren and Brandeis borrowed the term "personality," and they characterized their right to privacy, in orthodox German fashion, as one aspect of the protection of "personality" more broadly. Indeed, it is likely that Warren and Brandeis knew more about the continental tradition than they chose to cite. Brandeis, who had been brought up in a Germanophile Louisville household, had been sent to high school in Germany during the 1870s, and he remained a passionate admirer of German culture.272 It seems wholly improbable that he did not know of the lively German literature on "personality" when he adopted the term for his article. (If he only cited Salkowski it may be because Salkowski's was the only German text that had been translated into English.) Moreover,
at least some of the French cases on the right to one's image must have been known to educated Bostonians. The Dumas case in particular had been an international cause celebre.273 In any case, French privacy protections had been publicized by E.L. Godkin, an author often identified as an influence
on Warren and Brandeis.274 As Godkin had explained, "In France a man can legally prevent or punish the mere mention of his name in any disagreeable connection, if he be not in political, literary or artistic
life"-law that Godkin insightfully credited to a French "sensitiveness to ridicule or insult which has probably never existed in any Anglo-Saxon country."275

Nevertheless, though Warren and Brandeis certainly knew the continental traditions, and cited them, they did not claim that it was possible to introduce continental practices directly into American law. They understood the continental tradition too well for that. The continental approach, they observed, was not available within the common law tradition-for the simple and insurmountable reason that the law of insult, and the protection of "personal honor," did not exist in America. "[O]ur system, unlike the Roman law, does not afford a remedy . . . for mental suffering which results from . . . contumely and insult [involving] an intentional and unwarranted violation of the 'honor' of another."276 No matter how vigorous and appealing the ideas of Royer-Collard, Jhering, Gareis, Beaussire, and the rest might be, they could not be fitted into the common law precedents, which simply said nothing about personal honor, or at least nothing useful.

Warren and Brandeis's article thus started from the admission that the United States was doomed to be a nation without continental-style "privacy" protections, at least in their full form. But it continued by insisting that this was no cause for despair: Even in the absence of a law of insult, there were other resources to which one could turn. Indeed, Warren and Brandeis maintained, the protection of "honor" was not as promising a vehicle for the protection of "privacy" as continental writers imagined. The apparent analogy between honor and privacy was merely "superficial." Another road would have to be taken:


Page 219 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It is not however necessary, in order to sustain the view that the common law recognizes and upholds a principle applicable to cases of invasion of privacy, to invoke the analogy, which is but superficial, to injuries sustained, either by an attack upon reputation or by what the civilians called a violation of honor; for the legal doctrines relating to infractions of what is ordinarily termed the common-law right to intellectual and artistic property are, it is believed, but instances and applications of a general right to privacy, which properly understood afford a remedy for the evils under consideration.277

There was no ultimate need for "honor" in order to protect privacy; artists' rights would do. But even here, of course, Warren and Brandeis were pursuing a continental tack, and most particularly a German one. The Germans, as we have seen,278 had created their law of personality by drawing both on the law of insult and on Urheberrecht, on intellectual and artistic property. This is exactly what Warren and Brandeis, like Gareis and Kohler before them, did as well.

The resulting article is, of course, a common law classic, a tour de force effort to capture the drift of a case law system in a state of productive flux. Yet let us note that, even in their account of common law
evolution, Warren and Brandeis did not sound all that different from their continental, and especially German, predecessors. As we have seen, French and German writers held that privacy had emerged as a limitation on property,279 and an evolutionary outgrowth of the growing sensitivity to the needs of "personality."280 Warren and Brandeis echoed these ideas. In a style unmistakably like that of Jhering, they tried to trace the evolving "spirit" of the law. Copyright, rights in "intellectual and artistic property," they observed, had always been understood as a property right.281 Yet primitive ideas of property were falling by the wayside as the common law evolved. It was a general evolutionary trend of the common law to get beyond the protection of mere material "property rights," offering new protections for the immaterial
damage of emotional and moral harms.282 This was true of privacy as well. Cases that had been interpreted as property cases, as cases in copyright, in fact revealed a growing judicial sense that it was necessary to "protect the privacy of the individual" from invasion-not just from the literal invasion of one's property, but from metaphorical invasions "either by the too enterprising press, the photographer, or the possessor of any other modern device for rewording or reproducing scenes or sounds."283 At the same time the common law of torts had gradually come to cognize the harm in various forms of mental suffering.284 These two trends conduced to the same evolutionary end: Common law thinking was giving rise to the new "Warren and Brandeis tort," the tort of invasion of privacy.

All of this made for an inspired contribution to the international literature on the protection of privacy-one that Europeans themselves still cite.285 But what Warren and Brandeis could not do was bring the European structure of values to the United States. Indeed, it was not just the continental law of insult that Warren and Brandeis were unable to introduce into America. It was much more broadly the constellation of ideas about personal honor that undergirded it.

The history of the cold reception that American law has given Warren and Brandeis has been written many times, and I will not repeat it here. I want only to emphasize that the American resistance to Warren and Brandeis has always been a resistance founded on two values in particular: the value of the free press,
and the value of the free market. These are of course the very values that continental advocates of continental-style, honor-oriented privacy rights have long regarded with the greatest suspicion.

Freedom of expression has been the most deadly enemy of continental-style privacy in America. To cite once again our German scholar of 1959, the conflict has always been one between the values of Jefferson and the values of Goethe.286 Of all American liberty values, freedom of the press is the most poisonous
for continental-style privacy rights. Starting with the famous Sidis case of 1940,287 American law began, in an American way, to favor the interests of the press at the cost of almost any claim to privacy. Perhaps the most striking examples come from the Supreme Court, with its decisions in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn288 and Florida Star v. B.J.F.289 These were cases in which the media published the names of rape victims-in the latter case despite the fact that dissemination of the victim's name was a crime under state law. In both cases the Supreme Court found that the First Amendment protected media outlets against suit.290 Freedom of expression just about always wins in America-both in privacy cases and in cases involving infliction of emotional distress, like Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, which denied recovery to preacher Jerry Falwell after Hustler published a particularly gross parody.291 This is the kind of question on which continental law, with its focus on personal honor, comes out differently.292

That does not mean, of course, that American law never protects the control of one's image. But even where it does, it tends to do it in an American way. This is perhaps clearest in the doctrine of the "right of publicity." The "right of publicity" is a characteristic American doctrinal invention, which we owe to Melville Nimmer's work of the 1950s.293 In a sense, it is a doctrine of the protection of one's image. Nimmer argued that persons had an ownership right in their image, and that they could sue others who had misappropriated it. But it should be obvious that the notion of one's image as a piece of property, as a commercial commodity, is different in spirit from the continental protection of image. And indeed, while continental lawyers endorse this American innovation, they are careful to distinguish it from their own distinctive traditions.294 (Indeed, Americans themselves are confused by the question of whether the right
Page 220 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of publicity really belongs within the realm of privacy protections or not.)295 And unsurprisingly, the American doctrine produces different results from continental doctrine. As critics complain, the "right of publicity" has tended to lose all of its moorings in the Warren and Brandeis idea of privacy, becoming essentially a vehicle for protecting the enterprises of celebrities like Bette Midler and Vanna White.296
Moreover, nothing in the doctrine of the "right of publicity" prevents Americans from alienating the rights in their image, no matter how humiliating their subsequent use may be. If your image is your property, you can sell it. In Europe, by contrast, as we have seen, sales of your nude image remain voidable297-a very important doctrine, in particular, for protecting the interests of persons who, in moments of youthful folly, have allowed themselves to be photographed in embarrassing positions.

Finally, an American interest in one's "publicity" is an interest in one's property, not an interest in one's honor. This too sets the American tradition apart from the continental, and it affects the analysis in such famous matters as the "Here's Johnny!" case. In that case, the entertainer Johnny Carson sued a portable toilet maker who had adopted the well-known tagline "Here's Johnny!" for its product. An appellate court held that Carson's publicity rights had been violated. But it was careful to insist that Carson's rights were commercial rights only, not privacy rights against humiliation or embarrassment.298 Here again, we can see a contrast with continental law, and with German law in particular. Even commercial enterprises can be "insulted" in Germany. German firms have "personality" rights, and they are indeed protected against embarrassing or humiliating uses of their slogans or logos, through what is called the doctrine of Markenverunglimpfung.299 Some cases litigated under the American "right of publicity" may come out the same way that they would in European "right to one's image" cases. But the underlying values are different, and courts feel obliged to say as much.

Indeed, even if some cases come out the same way, many come out differently. And there are many areas of the law, as we have seen, where Americans do not even perceive the sorts of privacy violations that seem to Europeans obviously present. The Europeans are right. At the end of the day, Americans do not really grasp the European idea of the protection of privacy.
IX. THE AMERICAN TRADITION: PROTECTING THE SANCTITY OF THE HOME

But does this mean that Americans don't understand the moral imperative of privacy in the creation of "personhood"? Such is the conclusion that commentators repeatedly draw, both in Europe and in the United States. Yet I hope it is clear that the problem is more complex than that. If Europeans protect "privacy," it is not because they understand universal moral truths that Americans fail to understand. It is because they live in societies that have been shaped by certain kinds of cultural expectations and certain kinds of egalitarian ideals. After many generations of experience, Europeans have come to value a certain kind of personhood: a kind of personhood founded in the commitment to a society in which every person, of every social station, has the right to put on a respectable public face; a society in which privacy rights are not just for royalty, but for everybody. This is a concept of personhood that has been formed by the peculiarities of continental culture and continental history, and it has produced a law of privacy that has been formed by the same culture and history. For persons who live in these continental cultures, there will always be some practices that seem, in an intuitively obvious way, to represent violations of privacy. Yet the same practices may not seem like violations at all to non-Europeans.

As for Americans: They have their own concepts of personhood, their own traditions, and their own values. And the consequence is that there will always be practices that intuitively seem to represent obvious violations to Americans. Most especially, state action will raise American hackles much more often than European ones.

This is indeed almost too obvious to need describing for American readers. Suspicion of the state has always stood at the foundation of American privacy thinking, and American scholarly writing and court doctrine continue to take it for granted that the state is the prime enemy of our privacy. To Americans, the starting point for the understanding of the right to privacy is of course to be sought in the late eighteenth century, and especially in the Bill of Rights, with its vigorous circumscription of state power. In particular, "privacy" begins with the Fourth Amendment: At its origin, the right to privacy is the right against unlawful searches and seizures. It is thus a right that inheres in us as free and sovereign political actors, masters in our own houses, which the state is ordinarily forbidden to invade. Over time, to the American mind, the early republican commitment to "privacy" has matured into a much more far-reaching right against state intrusion into our lives.

The classic statement of this American view came in 1886, at the same time that European scholars were developing their own characteristic ideas of privacy protections. The case was Boyd v. United States.300
In forbidding the government to seize the documents of a merchant in a customs case, the Supreme Court, after discussing the eighteenth-century background at length, issued an aggressive declaration of the "sanctity" of an American home. The court focused on a cause celebre of the eighteenth century: the case of John Wilkes, the British political dissenter whose papers had been seized by government agents.301 In 1762, Lord Camden had condemned such seizures in terms that helped inspire the
Page 221 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
American Bill of Rights. The Court rehearsed Camden's opinion-"a monument," as the Court put it302-and then continued:

The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employes of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offence . . . . Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation of that judgment.303

In later generations, the Supreme Court retreated from its uncompromising stance on the particular issue in Boyd, the government's access to papers.304 Nevertheless, Boyd's fundamental understanding of "privacy" rights as generalizations of the principle of the "sanctity of the home" has survived. Indeed, the standard history of modern American privacy rights should really begin, not with Warren and Brandeis's distant and dim echo of continental ideas, but with Boyd v. United States, four years earlier.

To be sure, American scholars and judges have repeatedly tried to graft a continental-style dignity standard on to this Fourth Amendment tradition. In the twentieth century, the most familiar attempt of this kind came from Louis Brandeis himself, by then a Supreme Court Justice, writing to dissent from a 1928 holding that wiretapping was not an invasion of privacy. Brandeis's famous dissent in that case, Olmstead v. United States, recast his 1890 "right to privacy" in a typically American way, as a Fourth Amendment matter.305 This dissent is cited often and enthusiastically by privacy advocates, but what is most remarkable about it is the way in which it lumped two distinct concepts of privacy together-only one of which had a clear basis in constitutional authority:

The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let alone-the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment.306

The "pursuit of happiness," if it need be said, is of course not a phrase from the Constitution.307 What Brandeis was able to identify was a core constitutional right against the state, which he tried-nobly, if you will-to extend well beyond its original circumstances. Later Fourth Amendment jurisprudence took the same tack-for example in Schmerber v. California, which described the Fourth Amendment as protecting "privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State."308 Here again, though, the reasoning was most emphatically about the state, with no discernible doctrinal content given to the "dignity" interest.

That tradition has now continued with Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court's striking 2002 Term opinion on homosexuality: "Liberty," the Lawrence opinion begins, "protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places."309 This is familiar, indeed well-worn, American language, but it is not the only language that the decision speaks. It also speaks the language of dignity: Lawrence insists movingly on the right of gays not to be "demeaned," on their right to enjoy respect.310 But once again, as has so long been the case, the Lawrence Court finds no doctrinal hook on which to hang its talk of "respect." There is language about respect in Lawrence, but there is little that can be said to count in any certain way as law. One wonders indeed whether "respect," as discussed by the Court in Lawrence, really has much future in American law. One hopes that it does. There is some
authority that insists on privacy protections for sexual orientation as an "intimate aspect of . . . personality."311 In other circumstances, too, dignity sometimes seems to play an authentically important role in the application of Fourth Amendment norms.312 History suggests, though, that such arguments will fade in American discourse with time. This makes the prospects for a constitutionalized right to gay marriage, for example, dim.

What matters in America, over the long run, is liberty against the state within the privacy of one's home. This does not mean that the American approach to "privacy" is narrowly limited to Fourth Amendment search and seizure problems, of course. Lawyers do ingenious things, and the conception of privacy as liberty within the sanctity of the home can be extended in important ways. This has been notably true, of course, in the famous series of "constitutional privacy" decisions that began with Griswold v. Connecticut.313 At the limit, for those who accept the reasoning in Roe v. Wade, the modern right to "privacy" is the right to keep the government from intervening in our "private" decision about whether or
Page 222 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
not to abort an unwanted fetus; just as for others it is the right to keep the government from taking away our firearms. When private actors breach the walls of our homes, they too may sometimes raise our legal hackles-like the much-cited New Hampshire landlord of Hamberger v. Eastman, who bugged his tenants' bedroom.314

Nevertheless, the fundamental limit on American thinking always remains: American "privacy" law, however ingenious its elaborations, always tends to imagine the home as the primary defense, and the state as the primary enemy. This gives American privacy law a distinctive coloration. Where American law perceives a threat to privacy, it is typically precisely because the state has become involved in the transaction. The case of Hanlon v. Berger-also commonly known as "the CNN case"-makes a  fine example.315 As we saw before, the Supreme Court found no violation of privacy rights when, in the Florida Star case, a newspaper published the name of a rape victim. The result was different in Hanlon: There the Court found a violation of privacy where a TV news crew went on a "ride-along" during a police raid. Once the police come into it, American intuitions shift. Another important example is Whalen v. Roe, the leading American informational privacy case.316 Predictably, that was a case involving government collection of private information. In general, the really easy cases in the American tradition are the ones involving, or resembling, criminal investigations.317 You can count on Americans to see privacy violations once the state gets into the act-in particular, where the issue can be somehow analogized to penetration into the home, or sometimes the body.318 Otherwise, you can never be sure. But you can count on
Americans to see violations once the state is involved, and that means that there will always be continental practices that seem acceptable to Europeans but objectionable to us.

This is certainly not, once again, because continental eyes perceive no dangers emanating from the state. There are continental protections against searches and the like, though in practice they are somewhat less extensive than American protections.319 There are also continental decisions like the well-known German census cases, which limited access to German census data.320 Continental observers certainly understand how to distrust the state in some cases, just as Americans certainly understand how to protect people, in some cases, from embarrassing appropriations of their image. The differences are relative, and not absolute, as always.

Nevertheless, they are real differences, and they do mean that there are always some continental practices that seem just as obviously untroubling to German or French people as they seem obviously wrong to Americans. I offered numerous examples at the beginning of this Article. For the sake of brevity, let me focus on just one before concluding: the law of names. Continental governments reserve to themselves the right to refuse to register certain given names that parents have chosen for their infants. This is done differently in different countries. In Germany, the local registry office, the Standesamt, maintains a list of permissible names.321 After reforms in 1993, the state has more limited powers in France. Today, local French officials can issue a complaint if parents choose a name that those officials deem to be not in the best interests of the newborn child. A court will then be seized of the matter, and will decide if the name is an acceptable one. If it rejects the parents' choice, the court itself is to choose a name for the infant in question, if necessary.322

These are practices that seem strange indeed to Americans-how can a judge name your baby?-but they are widely defended by Europeans. Most commonly, Europeans say that the state simply must intervene
to protect children against the stupidities of their parents. Indeed, to judge from my own conversations, the popular mind is vividly conscious of the problem of parental stupidity. It is a problem that is exemplified in particular, for ordinary Europeans, by the case of a French child named by her parents "Megane Renaud." "Megane" is the French version of the American name "Megan," one of a number of American names that became popular in France in the 1980s and 1990s.323 "Megane" is however also the name of a popular car model marketed by the French manufacturer Renault (pronounced in the same way as "Renaud"). Thus two bits of French popular culture came together in an unfortunate way when parents with the surname "Renaud" chose to call their newborn daughter "Megane." Eocal officials made a highly
publicized (though ultimately unsuccessful) intervention, apparently believing that it was too much to saddle a child with a name something like the equivalent of "Camry Toyota."324 There are other recent cases, too, in which parents have been prevented from giving their children names that are "ridiculous, pejorative, or in bad taste."325 One Belgian woman, for example, was recently forbidden to name her newborn "Anakin," after the character in the Star Wars movie series. Despite her threat to go on a hunger strike, officials decreed that her child was to be called "Dorian."326 There is even European human rights law on the issue. The case in question involved a French couple that chose to name their child "Fleur de Marie" ("Mary's Flower"), a name rejected by local officials on the ground that it was not a proper saint's name. That decision was litigated all the way to the European Court of Human Rights, which held, in 1996, with a Canadian judge dissenting, that the law of names did not represent a cognizable violation of the
right of privacy.327

All very strange to Americans. To be sure, the law of names has been loosening up, both in France and Germany. French law has eased up noticeably since the early 1990s.328 In the last few years, cases have been few in France-though the standard commentary to the Civil Code speculates that this may be
Page 223 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
because prelitigation interventions by officials are sufficient to discourage unacceptable names.329 As for
Germany: There, the most important challenges to the law of names came from the many resident
non-Germans wishing to give their children ethnic names. The German government responded essentially
by extending its list to include acceptable names for all recognized ethnic groups. These days, Germans
can theoretically pick any name that comes from some culture, as long as it appears in the official
"International Handbook of Given Names," is "according to its essence a given name" (family names
cannot be used as first names), and conforms to the sex of the child.330 This is certainly looser than the
regulation of the past-though in my experience, few Germans realize how much latitude they have. At any
rate, the European law of names is certainly not normally applied in a doctrinaire or draconian way. It is a
complex body of law, in a state of some flux, which deserves a longer treatment than I can give it here.

Nevertheless, however complex it may be, its very existence is simply weird to Americans. Indeed, if you tried to introduce a law of names into a state like Texas, you might face an armed rebellion.331 But does that mean that it is wrong or evil, by some universal standard, to have such a law of names? Europeans can see benefits in it-just as Americans can see benefits in extensive credit reporting. But the issue, here as in credit reporting, is not whether there are or are not identifiable benefits. The issue is whether a given privacy violation seems to fly in the face of fundamentally important social values. For Americans, the answer is very likely to be that the continental law of names does exactly that-flies in the face of important values of liberty. They may note that African Americans in particular, a historically oppressed population, express their independence partly through inventing unusual names for their children.332 But in any case, here as elsewhere, Americans will see an unacceptable violation of privacy where the state introduces itself into any "private" decision. Indeed, if drawn to defend themselves philosophically, Americans may
use exactly the same imposing language of "personhood" that Europeans use in defending their conceptions of privacy. Is not the name fundamental to the making of the person?
X. CONCLUSION

I will not try to answer that last question, because the correct concept of personhood is not what is at stake here. What is at stake are two different core sets of values: On the one hand, a European interest in personal dignity, threatened primarily by the mass media; on the other hand, an American interest in
liberty, threatened primarily by the government. On both sides of the Atlantic, these values are founded on deeply felt sociopolitical ideals, whose histories reach back to the revolutionary era of the later eighteenth century.

These different core values do not, to say it one last time, completely dictate the shape of the law on either side of the Atlantic. The contrast, like all such contrasts, is relative and not absolute. Moreover, there is no logical inconsistency in pursuing both forms of privacy protection: It is perfectly possible to advocate both privacy against the state and privacy against nonstate information gatherers-to argue that protecting privacy means both safeguarding the presentation of self and inhibiting the investigative and regulatory excesses of the state. Indeed, American advocates of privacy typically do just that, denouncing the threat
to "privacy" indiscriminately, as coming both from the state and from the media. There is nothing illogical in this.

Nevertheless, the emphases and sensibilities of the law on either side of the Atlantic remain stubbornly different, whatever careful philosophical logic might allow or dictate. Privacy law is not the product of logic. But neither is it the product of "experience" or of supposed "felt necessities" that are shared in all modern societies.333 It is the product of local social anxieties and local ideals. In the United States those anxieties and ideals focus principally on the police and other officials, and around the ambition "to secure the blessings of liberty," while on the Continent they focus on the ambition to guarantee everyone's position in society, to guarantee everyone's "honor." This was already true in 1791, in the French Revolution of Jerome Petion, and it remains true today.

This is not something we will ever understand if we do not get beyond the sort of shallow intuitionism that is the stuff of most of our privacy literature. Indeed, it is a basic error to try to explain or justify any aspect of the law by appealing to our unmediated intuitions about what seems evil or horrible. That kind of crude intuitionist approach has been rejected by most moral philosophers-most famously by John Rawls, who insisted that good moral reasoning is founded on a "reflective equilibrium" between intuitions and rational moral theory.334 Crude intuitionism is pretty much dead among moral philosophers, and it ought to be dead in the law too. Indeed, if anything, that sort of intuitionism is less acceptable in the law than it is in
other realms of moral reasoning. In liberal Western societies, law is regarded as a weapon of last resort, to be drawn only when authentically fundamental values of society are at stake. This has a consequence that deserves to be stated over and over again: It is in the very nature of being a member of a liberal society that one must live with many things that seem horrible. If the sort of arguments mounted by privacy advocates were valid, many things indeed would be forbidden. Take only the example of adultery. One could easily offer an argument about adultery that took the same form as the arguments commonly offered in our privacy literature: Picture, one might say, your spouse having sex with someone else. Isn't it
horrible? Horrible it may be, for most of us. But that does not decide the question of what the law should
Page 224 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
do about adultery. To decide that question, we must reflect on other, larger values-most particularly, on values of liberty.

The same is true of the law of privacy. We cannot simply start by asking ourselves whether privacy violations are intuitively horrible or nightmarish. The job is harder than that. We have to identify the fundamental values that are at stake in the "privacy" question as it is understood in a given society. The task is not to realize the true universal values of "privacy" in every society. The law puts more limits on us than that: The law will not work as law unless it seems to people to embody the basic commitments of their society. In practice, this means that the real choice, in the Atlantic world at least, is between social
traditions strongly oriented toward liberty and social traditions strongly oriented toward dignity. This is a choice that goes well beyond the law of privacy: It is a choice that involves all the areas of law that touch, more or less nearly, on questions of dignity.

We can respond to this choice by refusing to make it: We can opt for a world in which societies just do things differently. For example, we can declare that American gays can realistically expect only to have their liberty rights protected. The prospects for the kind of dignitary protections embodied in a law of gay marriage, we could say, are remote. After all, protecting people's dignity is quite alien to the American tradition. Or we can do what most moral philosophers want to do: We can reject the notion that different societies should have differing standards. But if we take that tack, we must face the fact that we will not succeed in changing either world unless we embark on a very large-scale revaluation of legal values.

In truth, there is little reason to suppose that Americans will be persuaded to think of their world of values in a European way any time soon; American law simply does not endorse the general norm of personal dignity found in Europe. Nor is there any greater hope that Europeans will embrace the American ideal; the law of Europe does not recognize many of the antistatist concerns that Americans seem to take for
granted. Of course we are all free to plead for a different kind of law-in Europe or in the United States. But pleading for privacy as such is not the way to do it. There is no such thing as privacy as such. The battle, if it is to be fought, will have to be fought over more fundamental values than that.

Privacy advocates often like to claim that all modern societies feel the same intuitive need to protect privacy. Yet it is clear that intuitive sensibilities about privacy differ from society to society, even as between the closely kindred societies of the US and Europe. Some of the differences involve questions of everyday behavior, such as whether or not one may appear nude in public. But many involve the law. In fact, there are major legal conflicts between the countries on either side of the Atlantic - conflicts over questions like the protection of consumer data, the use of discovery in civil procedure, the public exposure
of criminal offenders, and more. Clearly the idea that there are universal human sensibilities about privacy, which ought to serve as the basis of a universal law of privacy, cannot be right. This article explores these conflicts, trying to show that European privacy norms are founded on French and German ideas of
personal honor.

HD             WSJE: Microsoft's Sun Deal Could Undermine  EU Challenge

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) deal with rival Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) in the U.S. could undermine its challenge of part of last week's landmark  antitrust ruling against Microsoft in Europe, lawyers and competitors said.

TD
To try to freeze the ruling by the European Commission, which requires it to share information with competitors to let their servers be more compatible with Microsoft systems, the company would have to convince a European court that its business would be irreparably harmed by such a move. But the deal  Microsoft made with Sun involves just such information-sharing.

"If  Microsoft has found a way to share the information with its arch-enemy, doesn't that prove that the (commission) decision isn't going to cause irreparable harm?" asked Stephen Kinsella, an antitrust partner at law firm Herbert Smith in Brussels.

(This report and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, WSJ.com.)

One person close to  Microsoft rival Novell Inc. (NOVL) also predicted the U.S. deal would make it harder for Microsoft to challenge the commission's order. Sun was the company that originally brought the complaint about  Microsoft's lack of compatibility to the commission, and Novell also testified against  Microsoft.

For years, Microsoft told European  antitrust regulators investigating its business practices that forcing it to hand over information to its competitors would amount to an excessive disclosure of its intellectual property. The commission nevertheless handed down its order last week, along with a record 497 million euro ($1=EUR0.80959)  fine for the company's past practices.

The fine also applies to Microsoft's use of its Windows program to gain an edge in multimedia players over rivals such as RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK). That part of the case wouldn't be affected by the U.S. deal. The commission gave the company 90 days to offer personal computer manufacturers the option of installing a version of Windows with another media player in place of  Microsoft's product.

In the server part of the case,  Microsoft could try to use the Sun deal as a template to meet the commission's order that the company work out information-sharing agreements with rivals and
submit them to an arbiter within 120 days. One traditional  Microsoft supporter said the deal could be used that way to help resolve demands by Novell and other companies, including backers of the
open-source Linux operating system.

"The resolution of Sun's issues before the  European Commission should pave the way to a reasonable settlement of that ongoing litigation," said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, referring to a  Microsoft appeal. ACT is a Washington, D.C.-based

Page 226 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
advocacy group that testified on  Microsoft's behalf in hearings on the EU  antitrust case late last year.

The company declined to comment on its plans for an appeal of the commission's decision to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. But two people familiar with Microsoft's thinking said the deal shouldn't be used a template to meet the commission's order, and that Microsoft would still seek to freeze and then overturn the commission's order, despite its arrangement with Sun.

"There's a big difference between a reciprocal arrangement in which two companies share technology and intellectual property with carefully negotiated provisions and a unilaterally compulsory licensing mandated by a government," said one person close to  Microsoft. The Sun deal was the result of "a very specific set of circumstances, claims and counter-claims," this person said. Sun has been fighting  Microsoft in U.S. courts for years, and had been due to go to court in a case involving Sun's Java software.

Open-source software advocates said it was unclear how the settlement between Sun and Mircosoft would affect the Linux operating system and other software initiatives that no one company controls.

"It remains to be seen how they reconcile their Linux plans with this," said Jeremy Allison, co-creator of Samba, a software program that provides file and print services to network computers.

In addition to computers running Sun's own software, Sun sells desktop PCs that run Linux and need to be able to integrate seamlessly in a network that includes Windows-based servers.

Several observers said the Sun-Microsoft settlement vindicates the commission's long-running case. "The commission could perhaps claim credit for making  Microsoft ready to settle" with Sun, said Kinsella, the  antitrust lawyer.

Microsoft still insists it provides rivals enough information to ensure compatibility with Windows computers without the extra details demanded by European  antitrust regulators.

But Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman and chief executive, said the settlement would give it a competitive advantage that it didn't have before. "Without the collaborationthe guarantees you can give a customer are much more tenuous," he told a news conference in San Francisco.

HD          A Compromise in Microsoft Case? --- European Judge Vesterdorf Has Brokered  Solutions In
Past Appeals Processes

LUXEMBOURG -- The judge who would rule on  Microsoft Corp.'s bid to suspend tough European antitrust sanctions raised the prospect that the court could instead broker a compromise to take effect while the company's appeal continues.

Bo Vesterdorf, the president of the European Union's Court of First Instance, didn't talk about the Microsoft case directly. But, in an interview, he explained his views on deciding on suspension requests. He said that companies succeed in winning a suspension of sanctions only about one in 10 times, and that he was disposed to look for alternative solutions.

TD
"I can set up a hearing very quickly. At the hearing I seek clarification of all points. I also want to point out that this process can open up other opportunities," he said.

Brussels-based legal experts believe Mr. Vesterdorf does have the power to knock heads together. "It wouldn't be the first time the court has called parties down to Luxembourg and brokered a compromise to avoid the uncertainty of litigation," said Stephen Kinsella, a Brussels-based  antitrust partner at law firm Herbert Smith.

Last week,  antitrust regulators of the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found Microsoft guilty of abusing its monopoly in operating systems to gain an unfair advantage in selling multimedia software and servers. The regulators  fined Microsoft 497 million euros ($612 million) and ordered it to change its methods in Europe. They said they would seek a precedent that would keep Microsoft from using similar strategies to gain an edge in other products.

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement with regulators to avoid a guilty finding, and now plans to apply to freeze the ruling and start an appeals process that could take several years. If the company is successful in winning the suspension, rivals that brought the case to the commission say they will be harmed more than Microsoft would be if the ruling stands. The commission could face lengthy uncertainty over whether its years of investigation would produce any results.

In the alternative scenario, Mr. Vesterdorf said, the court would supervise an interim arrangement. "The parties would agree to these arrangements in a document that's certified by the court. In the meantime, the company withdraws its request for a suspension of the commission order," he said. He said he had overseen such efforts before, but declined to offer examples.

A lawyer for the  European Commission who has dealt with dozens of cases in Mr. Vesterdorf's court said the judge often has tried to broker such solutions in lower-profile suspension hearings, but with limited results. Mr. Vesterdorf has been the court's president since 1998.

Neither Microsoft nor commission officials had any comment on the judge's statements, though Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said after the breakdown of talks that he still hoped "to settle the case at a later stage." The Redmond, Wash., company has declined to elaborate.

As president of the court, Mr. Vesterdorf alone would decide on a suspension or other solution. For an appeal, he would appoint a panel of judges, which he said could number from five to 11 for a complex case such as Microsoft. He said on the suspension question, he would hear from third parties such as governments and rival companies that could demonstrate a stake in the outcome.

He also said he might issue a temporary stay in a case in which the company's suspension request and deadline for it to comply with commission orders were close together. That's the case with Microsoft. Its deadline to request a suspension is in two months, while it must offer PC manufacturers Windows without a media-player program within 90 days and offer more networking code to its rivals in
120 days.

Mr. Vesterdorf said to win a suspension, a company would have to show its case for appeal was strong, that it would suffer "irreparable harm" and that the "balance of interests" was in its favor. In some cases, he said, the difficulty of calculating financial losses to a company that was forced to carry through EU orders could weigh in the company's favor.

HD          UPDATE 3-Sun, Microsoft settle long-running disputes. BY          By Duncan Martell

LP
SAN FRANCISCO, April 2 (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. Friday settled their bitter antitrust battles, uniting the two rivals to take on the increasingly popular Linux operating system.

The settlement includes  Microsoft payments of $2 billion to Sun, which has had 11 straight quarters of declining revenues. Sun also said Friday that it would cut its work force by 10 percent.

TD
For Microsoft, the resolution, along with the recent  European Commission decision to fine Microsoft around $600 million in penalties on its practices in Europe, allows it to address its growing $53 billion cash pile. Microsoft had said it would hold onto its cash while the threat of major litigation remained.

Both companies are facing stiff  competition from upstart Linux, the operating system that can be copied and modified freely, in the market for server software used to run networked computers that power large businesses.

"Sun and  Microsoft have a common enemy: Linux," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst Enderle Group in San Jose, California. "They are seeing each other as less of a threat and, together, facing a common threat."
Shares of Sun were up about 18 percent, while shares of  Microsoft were up 3 percent in afternoon
Nasdaq trade.

The settlement, which resolves the bitter rivalry between Sun Chief Executive Scott McNealy and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, will give customers who were thinking of moving to Linux a reason to stay with Sun and  Microsoft, analysts said.

Under the agreement, the two companies' basic technologies will now work more smoothly with one another. Sun's computer servers as well as its widely used Java software will work better with Microsoft's Windows software, the companies said. Sun had filed an  antitrust suit and sued the world's largest software company over its Java software.

Microsoft will pay $700 million to resolve pending  antitrust issues and $900 million to resolve patent issues.

In addition, Sun and  Microsoft have agreed to pay royalties for use of each other's technology. Microsoft will make an initial payment of $350 million, and Sun will make payments when its uses the technology in its computer servers.

"Things are happening so quickly in the technology industry that this kind of enmity between the companies was kind of yesterday's news," said Henry Asher, president of New York-based money management firm Northstar Group. "It increases the probability of Sun's success but doesn't guarantee it."

Sun's McNealy called the resolution a huge step forward. "Everywhere we go our customers say, 'We have both Sun technology and  Microsoft technology - we need peace,'" he said in a conference call.
OUTLOOK CUT

While investors applauded the settlement news and 3,300 job cuts, Sun said it expects its quarterly loss, excluding charges, to be wider than Wall Street had expected.

Jonathan Schwartz, who Friday was named Sun's president and chief operating officer, told analysts on a conference call that the realities of business carried the day over acrimony between the two companies.

Sun had supported a European Union case against  Microsoft. In the EU ruling last week,  Microsoft was told to change the way features are bundled into its software and share more information about its server software code.

Sun only recently embraced the Linux operating system and began using Intel Corp. chips in its computer servers, in addition to Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s Opteron processors. But Sun's business is still largely based on its own proprietary microchips and its version of the Unix operating system, Solaris, which competes with Linux.

"Sun is a company in transition," said Martin Reynolds, an analyst at Gartner Inc. "They have to move away from their proprietary platform."

Sun said it expects a net loss for the third quarter ended March 28 of $750 million to $810 million, or 23 cents to 25 cents a share, on revenue of $2.65 billion. The loss will include approximately $200 million for work force and real estate restructuring.

Excluding the charge, Sun expects a loss of 6 cents to 8 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting a loss of 3 cents a share, according to Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Group Plc. Analysts had forecast revenue of $2.83 billion.

The company said that it expects to take a total charge of $475 million related to the restructuring. The move comes after being pressured by analysts and investors to cut more jobs to bring costs in line with lower revenue.

Shares of Sun were up 74 cents, or 17.7 percent, to $4.93 in midday trade on Nasdaq, and whiles shares of Microsoft were up 75 cents to $25.83.

SEATTLE, April 2 (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems' $2 billion  antitrust lawsuit settlement with  Microsoft Corp. on Friday has removed a major reason for the world's largest software maker to continue hoarding its $53 billion cash pile, analysts said.

The settlement, along with last week's decision by the  European Commission to fine Microsoft 497 million euros ($603 million) and change the way it ships software, "clears the decks to deal with its cash position," said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Charles Di Bona.

Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft has long said it would retain cash while the threat of major litigation remained, but investors are clamoring for it to return money to them.

At the end of 2003,  Microsoft (MSFT.O) had $52.8 billion in cash, which grew nearly $2.4 billion per quarter that year.

In February, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors promised the company would offer clearer direction on Microsoft's cash plans by its annual analysts meeting at the end of July.
"At this point, they better come through with something meaningful," Di Bona said.

Last year, Microsoft paid its first dividend since going public in 1986 in response to pressure from shareholders. It later doubled the annual payout to 16 cents a share.

"Investors are going to be more eager for  Microsoft to make a move toward a stepped-up dividend," said Alan Davis, analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.
Friday's settlement calls for  Microsoft to pay Sun (SUNW.O) $700 million to resolve  antitrust issues,
$900 million to resolve patent issues and $350 million in royalty fees. Combined, it represents about 3
percent of  Microsoft's cash on hand.
Asked about  Microsoft's cash position after announcing the settlement,  Microsoft chief executive
Steve Ballmer said the company is still "not clear of litigation."

"Obviously, this is another step forward and our board will be able to take a look at things in that light," Ballmer told reporters.

Since settling the U.S. government's landmark  antitrust case against it in late 2002,  Microsoft has steadily resolved its lawsuits by paying large settlements to its legal adversaries.
So far,  Microsoft has settled class actions in nine states and the District of Columbia for more than
$1.5 billion. It paid $750 million to America Online in a Web browser dispute.

Other, pending issues, include its expected appeal over the European Commission ruling. Current patent-related litigation has more than $500 million at stake. Microsoft also faces a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit by RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK.O), its rival for digital media player software. ($1=0.824 euros) (Additional reporting by Duncan Martell in San Francisco).

Sun Microsystems announced Friday that it has moved to a new phase of legal and technical cooperation with longtime foe  Microsoft that will involve a payment of
$1.95 billion to Sun.

Sun also said Friday that it plans to cut 3,300 jobs after it issued an earnings warning. The company now sees deeper-than-expected losses for the quarter that just ended.

TD
In addition, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company named Jonathan Schwartz, 38, previously executive vice president of software, as president and chief operating officer. Previously, Chief Executive Scott McNealy had said the company didn't need to fill the position after the departure of Ed Zander in 2002.

Under the 10-year pact with  Microsoft, the software company will pay Sun $700 million to resolve  antitrust issues and $900 million to resolve patent issues, the companies said. The companies will pay royalties to use each other's technology;  Microsoft is paying $350
million now, with Sun to make payments when it incorporates technology later.

"Our companies will continue to compete hard, but this agreement creates a new basis for cooperation that will benefit the customers of both companies,"  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said.

The executives said that they had been working on the deal for a year since McNealy had made a call to his Microsoft counterpart. In a press conference in San Francisco on Friday, Ballmer addressed the issue of
why it took so long to finish the deal, which was wrapped up only a few hours earlier.

"I think we were close in December," he said. "We needed a little bit more creativity."

For Microsoft, the deal with Sun is the latest settlement it has struck with a key rival. Last May, the company inked a $750 million deal with America Online to drop pending litigation, share technology and jointly distribute

Page 236 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
software. And in 1997, the software maker and Apple agreed to settle their differences.
A $1 billion antitrust suit filed by RealNetworks in
December, however, is still pending.

Ballmer said that the deal with Sun was not driven by events in Europe, where regulators last week levied a record fine on Microsoft in an antitrust decision that also seeks changes in the way the company offers its software.

"I think you need to completely separate the two things," Ballmer said at the press conference.

Complaints from Sun had been a key factor behind the European action, but with Friday's deal, the company backed down from its earlier claims. Sun said that the points of the agreement "satisfy the objectives" it was pursuing in the European Commission's case against Microsoft.

Lawyers said the Sun settlement will bolster Microsoft's efforts to get a stay, or temporary hold, in the antitrust decision. That's because the deal allows the software giant to argue that there is no need to rush forward with regulators' remedies for server interoperability, before
the case can be heard in a European appeals court.

"This will strengthen  Microsoft's hand in arguing for a stay. I don't think there is any way this can't help them," said Chris Compton, an  antitrust attorney with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. "It will also put pressure on RealNetworks to settle their case against  Microsoft.
And if they do, the Court of First Instance may get out of the line of fire and say they will not require any
remedies, until the case is formally heard."

The judge in the Court of First Instance is expected to hold a hearing in the coming weeks on whether to grant Microsoft a stay. A trial, however, is not likely for years.

"This settlement could be the first domino to fall in resolving Microsoft's problems with the  European        Commission," Compton said.
Broad pact with  Microsoft

The goal of the technical collaboration between Sun and Microsoft is to improve interoperability between the companies' respective products, according to Sun.

"This is a big day for customers. Everywhere we go customers say we have Sun and  Microsoft technology and we need interoperability. We need peace," McNealy said.

As to how the peace treaty came to pass after years of Sun complaining about  Microsoft's behavior, McNealy gave several possible reasons.

"Maybe we've grown up. Maybe they've grown up. Who knows?" he said. "Maybe the customers have gotten more in charge."

The Sun executive also challenged the crowd at the press conference to find customers who don't like the


Page 237 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
deal. He acknowledged, though, that there might be some fretting.

"There may have been a few customers who were a little shaky," McNealy said.

The 10-year technical collaboration will encompass several facets, designed to improve information sharing between the companies' server and desktop products.

The companies will share technical information to allow their respective security products, namely their directories and identity servers, to work together. The agreement could also be expanded to e-mail and database software, the companies said.

Sun will also license access to the Windows desktop communications protocols under a program initiated as a result of  Microsoft's settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2002.

Microsoft will be allowed to continue to provide technical support for customers using its Java virtual machine, the software needed to run Java programs. The companies also vowed to work to improve technical collaboration between Sun's Java software and Microsoft's .Net programming technology.

Sun also said that its servers based on Intel Xeon and AMD Opteron processors have been certified to run Windows.

As part of the deal, the companies have agreed to not to sue over past patent infringement claims they may have against each other. That agreement can also be expanded to cover future situations. In addition, the companies have agreed to discuss a patent
cross-licensing agreement.
Ups and downs for Sun

Sun, which chiefly sells powerful networked computers, called servers, has been struggling to return to the profitability that rivals such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft enjoy. The company already has suffered 12 straight quarters of shrinking revenue after previously enthusiastic customers from the late 1990s curtailed spending and embraced technology Sun didn't support.

Sun now has made several dramatic changes, including the embrace of x86 processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices alongside Sun's own UltraSparc chips
and the lukewarm adoption of the Linux operating system alongside Sun's Solaris.

McNealy put the moves in a positive light: "Now is the appropriate time to take cost out and drive productivity improvements in anticipation of returning Sun to sustained profitability," he said.

"Over the past three years we have made substantial progress in reducing cost and capacity," McNealy said. "We completely revamped our product line, leveraging open source and industry economics while improving product quality and availability. And, we have
re-energized our channels and developer communities."


Page 238 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
McNealy and Sun Chief Financial Officer Steve McGowan refused to say whether product issues, broader economic problems or other factors affected the quarter's financial results. They promised details when the company reports full results April 15.
McGowan said in a conference call Friday morning that
Sun expects to reduce R&D and administrative
expenses by $500 million from about $5.2 billion in fiscal
2004, which ends June 30, to $4.7 billion in fiscal 2005.

The Microsoft payments will be recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter, McGowan said.

Offsetting the payments will be a charge of about $475 million total spread over upcoming quarters, including the charge of about $200 million for the third quarter, to pay for the restructuring and reductions in product portfolio, Sun said.
A deeper loss

For its fiscal third quarter, which ended Sunday, Sun expects revenue of $2.65 billion and a net loss of $710 million to $810 million, or 23 cents to 25 cents per share. The loss includes charges of about $350 million for an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and about $200 million to restructure its work force and real estate, Sun said.

Excluding the charges, the loss would have been $200 million to $260 million, or 6 to 8 cents per share. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thompson First Call was less pessimistic: a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $2.85 billion.

The company says it has more than 35,000 employees worldwide, so the layoffs account for about 9 percent of its work force. The job cuts will affect all divisions and geographic areas, McGowan said. The majority of cuts will take place by the end of September, he added. Sun already had cut 8,500 employees in two major layoffs in
2001 and 2002.

Schwartz's role, meanwhile, won't be ceremonial, McNealy said on a conference call. "He will be driving the product, sales, marketing and manufacturing efforts at Sun with a huge, hands-on chief operating officer role at Sun. This is a good thing," McNealy said.

Asked what he plans to do with Sun's billions in cash, McNealy said, "It's going to sit there, and we're going to continue to say we've got the best cost structure of any non-investment grade company you've seen." Standard
& Poor's in March lowered Sun's credit rating to "junk" status.

Making amends

Longtime foes Sun Microsystems and  Microsoft reached several agreements that will result in payments to Sun of nearly $2 billion. Here are some of the main points:


Page 239 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
â¢  Legal settlements: Microsoft will pay $700 million, and Sun will withdraw its antitrust lawsuit in the United States.

â¢  Patents:  Microsoft will pay $900 million to Sun as part of a broad agreement not to sue each other over past patent infringement claims. They also are seeking a patent cross-license agreement.

â¢  Technical collaboration: The companies will have access to each other's server technology, enabling their products to work together. Initially, the technology sharing will include Windows but will expand to include
e-mail and database software.  Microsoft will initially pay Sun $350 million, while Sun could later make payments, as it incorporates  Microsoft technology.

â¢  Communications protocols: Sun will license communications protocols for the Windows desktop OS under terms established through the consent decree with the Department of Justice.

â¢  Java support: The companies will work together to improve technical collaboration between Sun's Java and Microsoft's .Net technologies.

â¢  Certification: A Windows certification for Sun's Xeon servers will be created.

The European Commission was clear in its judgement that  Microsoft had broken antitrust laws, but will the ruling make any difference?

Competition commissioner Mario Monti reminded us of  Microsoft's dominance with 95 per cent of the
PC operating system market, and said it should have supplied connectivity information to third parties.

TD
He also accused Microsoft of 'tieing', effectively forcing consumers to buy Windows Media Player.

The fine of &euro;497m (Â£335m) to the EU, the equivalent of &euro;4 (Â£2.70) per online PC in Europe, looks huge.

But with a war chest of $51bn (Â£28.3bn), Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer - who will appeal - won't be losing any sleep over the fine.

But how will this affect  Microsoft's market position? Original equipment manufacturers can now offer preinstalled alternatives to Windows Media Player.
HP is doing this with iTunes. Apple and Real Networks will be on manufacturers' doorsteps to offer
QuickTime and RealPlayer respectively.

This could hurt  Microsoft as consumers start to turn their home PCs into entertainment centres that play music downloads and video clips.

But Microsoft need not worry too much. Regardless of the strides made by RealPlayer, QuickTime and DivX, content companies - including Disney and Napster - have already committed to MS DRM and Media Player.
If the EC had given its ruling two years ago, the likes of Apple and Real would have had a chance.

Now it is too late, especially as an appeal will give  Microsoft the opportunity to buy another few years of undisturbed Media Player sales.

Consumers will continue to vote with their browser by (unknowingly) downloading Media Player with their first bit of licensed content - just as happened with Explorer a few years ago.
If the ruling doesn't change the dominance of Media Player, why did the Commission bother? Monti also stated that he wanted to set "principles for future conduct". There's the rub.
This ruling is really about Longhorn,  Microsoft's next major consumer operating system scheduled for release in 2006.
Rather than trying to correct  Microsoft for the same offences through a meticulous but slow process in
2008, the Commission is launching a pre-emptive strike.
Monti wants  Microsoft to develop two versions of Longhorn: a standard one shrink-wrapped with all the
Microsoft bells and whistles, and a bare-boned version that other vendors can dress up.

This measure would create the level playing field that the Commission is looking for, to give consumers a real choice of applications such as browsers, streamers and even spreadsheets.

But will the playing field be level? Forrester believes not. First, platoons of experienced programmers will be working together in Redmond to create the integrated pack, while tens of scattered vendors will be struggling to decipher  Microsoft's integration manual.
Guess who will be first to market, with the best integrated package?

Second, consumers don't care.  Microsoft has a 71 per cent brand recognition among Europeans, and 27 per cent trust the brand.

These consumers will have to choose between a full-blown package from their trusted supplier, or a patchwork of products from unknown and distrusted vendors. Tough choice.

The pre-emptive strike won't work either. As long as the PC maintains its position as the generic utility for work, communication and fun,  Microsoft will maintain its dominance.

Only when these functions are spread across devices such as mobiles and set-top boxes (forget intelligent fridges), will other vendors get a chance.

The eventual contenders will be Sony and Symbian, and they'll be moving in fast. Monti's pre-emptive strike might even be unnecessary.
And the European consumer? Well, we'll have saved ourselves &euro;497m in European taxes. Jaap Favier is research director at Forrester Research.

HD            WSJ UPDATE: Microsoft,Sun Bury Hatchet With $2B Agreement

By Don Clark and Robert A. Guth
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones)--With nearly $2 billion in cash, and an exchange of hockey jerseys, two of technology's worst enemies today said they were burying the hatchet - at least in the courtroom.

TD
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to make the big payment to rival Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW), and begin a broad technology collaboration to help their products work together. Sun agreed to drop
an antitrust suit against  Microsoft, and said the agreement satisfies objectives it has been seeking in a high-profile antitrust proceeding against  Microsoft by European regulators.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)

Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive, and  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, said the companies will continue to compete in some areas. But they stressed that the initial collaboration may be only a beginning, as they begin mapping out broader areas of cooperation.

"There is the potential that this is Phase One," McNealy said during a news conference here, which was kicked off by the exchange of Detroit Red Wings jerseys by the two CEOs, who attended rival high schools in the Motor City's suburbs.

The surprise rapprochement represents a sharp strategy shift for Sun, a struggling maker of computer servers that has been  Microsoft's biggest critic and toughest legal opponent. Underscoring the pressures on the company, Sun simultaneously announced that it would cut 3,300 jobs and projected larger losses than expected for its third fiscal quarter.

But investors welcomed the news, sending Sun's shares up more than 20%. The stock traded at 4 p.m. at $5.06, up 87 cents, on Nasdaq.  Microsoft's shares gained 77 cents to $25.85.

Microsoft agreed to pay Sun $700 million to resolve  antitrust issues. Microsoft also agreed to pay Sun $900 million more to resolve issues concerning patents. In addition, Microsoft is making an additional up-front payment of $350 million, as an initial part of a new arrangement whereby each company will pay royalties for use of the other's technology.

Sun, of Santa Clara, Calif., has been one of Silicon Valley's technology leaders since the early 1980s. The company entered a major growth phase during the Internet bubble, only to crash when
companies stopped buying its server systems during the ensuing slump.

One of Sun's best-known innovations is Java, a software technology that was designed to create programs that could work with little modification on computers running any operating system. Microsoft licensed Java, but the relationship soured; Sun filed a suit in 1997 that accused  Microsoft of violating the contract by making a version of Java that was designed to work only with Windows.

Page 244 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That suit was settled, but Microsoft's tactics against Java became a key part of the Department of Justice's long-running antitrust suit against Microsoft. The issues and court findings in that case, in turn, became a legal foundation for Sun's antitrust case against Microsoft, which was filed after Microsoft settled with the government in 2002.

In late 1998, Sun filed a complaint with the European Commission over a different issue - the ability of Sun to make its server systems exchange information with Microsoft's Windows operating system, particularly on personal computers. Last month, the European regulators said they would  fine            Microsoft more than $600 million and ordered  Microsoft to give up technical information to help competitors.  Microsoft plans to appeal that ruling.

Sun officials said the private settlement with Microsoft would provide much more information than they had sought in the European case. Microsoft will initially share information about the PC and server versions of Windows, but will later add data about products such as electronic mail and database software, the companies said.

The agreement also gives Sun, which had more than $5 billion in cash and about $1.2 billion of long-term debt in December, an infusion of cash as the company's business continues to struggle. Last month, Standard & Poor's cut Sun's corporate-debt rating to speculative, or junk, levels.
Mending fences with  Microsoft could reverse Sun's market share losses, said Megan
Graham-Hackett, an equity analyst at S&P. She rates Sun at "neutral" and doesn't own the stock.
However, it will require an about-face for Sun, since much of its sales pitch has been anti-Microsoft,
she added.

Indeed, McNealy turned bashing Microsoft into an art form, describing Windows as a "welded-shut hairball" and blaming other Microsoft products for many security problems and computer viruses. His term for Microsoft Outlook, for example, is usually "look out."

"If McNealey can say Outlook instead of 'look out' that will be a step forward," said Thomas Murphy, an analyst at Meta Group.

During the press conference, McNealy said customers had been demanding that he stop the harsh rhetoric and begin to make products that worked well with  Microsoft's.
"Maybe we've grown up," McNealy said. "Maybe they've grown up."

Customers were making similar demands on  Microsoft about putting legal troubles behind the company. "There is nothing in this - nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing -that will do anything other than delight customers," Ballmer said.

The settlement, at a minimum, removes one of the remaining legal risks that had kept the world's largest software company from distributing more of its cash hoard, which was about $53 billion at the end of December, to its investors.

Microsoft has been trying to dispense with its legal troubles. In May 2003, for example,  Microsoft agreed to pay $750 million to end an  antitrust lawsuit brought by Time Warner Inc. (TWX) on behalf of its America Online division. RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) still has a pending suit against the company.

The cost of Friday's settlement with Sun is higher than analysts expected, but could help  Microsoft afford a dividend hike or share repurchase. The deal "further clears the way for the company to address its cash situation," said Charles DiBona, analyst at Sanford Bernstein.

Despite the public animosity, McNealy said he had been friends with Ballmer for years. Last June, he invited McNealy to a round of golf to open the door to discussions about how the companies could improve their relations.

The talks that followed were complicated by the years of distrust between the companies, as well as the complex legal and technical issues involved. Though they had never battled over patents before, for example, officials of both companies said they realized they could not move forward to address other concerns unless they came up with a scheme to compensate each other for intellectual property they would exchange. Under the settlement, the companies agreed to not sue each other with respect to past infringement claims, and provides for future negotiations for a cross-license agreement between the companies.

One of the immediate benefits to Sun, its executives said, would be long-sought information that could allow a user to log on once to multiple systems, running either Sun or  Microsoft software. Sun and

Page 245 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft said they would collaborate to allow identity information to be easily exchanged between two competing products,  Microsoft Active Directory and Sun Java System Identity Server.

They did not reach a broad agreement on how to address Java, though they said  Microsoft may continue supporting a version of Java it developed. They agreed to work together to certify use of Windows on Sun's servers, so that customers can install the software if they wish.

In an interview, Ballmer and McNealy said their relationship may not be as close as that between Microsoft some Sun rivals, such as Dell Inc. (DELL). That is partly because Sun continues to make software that will compete with  Microsoft's, they said. "Our customers do not want us to stop competing," McNealy said.

Meanwhile, analysts said that the deal won't immediately reduce the short-term financial pressures on Sun. The company said it expects a loss for the fiscal period ended March 28 of between $750 million and $810 million, or 23 cents to 25 cents a share. That figure includes charges of $350 million for an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and about $200 million for work force and real estate restructuring.

Excluding those charges, it predicted the loss per share would be 6 cents to 8 cents, compared with analysts' average estimate on that basis of 3 cents, according to Thomson First Call. Sun put revenue at about $2.65 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $2.85 million.

The job cuts, which represent about 9% of Sun's work force of more than 35,000, are expected to lead to a charge of about $475 million spread over the next several quarters, including the $200 million charge in the third quarter.

In another move, Sun promoted Jonathan Schwartz to president and chief operating officer. He had been Sun's executive vice president for software. McNealy, the company's co-founder, will retain the chairman and chief executive posts.

HD            Sun rises as Microsoft agrees $2bn settlement

MICROSOFT, the world's largest software company, yesterday agreed to pay almost $2 billion
(Pounds 1.1 billion) to settle a long-running legal dispute with its rival Sun Microsystems, a
loss-making computer hardware and software business.

Sun announced the settlement at the same time as it unveiled a major overhaul of its operations, including plans to cut the jobs of 3,300 employees, or about 10 per cent of its workforce.

TD
Shares of the company, which has suffered 11 consecutive quarters of declining sales, rose by more than 11 per cent.

Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman and chief executive, described both developments as "a huge step forward".

Sun and Microsoft have long been bitter enemies because of a dispute over patents and Sun's complaints that Microsoft had sought to sabotage its Java software. It has described the world's largest software company as "an unrepentent monopolist".

Microsoft, which was last month found to have illegally abused its monopoly by European regulators and forced to pay a record $497 million  fine, will pay Sun $700 million to resolve pending  antitrust issues and $900 million to resolve patent issues.
"It puts peace on the table in a big way," Mr McNealy said.
"Everywhere we go, our customers say: 'We have both Sun technology and  Microsoft technology
-we need peace'."

Sun and Microsoft have also agreed to pay royalties for the use of each other's technology. Microsoft will make an initial payment of $350 million, and Sun will make payments when using the technology in its computer servers.

Steve Ballmer,  Microsoft's billionaire chief executive, said: "Our companies will continue to compete hard, but this agreement creates a new basis for co operation that will benefit the customers of both companies."

Sun was the original instigator of the  European Commission's case against  Microsoft, complaining in 2000 that its rival was using a dominant position in the desktop computer market to leverage a greater share of the market for servers, which power large computer networks used by companies.

Microsoft denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal the Commission's ruling to the European
Court in Luxembourg.
Separately, Sun had sued  Microsoft for $1 billion in a private anti-trust case. That case will now end as part of the new agreement.


Page 247 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr McNealy, who founded Sun in 1982, has suffered sharp criticism from Wall Street over his strategy at the company, which has been losing market share to Dell and Hewlett-Packard.

Sun's products operate on the Unix operating system, while Dell and HP sell cheaper servers which operate on Microsoft's Windows software.

Sun said it expected a net loss for the third quarter to March 28 of between $750 million and $810 million, on revenues of $2.65 billion.
The loss will include approximately $200 million for work force and real estate restructuring. (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2004

San Francisco CA

Sun Microsystems Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. yesterday settled their bitter  antitrust battles, uniting the two rivals to take on the increasingly popular Linux operating system.

TD
The settlement includes  Microsoft payments of $2-billion (U.S.) to Sun, which has had 11 consecutive quarters of declining revenue. Sun also said yesterday that it would cut its work force by
10 per cent.

For Microsoft, the resolution, along with the recent  European Commission decision to fine              Microsoft around $600-million in penalties on its practises in Europe, allows it to address its growing
$53-billion cash pile.  Microsoft had said it would hold onto its cash while the threat of major litigation remained.

Both companies are facing stiff  competition from upstart Linux, the operating system that can be copied and modified freely, in the market for server software used to run networked computers that power large businesses.
âSun and Microsoft have a common enemy: Linux,â said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle
Group. âThey are seeing each other as less of a threat and, together, facing a common threat.â
Shares of Sun closed up about 20 per cent at $5.06, while shares of  Microsoft were up 3 per cent at
$25.85 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The settlement, which resolves the bitter rivalry between Sun chief executive officer Scott McNealy
and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, will give customers who were thinking of moving to Linux a reason
to stay with Sun and  Microsoft, analysts said.

Under the agreement, the two companies' basic technologies will now work more smoothly with one another. Sun's computer servers as well as its widely used Java software will work better with Microsoft's Windows software, the companies said. Sun had filed an  antitrust suit and sued the world's largest software company over its Java software.  Microsoft will pay $700-million to resolve pending antitrust issues and $900-million to resolve patent issues.

In addition, Sun and  Microsoft have agreed to pay royalties for use of each other's technology. Microsoft will make an initial payment of $350-million, and Sun will make payments when its uses the technology in its computer servers.

âThings are happening so quickly in the technology industry that this kind of enmity between the companies was kind of yesterday's news,â said Henry Asher, president of New York-based money


Page 249 of 250 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
management firm Northstar Group. âIt increases the probability of Sun's success but doesn't guarantee it.â

Mr. McNealy called the resolution a huge step forward. âEverywhere we go our customers say, âWe have both Sun technology and  Microsoft technology â we need peace,' â he said in a conference call.

While investors applauded the settlement news and 3,300 job cuts, Sun said it expects its quarterly loss, excluding charges, to be wider than Wall Street had expected.

Jonathan Schwartz, who yesterday was named Sun's president and chief operating officer, told analysts on a conference call that the realities of business carried the day over acrimony between the two companies.

Sun had supported a European Union case against  Microsoft. In the EU ruling last week,  Microsoft was told to change the way features are bundled into its software and share more information about its server software code.
