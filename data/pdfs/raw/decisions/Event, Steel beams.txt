HD          EU to fine steel companies for price fixing. WC         500 words

BRUSSELS, Feb 14 (Reuter) - The  European Commission is due to fine 17 steel companies on Wednesday on the grounds that they colluded illegally to fix prices, a senior Commission official said on Monday.

Ironically, the  fines will be announced the day after the Commission meets  steel industry representatives to seek cuts in production capacity as part of an attempt to haul the beleaguered sector out of trouble.

TD
Among the  steel firms in line for  fines were Arbed, British  Steel, Unimetal, Saarstahl, Ferdofin, Fried Krupp-Hoesch AG, NMH Stahlwerke, Fundia Norske, the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.

Under anti-trust rules which apply across the European Union, the Commission can  fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales turnover for colluding on prices or avoiding free competition in other ways.

The breach of the rules in this case concerned the market for  steel beams, used in construction, the official said.
The Commission will consider another key  steel question on Tuesday -- how to resuscitate its  steel
rescue plan.

Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert will meet over dinner with company executives in what has been billed as the industry's last chance to show it is willing to play along.

The meeting has been shrouded in secrecy, with Commission officials refusing to say where it will take place. The parties want to meet away from "media pressure", a Commission spokesman said.

The Commission wants companies to slash up to 26 million tonnes of excess capacity in hot-rolled steel products in exchange for money to help cushion at least 50,000 job losses and loans to set up restructuring funds.

The deadline for pledges was originally set for last September 30, but it slipped while the industry waited for a decision by EU ministers on a multibillion-dollar package of  steel subsidies which finally came in December.

The deal, which authorised subsidies to state-owned plants in Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal in exchange for 5.5 million tonnes of capacity cuts, has since been criticised by the German  steel industry, along with British  Steel Plc and France's Usinor Sacilor SA.

They argue that the package will actually allow companies such as east Germany's Eko Stahl AG to increase capacity.

That has put a damper on the Commission's efforts to get privately owned steelmakers to slash 10.5 million tonnes of capacity under the EU loan scheme.
"The pledges that would have been possible before are no longer possible now," an official at the  steel
industry group Eurofer said.

Another key stumbling block is the decision by Germany's Kloeckner-Werke AG to sell a majority interest in the Kloeckner Stahl GmbH steelworks to a private-public sector industry consortium backed by the Bremen city-state government.
That dashed Eurofer's proposal that the  steel mill be closed as part of an EU-wide restructuring plan. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

BRUSSELS, Feb 14 (Reuter) - The European Commission is to fine 17 European steelmakers this week on the grounds that they collaborated on prices for steel beams in breach of anti-trust rules which apply across the European Union, a senior Commsision official told Reuters.

Among the firms were Arbed, British  Steel, Unimetal, Saarstahl, Ferdofin, Fried Krupp-Hoesch AG, NMH Stahlwerke, Fundia Norske, said the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity.

TD
The size of the  fines had not been fixed yet, the official added.
"We have the material that proves there has been collusion on prices," said the official.

"There is an agreement on the principle that the companies should be  fined but the amounts will give rise to a heated debate," the official said.

The official said that there would be a secret meeting of Commission officials late on Tuesday night to decide what the level of the  fines should be. This would avoid any leaks on the amounts before the decisive meeting on Wednesday.

The 17 Commissioners would meet on Wednesday to adopt a formal decision and decide the  fines, the official said.

Under EU anti-trust rules the Commission can fines firms up to ten percent of their annual sales turnover. But it has never imposed such high fines.

The official said the fines would be particularly sensitive in this case because the Commission was trying to get private steel companies generally to agree to cut capacity to alleviate wider problems in the industry.

HD     EC to slap big fines on European steel cartel, industry protests

BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (AFP) - The European Commission is set to impose stiff  fines on Europe's major
steel firms for operating an illegal cartel, a senior EC official said here Tuesday.
He said the EC's executive  European Commission would announce its decision and the level of the
fines Wednesday following a meeting of commission officials with industry representatives late Tuesday.

TD
The official said the  fines -- amounting to up to 10 percent on annual turnover -- would almost certainly be applied to all the EC's major steelmakers and many smaller ones -- between 15 and 20 firms in total.

The commission has accused them of  fixing  prices and sharing  the market for heavy  steel sections and beams used in the construction industry.

The firms include such industry giants as British  Steel, the Unimetal affiliate of Usinor-Sacilor of France, Arbed of Luxembourg, Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium, and German steelmakers Thyssen, Saarstahl and Krupp-Hoesch.

The EC official said the companies had been exchanging information on deliveries and orders -- "the definition of a full-scale  cartel" -- since the mid-1980's. The sanctions will apply to their actions since
1988.

The chairman of Britain's House of Commons select committee on trade and industry, Richard Caborn, said on British radio Tuesday that the EC was trying to pressure the steelmakers into accepting a recovery plan for the industry.

He echoed a widespread view in the industry that the commission was doing all it could to make reluctant private steelworks accept a controversial plan to destroy production capacity in a bid to overcome a saturated market.

Keith Brookman, general secretary of Britain's Iron and  Steel Trades Confederation said: "If this is a blackmail tactic to force British  Steel to agree to further cuts in capacity, it is a disgrace.

"British  Steel has done nothing wrong and they have made savage cuts in capacity while other countries have done little."

Chris Mallander, co-ordinator of SteelAction, a group of 28 local authorities with  steel plants in their areas said, "It is a strange coincidence that the commission should make this move on the very day they are meeting with British  Steel and other European producers to try to agree a reduction in European  steel capacity.

"British  Steel has made far more reductions than anyone else and is not offering any further cuts. Now we get this news from Brussels. It looks like the commission is using leverage."
Spokesmen for Germany's Thyssen Stahl and Krupp-Hoesch said their companies no longer produced
the heavy steel beams targetted by the commission and so were not concerned by the threatened action.

The European Commission wants the steel industry to cut  steel production capacity by by more than 20 percent -- by 30 million tonnes of raw steel and 20 million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel -- a year.

Page 7 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice which the commission deems essential medicine for an industry buffetted by over-production, falling demand, plummetting prices and economic recession.

Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector steelworks would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel a year, as a condition for allowing them last-time subsidies totalling about
7.5 billion dollars.

The commission expects the private steelmakers to share out the rest of the production cuts -- about 10.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel.

So far, the private steelworks have pledged cuts of no more than five million tonnes a year. The commission warned earlier this month that it might abandon the industry recovery plan unless they played their allotted part.
But the private steelmakers are upset about continuing subsidies paid to their public sector competition in
Spain, Germany, Italy and Portugal.
They say they are being asked to shoulder an unfairly large share of the production sacrifice.
Private sector  steel executives were due to meet the EC's commissioners for competition, Karel van
Miert, and for industry, Martin Bangemann, late Tuesday for talks on the  steel recovery plan.
Officials said the discussions would certainly focus on the  cartel accusations. bur/dm AFP AFP

LONDON -- The  European Commission (EC) invited open warfare with western European  steel producers yesterday when it said 17 companies in the European Union will be  fined late this week on charges of devising a pricing  cartel.

The Brussels-based regulatory body is alleging price-fixing  for heavy beams produced by the companies within the 12 member states of the European Union.

TD
The commission is scheduled to hold a closed meeting today to decide on the size of the  fines, according to market observers in Brussels.
London-based British  Steel Plc, which makes more than 95 percent of the heavy beams produced in
Britain, is among the 17 companies that will be  fined, according to sources,

British Steel spokesmen did not return telephone calls by presstime, and an official at the British Iron and Steel Producers Association declined comment.
Officials at the German  steel federation could not be reached by presstime yesterday. The fines could be hunreds of millions of dollars.
Steelmakers and EC officials are due to meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss problems concerning the commission's  steel restructuring plan.

A number of major  steel-makers, notably German producers, last week made it plain they would not meet the commission's capacity cutback requirements without changes in the plan.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission is expected this week to  fine 17 steelmakers for alleged price fixing,  in a move likely to fire rising tensions over plans to overhaul Western Europe's beleaguered steel industry.

The size of the  fines hasn't yet been determined, but officials said the  fines would reflect  cartel-like activity dating back to the late 1980s. Under European Union competition law, the commission can impose fines amounting to as much as 10% of a company's annual revenue.

TD
Industry officials expressed outrage at Monday's news, but it was the timing more than the expected fines that stirred resentment. Senior  steel-industry officials are scheduled to have dinner with the EU's competition and industry commissioners, Karel Van Miert and Martin Bangemann, in Brussels today to discuss cutbacks in EU  steel production.

"I'm almost speechless at the extraordinary futility of this. It's so cynical," said one industry official. "It means we'll have more things to talk about tomorrow," scoffed another official.

According to EU officials, the companies targeted by the  fines include Arbed SA of Luxembourg, British Steel PLC, the Unimetal unit of France's Usinor-Sacilor SA, Belgium's Cockerill-Sambre SA, and Thyssen AG, Fried. Krupp AB Hoesch-Krupp and Saarstahl AG of Germany.

"They ran a  cartel. They agreed collectively on the level of prices, and they informed each other on deliveries and orders so they knew exactly what the market was and what the demand was," said one commission official.

The industry and the commission have been at loggerheads since last autumn over the  steel restructuring plan. In December, the EU approved 6.79 billion European currency units ($7.52 billion) in government subsidies for state-owned steelmakers in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Nonsubsidized steelmakers complain that the EU is allowing subsidies to distort competition, while pressing them to make the painful -- and costly -- sacrifices of plant closures.

The anger of the nonsubsidized producers has been further fueled by the commission's failure to stop the German regional government of Bremen from bailing out the bankrupt steelmaker Kloeckner-Werke AG. The commission has opened an investigation into whether Bremen's move constitutes illegal state aid, but it has signaled it won't make a definitive decision before the summer.

At this evening's dinner, Messrs. Van Miert and Bangemann want a pledge from the nonsubsidized producers to shut down more than 20 million metric tons of their steelmaking capacity. Industry officials have said they'd refuse to promise anything as long as the commission doesn't take action in the Kloeckner-Werke case and imposes significant cutbacks by subsidized producers.

The fines are expected to be imposed at the commission's weekly meeting Wednesday. Asked if the timing was merely coincidental, a senior commission official said that EU civil servants "assured us that

Page 15 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
it is." Privately, however, he expressed doubts: It's no secret that the commission is seeking to turn up the heat on the nonsubsidized steelmakers to cut capacity.

The move also reinforces the commission's warnings that it won't go back to imposing production quotas as it did in the 1980s to boost steel prices and nurse the industry back to financial health. Indeed, industry officials say the planned fines are a consequence of the quota system imposed by the EU from 1980 through 1988 under the so-called Davignon plan, named after the former Industry Commissioner Etienne Davignon.

When the commission ended the quota system in 1988, price  fixing  suddenly became illegal again. The industry says it turned to the commission for legal advice on how to progressively move to a
free-market situation, but to no avail. Instead, the commission opened investigations into alleged price fixings for beams and hot-rolled coils in 1991, seizing stacks of documents in raids on corporate headquarters.

One industry official retorted: "If some companies transgressed the rules it was done unwittingly." He added that such practices had now ceased completely.

An EU official said the companies had assured the commission that any illegal activities had ceased, but he added that one purpose of the  fines is to make sure that is indeed the case.

- Europe's unaided  steel companies are on a collision course with their subsidised rivals, says Andrew
Hill.

Nobody ever said it would be easy to pull the west European  steel industry out of its latest crisis. But in trying to alleviate the sector's problems, governments, steelmakers and the  European Commission seem to be thrusting themselves deeper into a furnace of controversy.

TD
The European Union's largest  steel producers will meet Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, today - ostensibly to discuss cuts in EU steel production. Private steelmakers, and those publicly owned producers that no longer receive subsidies, made tentative pledges last year to reduce their  steel production by a total of 25m tonnes to about 135m-140m tonnes. Brussels considers this the vital last element of the EU's complex and politically sensitive plan to restore the industry's health after years of overcapacity, slowing demand and competition from cheap imports. Moves, which emerged last night, to  fine leading European  steel manufacturers for operating a  cartel in heavy steel beams appeared timed to step up the pressure on private steel manufacturers to come to heel.
But producers not receiving aid are unhappy about continued subsidies to state-owned competitors in
east Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy. In December, EU industry ministers agreed unanimously to limit
that aid and cut production capacity in the subsidised sector, in the hope of levelling the playing field. But
the deal has opened a rift between the non-aided sector and the subsidised producers.

Since December, the attitude of unsubsidised producers has hardened further. Their most vehement attacks have been reserved for the German city-state of Bremen and its plans to keep Klockner-Werke's steel mill in the city alive, a proposal being investigated by Brussels for possible illegal state aid.

So at today's meeting, instead of co-operating to cut capacity and relieve the crisis, individual  steel chiefs could find themselves pitted against one another as well as against the Commission - only 16 months
after they stood shoulder to shoulder calling for EU action.

The meeting could mark the beginning of a dangerous stand-off between public authorities - in Brussels and national capitals - and the unsubsidised steelmakers, in which both sides seem ready to gamble with the fate of the industry itself. 'It's a poker game,' said one Commission official last week. 'We have done our part and it was clear from the end of last year that (unsubsidised) industry had to do its part.'

The problem is that, since the December subsidies deal, the non-aided producers - led by big west German steelmakers and backed by British  Steel and Usinor Sacilor of France - have shown no intention of fulfilling their part of the bargain.

When EU steelmakers first called for action in October 1992, they seemed prepared to offer capacity cuts in return for help from the Commission and national governments. Brussels has tried to comply with the other elements of that request, negotiating with east European governments to reduce cheap imports, promising cash to help cover redundancy costs, issuing forecasts of market conditions and allowing certain steel companies to club together to reduce capacity.



Page 17 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But by withholding cuts in production capacity, the Commission believes the private and non-aided sector risks sacrificing the benefits of those other measures, prompting a drop in the  steel price and, in the
worst cases, provoking bankruptcies and a new race for state subsidies.

The non-aided producers are worried that the December agreement is unenforceable. Under the deal, governments were allowed to pump subsidies of ECU 6.8bn (#5.1bn) into state-owned companies, provided the same producers cut capacity by more than 5m tonnes. But observers claim the effective cut in capacity will be nearer to 2.5m tonnes, and they doubt whether the political resolve exists to ensure that the main public companies involved in the December agreement - Ilva in Italy, Ekostahl in east Germany and CSI in Spain - receive no further subsidies, as promised by the ministers.

As a result, the non-aided producers are reluctant to push through restructuring which the Commission itself forecasts could lead to the loss of more than 33,000 jobs in the industry during 1994. As British
Steel puts it, the unsubsidised steelmakers are prepared to share in the cost of restructuring the industry, but they will not put plants and workers at risk while others continue to receive subsidies.

Preussag, the German company, says it cannot close any capacity without unbalancing its entire integrated operation: cutting capacity in one part of its production line would merely lead to overcapacity in another, the group claims. Thyssen, another of the German steelmakers, says it has done enough, at
least on flat products: it is laying off 15,000 workers - more than 30% of its workforce - between 1992 and the end of this year.
Mr Van Miert is prepared to listen to such arguments today. But he will insist that December's subsidy
deal cannot be reopened. He has always said the compromise was not ideal, but points out that ministers
would never have reached unanimous agreement on a tougher subsidy package.

He and Mr Bangemann will also resist any pressure for the Commission to use special powers to declare a 'manifest crisis' in the industry and impose production quotas. The commissioners believe such measures, used during the  steel slump of the early 1980s, would simply postpone necessary longer-term restructuring of the industry.

The commissioners are counting on subsidised producers and their governments to demonstrate that the December agreement on subsidies and capacity cuts will stick. The timetable is tight, but governments previously known for procrastination are already acting. On Friday, the outgoing Italian government approved a decree providing L800bn (#324m) to restructure the state-owned  steel industry in order to comply with production cuts, and is pressing ahead with privatisation of large parts of the industry.
However, that is unlikely to be enough to mollify the unsubsidised  steel producers, which will cite the
Klockner subsidy case as the best example of how the Commission's plans are unravelling.

The Commission is investigating the sale of 75% of the Klockner mill for just DM 4 (#1.50) to a consortium led by Bremen and made up mainly of publicly controlled companies. That has angered
non-aided producers in west Germany and beyond, which hoped that when the Klockner-Werke parent company went into receivership last year the hot-strip mill would be closed. Some 3m tonnes of annual production would then have been cut and overcapacity eased in the sensitive sector of flat products. Critics say the mill will only survive because of a capital injection from the consortium partners, and warn that the chances of further cuts in flat products are remote if the sale is approved by Brussels.

Klockner's chief executive, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, claims his restructuring plan has turned the plant round, and made it profitable. It would be quite wrong to close one of the most modern integrated steel plants in Germany, he says: 'We would be slaughtering the wrong pig.' But he admits he cannot see any easy alternative - except to close another entire plant, if possible one of the oldest.

Mr Van Miert and his officials have indicated they are likely to take a tough line against the Klockner plan, to ease the confrontation with the private and non-subsidised steelmakers. If it is not, then the chances of an easy solution are probably slimmer than they were when a united west European  steel industry approached the Commission in October 1992. The only hint of a concession on the part of the non-aided producers is a possible reduction of capacity in long products, such as beams used in construction. In trying to persuade them to go further, the Commission's only lever is the threatened abandonment of
other elements in its rescue package, such as redundancy aid and protection against cheap imports.

Brussels still insists that it is calling the steelmakers' bluff and not the other way round. Officials say the choice for the industry is capacity cuts or catastrophe. But if the steelmakers are prepared to push negotiations to the brink, it is hard to imagine that the politicians in the Commission and national governments will stand by and watch the steelmakers throw themselves off the edge.

HD        BRUSSELS TO FINE STEEL GROUPS OVER CARTEL. BY         By DAVID GARDNER.

The European Commission will fine leading European  steel manufacturers tomorrow for operating a
cartel in heavy steel sections and beams for the construction industry.

Up to 20 companies in seven EU member states and three Nordic countries have been found to be distorting competition in European  steel products, breaching the European Coal and  Steel Treaty which bans price-fixing  and the sharing  out of markets, a senior Brussels official said.

TD
Brussels' action comes as the Commission steps up pressure on private steelmakers to cut production, as part of the restructuring plan agreed by the 12 just before Christmas.

Among steelmakers facing  fines are Arbed, British  Steel, Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Fundia Norske, officials confirmed.

The level of  fine will be set at a meeting tonight of senior Brussels officials, which will take place at the same time as a Brussels dinner between Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, and leading steelmakers grouped in Eurofer, the industry association.

An official said the competition directorate 'would like to have a serious  fine' imposed, but that the level of sanction would be subject to 'a political appreciation'.  Fines can be levied up to 10% of annual sales in the sector, but an official said the normal level was about 2% of turnover.

The fines follow a three-year investigation. Officials do not deny that bringing the inquiry to a head now will put pressure on Europe's private steelmakers to accept the crisis measures adopted last year.
In December, EU industry ministers approved ECU 6.8bn (#5.1bn) in government subsidies for
state-owned steelmakers, mainly in Italy, Germany and Spain, in return for capacity cuts of more than
5m tonnes. But as part of the deal, the Commission is looking for cuts of 25m tonnes from non-aided
producers, provoking angry resistance from private steelmakers.

The steel industry has until now escaped the heavy sanctions for competition distortion that Brussels has imposed in other sectors, such as chemicals and paper and board.

HD              STEELMAKERS FACE FINES FOR PRICE-FIXING. BY              By Nicholas Bannister.

A DECISION to fine British  Steel and 16 other steelmakers for price  fixing  has been leaked by the European Commission the day before it hosts a meeting of  steel company bosses to discuss restructuring of the industry.

A commission official, speaking anonymously, said the companies would be  fined this week for breaking European Union rules by collaborating on the price of  steel beams for the construction industry.

TD
He said the companies involved included British  Steel, Arbed, Unimetal, Saastahl, Ferdofin, Fried. Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, and Fundia Norske. The size of the  fines has yet to be decided.

Industry sources were surprised at the timing of the leak and suspected the commission was attempting to put pressure on the  steel companies ahead of the restructuring talks today.
Europe's  steel industry is suffering from the chronic over-capacity which led to EC intervention in
1980. The price-fixing  charge arose at the end of that quota scheme.

The European Commission will this week fine 17 European steelmakers, including British  Steel, for breaching anti-trust rules governing the marketing of  steel beams used in construction. The Commission can fine firms up to 10 per cent of annual turnover.

Today, the Commission will consider another key question - how to resuscitate its  steel rescue plan. It is expected to put pressure on manufacturers to cut millions of tons of capacity.

HD         British Steel says plans protest  against EU fine. WC        460 words

LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuter) - British Steel Plc said it was "most likely" that it would lodge a protest against European Commission fines due to be imposed on Wednesday for allegedly running an illegal price-fixing  cartel for steal beams.

"We have't decided yet but it is most likely we will lodge a complaint," a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday.

TD
A European Commission official said on Monday evening that the Commission was due to  fine 17
steel companies on Wednesday on the grounds that they colluded illegally to fix prices.

Under anti-trust rules which apply across the European Union, the Commission can  fine firms up to 10 percent of their annual sales turnover for colluding on prices or avoiding free competition in other ways.

British  Steel makes its beams, which are used in the construction of  steel-framed buildings such as office blocks and sport stadia, at its Teeside site.

British  Steel chairman and chief executive Brian Moffat is due at a dinner in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the state of Europe's  steel industry restructuring plan.

British  Steel, one of the few European  steel makers without any state support, is unhappy the Commission last December allowed some member states -- Italy, Germany, Portugal and Spain -- to pump additional subsidies into their industries with only limited capacity cuts in return.
British  Steel also opposes a rescue plan by the city state of Bremen for the locally based Kloeckner
Stahl GmbH steelworks.

British  Steel is also unwilling to make any capacity cuts itself, claiming it has already cut deeply since privatisation in 1989.

The European Commission is trying to get  steel makers to slash 10.5 million tonnes of capacity, ironically by working together into setting up a fund to finance closures.

In the company's annual report for the year to April 3 1993, British  Steel said that the  European             Commission has in May of the previous year started an investigation "under Article 65 of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty" into alleged arrangements relating to  steel sections, which includes beams.

"Article 65 prohibits certain commercial arrangements which restrict normal competition and, if found to be infringed, may lead to the imposition of a  fine," the company said.

"The directors believe that any  fine, if imposed, would not result in a material loss to British  Steel," it added.

The company, which often presents itself as the fairest player in the  steel industry, was in June at the receiving end -- with other companies -- of U.S. duties designed to prevent the dumping of cheaper steel on the U.S. market. The levies more than doubled the price of British  steel plate in the U.S.

HD         Troubled  Euro steelmakers face fines, debate rescue plan. BY         By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuter) - European steelmakers, struggling to weather bad times, meet for talks with the European Commission on a rescue plan on Tuesday night -- at the same time as some of them face fines on charges of fixing  steel prices.

About 17  steel producers are due to be  fined, according to Commission officials, on the grounds that they broke anti-trust laws to jointly set prices for  steel beams, used mainly in the building sector, instead of competing freely for business.

TD
"The level of the possible  fines, which concerns about 17 companies I think, will be fixed by the
Commission tomorrow," a Commission spokesman said, declining to give company names.

Some Commission officials were privately questioning the timing of the  fines while the Commission was simultaneously trying to get private  steel firms to slash 10.5 million tonnes of production capacity to
ease pressure on the entire sector.

Commissioners Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert were to hold secretive dinner talks on Tuesday with envoys from the  steel sector to try to broker an output deal, the officials said.

However, industry sources said they did not expect a big breakthrough because many companies were still furious about a multibillion-dollar package of  steel subsidies approved for some of their competitors by the EU in December.

The decision by Germany's Kloeckner-Werke AG to sell a majority interest in the Kloeckner Stahl GmbH steelworks to a consortium backed by the Bremen government has also dashed hopes that the company would shut down about two million tonnes of capacity, they said.

"If something positive happens tonight, it would be that the  steel industry and the Commission agree on reassessing the situation," said one official who requested anonymity.

While they eat, Commission anti-trust investigators were to be meeting elsewhere, also in secrecy, to discuss how much they should  fine the steel firms which they accuse of operating a  cartel in violation of European laws on free competition.

Among the  steel firms in line for  fines are Arbed, British  Steel, Unimetal, Saarstahl, Ferdofin, Fried Krupp-Hoesch AG, NMH Stahlwerke, Fundia Norske, a senior Commission official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, has told Reuters.

Under anti-trust rules which apply to businesses operating in the 12-nation European Union, the Commission can fine firms up to 10 percent of their yearly sales turnover for colluding on prices or avoiding free competition. But it has yet to impose the maximum  fine.

British  Steel said on Tuesday it was "most likely" that the company would lodge a protest against any Commission fine. Arbed declined comment. France's Usinor Sacilor declined comment but confirmed to Reuters that the offices of its Unimetal  steel beams division had been visited by Commission investigators.

The Commission anti-trust experts have been investigating since they made surprise visits to steelmakers' offices across the EU in early 1991 and are due to present their  fines verdict to Bangemann, Van Miert and the other 15 Commissioners for a formal decision on Wednesday.

Some officials say there is a slight risk that the formal decision could be postponed on Wednesday if some commissioners argue that the  fines should be left aside until negotiations on capacity cuts by private firms are wrapped up.

They say some fear that private firms are already unhappy about government subsidies given to rival state-owned  steel companies and would be further smitten should some of them be hit by  fines at a time when they are being asked to scale down production.

The Commission wants the whole  steel sector to slash up to 26 million tonnes of excess capacity in hot-rolled steel products in exchange for EU money to help cushion at least 50,000 job losses and loans to set up restructuring funds.

The deadline for pledges was first set for last September 30, but it slipped while the industry waited for a decision by EU ministers on a package of  steel subsidies to plants in Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal.

That deal, finally reached in December, required 5.5 million tonnes of capacity cuts, but it has been criticised by the German  steel industry, along with British  Steel and Usinor Sacilor.
Denmark's only steelworks, Det Danske Staalvalsevaerk, said on Tuesday it planned to quit the
European steel industry group Eurofer in protest against the EU's subsidisation policies.

HELSINKI, Feb 15 (Reuter) - A board member of Finnish  steel maker Rautaruukki Oy said he was surprised by reports that the European Commission is expected to  fine European steelmakers, including a partly owned unit of Rautaruukki, on cartel charges.

Board member Gosta Engman said Rautaruukki Oy's subsidiary Fundia AB and its Norwegian arm had not received a request for clarification from the  European Commission.

TD
The European Commission is due to fine about 17 European steelmakers this week on the grounds that they collaborated on prices for steel beams in breach of the EU anti-trust rules, a senior Commission official told Reuters in Brussels on Monday.

"I have been in touch with Fundia and they have not received a request for clarificiation in the matter," Engman said.

"The news came as a surprise," Engman added, referring to the  fines the Commission was said to be planning.

Asked for his opinion about the existence of the alleged  cartel, Engman said: "In our opinion, the allegations are not based on truth."

Rautaruukki has a 50 percent stake in Fundia AB, a steelmaker based in Sweden. It operates in Norway under the name of Fundia Norsk Jernverk A/S. The other shareholder in Fundia is Norsk Jern Holding A/S.
Among the firms that might face  fines were Arbed, British  Steel, Unimetal, Saarstahl, Ferdofin, Fried
Krupp-Hoesch AG, NMH Stahlwerke and Fundia Norsk Jernverk, the Commission official said.

BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuter) - Luxembourg steel-maker Arbed SA said it had no comment to make yet on news yesterday that the European Commission is to fine 17 European steelmakers, including Arbed, on  cartel charges.
"There is no comment to make before this evening's meeting with Bangemann and Van Miert," an
Arbed spokesman said.

Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert are due to meet with  steel industry representatives tonight to discuss possible cuts in production capacity as part of an attempt to haul the beleaguered sector out of trouble.
By 1145 GMT, Arbed shares were 50 francs lower at 4,130 on the Brussels forward market.

On Monday a senior Commission official told Reuters that the Commission would  fine 17 European steelmakers on the grounds that they collaborated on prices for  steel beams in breach of anti-trust rules which apply across the European Union.

He said there would be a secret meeting of Commission officials late Tuesday night to decide the level of the fines.

The European Commission meets on Wednesday to adopt a formal decision, a Commission spokesman said today. He declined to identify the firms cited by other officials.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission is expected this week to  fine 17 steelmakers for alleged price fixing,  in a move likely to fire rising tensions over plans to overhaul Western Europe's beleaguered steel industry.

The size of the  fines hasn't yet been determined, but officials said the  fines would reflect  cartel-like activity dating back to the late 1980s. Under European Union competition law, the commission can impose fines amounting to as much as 10% of a company's annual revenue.

TD
Industry officials expressed outrage at Monday's news, but it was the timing more than the expected fines that stirred resentment. Senior  steel-industry officials are scheduled to have dinner with the EU's competition and industry commissioners, Karel Van Miert and Martin Bangemann, in Brussels today to discuss cutbacks in EU  steel production.

"I'm almost speechless at the extraordinary futility of this. It's so cynical," said one industry official. "It means we'll have more things to talk about tomorrow," scoffed another official.

According to EU officials, the companies targeted by the  fines include Arbed SA of Luxembourg, British Steel PLC, the Unimetal unit of France's Usinor-Sacilor SA, Belgium's Cockerill-Sambre SA, and Thyssen AG, Fried. Krupp AB Hoesch-Krupp and Saarstahl AG of Germany.

"They ran a  cartel. They agreed collectively on the level of prices, and they informed each other on deliveries and orders so they knew exactly what the market was and what the demand was," said one commission official.

The industry and the commission have been at loggerheads since last autumn over the  steel restructuring plan. In December, the EU approved 6.79 billion European currency units ($7.52 billion) in government subsidies for state-owned steelmakers in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Nonsubsidized steelmakers complain that the EU is allowing subsidies to distort competition, while pressing them to make the painful -- and costly -- sacrifices of plant closures.

The anger of the nonsubsidized producers has been further fueled by the commission's failure to stop the German regional government of Bremen from bailing out the bankrupt steelmaker Kloeckner-Werke AG. The commission has opened an investigation into whether Bremen's move constitutes illegal state aid, but it has signaled it won't make a definitive decision before the summer.

At this evening's dinner, Messrs. Van Miert and Bangemann want a pledge from the nonsubsidized producers to shut down more than 20 million metric tons of their steelmaking capacity. Industry officials have said they'd refuse to promise anything as long as the commission doesn't take action in the Kloeckner-Werke case and imposes significant cutbacks by subsidized producers.

The fines are expected to be imposed at the commission's weekly meeting Wednesday. Asked if the timing was merely coincidental, a senior commission official said that EU civil servants "assured us that

Page 31 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
it is." Privately, however, he expressed doubts: It's no secret that the commission is seeking to turn up the heat on the non subsidized steelmakers to cut capacity.

The move also reinforces the commission's warnings that it won't go back to imposing production quotas as it did in the 1980s to boost steel prices and nurse the industry back to financial health. Indeed, industry officials say the planned fines are a consequence of the quota system imposed by the EU from 1980 through 1988 under the so-called Davignon plan, named after the former Industry Commissioner Etienne Davignon.

When the commission ended the quota system in 1988, price  fixing  suddenly be came illegal again. The industry says it turned to the commission for legal advice on how to progressively move to a
free-market situation, but to no avail. Instead, the commission opened investigations into alleged price fixings for beams and hot-rolled coils in 1991, seizing stacks of documents in raids on corporate headquarters.

One industry official retorted: "If some companies transgressed the rules it was done unwittingly." He added that such practices had now ceased completely.

An EU official said the companies had assured the commission that any illegal activities had ceased, but he added that one purpose of the  fines is to make sure that is indeed the case.

HD     EC imposes  record fines on steel cartel; industry protests

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (AFP) - The European Commission fined 16 European steelmakers a record 104 million Ecu (115 million dollars) Wednesday for running a price-fixing  cartel, with British  Steel taking the brunt of the sanctions.

Steel industry officials immediately protested the ruling and said they would probably appeal to the
European Court of Justice.

TD
Announcing the decision, EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said: "This is a case where everything which can be infringed has been infringed by several companies. We needed to be tough."

Van Miert rejected allegations that the  fines were linked to attempts by the EC executive to force private steelmakers into large  steel production cuts in order to restore the ailing industry to profitability.

He said the steelmakers had operated a "classic" price-fixing  and market-sharing  cartel in the steel beams sector in clear infringment of EC competition rules since 1984, but that they had been fined for their activities only since July 1988.

He said British Steel received the largest  fine -- 32 million Ecu (35.2 million dollars), because it was the largest producer of steel beams used in the contruction industry, and had played a leading part in the cartel.

He said the company's  fine was one of the biggest ever imposed by the EC's competitions watchdog and the biggest in the  steel industry.
In London, a spokesman for British  Steel said the company would "very likely" appeal the ruling to the
European Court of Justice once it received official notificaiton from Brussels, "given the size of the  fine."

Eurofer and the German  Steel Federation in Duesseldorf, Germany, also protested and said they were studying a possible appeal.

German federation president Ruprecht Vondran said "The German  steel firms aren't going to accept these decisions without responding".
German steel group Preussag AG in Hannover said in a communique that it would also oppose the EC
decision "by all available means."

"We cannot understand" why the  fine was slapped on Preussag, since the company "has not taken part in a pricing or quantities  cartel. As far as we know, there has never been such a  cartel" in the EC  steel industry, it said.

Preussag AG was  fined 9.5 million Ecu (10.45 million dollars), the Unimetal affiliate of Usinor-Sacilor of France 12.3 million Ecu (13.5 million dollars), and Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed SA 11.2 million Ecu (12.3 million dollars),

British  Steel was fined about eight percent of its total annual sales of  steel beams -- close to the maximum of 10 percent which the commission was authorised to apply.


Page 35 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The equivalent percentage was about seven percent each for Unimetal and German steelmaker Thyssen. The three firms were particularly targeted because they were "recidivists" (repeated offenders), Van Miert said.

Lesser fines were imposed on German steelmakers Saarstahl, NHM Stahlwerke, Krupp Hoesch, Ferdofin of Italy, the Spanish firms Empresa Nacional Siderurgia and Siderurgica Aristrain, Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium, and four Scandinavian steelmakers -- SSAB Svenskt Stal, Inexa Profil, Norsk Jernverk and Fundia Steel.

Fundia Steel, a Norwegian-Swedish-Finnish group, was  fined the nominal sum of four Ecu (4.4 dollars). SSAB Svenskt of Sweden is being asked to pay just 40 Ecu (44 dollars).

Van Miert said the Scandinavian companies played a relatively minor part in the  cartel, and may have been dragged into it under pressure from the bigger European steelmakers.

Dismissing arguments that the loss-making  steel sector could be pushed further into the red by the  fines, the commissioner said the  cartel had operated during a time when production doubled between 1984 and
1990.

But he added that the  fines could be paid over several years, and that the EC executive was ready to discuss the steel sector's difficulties.

British officials expressed particular anger over the heavy  fine against the privatized British  Steel, given that much of continental Europe's  steel industry remains heavily subsidized.
Robin Cook, the British Labour Party's shadow industry minister said: "How can it be fair competition to
fine British  Steel millions and subsidise German and Italian  steel by billions?"

John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, said: "I really do think it is a bit much when British  Steel has done what everybody else should have done.

"It has cut capacity, slimmed its workforce, it is one of the most efficient producers in the western world. Now it is being punished when much of the inefficient capacity owned by the public sector on the continent remains in business purely because of subsidies."

Announcing the decision, European Community Competitions Commissioner Karel van Miert said the largest fine -- 32 million Ecu (35.2 million dollars) -- was imposed on British  Steel -- nearly one third of the total.

TD
He said the fine was one of the biggest ever imposed by the EC's competitions watchdog, and the biggest in the steel industry.

"This is a case where everything which can be infringed has been infringed by several companies. We needed to be tough," he said.

Van Miert rejected allegations that the  fines were linked to attempts by the EC executive to force private steelmakers into large  steel production cuts in order to restore the ailing industry to profitability.

He said the steelmakers had operated a "classic" price-fixing  and market-sharing  cartel in clear infringment of EC competition rules since 1984, but that they had been fined for their activities only since July 1988.
German firm Preussag AG was  fined 9.5 million Ecu (10.45 million dollars), the Unimetal affiliate of
Usinor-Sacilor of France 12.3 million Ecu (13.5 million dollars), and Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed SA
11.2 million Ecu (12.3 million dollars),

Van Miert said British  Steel received the biggest  fine because it was the largest producer of  steel beams used in the contruction industry, and had played a leading part in the  cartel.

British  Steel was fined about eight percent of its total annual sales of  steel beams -- close to the maximum of 10 percent which the commission was authorised to apply.

The equivalent percentage was about seven percent each for Unimetal and German steelmaker Thyssen. The three firms were particularly targeted because they were "recidivists" (repeated offenders), Van Miert said.

Lesser fines were imposed on German steelmakers Saarstahl, NHM Stahlwerke, Krupp Hoesch, Ferdofin of Italy, the Spanish firms Empresa Nacional Siderurgia and Siderurgica Aristrain, Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium, and four Scandinavian steelmakers -- SSAB Svenskt Stal, Inexa Profil, Norsk Jernverk and Fundia Steel.

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (AFP) - The European Commission fined 16 European steelmakers a record 104 million Ecu (115 million dollars) here Wednesday for running a steel beams cartel, with British  Steel taking the brunt of the  fines.

Announcing the decision, European Community Competitions Commissioner Karel van Miert said the largest fine -- 32 million Ecu (35.2 billion dollars) -- was imposed on British  Steel -- nearly one third of the total.

He said the fine was one of the biggest ever imposed by the EC's competitions watchdog, and the biggest in the steel industry.

"This is a case where everything which can be infringed has been infringed by several companies. We needed to be tough," he said.

German firm Preussag AG was  fined 9.5 million Ecu (10.45 million dollars), the Unimetal affiliate of
Usinor-Sacilor of France 12.3 million Ecu (13.5 million dollars), and Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed SA
11.2 million Ecu (12.3 million dollars),

Van Miert said British  Steel received the biggest  fine because it was the largest producer of  steel beams used in the contruction industry, and had played a leading part in the  cartel.

British  Steel was fined about eight percent of its total annual sales of  steel beams -- close to the maximum of 10 percent which the commission was authorised to apply.

The equivalent percentage was about seven percent each for Unimetal and German steelmaker Thyssen. The three firms were particularly targeted because they were "recidivists" (repeated offenders), Van Miert said.

Lesser fines were imposed on German steelmakers Saarstahl, NHM Stahlwerke, Krupp Hoesch, Ferdofin of Italy, the Spanish firms Empresa Nacional Siderurgia and Siderurgica Aristrain, Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium, and four Scandinavian steelmakers -- SSAB Svenskt Stal, Inexa Profil, Norsk Jernverk and Fundia Steel.

Fundia Steel, a Norwegian-Swedish-Finnish group, was  fined the nominal sum of four Ecu (4.4 dollars). SSAB Svenskt of Sweden is being asked to pay just 40 Ecu (44 dollars).

Van Miert said the Scandinavian companies played a relatively minor part in the  cartel, and may have been dragged into it under pressure from the bigger European steelmakers.

Dismissing arguments that the loss-making  steel sector could be pushed further into the red by the  fines, the commissioner said the  cartel had operated during a time when production doubled between 1984 and
1990.

But he added that the  fines could be paid over several years, and that the EC executive was ready to discuss the steel sector's difficulties.

"There should be no doubt the EC's competition laws are there to be applied and that, if they are not, the commission must shoulder its responsibilities and impose  fines," van Miert said.

He added that the investigation had started with July 1988 to avoid ambiguities arising from relaxations of competition rules during a "manifest crisis" declared for the European industry between 1980 and 1988.

The commission issued a report saying it had evidence that the  steel beams cartel was tightly run by the Brussels-based Eurofer confederation of steelmakers, which oversaw market-sharing  and set quarterly sales prices.

All of the big EC  steel groups making such products were  fined, including Luxembourg's Arbed company, British  Steel, Preussag in Germany, and a subsidiary of French group Usinor-Sacilor.

The European Commission found that the companies had acted as a  cartel since the mid-1980s, regularly exchanging information as well as having understandings on prices and market shares.

HD     EC still short of steel reduction target, says official

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (AFP) - Private European Community steelmakers still need to find capacity cuts of two to four million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel if a rescue plan for the industry is to succeed, an EC official said Wednesday.

EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told journalists here that the private  steel sector had been given until April to share out amongst themselves the required capacity cuts.

TD
He said the two to four million capacity reduction target was the bare minimum to destroy over-production of between 19 and 25 million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel a year.

Bangemann was speaking after a meeting with  steel executives here on Tuesday to discuss the over-production crisis.

"I think they got the message," he said, adding that he planned another meeting with the steelmen shortly before a gathering of EC industry ministers on April 22 to review the rescue plan.

He repeated that the European Commission would abandon a plan to lend financial support for a slimming down of the steel industry unless the private sector accepted the commission's capacity-cut targets.

But Bangemann said the threat had nothing to do with the commission's decision Wednesday to levy fines totalling 104 million Ecu (115 million dollars) on 16 European  steel firms for running a  cartel in steel beams.
About one third of the total  fine was levied on British  Steel, and the  fines provoked outrage in Britain. Reflecting British sentiment, Keith Brookman, general secretary of Britain's Iron and  Steel Trades
Confederation, suggested earlier that the  fines might be a "blackmail tactic" to enforce the production
cuts.

The commission's capacity reduction targets would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice deemed essential medicine for an industry buffetted by a  steel glut, falling demand, plummetting prices and economic recession.

Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector steelworks would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled  steel a year, as a condition for allowing them last-time subsidies totalling about
7.5 billion dollars.
Bangemann said there were indications that the private sector might be ready to slice capacity by about
11 million tonnes, leaving two to four million tonnes still to be found.
But the private steelmakers are upset about continuing subsidies paid to their public sector competition in
Spain, Germany, Italy and Portugal.

They say they are being asked to shoulder an unfairly large share of the production sacrifice in the face of state-subsidised competition.

LONDON, Feb 16 (AFP) - Share prices were mixed in trading on the European stock exchanges early
Wednesday, rising in London despite weak economic data, while falling in Paris.
In London, the FT-SE 100 share index rose by 13.2 points to 3,406.4. In Paris, the CAC 40 index fell by
0.28 percent to 2,251.69 points.

TD
On the London market, shares were supported by the rise on Wall Street and in Tokyo on Tuesday.

Dealers hoped that a series of mediocre economic figures, showing an increase in inflation to 2.5 percent a year and the first rise in unemployment for four months, might lead to a fresh cut in interest rates.
Banks rose and oil shares were firm, despite weak oil prices.
British Petroleum rose by three pence to 369 and Shell by one penny to 733.

Among the pharmaceuticals groups, Glaxo rose by seven pence to 672, the day before the publication of its half-year results.
British Steel was up by 1.5 pence to 369, bouncing back after the news on Tuesday that the European
Commission was preparing to impose  fines on the big European  steel makers for operating a cartel.
British Airways, which published its quarterly results on Tuesday, advanced by two pence to 475.

HSBC Holdings fell by 24 pence to 985 after a sharp fall in the Hong Kong market. Standard Chartered was off six pence to 1,295.

In Paris, share prices continued recent falls, depressed by signs that Germany will not cut interest rates in the near future.

On Tuesday, German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt said he did not expect interest rates to fall in the near future.

At the same time, dealers said the markets were edgy because of the approaching NATO deadline for withdrawal of Serb-held heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo.
Shares in clothing group Damart, which have risen in the past week, fell back 4.4 percent.
Shares in SCOA fell by 3.80 percent after it was pushed off the index of the Societe des Bourses
Francaises. Its replacement, Sidel, rose by 4.5 percent.

Shares in oil group Elf Aquitaine, which rose on Tuesday after US buying, fell back by 0.09 percent. The group is being privatized.

LONDON, Feb 16 (AFP) - European stock markets gained ground on Wednesday, as stocks were up 0.7 percent in London and 0.99 percent in Frankfurt, with a modest 0.28 percent rise in Paris.

London stocks were boosted by hopes for lower British interest rates after release of economic indicators showing economic recovery lagging. the Footsie 100-share index gained 24.5 points or 0.7 percent on the day to end at 3,417.7, while gilts were up by around 3/16 of a point. Share volume rose to 791.1 million, against 615 million on Tuesday.

TD
Announcements of a rise of 15,500 in unemployment in January and of moderate growth (0.6 percent) in retail sales fueled speculation about another reduction of interest rates.

Construction groups were helped by those hopes, especially RMC Group, which advanced 179 pence on the day to end at 980.

British Steel gained one penny to 145.5 despite the announcement of a 32-million-Ecu  fine for the company by the European Commission, on cartel charges.
British Aerospace shed nine pence to 531 after announcement of a big contract for Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas in Saudi Arabia.

Trading on the Paris Bourse was dull in the wake of a small rally on Tuesday that had put an end to a three-session losing streak.
The CAC 40 index was off 0.11 percent at the Wednesday opening, but managed to end up with a gain of
0.28 percent on the day to finish at 2,264.32 points. Volume totaled 4.6 billion francs, boosted by orders
for Elf Aquitaine, which totaled 820 million francs.

Traders were at a loss to explain investor stock buying on Wednesday, since cuts in French interest rates seem unlikely in the near future and there was no promising economic news.

Scoa lost a hefty 9.5 percent on the day to end at 7.15 francs after its removal from the SBF 120 market index, replaced by Sidel, which was recently listed on the secondary masrket. Sidel rose 3.5 percent to
807 francs.
Olipar was off 4.5 percent and Bic 2.6, but Dassault Aviation gained eight percent, Saupiquet 7.6, and
Eiffage six percent.

The Frankfurt stock market was firm in active trading, as the DAX index gained 0.99 percent on the day to end at 2,136.61 points.

Traders said the rise was due mainly to the impending expiration on Friday of contracts on the German futures market (DTB).
Preussag gained 6.10 marks to end at 477.80, Thyssen one to 263.50, and Krupp-Hoesch five to 194. Banks also gained, Deutsche Bank tacking on 20.50 to end at 829.50, Dresdner Bank 12.80 to 422.80,
and Commerzbank four to 358.

In the auto sector, BMW was up 0.50 to 445.50 and Mercedes 9.50 to 827.50, but VW was off 0.50 to
445.50.

The Frankfurt bond market dropped sharply, and the average yield on government issues jumped 0.06 percent to 5.76 percent. Traders said they did not expect the Bundesbank to lower interest rates at a Thursday meeting of its policy-making central council because of money supply growth and current tough wage negotiations.

The Milan bourse also rose, the Mibtel index gaining 0.38 percent on the day to end at 10,771 points. Volume was 800 billion lire.
Traders said they had no explanation of the rise, as nobody expects a German interest rate cut this week. Montedison was active, gaining nine lire to 1,151 at the close, while Ferruzzi was down 75 to 2,038.
Fiat lost 59 to 4,701.
The International Herald Tribune's World Stock Index stood at 1700 GMT at 116.65, up 0.21 percent from
116.40 the previous day. The Trib's European Stock Index stood at 115.95, up from 114.80 on Tuesday.

BRUSSELS -- Europe's steelmakers are facing a difficult time, with two major events this week likely to add to their troubles.

By midday today, they will know how severely they are to be  fined by the European Commission for allegedly fixing  the prices of construction beams. By then, it also will be clear whether the European Union steel industry restructuring plan will collapse.

TD
European Commission officials allege 17 companies--in seven EU member states and in three Scandinavian nations--have been colluding to fix prices since the mid-1980s. Senior commission officials were due to meet late last night to draw up recommended  fines, which then will go to the full commission for approval.

The accused companies include the biggest in Europe, such as France's Usinor-Sacilor, British  Steel, Luxembourg's Arbed and Thyssen and Krupp in Germany.

Under Article 65 of the EC Coal and  Steel Community, antitrust  fines can go as high as 10 percent of annual turnover, although past  fines have been closer to 2 percent.

Steel industry executives said the allegations stem from practices legally introduced in the quota system introduced under the EC's Davignon steel restructuring plan between 1980 and 1988. The commission has been probing claims of price fixing  since 1990 and beams in particular since 1992 (AMM, May 12,
1992).

The relationship between the  fines and voluntary capacity cuts in the current  steel restructuring plan is cloudy.

A commission official yesterday made a link, commenting that "a carrot and stick" approach to restructuring is being used.

The heads of private  steel companies last night were due to meet EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert, whose department is responsible for the  steel antitrust investigations. Also due to be present was Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann.

Although the impending  fines were expected to be discussed, the main purpose of last night's dinner meeting was to hear what capacity cuts the private sector is ready to make.
The commission and industry agree there is excess capacity of some 30 million metric tons.
Private-sector cuts of around 5 million tons have been announced in the past month. A further 5.5 million
tons of cuts will be made bly the state-assisted sectory, which in turn has been given EC governmental
approval for around $7.5 billion worth of additional subsidies. Van Miert has said that unless the private
sector comes up with at least a further 10 million tons of cuts, and preferably twice that level, the  steel
plan will collapse.

HD        STEELMAKERS FACE RECORD #76M FINE. BY        By DAVID GARDNER.

Competition authorities at the European Commission looked set last night to seek a record  fine on 17
EU steelmakers they have found guilty of operating a cartel to supply the construction industry.

The opening bid of the Brussels competition directorate at a meeting of senior officials last night was expected to be for a  fine of about ECU 100m (#76m), say Commission officials.

TD
The biggest penalties Brussels has imposed until now were of ECU 75m in 1991 on Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, for restrictive practices and predatory pricing, and of ECU 60m in 1986 on 14 chemical companies for running a  cartel in polypropylene.

But the officials warned that the Commission could reduce the figure at its full meeting today, depending on the outcome of a dinner at which Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, were due to meet leading European steelmakers.

The companies facing sanctions after the three-year inquiry include British  Steel, Arbed of Luxembourg, a division of Usinor-Sacilor in France, Cockeril-Sambre of Belgium, and Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Thyssen of Germany. The Commission has found that they infringed EU antitrust rules by  sharing  out markets and  fixing  prices for heavy steel sections and beams.

'This is a terribly serious infringement,' one official said. He pointed out that when steelmakers were hauled up by the Commission in 1990 for operating a stainless steel cartel, they escaped with a token fine. But they were warned then that the EU crisis regime for steel, which licensed certain market collaboration between manufacturers until 1988, was at an end.

Under EU competition rules, the Commission can levy  fines of up to 10% of annual turnover in the sector being distorted, although 2% of sales has been the normal ceiling.

Suggestions by officials that British  Steel could face an ECU 10m  fine are in line with the lower threshold. The Commission estimates that British  Steel's turnover in the 1990 reference year was about
#400m in steel beams, 2% of which would be roughly ECU 10m. British  Steel yesterday said it was
'most likely' to contest the sanction.

At last night's dinner Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann intended to press private steelmakers to deliver capacity cuts of up to 25m tonnes as part of the EU restructuring plan for  steel.

HD           RAVENSCRAIG CLOSURE 'LINKED TO CARTEL'. BY           By MURRAY RITCHIE, EUROPEAN EDITOR.

CLAIMS that British  Steel sacrificed Ravenscraig as the price for joining a European  cartel were given credibility yesterday as it emerged that the company was among 17  steel makers facing huge fines
for illegal price-fixing.

The European Commission, which has investigated the pricing policies of  steel producers across Europe, has accused the 17 of breaking anti-trust laws and colluding in the setting of prices for  steel beams used in the building sector instead of competing freely.

TD
Fines imposed by the commission are expected to be announced today.

When Ravenscraig's closure was confirmed in 1992 with a resultant threat to 15,000 Scottish jobs there were specific claims that BS was part of a  cartel involving steel beams.

At that time Mr Ken Collins, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde East which includes the plant, made his suspicions public. In Brussels last night he said he had been vindicated: "The closure of Ravenscraig is now seen in its true light."

Today's announcement in Brussels is expected to show that BS has been found guilty of involvement in a cartel which kept the prices for heavy beam sections artificially high.

BS has never explained why it closed Ravenscraig apart from blaming the recession and saying production should be moved south.

On the day Ravenscraig's closure was formally announced The Herald's industrial correspondent, Ian Bruce, reported: "Union leaders still harbour the suspicion that a European  cartel of steel producers is engaged in cutbacks designed more to hike prices rather than catering for the long-term strategic needs of the industry."

Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner responsible for  steel at the time, dismissed the claim saying it was not supported by any evidence. He insisted Ravenscraig was not the victim of a plot by a cartel including BS and he refused to investigate the matter.

The commission's findings suggest that British  Steel might have had sound reason for closing the Motherwell plant: without reducing total British capacity by closing Ravenscraig BS might have been excluded from the secret deal. This could explain the insistence on closing the plant instead of selling it.

Mr Collins said last night: "BS was prepared to sacrifice almost anything to get into this market so that they could be involved in the  cartel fixing  prices to the detriment of both  steel users and steel workers.
"I think this is now proof and I only wish we could open up the books and see for ourselves. I think the
UK Government should now mount an inquiry."

In 1991 Mr Collins claimed there was a price-fixing  racket after BS offices on Teesside - where  steel
beams are made - were raided by European Commission anti-trust investigators. He said if
Page 55 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
suspicions that BS was part of a  cartel were proved, the company would be forced to sell and not close Ravenscraig.

Mr Collins said then: "It would not surprise me to find that the real explanation for recent closures and planned closures, such as Ravenscraig and Clydesdale, is as a quid pro quo for buying into distribution systems on the Continent.

"This is yet further evidence that the European  steel industry is in the grip of a  cartel arrangement among the major producers. If the case against British  Steel is demonstrated to be true, then I think it would have to offer Ravenscraig for sale. That would be a major triumph."

In Brussels last night  steel producers from around Europe were in talks with commission officials. The producers face fines of up to 10% of a year's turnover if found guilty.

Observers noted the curious timing of the  fines announcement. It comes just when the commission is trying to persuade private  steel firms voluntarily to reduce production by a total of 10.5 million tonnes.

BS is expected to escape the need to make further big capacity reductions. It has said it will protest at a fine. A formal decision on  fines is expected after today's weekly commission meeting.

The commission wants the whole European  steel sector to cut up to 26 million tonnes of excess capacity in hot-rolled  steel products in exchange for EU money to help cushion at least 50,000 job losses and loans to set up restructuring funds. Small  steel operations under one roof - as Ravenscraig was - have been exempted.

Last night Motherwell district's economic development chief, Councillor Harry McGuigan, said: "I fear what the knock-on effects of a large  fine could be for what is left of the industry in Lanarkshire."

Dr Jeremy Bray, MP for Motherwell South, said: "This should show BS that they can't have it both ways."

Ms Kathleen McAlorum, for the SNP, said: "BS has always denied these allegations, but they also always denied rumours of impending closures until they happened. This kind of behaviour seems to be par for the course."
BS said it could not comment until EC commissioners take action.

HD       BRITISH STEEL PROMISES TO FIGHT EU FINES. BY       By Sarah Lambert in Brussels.

British  Steel said yesterday it would oppose any efforts by the  European Commission to fine the company along with 16 others for alleged price-rigging.
The Commission says it has evidence of a price-fixing  cartel among 17 European makers of  steel
beams and will announce punitive  fines today.

TD
European Union sources yesterday suggested that the levy on British  Steel could be as high as #7m. Under EU law, the Commission may  fine a company up to 10 per cent of its annual turnover, but has never done so.

The decision is politically fraught, given the crisis in Europe's over-productive  steel industry. The Commission was due to meet late last night to set the  fines, which will be formally approved by the 12 commissioners at their weekly meeting today.

The EU's Competition Commissioner, Karel van Miert, and the Industry Commissioner, Martin Bangemann, prepared to host a dinner for the heads of Europe's leading  steel companies, including British  Steel's chairman, Brian Moffat, to put greater pressure on them to cooperate in implementing the Commission's restructuring plan.

A British  Steel spokesman said: "The timing of the Commission's announcement is certainly interesting, given that the findings of the inquiry have been available for some time. I do not think we would be happy to think they were using the sledgehammer of hefty  fines in an unrelated pricing case just to bring in capacity cuts - because we have done our bit on that front."

It is a year since the Commission first announced a restructuring plan that has so far spectacularly failed to deliver the production cuts required to rescue the industry from the combined effects of recession, military cutbacks, competition from the East and over-production.
Last December, EU industry ministers formally approved #4.7bn of state subsidies to state-owned  steel
makers in return for promised capacity cuts.

Implementing this package has proven increasingly difficult. Last month, Mr van Miert warned that the plan was in danger of collapsing. The private  steel makers are unwilling to make cuts while, as they argue, the state-aid deal will actually increase capacity in some state-owned producers, in countries such as Spain and at eastern Germany's Eko Stahl plant, which has just been sold to a private-public sector consortium, although it was to have been closed under the EU restructuring plan.

British  Steel complained that the  cartel investigation dates back to the last  steel crisis, when the Commission's industrial directorate sought remedy in allowing voluntary price restraints and pricing agreements.

The company's spokesman said: "As far as the industry directorate was concerned long-term restructuring was fine, but the competition directorate seems to have assumed all pricing agreements amounted to `fixing',  which is not the case."

HD         British Steel plans to appeal against rigging fine. WC        271 words

LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuter) - British Steel Plc, Europe's leading private  steel firm, said on Wednesday it planned to appeal against a huge European Commission fine for alleged market-rigging.

European Commssioner Karel Van Miert earlier slapped a 32 million European currency unit ($35.84 million) fine on British  Steel, the highest of 16 such  fines totalling a record $116 million, for being the main force behind a market  cartel in making steel beams for the construction industry.

TD
"British  Steel is aware of reports that the  European Commission intends to impose a  fine of 32 million Ecus on the company in respect of alleged breaches of EU competition rules in the beams sector," the company said in a statement.

"The company has not received official notification of the Commission's decision and is not able, therefore, either to confirm the reports or to assess the basis of the decision and the calculation of the fine," it added.

"The company expects, however, to appeal against the decision but does not consider it appropriate to make any further comment at this stage," it said.

In Parliament, Industry minister Tim Sainsbury said that under European Union rules the Commission had sole jurisdiction in competition law and the government supported the "full and fair" application of the competition rules.

"We are members of the European Community. We adhere to the Treaty of Paris," Sainsbury said. He added he supported plans for capacity reductions and elimination of subsidies.
"That is what I shall stand up for as strongly as I am able," he said. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuter) - British Steel Plc said on Wednesday it expected to appeal against a decision by the European Commission to fine it for alleged market rigging in the  steel beams sector.

"British  Steel is aware of reports that the  European Commission intends to impose a  fine of 32 million Ecus on the Company in respect of alleged breaches of EU competition rules in the beams sector," the company said in a statement.

"The Company expects, however, to appeal against the decision but does not consider it appropriate to make any further comment at this stage," it said.

France's Usinor Sacilor said it contested the allegation of violations of competition rules but said it was too early to say whether or not it would appeal against the  fines.
"We contest the allegations we were running a  cartel. If there had been a  cartel, prices would not
have collapsed as they have done in the past few years," Usinor Sacilor director of international affairs
Jean-Yves Gilet told Reuters.

"But before we know what we're going to do, we need to know exactly what we are accused of," he added.

Gilet also said the  fines were excessively high just when Europe's  steel industry was going through tough times and was forced to carry out drastic capacity-cut programmes.
"We don't understand the harshness of the (European Commission's) position," he said. Usinor unit, Unimetal, was given a 12.3 million Ecu  fine.

BRUSSELS (Reuter) - The European Commission fined 16 steelmakers a record $116 million Wednesday for operating a clandestine cartel to illegally rig prices and markets for  steel building beams, saying they had broken every rule in the book.

Dubbed one of the "habitual offenders," British  Steel bore the brunt of the ruling, with a  fine of 32 million Ecus ($36 million), European Commissioner Karel Van Miert said.

TD
"Everything which could be infringed has been infringed," Van Miert told a news conference. "It's a textbook case."

At the other end of the offenders' list cited by the European Union's executive commission, Finland's Fundia Steel was fined just four Ecus ($4.5) because it was one of what Van Miert called the "smaller sinners."
The 16 steelmakers were said to have operated the  cartel in breach of the EU anti-trust laws since
1984 but were only  fined for the offence since 1988. Brussels condoned industry pacts before 1988
because of a crisis in the sector.

A Commission statement listed the offences as price-fixing,  sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information on a grand scale on the market for steel beams in the 12-nation EU.

The steel beams are used in office blocks and other big buildinga and the manufacturers found guilty by the Commission come from almost all the EU's north European states. Van Miert said all who agreed had up to five years to pay up.
Just after British  Steel on Van Miert's list of "habitual offenders" was Unimetal, which is owned by
French steel group Usinor Sacilor and was  fined 12.3 million Ecus ($13.7 million).
The fines followed a three-year inquiry which began with the seizure of documents in surprise raids by
EU anti-trust experts at the premises of steelmakers across Europe in early 1991.

Germany's Preussag said it would do all it could to fight its  fine of 9.5 million Ecus ($10.6 million) and spokesmen from other German firms involved, Thyssen and Krupp Hoesch, told Reuters they were surprised by media reports on the  fines.
British  Steel Plc said in London it planned to appeal the commission's decision.

"The company has not received official notification of the Commission's decision and is not able, therefore, either to confirm the reports or to assess the basis of the decision and the calculation of the fine," it said in a statement.
Companies can appeal against the Commission's decision in the EU's Court of First Instance in
Luxembourg.

The Commission decision came a day after talks in which Van Miert and fellow-commissioner Martin Bangemann asked steel industry representatives to offer new cuts in  steel production capacity to alleviate the sector's wider troubles.

Page 61 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
While the latest forecasts suggest an upturn in demand this year, the Commission is trying to broker a plan which would lead to major reductions in production capacity, with job losses well in excess of
50,000 expected in the restructuring process.

Steel industry analysts in London, surprised by the size of the  fines, hinted that the Commission's move was not likely to help efforts to streamline the industry.

"Clearly the Commission is doing it now because it is frustrated with the private-sector companies not coming forward with capacity cuts," John Graham, an analyst with Warburgs financial house, said.

"This seems unfair. First the commission agrees to further subsidies to state-owned steelmakers and then they announce  fines for the private steelmakers," said analyst Graham Philips of James Capel stockbrokers.

A few minutes before Van Miert's news conference, Bangemann had told reporters he wanted the steel industry to come up with up to 3 million metric tons of further capacity cuts before an April 22 meeting of EU industry ministers.

HD       EU fines 16 steel companies $116 million. BY        By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (Reuter) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined 16
European steel companies about $116 million for running a cartel in the steel-beam sector.

It gave few details of individual  fines, although British  Steel was fined 32 million European currency units (about $36 million), according to EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.

TD
A Commission statement issued as Van Miert held a news conference listed the companies  fined as:

British  Steel, Arbed SA, Usinor Sacilor's Unimetal, Saarstahl AG, Ferdofin SpA, Thyssen Stahl AG, Preussag AG, Empresa Nacional Siderurgica, Siderurgica Aristrain Madrid, Cockerill Sambre, NHM Stahlwerke GmbH, Krupp Hoesch AG, SSAB Svenskt Stahl, Inexa Profil AB, Norsk Jernverk AS and Fundia Steel AB.

Van Miert told the news conference the companies had operated a  cartel which began in 1984, but that the Commission's  fines only penalised the firms for their illegal practices from 1988 onwards, the end of a previous declared crisis in the European  steel industry.
The Commission statement cited among the offences price fixing,  sharing  out markets and exchanging
"on a grand scale" confidential information on the market for steel beams in the EU.

It said 17 companies were involved in the  cartel -- of which 16 were fined -- and said that they as well as their European federation, Eurofer, had to put an immediate end to anti-competitive practices.
It said no  fine had been imposed on Acciaierie E Ferriere Stefana F. Lli. Fu Girolamo SpA and Eurofer. The commission statement did not list the  fines for all the individual companies but Van Miert told the
news conference British  Steel, Unimetal and Thyssen had been  fined the most.

Some Commission officials had previously questioned the timing of the  fines while the Commission was simultaneously trying to get private  steel firms to slash production capacity to ease pressure on the entire sector.

A few minutes before Van Miert's announcement, Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann had told reporters the Commission wants the European  steel industry to come up with 2-3 million tonnes of further capacity cuts before an April 22 meeting of EU industry ministers.

Bangemann said  steel representatives had not offered any fresh cuts at a meeting with him on Tuesday night, but that the parties would meet again shortly before the April 22 meeting.

PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuter) - France's Usinor Sacilor said it contested the  European Commission's allegation of violations of competition rules in the  steel beam sector, but said it was too early to say whether or not it would appeal the  fines.
"We contest the allegations we were running a  cartel. If there had been a  cartel, prices would not
have collapsed as they have done in the past few years," Usinor Sacilor director of international affairs
Jean-Yves Gilet told Reuters.

TD
"But before we know what we're going to do, we need to know exactly what we are accused of," he added.

Gilet also said the  fines were excessively high just when Europe's  steel industry was going through tough times and was forced to carry out drastic cuts in capacity.
"We don't understand the harshness of the (European Commission's) position," he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, the EU Commission said it had  fined 16 European steel companies about
$116 million for running a  cartel in the steel-beam sector.

HD         Commission appears to relax steel capacity  cut demands. BY         By Suzanne Perry

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (Reuter) - While the European Commission is at odds with the  steel industry over its decision to  fine 16 companies for running a steal-beam cartel, it appeared on Wednesday to be relaxing its demands for capacity cuts.

Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told reporters he was looking for new cuts of at least two to three million tonnes in hot-rolled products to supplement 17 million tonnes of cuts that were either already agreed or expected.

TD
That would bring the cuts within the range of the 19 to 26 million tonnes a year in overcapacity that has been cited by the Commission in its campaign to entice the industry to restructure with EU help.

However, Bangemann said during November's Industry Council he was hoping to achieve a higher total of 25.5 million tonnes of cuts in hot-rolled capacity.

A official at the  steel industry group Eurofer said earlier that talks with the Commission on Tuesday night had gone well because the Commission had shown more willingness to recognise that the  steel industry had already shut down significant  steel capacity.

"It's still subject to discussion, but it's a very good step from what came from the Commission before," Christian Mari said.

The Commission had complained before Tuesday's meeting that the EU's  steel rescue plan was near collapse because the industry had not come up with the needed capacity cuts.

But a decision by the December Industry Council to approve almost seven billion European currency units in government aid for state-owned plants in Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal infuriated unaided companies and stalled restructuring efforts.

Industry sources said the decision of Germany's Kloeckner-Werke AG to sell a majority interest in the Kloeckner Stahl GmbH steelworks to a consortium backed by the Bremen government had also dashed hopes that the loss-making company would shut down about two million tonnes of capacity.

Bangemann said only about 11 million tonnes of  steel cuts were certain -- about half from the private sector and half linked to the December subsidy package.

He said four million additional tonnes were expected from a group of  steel mills in Brescia, Italy, and two million more in the coming weeks from the private  steel sector. He gave no further details.
Bangemann said the Commission wanted companies to forward their closure plans before an April 22
Industry Council. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said separately that the Commission
would meet again with  steel companies at the end of March to finalise plans.

Bangemann repeated his warning that the EU's  steel rescue plan, which involves loans and money to cover job losses, would have to be withdrawn if companies did not come up with sufficient cuts.

But he tied the warning to the minimum amount of capacity cuts needed. "All (the measures) have been set up only with a view of freezing excess capacity," he said. "If we don't get the lower limit, those measures would be nonsensical."

A key deadline is March 21, when applications are due for an EU loan scheme designed to help companies pool funds to finance 10.5 million tonnes of capacity cuts in heavy sections, hot-rolled wide strip and plate.
Bangemann said the Council would have to decide whether to extend the deadline. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

BONN, Feb 16 (Reuter) - Preussag AG, the German metals and engineering group, said on Wednesday it would use "all means" to fight  fines imposed by the European Commission for breaking European Union competition rules.
"The imposition of  fines is incomprehensible for us because Preussag Stahl did not take part in a
cartel to regulate prices and volumes," Preussag said in a statement, referring to its  steel company.

TD
The Commission announced that it would impose  fines against 16 companies for price  fixing,
sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information in the  steel beam sector.
The fines total more than 104 million Ecus including a  fine of 9.5 million for Preussag. Preussag said it would use all means available to oppose the  fines once it received a formal
explanation of the grounds on which they were based.
It added that it did not believe a  cartel as defined by the Commission had ever existed. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

DUESSELDORF, Germany, Feb 16 (Reuter) - Germany's leading steel companies said they were surprised by press reports of  fines imposed by the European Commission for alleged violations of competition rules in the  steel beam sector.
Spokesmen for  steel firms Thyssen AG, Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch Krupp and Preussag AG told
Reuters that the Commission had not formally notified them of the  fines.

TD
"Everything we know is coming from the media," said Thyssen spokesman Peter Blau.
The companies declined to comment on the  fines until receiving official notification from the
Commission.

European Union competition commissioner Karel van Miert announced earlier that the Commission would impose fines of 104 million Ecus against 16 steel companies for price fixing,  sharing  out markets and exchanging confidential information in the steel beam sector.

He said the companies involved had operated a  cartel since 1984, but the  fines were applied only from 1988 onwards.

ELEVENTH-HOUR talks have been under way in Brussels to try to head off huge  fines threatened by the European Commission against six major steelmakers.

The commission has warned it is ready to impose penalties against the six - Arbed, British Steel, Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Fundia Norske - for allegedly operating a cartel in heavy steel and beams.

TD
Speculation is growing that the commission is using the threat as part of its leverage to get the private sector to agree to capacity reductions of up to 25m tonnes, which was recommended in a European Union plan adopted in last December.

Commissioners could be prepared to moderate the penalties in return for commitments to rationalisation. The maximum penalties could be 10% of turnover in the products in question.
The commissioners are keen to bring the private sector into the deal. Private firms are upset at the
$7.5bn of subsidies allowed to state-owned producers.

The issue has highlighted a clash between a directorate which seems to sanction co-operation to help the industry, and one which restricts market distortion. A similar conflict existed between a directorate sympathetic to shipping, against one suspicious of rate-fixing  aspects of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement.

HD         EC PLAN TO REVAMP STEEL INDUSTRY IN RUINS - BRITISH STEEL. BY          By James Landale, in Brussels.

LP
THE decision by the European Commission to impose fines today on British  Steel and 16 other European steel producers for operating a cartel in the late 1980s comes as its plan to restructure the industry lies in tatters.

Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this month that the plan had failed because Europe's unsubsidised  steel producers had not offered to make a single cut in production to reduce overcapacity. "We cannot deliver the goods," he said.

TD
The commission's plan seeks to cut production, mainly in strip  steel, by 30m tonnes and to shed
50,000 jobs. The overall aim is to raise prices and increase revenue.

Last December, the commission secured production cuts of 5.5m tonnes from German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish state-owned  steel producers, in return for final, one-off state aids worth
#5.2bn to help their restructuring plans. These cuts were supposed to encourage the unsubsidised companies, including British  Steel, to make voluntary cuts of about 10.5m tonnes or to contribute to a compensation fund for companies making the cuts.

However, these producers have not offered to make cuts, arguing that December's subsidies still represent an unfair distortion of the market. British  Steel, one of Europe's most efficient  steel companies, has not received any state aid since 1985, three years before it was privatised.

Last night Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, and Mr Van Miert met  steel industry chiefs, including Brian Moffat, chairman of British  Steel, over dinner in Brussels to repeat their demands for cuts. Though the  fines are likely to be high, the commission has never imposed the maximum penalty of 10% of turnover. The largest  fine was #57.7m in 1991 on Tetrapak, a
Swiss-Swedish packaging company, for abuse of its dominant position in the market.

The 17 steel companies have faced various charges, from price  fixing  to market sharing  and illegal information exchange, since commission officials carried out dawn raids to gather documents in 1991. Steel producers claim that the commission failed to indicate how they could move from a legal  cartel which existed between 1980 and 1988 to resolve a similar problem of over-capacity back to an open market.

The commission agreed to allow  sharing  of information and markets to help the industry through the slump. However, when the market picked up, the  cartel was not closed down. "It was not feasible to go back to the open market overnight," an industry source said. However, commission sources were last night unrepentant, saying that the  cartel broke EC law and must face the consequences.

The European Commission will today impose large fines on British  Steel and 16 other European steel producers for running a price-fixing  and market-sharing  cartel in the 1980s. Commission officials are thought to have demanded that the companies pay at least #80m. British  Steel is believed to face a #10m  fine.

British  Steel privately protested to the commission yesterday about the prospect of  fines; publicly, however, it emphasised that it had received no communication from Brussels on the issue.

TD
The company is angry that the dormant issue of alleged price-fixing  has been raised as discussions take place over subsidies to unprofitable and inefficient producers. It regards the timing as an attempt by the commission to try to win agreement from producers such as itself, which have opposed planned subsidies and capacity cuts.

Last night, senior EC officials met  steel chiefs to try to persuade them to agree production cuts. Industry sources said the commission was clearly using the threat of  fines to coerce producers. "It's pure blackmail," one said.

The companies, which include Luxembourg's Arbed, France's Unimetal, Belgium's Cockerill-Sambre and Germany's Thyssen, NMH Stahlwerke, Krupp-Hoesch and Saarstahl, are accused of fixing  prices of heavy steel sections and beams. Ferdofin and Sweden's Fundia Norske are also set to be fined.

The commission can fine each company up to 10% of its  steel beams turnover for violating Article 65 of the European Coal and  Steel Community Treaty.

HD       EUROPE'S BEAM MAKERS FINED: PENALTIES AGAINST 16 STEEL COMPANIES TOTAL $117
MILLION. (STEEL BEAMS; ANTI-TRUST LAW VIOLATIONS)

Penalties against 16  steel companies total $117 million
BRUSSELS -- Sixteen European  steel beam manufacturers have been  fined a total of $117 million
(104.6 million European currency units) for anti-trust offenses.

TD
In announcing the fines, Karl van Miert, competition commissioner for the European Union's governing European Commission, said that since July 1988 the companies had been  fixing  prices, sharing markets and exchanging normally confidential information. He said the  fines had been calculated against the turnover in the construction beams sector for the companies involved.

Although the commission had the right to  fine them up to 10 percent of turnover, the largest percentage fines imposed were 7.5 percent. Van Miert said the companies had violated Article 65 of the Coal and Steel Community treaty in activities in the Eu and in Scandinavia.

In money terms, British  Steel received the heaviest penalty of 32 million ECUs. But Van Miert stressed that while British  Steel had played an important part in the  cartel, its fine was based mainly on its turnover and also on how long the infringements had continued.

Some companies had received light or nominal  fines as they had been "pushed" by other members of the cartel into colluding with them, he said. The illegal activities practiced by thB companies were "clear cut... they were about price  fixing,  about sharing  markets," he said.

The products in question were hot-rolled beams wider than 80 millimeters used in the construction industry. Production of the beams increased sharply through the 1980s, from 4.77 million metric tons in
1984 to 8.0 million tons in 1990, with the biggest output coming from Britain, Germany, Spain and Luxembourg. In 1990, British  Steel's output of the beams was worth 401 million EUC's while Unimetal's was 168 million ECUs, van Miert said in demonstrating how turnover had been a determining factor in setting the  fines.

He said the severity of the fines demonstrated that the commission was determined to enforce competition laws. The fines were among the largest ever imposed by the commission, he said.

The largest single  fine imposed for anti-trust violations--75 million ECUs--was imposed on the Swedish packaging company Tetra Pak in 1991.
Most of Europe's major  steel producers were fined (see list on page 5).

BRUSSELS -- Finding that Europe's major steelmakers engaged in massive price  fixing  and carve-up of markets in the  steel-beam sector, the  European Commission imposed fines totaling 104 million European currency units ($116.7 million) against 16 companies.

The heaviest  fines were assessed against British  Steel PLC, at 32 million ECUs; the Unimetal SA division of France's Usinor Sacilor, at 12.3 million ECUs, and Arbed SA of Luxembourg, fined 11.2 million ECUs. British  Steel and Usinor both indicated that they expect to appeal the fines to the European Court of Justice.

TD
"We're rather surprised by the principle as well as the overall size of the  fines," said Jean-Yves Gilet, director of strategy and international affairs at Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steelmaker. "We contest the logic of all this." Some industry officials said privately they were "outraged" by the decision.

The commission, however, said the companies' anticompetitive behavior warranted the big  fines. "This was a situation where everything that could be infringed was infringed by these companies," said the European Union's competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert. "We had to be tough."

One element of the  cartel, he said, involved restricting the flow of information on the  steel sector in order to freeze out any new competitors.

The commission's record  fine to a single company is a 75 million ECU levy against the Swedish-owned packaging concern Tetra Pak AB in 1991. Collectively, however, the  fines announced Wednesday represent the largest penalty ever imposed under EU competition law.

The fines, however, will do little to resolve a deadlock between the commission and much of Europe's steel industry over the need for cutbacks in EU  steel output. Both sides failed to put forth any new ideas during a dinner meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.

Unsubsidized steelmakers continued to complain that the 6.79 billion ECUs in subsidies the EU approved in December for state-owned steelmakers in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal are distorting the market, participants said. The commission, represented by Mr. Van Miert and fellow industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, pressed the unsubsidized producers to reduce laminating capacity in the flat-products sector by several more million tons than already realized or pledged. But many steelmakers are reluctant to shut down mills at a time the  steel market looks like it's about to rebound.

Steel-industry officials on Wednesday underlined the contradictions in the EU's policy, which they say distorts fair competion by subsidizing some producers while fining others for allegedly breaching competition law. In addition, Mr. Van Miert didn't give any firm pledge during Tuesday's dinner that the commission would block a planned government bailout of Germany's bankrupt Kloeckner-Werke AG, which alone has two million tons in cold-rolling capacity.

"The commission must reassure unsubisidized steelmakers that they mean what they say" in pledging to block any new subsidies. "Then they'll get cooperation and progress," said an industry official. The

commission, on the other hand, is offering financial help to pay hefty costs of layoffs that closures would entail. Some steelmakers say a compromise is still possible.

"We all agreed not to throw out the baby with the bathwater," contended Usinor Sacilor's Mr. Gilet. "There could be further restructurings." Both sides agreed to meet again late next month prior to an April
22 meeting of EU industry ministers.

In any event, Mr. Van Miert sought to draw a sharp distinction at Tuesday's press conference between the steel industry's current sorry plight of depressed prices and staggering losses and the "considerable profits" enjoyed by an expanding industry during the peak period of  cartel-like behavior in the late 1980s.

Under the EU's competition laws,  fines for cartels can total 10% of a company's revenue in the relevant business during the previous year, but such a percentage is reserved for repeat offenders: The  steel       fines ranged from 3% to 7.5%, depending on the alleged gravity and length of infringement.

British Steel, Unimetal and Thyssen Stahl AG received the harshest treatment, the commission said. Tiny fines against some Swedish and Norwegian producers -- one of them a measly four ECUs -- were merely "symbolic" in that those companies were "pushed" by other producers into anticompetitive activity in the Danish market, Mr. Van Miert said.
Officials said  cartel-like behavior dated back to 1984, but the  fines reflected activity only since July
1988, after the EU's  steel industry emerged from a strict commission-imposed regime of price and output
controls brought on by an earlier crisis.

Part of the commission's decision was an injunction against the  steel companies and their trade group, Eurofer, not to engage in any further anticompetitive activity. The commission said 17 steelmakers were involved in the cartel, but one of them, Acciaierie & Ferriere Stefana F. Lli. Fu Girolamo SpA, wasn't fined.

HD   EU FINES ARISTRAIN AND ENSIDESA OVER PRICE FIXING. WC   197 words

The European Commission has fined Aristrain 1,675m ptas and CSI unit Ensidesa 632m ptas over price fixing.  The size of the Aristrain fine is explained by the supposed existence of specific agreements with British Steel. The Basque company is to appeal, arguing that the meetings referred to by the  European      Commission were the failed talks over British  Steel taking an equity stake in Aristrain. Ensidesa is also to appeal.

Meanwhile, CSI president Jose Manuel Garcia Hermoso has appeared before the Industry committee of Congress. He emphasised that operating losses had been reduced from the 1992 figure of 60,000m ptas for AHV and Ensidesa to between 35,000m ptas and 40,000m ptas last year. Garcia Hermoso said that one of the causes for the crisis in the integrated  steel industry was a 33% fall in prices between the last quarter of 1990 and January 1st, 1993.

TD
Since February 1993 the workforce of CSI has fallen by 5,300, mainly through early retirements. This year there should be a further reduction of 1,800 and the closure of facilities at Sestao and Baracaldo.

The level of  fines against British Steel and 16 other major European  steel makers was due to be fixed at a meeting of the European Commission in Brussels yesterday.

The penalties could be either token or punitive, and follow a three-year investigation into an alleged price-fixing  cartel in breach of European Union competition law.

TD
The 17 commissioners will have based their decision on recommendations from senior officials, who considered the size of the  fines at talks on Tuesday.

EU law permits the commission to impose  fines of up to 10% of annual turnover if the rules on fair competition have been ignored.

The commission insists a price-fixing  ring operated for years in the  steel beams sector, propping up ailing companies illegally. `The case is clear,' said one commission official on Tuesday.
He ruled out any last-minute reprieve for the companies involved.

British  Steel is particularly bitter about the  fines. It has an excellent record on trimming surplus capacity and shedding jobs in line with a Europe-wide strategy for reviving the industry.

It denies acting illegally. The company is also refusing to make any more capacity cuts in the latest round, pointing to the Spanish, Italian and German  steel firms' modest response to the need for cutbacks.

The commission wants companies to cut production by 30milliontonnes this year, but a bitter row has broken out because of subsidies paid to  steel producers in Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy.

Shadow trade and industry secretary Robin Cook described as `perverse' the prospect of the commission imposing a fine on British  Steel for allegedly taking part in a  cartel.

He called on the government to demand that `unfair subsidies' to other European  steel companies should stop.

A full-scale inquiry into claims that British  Steel deliberately killed off the Scottish  steel industry was demanded last night.

Labour and Scottish National Party MPs acted in the wake of the #29million  fine imposed on the company by the European Commission for breaking competition law.

TD
The EU action against British  Steel and 16 other European  steel producers - with fines totalling
#94.5m - sparked fury in Westminster, where English Tory MPs joined in angry attacks on the
Government for not doing more to defend the UK firm.
They accused the Eurocrats of singling out BS - which is set to appeal - for the heaviest  fine
because it was the most successful  steel maker in Europe.
But Shadow Scottish Minister Henry McLeish claimed the Commission's finding of an illegal  cartel
raised new questions about why the last remaining  steel plant in Scotland was closed.
He asked if the report of the  cartel explained why BS insisted on the closure.

And he called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang "to join with us in demanding an inquiry to expose the truth behind what as happened to Scottish  steel".
SNP leader Alex Salmond broke into Commons exchanges on the fine to claim BS had
"sacrificed" Ravenscraig as the "price for entering into a sordid price-fixing  cartel in Europe".

Industry Minister Tim Sainsbury, who faced the brunt of Commons anger over the affair, retorted these were "typical unsubstantiated allegations" from Mr Salmond.
Earlier the Banff and Buchan MP had claimed the shut-down was "a quid pro quo to help British
Steel generate massive profits "by throwing thousands of Scottish workers on to the scrap heap".
Meanwhile, BS chiefs consulted advisers after being hit by the massive penalty. They maintained that they had still not heard officially from the Commission.
Mr Sainsbury said: "I shall do all I can to make sure the subsidies are eliminated."

But he made clear that under EU rules the Commission had sole jurisdiction in the application of competition law.

European industry commissioner Karel van Miert said Brussels had no option but to act to enforce the rules.
He claimed BS had suffered the steepest fine because the company had the highest turnover in
Europe of the sector involved in the cartel.
"British  Steel has been fully involved in this whole affair," he said.

Page 85 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Liberal Democrat industry spokesman Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon, said: "It is difficult to understand why BS should suffer such a penalty especially as some other members of the European Union are continuing to subsidise their  steel industries."
Mr van Miert said the firms infringed European rules on competition on three scores: Price fixing.

Sharing out markets.
Circulating information on a restricted basis.
"The rules were infringed quite clearly over a very long period of time indeed.
The infringements began in 1984, at a time when Europe's  steel industry was declared to be in
"manifest crisis".
But the Commission investigation only went back to the period beginning in July, 1988.

European steelmakers reacted angrily last night to  fines of ECU 104.4m (#78.9m) imposed on 16 companies by the European Commission for allegedly operating a  cartel in steel beams used in the construction industry.

Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British  Steel, said the company would be appealing against the decision, probably to the European Court of Justice. British  Steel, seen by the Commission as one of the ringleaders, faces the heaviest  fine of the 16 steelmakers - ECU 32m (#24.3m).

TD
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German  steel federation, said: 'German  steel companies will not accept this decision silently. They will instead defend themselves in front of the European Court of Justice and show that all principles of free competition have been respected.'

The steelmakers are upset both by the timing of the decision and the judgment itself. Following dawn raids by the Commission's competition directorate in 1991, a judgment against the companies was made in 1992, but no  fines were announced.

One steelmaker says it had heard nothing from the Commission on the matter for a year until this week's 'controlled leak'. This threatened to add further controversy ahead of Tuesday's crucial meeting between heads of the big producers and the Commission. The industry clearly believes the leak was intended to put pressure on it to agree to much-needed capacity cuts.

The Commission says that after 1988 - when the so-called manifest crisis regime in the industry ended - the industry was repeatedly told to cease  cartel practices in beams and girders. The industry says it repeatedly sought guidance from the Commission on the legality of inter-company discussions.

According to British  Steel, from mid-1988 the Commission authorised a framework of market monitoring. The UK producer rebuts the Commission's comments on market  sharing  - it says it increased its deliveries of beams to Continental markets nearly eight-fold between 1986 and 1993.

Mr Moffat said British  Steel wanted the Commission to be given the authority to vet subsidy cases before the aid is granted rather than retrospectively as occurs now. He said the company would not contribute to the capacity cuts fund if the subsidies issue was not resolved satisfactorily.

HD        BRUSSELS FINES BRITISH STEEL #24M FOR MARKET-RIGGING. BY        By DAVID GARDNER and ANDREW BAXTER AND KEVIN BROWN.

British Steel was yesterday fined ECU 32m (#24.3m) for breaking European rules outlawing price-fixing. The fine was the heaviest single penalty imposed by the  European Commission on 16 leading steelmakers it found guilty of operating a  cartel to supply the construction industry.
The penalties on the 16 totalled a record ECU 104.4m and were accompanied by a stiff warning that the
Commission would take a tough line against market-rigging in any industry.

TD
Brussels also issued an ultimatum to private steelmakers over plans for capacity cuts agreed by EU
industry ministers last December.

The commission said the ECU 240m fund to ease the redundancies created by the restructuring would be withdrawn unless by April the  steel companies came up with the agreed capacity cuts.

The 16 companies were found guilty of infringing all the provisions of Article 65 of the European Coal and Steel Treaty, which outlaws price-fixing,  market-sharing  and exchanging confidential information.

'This was a case when everything that can be infringed has been infringed,' said Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, justifying the unprecedented severity of the  fines. 'We needed to be tough,' he said, adding: 'There should no longer be any doubt that the rules of competition are applicable in this Community.'

Mr Van Miert said the Commission had levied the heaviest  fines on 'those who have sinned repeatedly'. Other ringleaders in the  cartel to rig prices for beams and girders, according to the Commission, were Unimetal, a division of France's Usinor-Sacilor,  fined ECU 12.3m; and Thyssen of Germany,  fined ECU
6.5m.

The Commission's decision was bitterly criticised during angry exchanges in the House of Commons. MPs of all parties said the judgment was unfair to British  Steel.

Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, rejected claims that the  fines were linked to the Commission's plans to reduce capacity throughout Europe. Mr Phillip Oppenheim, a Conservative backbencher, accused the Commission of rigging the  steel market and creating 'a mess of overcapacity'.
German steelmakers and British  Steel said they would appeal against the Commission's judgment to the
European Court of Justice. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German  steel federation, said:
'German  steel companies will not accept this decision silently.'

Under the December deal, state-owned steelmakers in Spain, Germany and Italy received government subsidies worth ECU 6.8bn in return for capacity cuts of over 5m tonnes. Non-aided producers, however, are supposed to deliver capacity cuts of between 19m and 25m tonnes. So far, according to Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, they have delivered 13m tonnes of cuts, with 4m tonnes more promised.

HD       EU FINES BRITISH STEEL #24.6M.

The European Commission fined British  Steel #24.6 million yesterday for being a leading member of
"a very serious, illegal price-fixing  cartel".

The fine followed a three year investigation into a  cartel run by British  Steel and 16 other firms. In total, the commission imposed  fines of more than #80 million on all but one of the members of the  cartel, which included steel firms in France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg and Italy. British  Steel is accused of being a key member of the  cartel since 1988 - the year it was privatised.

TD
British Steel said yesterday that it was waiting to hear the details but was likely to appeal against the  fine.

The Industry Minister, Tim Sainsbury, answering an emergency Commons question, said the matter was entirely between the company and the commission. The shadow trade and industry secretary, Robin Cook, said the decision was another blow to the industry andwould cause anger and anxiety among the workforce. He accused ministers of agreeing last December to a subsidy of #5 billion for the  steel industries of other EU countries. The solution to the European  steel crisis was to wind down subsidies to less efficient producers, "not to  fine British  Steel and threaten the most efficient  steel plants in Europe".

Privately, British  Steel officials were astounded by the  fine. They have argued that the operations deemed illegal by the commission's competition authorities had been set up in 1986 at the behest of the commission's industry department as part of emergency measures to deal with a crisis in the industry. They also accused the commission of double standards, claiming that the #5.2 billion of subsidies for state-owned  steel firms were illegal under the same treaty which outlawed cartels.

HD        EC MOVES TO FORCE STEELMAKERS TO REDUCE CAPACITY. BY         By Nicholas Bannister, John Palmer and Mark Milner.

The European Commission yesterday embarked on a high risk strategy to force the community's steelmakers to reduce capacity by up to 30 million tonnes a year with the expected loss of at least
30,000 jobs.

Its decision to impose higher-than-expected  fines on 16 leading steel makers for price fixing  is seen as a warning to the industry which has yet to agree how the capacity cuts should be made.

TD
Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, warned the  steel firms that they might lose EU financial aid if they did not agree by April to cut a further two million tonnes of capacity.

The Commission and the  steel companies agreed in December that up to 30 million tonnes of capacity would have to be taken out if the industry was to become financially viable. This would reduce EU  steel making capacity to between 135 million to 145 million tonnes a year.

But steel industry chiefs, who met Mr Bangemann on Tuesday, have been unable to agree where the voluntary cuts should be made. They have also been angered by the Commission's approval of generous subsidies to a number of state-owned  steel firms in return for cutting capacity by five million tonnes, and the planned DM4 takeover of the ailing Kloeckner  steel plant at Bremen by local state companies.

The Commission yesterday denied that the  fines had any bearing on the restructuring issue. However, industry and City sources claimed they were a veiled warning that the Commission was prepared to get tough on the capacity cuts.
They said the policy could backfire, with the heavy  fines taking away any remaining appetite among the
European steelmakers to come up with proposals for further plant closures.

Graham Philips, an analyst at James Capel, said the  fines seemed unfair. "First the commission agrees to further subsidies to state-owned  steel makers and then they announce  fines for the private  steel makers."

John Graham of Warburgs said: "There is going to be nothing happening on the capacity front while Kloeckner-Werke remains open. If it were to be closed down in six months time because the Commission ruled that the takeover bid was against the public interest, then maybe the private mills would come forward with additional cuts."

British  Steel, whose chairman Brian Moffat attended Tuesday's meeting with Mr Bangemann, has not offered and has not been asked to reduce its capacity. It has, however, offered to share the costs of capacity cuts by less efficient companies provided there are no further state subsidies for its rivals.

Mr Bangemann, speaking at a press conference in Brussels yesterday, said that since last December the steel makers had only agreed about 11 million tonnes of capacity cuts. Even if a further six million tonnes of reductions which had been discussed materialised this would still leave a minimum of two million tonnes of excess capacity to ensure a viable European  steel industry.


Page 92 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"If we do not achieve the lower limit of the capacity reductions then there may be no justification for the special aid measures we have announced," he said, "We will expect to hear again from the  steel producers before the next meeting of European Union industry ministers in April."

The steel industry lost $4.5 billion in 1992 and is believed to have suffered even bigger losses last year. The Commission forecasts that the total capacity reduction it is seeking could lead to the loss of more than 30,000 jobs in the industry this year alone. But its programme of aid for redundant  steel workers, retraining and help with development of alternative industries is aimed at easing the impact of closure
on steel making regions.

According to some forecasts, Germany's steelmakers will have to bear the brunt of any capacity cuts. Some steelmakers in the non-subsidised sector argue that they have already done much. By the end of this year, Thyssen, for example, will have laid off some 15,000 workers.

They also argue that the five million tons of capacity being taken out of the subsidised sector is, in practice, only half that figure and that the support agreed for the subsidised sector - in Italy, Spain, Portugal and eastern Germany - under the December deal in exchange for capacity reduction will not be the last.

Minister `washes hands' of  steel companies penalty - Cook urges rethink over subsidy - Tunnel security tightened amid terrorism fears

Lord Tebbit, former Conservative Party chairman, buried his head in his hands in a gesture of despair yesterday as he sat in the Commons gallery listening to Tim Sainsbury, Minister of State for Industry, wash his hands of the  European Commission attempt to  fine British  Steel #28m.

TD
The Commission has decided to impose a  fine of about ecu 100m (#76m) on 16  steel companies after an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices involving beams for the construction industry. It found price-fixing,  exchange of information and market-sharing.  British  Steel, which faces the heaviest fine, is expected to appeal.

Mr Sainsbury, responding to a Labour demand for a statement, provoked uproar when he told MPs: "I would stress that this matter is entirely for the Commission and the company." Robin Cook, Labour trade and industry spokesman, sounded astonished. "The survival of the British  steel industry is not something else Mr Sainsbury can add to the long list of things for which this Government will take no responsibility."

British  Steel had made the biggest cuts in capacity and yet would be hit by a  fine three times that of the next biggest  fine, and larger than the profits it declared in the first six months of 1993.
Mr Cook urged Mr Sainsbury to reconsider his agreement at the Council of Ministers last December to a
#5bn subsidy for the  steel industries of Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. "How can it be fair
competition to fine BS millions and subsidise German and Italian  steel by billions?" There should be no
more cuts in steel capacity in Britain until the rest of Europe matched those BS had already made, he
added.

Mr Sainsbury wondered whether Mr Cook was suggesting leaving the EU and abrogating the treaties of Rome and Paris. The purpose of the December agreement had been to reduce operating subsidies and to introduce strict monitoring.

Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, sat gloomy-faced on the front bench as his deputy came under fire, not only from Labour but from a succession of Tory Eurosceptics. In the gallery reserved for peers, their champion, Lord Tebbit, buried his head as Mr Sainsbury, seemingly incapable of
deflecting the angry mood, said MPs should not assume the appeal would go against BS "any more than we should assume it would succeed".

From the Conservative side, Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said European treaties had caused a "disastrous mess" in Britain's coal and  steel industries and should be renegotiated. Phillip Oppenheim, MP for Amber Valley, said the EC was "the biggest rigger of markets of the lot".

Roger Knapman (C. Stroud) wanted a guarantee that  fines in Italy would not be paid with a further subsidy. " #28m is a lot of money. It will keep 28 MEPs going for a full working year," he added.

MPs were keenly aware that, two weeks ago, Mr Sainsbury, with a similarly impassive Mr Heseltine by his side, had announced the takeover of Britain's last volume car-maker, Rover Group, by BMW of
Page 94 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Germany. And last May he had signalled the end of shipbuilding on the Tyne with the closure of Swan
Hunter. On both occasions he disclaimed any Government responsibility. "When it comes to
hand-wringing and hand-washing, Mr Sainsbury has no lessons to learn from Pontius Pilate," Stuart Bell,
Labour MP for Middlesbrough, said.

Perhaps the day's lack of enthusiasm for Europe accounted for the near-empty chamber as approval was given to an Order intended to strengthen the defences of the Channel tunnel against terrorists,
bomb-hoaxers and train hijackers.

The Channel Tunnel (Security) Order creates a number of new offences, all punishable by life sentences, including hijacking, seizing control of the tunnel system, destroying or damaging tunnel trains or the system, and making threats. It places responsibility for security on Eurotunnel and British Rail and gives authority for searches of trains, passengers and buildings.

Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said the tunnel was Britain's prestige engineering project of the last part of the century and as such was likely to attract the attention of terrorists, and of "slightly potty" attention-seekers.

A feeling of security and safety was crucial to the success of the venture, he said. If ministers and Eurotunnel thought that "at some point they are going to contract-out some of these security duties to people like Group 4, they can write off any thought that there is going to be any profit.

"Nobody will use the tunnel if they're going to involve people like Group 4." Security had to remain with the British Transport Police and other police forces.

John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said it would "foolish" to think that the tunnel would not be a major target for terrorism. He told MPs that a very large number of workers from the Irish Republic had been involved in the project.

"They had their chaplaincy and they had their Irish pubs. It may not be generally known that at those Irish pubs there were considerable collections taken for IRA funds." Mr Taylor added that contracts for
catering on the trains and duty-free shopping had gone to two Irish firms, and called for "proper screening and vetting of staff". The Order was agreed without a vote.

HD         Commission steel fines send message to ailing industries. BY         By Suzanne Perry

BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's decision to  fine 16 steelmakers for running a cartel breaks no new legal ground, but it sends a strong political message to Europe's struggling industries, anti-trust lawyers said.

The Commission has signaled: "If you want to deal with the recession, you've got to understand that our rules are that you can only deal with coordinated reductions of capacity," said Peter Alexiadis, a lawyer at Coudert Brothers.

TD
"Anything else is out of the question."

On Wednesday, the Commission fined the companies a record 104 million Ecus for operating a secret cartel to rig prices and markets for steel building beams. The  fines come at the same time the Commission is trying to broker a steel restructuring plan based on deep capacity cuts.

Petrochemical producers, who are struggling to cope with an ethylene glut, are among those who will get the message, said Frank  Fine, a lawyer at Jaques & Lewis.
"There are legal ways to reduce overcapacity," he said. "Then there's the (illegal) quick fix."

A plan by the Association of Petrochemical Producers in Europe to coordinate the shutdown of 1.5 million tonnes a year of ethylene production failed in December when some firms refused to pay into a fund to subsidise closures.

The Commission has authorised  steel companies to set up similar funds, backed by EU loans, but the rules specifically bar any kind of joint price  fixing  or concerted policies on production, investment or sales.

Shipping companies and paper and cardboard packaging producers are among others that have been targeted recently for Commission  cartel investigations.

But the  steel industry may interpret the Commission's action in its case as vindictive given that the Commission is upset because the sector has not come up yet with sufficient capacity cuts, Alexiadis said.

The Commission has traditionally had a close relationship with the  steel sector, which has a protected status under the European Coal and  Steel Community Treaty. But that treaty is due to expire in the year 2002 and the EU is starting to phase out its activities.

Alexiadis said the industry became used to  cartel-like activity in the 1980s, when the Commission declared that the industry was in a "manifest crisis" and set production quotas under the so-called Davignon Plan. "It's difficult to teach an old dog new tricks," he said.

In fact, in levying the  cartel fines, the Commission specifically exempted activity from 1980 to 1988, when the Davigon Plan was in effect. "Historically, the Commission has gone very hard in co-regulating and accepting arrangements in the  steel industry," said Barry Hawk, a partner at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.

"But if you're an enforcement official, you say I don't care what we did under the Davignon Plan, my job is to enforce (EU competition rules)."

The fines also show EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert can be as tough as his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, despite expectations he would be more "flexible", Alexiadis said.
Although the total level of  fines set a record, those levied against individual companies do not.

The highest, 32 million Ecus for British  Steel Plc, is less than half the biggest individual  fine imposed by the Commission in a competition case -- 75 million Ecus against packaging group Tetra Pak in 1991 for abusing a dominant position.

LONG-SUFFERING British  Steel shareholders might feel that the 32m ecu  fine levied by the European Commission is the final insult. Since the company's flotation in 1988, the shares have risen only 16%, missing out on most of the stock market's impressive gains in the past five-and-a-half years. Now the EC is threatening to relieve the group of #24.3m, not far short of what it made in the first half of 1993 and a fifth more than it paid in dividends for 1992.

TD
It is at least reassuring to know that BS can afford to pay the  fine. The group had net debts of only #15m at the middle of last year, and the EC's punishment amounts to less than 1% of the group's #3.7bn net asset value. But it is galling for BS's management, which has toiled to reduce working capital, to hand a portion of the proceeds to Brussels. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the EC's accusations of
price-fixing,  it should also be reassuring for BS's shareholders that Europe's  steel market still has a remarkable capacity to absorb price increases. Prices for most basic  steel products have risen by 15% or more in the past year, even though there is overcapacity and demand is falling in many markets. In other industries, surely a combination of falling demand and overcapacity would result in lower prices?

But BS's shareholders should not trouble themselves unduly, since the price increases will transform the group's profitability. Profits of perhaps #80m in the year to end-March could become #250m next year.
By then, the EC  fine could have become a distant memory and investors could finally see a better return from their privatised asset.

RECOVERY! What recovery? That was the question being posed by investors in the Square Mile as equities and government bonds raced away, confident that another cut in interest rates is on the cards.

Investors and brokers were responding to the latest economic news showing a jump in the headline rate of inflation and another rise in unemployment. They are convinced that last week's 1/4 point reduction in base rates was not enough to kick-start the economy and that another cut will be needed soon. This, they perversely believe, will also channel funds back into the stock market.

TD
As a result, share prices made a firm start, breaching the 3,400 level and growing in confidence as the day wore on, helped by another positive start to trading on Wall Street.

At its best, the FT-SE 100 index was 30 points up, but it closed off the top after the Dow Jones industrial average gave back some of its initial gains. The index ended up 24.5 points at 3,417.7.

Prices were squeezed higher by stock shortages in some areas and this situation may be exacerbated before the expiry of the FT-SE 100 index options tomorrow.

But turnover levels were disappointing, with only 817m shares changing hands, compared with the billion-plus figures seen in recent weeks. Yesterday's figure was also exaggerated by trading in shares of lowly priced Dragon Oil, unchanged at 2p.

By the close of business, a staggering 54m Dragon shares had been traded, with the speculators pinning their hopes on a Hong Kong listing for the shares shortly.

The prospect of a cut in rates attracted support for builders and retailers. There were gains for Amec, 7p to 156p, Higgs and Hill, 5p to 134p, Alfred McAlpine, 7p to 294p, John Mowlem, 3p to 185p, Taylor Woodrow, 9p to 178p, Westbury, 3p to 215p, and George Wimpey, 5p to 235p. Tarmac was another firm market, adding 8p to 194p. It is expected to benefit from the trend towards cheaper money. This has not gone unnoticed by Strauss Turnbull and Cazenove, the brokers, which have both been recommending the shares to clients. Among the retailers, gains were seen in Betterware, 10p to 151p, Marks and Spencer, 61/2p to 4321/2p, Storehouse, 4p to 237p, Boots, 7p to 543p, Carpetright, 9p to 304p, and Lloyds Chemists, 16p to 347p.

British Aerospace touched 526p before rallying to close 9p cheaper at 531p on reports that Airbus Industrie, in which it has a 20% stake, had lost out to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in a #4bn deal to supply Saudi Arabia with civil aircraft.

But BAe is reputed to be front-runner to supply the Ministry of Defence with two communications satellites worth #300m. The group is expected to unveil full-year figures next week that will include a
#250m provision relating to problems at its turboprop division. British Steel rallied 1p to 1451/2p, unruffled by reports that it had been  fined #22.5m by the European Commission over price fixing.

BAT Industries lost an early lead to finish 1p lighter at 497p. Farmers, its American insurance division, expects to pay out #400m as its share of claims relating to the recent Los Angeles earthquake.

Thorn EMI rose 26p to #11.31 before third-quarter figures next week. Speculators are also pondering the possibility of a bid from QVC Network for Thorn.

United Biscuits added 12p to 357p as Warburg Securities snapped up stock after pointing out the group's attractive yield and low p/e.

Enterprise Oil was marked lower in early trading, but closed off the bottom, with a fall of 4p to 435p. But NatWest Securities says the group is finding it difficult to produce enough earnings to match its current level of dividends. It says a cut in the dividend would be the prudent option but could result in a collapse in the share price, which has been largely supported by yield considerations.

Gilt-Edged: Gilts also made headway on the back of the latest economic data. The March series of the Long Gilt rose Pounds to #116 as a total of 104,000 contracts were completed. All eyes today will be firmly focused on the Bundesbank meeting.
In longs, Treasury 9% 2012 added Pounds to #122, while at the shorter end, Treasury 91/2% 1999 was
#1/8 better at #114.

HD           STEEL TO APPEAL OVER #24M FINE - BRITISH STEEL. BY          By Philip Bassett and James Landale.

British Steel is to press for an early appeal against a #24.3m  fine levied against it yesterday by the
European Commission for illegal price fixing.

The fine, which provoked a row in the Commons, came as part of a larger  fine of #79.2m, covering 15 other European  steel companies, for running a price-fixing  cartel in the 1980s against the terms of European competition law.

TD
MPs and union leaders said that the  fine would lead to new  steel job cuts, but British  Steel said last night it had still not received formal notification of the  fine. BS insisted that its actions were sanctioned by the commission.

The EC said the companies were involved in a clear-cut and systematic  cartel over a number of years, and had been found guilty of price  fixing,  market sharing  and information exchanging in the manufacture of  steel beams, which are used in the construction industry.

Karel van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, said: "Since this is a case where everything which could be infringed has been infringed, we needed to be tough." BS said it was not fully in the beams market until the late 1980s, but the commission said that while it had discounted infringements that occurred during the European  steel industry crisis in the early 1980s, it could not ignore the breach of the laws in the late 1980s.

The companies fined were: Unimetal, #9.3m; Arbed, #8.5m; Siderurgica Aristrain Madrid, #8m; Ferdofin, #7.2m; Preussag, #7.2m; Thyssen Stahl, #4.9m; Saarstahl, #3.5m; Empressa Nacional Siderurgica, #3m; Cockerill Sambre, #3m; NMH Stahlwerke, #113,700; Krupp Hoesch, #9,854; Norsk Jernwerk, #568; Inexa Profil, #455; Svenskt Stal, #30; and Fundia  Steel, #3.
British  Steel suspects that the  fines are connected with calls to cut capacity.

British Steel was preparing last night to appeal against a #24.3m  fine imposed by the European        Commission for colluding in price-fixing,  as Labour MPs and trade union leaders said the penalty could lead to further job losses.

The fine was the largest of the penalties for a total of 16 European  steel producers said to be involved in a "clear-cut and systematic  cartel over a number of years" involving price  fixing  in the
1980s.

HD        European Commission Fines Steelmakers $116.7 Million

BRUSSELS -- Finding that Europe's major steelmakers engaged in massive price  fixing  and carve-up of markets in the  steel-beam sector, the  European Commission imposed fines totaling 104 million European currency units ($116.7 million) against 16 companies.

The heaviest  fines were assessed against British  Steel PLC, at 32 million ECUs; the Unimetal SA division of France's Usinor Sacilor, at 12.3 million ECUs, and Arbed SA of Luxembourg, fined 11.2 million ECUs. British  Steel and Usinor both indicated that they expect to appeal the fines to the European Court of Justice.

TD
"We're rather surprised by the principle as well as the overall size of the  fines," said Jean-Yves Gilet, director of strategy and international affairs at Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steelmaker. "We contest the logic of all this." Some industry officials said privately they were "outraged" by the decision.

The commission, however, said the companies' anticompetitive behavior warranted the big  fines. "This was a situation where everything that could be infringed was infringed by these companies," said the European Union's competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert. "We had to be tough."

One element of the  cartel, he said, involved restricting the flow of information on the  steel sector in order to freeze out any new competitors.

The commission's record  fine to a single company is a 75 million ECU levy against the Swedish-owned packaging concern Tetra Pak AB in 1991. Collectively, however, the  fines announced Wednesday represent the largest penalty ever imposed under EU competition law.

The fines, however, will do little to resolve a deadlock between the commission and much of Europe's steel industry over the need for cutbacks in EU  steel output. Both sides failed to put forth any new ideas during a dinner meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.

Unsubsidized steelmakers continued to complain that the 6.79 billion ECUs in subsidies the EU approved in December for state-owned steelmakers in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal are distorting the market, participants said. The commission, represented by Mr. Van Miert and fellow industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, pressed the unsubsidized producers to reduce laminating capacity in the flat-products sector by several more million tons than already realized or pledged. But many steelmakers are reluctant to shut down mills at a time the  steel market looks like it's about to rebound.

Steel-industry officials on Wednesday underlined the contradictions in the EU's policy, which they say distorts fair competion by subsidizing some producers while fining others for allegedly breaching competition law. In addition, Mr. Van Miert didn't give any firm pledge during Tuesday's dinner that the commission would block a planned government bailout of Germany's bankrupt Kloeckner-Werke AG, which alone has two million tons in cold-rolling capacity.

"The commission must reassure unsubisidized steelmakers that they mean what they say" in pledging to block any new subsidies. "Then they'll get cooperation and progress," said an industry official. The

commission, on the other hand, is offering financial help to pay hefty costs of layoffs that closures would entail. Some steelmakers say a compromise is still possible.

"We all agreed not to throw out the baby with the bathwater," contended Usinor Sacilor's Mr. Gilet. "There could be further restructurings." Both sides agreed to meet again late next month prior to an April
22 meeting of EU industry ministers.

In any event, Mr. Van Miert sought to draw a sharp distinction at Tuesday's press conference between the steel industry's current sorry plight of depressed prices and staggering losses and the "considerable profits" enjoyed by an expanding industry during the peak period of  cartel-like behavior in the late 1980s.

Under the EU's competition laws,  fines for cartels can total 10% of a company's revenue in the relevant business during the previous year, but such a percentage is reserved for repeat offenders: The  steel       fines ranged from 3% to 7.5%, depending on the alleged gravity and length of infringement.

British Steel, Unimetal and Thyssen Stahl AG received the harshest treatment, the commission said. Tiny fines against some Swedish and Norwegian producers -- one of them a measly four ECUs -- were merely "symbolic" in that those companies were "pushed" by other producers into anticompetitive activity in the Danish market, Mr. Van Miert said.
Officials said  cartel-like behavior dated back to 1984, but the  fines reflected activity only since July
1988, after the EU's  steel industry emerged from a strict commission-imposed regime of price and output
controls brought on by an earlier crisis.

Part of the commission's decision was an injunction against the  steel companies and their trade group, Eurofer, not to engage in any further anticompetitive activity. The commission said 17 steelmakers were involved in the cartel, but one of them, Acciaierie & Ferriere Stefana F. Lli. Fu Girolamo SpA, wasn't fined.

STEEL

THE European Commission has endorsed claims that Europe's ailing  steel industry operates a
cartel by fining 16 steelmakers a total of $168 million for their role in a price-  fixing  deal.

TD
British  Steel was singled out as the ringleader in the  cartel, and received the biggest  fine of $60 million - almost equivalent to its pre-tax profit in the six months to September 30.

The fines - the culmination of a three-year investigation into the industry- represent one of the commission's biggest anti-trust busts ever.

"This is a case where everything that can be infringed has been infringed,"a commission official said. "We have to be tough."

The fines drew an immediate and angry response from steelmakers, who announced that they would appeal to the European Court of Justice.

Coming just 24 hours after both the European Competition Commissioner, Mr Karel van Miert, and the Industry Commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, told the industry it needed further cuts in production to survive, the  fines were seen by steelmakers as
part of heavy-handed tactics by Brussels to achieve that goal.

The steel industry, which has been badly hit by the international recession, has been previously told by the commission to cut production by up to 30 million tonnes or face the loss of commission loans earmarked for helping it restructure.

The European  steel industry lost about $5 billion in 1992 and is believed to have suffered even bigger losses last year.

Apart from effectively endorsing complaints from other nations, notably the US, that the European producers operate a  cartel to the detriment of other world producers, the commission's decision has also raised new tensions within the European industry.
Mr van Miert said that the  cartel had made considerable profits as a result of its action. "There should no longer be any doubt that the rules of competition are applicable in this
community," he said.
Also criticised for their role in the  cartel were the French  steel manufacturer Unimetal and the
German group Thyssen.

While a spokesman for British  Steel said the company was "astonished" at the size of the  fines imposed by the commission, the president of the German  steel federation, Mr Ruprecht Vondran, said: "German  steel companies will not accept this decision silently.

"They will instead defend themselves in front of the European Court of Justice and show that all the principles of free competition have been respected."

Commission officials said raids on the Brussels offices of industry representatives had produced evidence of the existence of the  cartel.

According to the commission the companies had made a series of agreements, at least as far back as 1984, to fix prices, share markets and exchange confidential information.

LONDON, Feb 18 (AFP) - The London Stock Exchange lacked direction this week with investors prudent ahead of signs of a faltering in the British economic recovery

After losing 2.8 percent the previous week, the FT-SE 100 share index gained only 3.7 points over the week before, up by 0.1 percent to 3,382.6 points.

TD
The market was largely a backwater despite new hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates, following the half-point reduction in the German discount rate to 5.25 percent on Thursday and a wave of interest rate reductions elsewhere in Europe.

Dealers hoped that a series of poor economic indicators, including a 0.5 percent fall in industrial production in December, a surprise rise in unemployment in January and a weak rise in banking credits would push Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to raise interest rates.

Shares fell back, however on Friday after a fall on Wall Street and the publication of a study by the Nomura research institute revising downwards its forecasts for the FT-SE index, seen as ending the year at 3,500 points and not 4,000.

Among the groups to announce their results, Glaxo Holdings gained 40 pence to 679 after a 22 percent rise in half-year profits, pushing over the billion pound mark for the first time.

British Airways fell by three pence to 472 despite tripling its third quarter profits from the same period in the previous year. Hanson shares were steady at 287 pence, down just two pence, after publishing stronger than expected results.
However, the merchant banking group Kleinwort Benson fell by 145 pence to 614 on profit taking after a
148 percent increase in pre-tax profits for 1993.

British Steel gained two pence to 144 despite the news that it was to be hit by a 32 million ecu (35 million dollar) fine by the European Commission for taking part in a  steel-makers' cartel in Europe.
British Aerospace fell by 17 pence to 526 after the US groups Boeing and McDonnell Douglas beat the
European Airbus consortium to a six billion dollar contract with Saudi Arabia.

Among the oil shares, all depressed by the fall in the price of oil, BP lost 14 pence to 361, Enterprise Oil lost 14 pence to 428 and Shell Transport and Trading fell by 11 pence to 729.

HD         BRITISH STEEL TO APPEAL FINES. (FOR PRICE FIXING) BY         By Christopher Munford

LONDON -- British  Steel Plc expects to appeal nearly $36 million in fines for alleged price fixing
imposed on the company earlier this week by the European Commission, the steelmaker announced.
The commission on Wednesday announced  fines totaling some $117 million against 16 European
Union producers, with British  Steel's share amounting to nearly one-third of the total, or more than twice
the amount imposed on any other company (AMM, Feb. 17).

TD
The Brussels-based commission apparently decided that British  Steel was the principal instigator of an illegal pricing cartel in heavy beams, according to industry sources here who declined to be identified.

While news that fines would be imposed has been rocking the European  steel industry since late last week, British Steel received officials notice of the fines from the commission only late Wednesday night in the form of a 10-page document, a British Steel spokesman confirmed yesterday.

"We've got the commission's deliberations now and are studying them with our advisers and (lawyers), he said. "It's difficult to know how the  fines were calculated until we've studied the document."
The company will likely go through the European Court of Justice, the spokesman added.
The second-heaviest  fine imposed by the commission is against Unimetal, Ste Francaise des Aciers
Longs, a unit of France's state-owned Usinor Sacilor, which was assessed nearly $14 million.

Also receiving a relatively large share of the  fines was Luxembourg-based Arbed SA, which is being ordered to pay about $12.6 million.
The price-fixing  case is said to be one of the largest ever pursued by the commission.

HD    EUROPEAN STEEL CARTEL FINED. BY    By Alastair Stewart.

Contradiction within commission.

Steel fabricators were due to confront British  Steel this week to explain recent hefty price increases. It also emerged that Britain's only producer, and several Continental rivals, were to receive heavy  fines from the European Commission for rigging the market in heavy construction sections.

TD
But in the late 1980s BS hit back at the commission for "hypocrisy and bureaucracy", claiming it was being penalised by one Brussels directorate for participating in a  cartel officially sanctioned by another.

The fines, set on Wednesday and reported to be #7m for BS, follow a three-year investigation into alleged illegal price fixing  and market share agreements after raids on the offices of British  Steel and rivals in
1991.

Directors of the British Constructional Steelwork Association met with BS on Wednesday afternoon in what was a routine meeting set up before news of the  fines emerged on Monday.

BCSA president Allan Collins said his members would express concern at the apparent ease with which BS made four price increases and withdrew rebates since last March, effectively raising the price of  steel sections by 23%.

The fines were imposed by Directorate General IV of the commission, which polices anti-competitive trading. But BS claimed this week that it was acting within the framework of the Davignon Plan of 1980, set up by DG III, the industrial affairs division.

The plan, against a background of Europe-wide overcapacity, was a voluntary agreement between producers to agree individual quotas.

A senior BS source said the #4bn a year group would appeal. He added: "Any exchange of commercial information was with the commission's blessing. We're suffering from the differing aims of DG III and DG IV."

Bruno Dethomas, a spokesman for DG IV, said: "The Coal and  Steel Treaty allows the possibility of cartels in crisis situations, under the supervision of the commission." But he said steelwork overcapacity had
ended in 1984.

Nevertheless, he said, the EC wanted to see further cuts in capacity even if this led to increased prices for consumers: "The  steel industry should be competitive, but at prices that allow them to live."

THE European Commission is imposing fines totalling pounds 74m on 17 of Europe's largest
non-subsidised steel makers - mostly private sector companies - for operating a price  fixing  cartel. The
fine is not the main issue, even though British  Steel will have to shoulder a penalty of pounds 22.5m for its
part in an operation to fix the price of  steel sections and beams for the construction industry. More
importantly, the timing of the decision shows that the stakes are rising in the poker game between the
Commission and the non-aided  steel makers.

This is a game which will determine future European Union  steel capacity, and therefore  steel prices and the health of the  steel industry. The Commission this week gave the non-subsidised companies a deadline of 22 April to come up with their own plans for deep capacity cuts.

TD
Back in October 1992, EU  steel makers were united in their call for the Commission to help them address the chronic overcapacity in their industry. Subsequently, the Commission identified 30m tonnes of excess capacity.

But it is soft-pedalling on action to reduce the capacity at the disposal of subsidised producers - primarily those in Italy, Spain and east Germany. They will receive pounds 5.1bn-worth of subsidies in return for cutting 5m tonnes of capacity. But even this cut may end up looking more like 2.5m tonnes, some producers fear.

Non-aided producers also argue it's unfair that they are having to shoulder the bulk of the capacity cuts (25m tonnes). Unlike their inefficient, subsidised brethren, they have already made great strides in cutting costs and capacity. British  Steel closed Ravenscraig. Thyssen of Germany will have laid off a third of its workforce between 1992 and the end of this year.

Having risen more than 10 per cent last year, despite weak demand,  steel prices, and therefore the entire steel industry, will suffer if a deal cannot be finalised. It's now a question of who blinks first. The EC says it won't. But its options are limited if the private and non-aided steelmakers will not cooperate, and it cannot stand back and do nothing if the industry goes back into a tailspin.

I seem to be the only one applauding the #24m  fine slapped on British  Steel last week by the  European Commission. It did after all rip off its customers, but everyone prefers to see the  fine as a snub to Britain. The sound of MPs of all persuasions protesting was as furious as a blast furnace - and as full of hot air.

The bad news is that the construction firms and other British  Steel customers who overpaid for  steel beams because of the price-fixing  cartel won't see any of the #24m, which goes straight into the maw of Brussels. Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner who administered the
Schwarzenegger-esque punishment, puts our own wimpish British watchdogs to shame.

TD
Most have the power to exact unlimited  fines. None that I can find has ever gone even as far as a paltry
#1m. When Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, breached industry rules over the Maxwell
scandal, the Securities and Futures Authority administered a record #160,000  fine.

To Goldmanites, who are accustomed to #1m annual bonuses, this was roughly equivalent to a slap over the wrist with a specially softened feather.

Lautro, the watchdog for life assurers and unit trusts, has managed a record  fine of #160,000 - against Interlife, a Romford-based insurer, while Imro, which oversees investment managers,  fined Noble Lowndes #740,000 in December for four breaches of its rules. They included systematic churning - doing unnecessary deals for clients.

Fimbra's record was a #60,000 penalty levied on DBS Management of Huddersfield for failing to ensure one of its reps was fit and proper and other failings.
As for beancounters, their regulator, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, has only managed a measly
#10,000 fine - and then the the guilty man was bankrupted and never paid up.

Solicitors? The Law Society tribunal can  fine up to #5,000 per allegation, but no one at Chancery Lane was able to tell me what the actual record stands at.

Fury over `double standards' on price  fixing

TEMPERS were white hot in the  steel industry last week, as the European Commission finally released the results of its investigation into the sale of  steel beams. Sixteen steel makers, British  Steel among them, were found guilty of exchanging confidential information and fixing  prices, contrary to the Commission's competition policy.

TD
But it was not just the  fines with which the Commission clobbered the producers - British  Steel was hit for a whopping #24m - that made them reach boiling point. It was also the manner in which the news was released.
On Monday, the newspapers reported that the Commission was proposing to  fine the steel producers
for operating a  cartel between January 1989 and January 1991, when a surprise raid on their offices first
suggested there had been price  fixing.  There was press speculation about the size of the  fines.

On Tuesday, the  steel chiefs and two commissioners, including Karel Van Miert, the Commissioner for Competition, were scheduled to meet for dinner. On the menu was the issue of overcapacity. But the steel makers failed to promise the capacity cuts for which the Commission had been looking. The following day came news that they would be  fined a total of #79.28m, vastly more than the #40,000 penalty imposed collectively on the industry before.

However, it was not until Wednesday evening that the  steel makers themselves received offical notification. "It was preceded by the Commission talking to the press," says a British  Steel spokesman. He adds that the company learned everything via the media rather than Mr Van Miert.

British  Steel is not alone in reading the events of the past week as a political manoeuvre to force its hand. "There was a bit of cage rattling the day before the dinner, in the form of unoffical leaks, then the dinner, when nothing happened, and finally a smack on the wrist in the form of  fines," says Paul Ruddell, steel analyst at NatWest Markets.

The European Commission adamantly denies this. "Mr Van Miert stressed there were no links between the fines and the plans to restructure the industry," said a spokeswoman.
She added that the offenders were invited to put their views at a meeting in early January 1993.

But this is at variance with reports from British  Steel. It was in January 1992, the company claims, that the steel makers were invited to argue their case. In May 1992, the Commission "indicated it had
reached a decision and was expecting to take action against the companies," according to a spokesman. "It was all over bar the shouting." Then, he adds, there was silence until February 1994 - 20 months after the decision was reached.

With a meeting to discuss capacity cuts due the day after the  fines were announced, most industry observers believe politics has again reared its head. The Commission has always taken a close interest in steel. From 1980 to 1988, it ran a system of quotas introduced by Commissioner Etienne Davignon when the industry was judged to be in "manifest crisis".
Page 114 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Davignon Plan encouraged the  steel makers to agree quotas under the auspices of Eurofer, the trade body, to discuss markets and quotas. But the quota system was removed in mid-1988, prohibiting the steel makers from exchanging information on markets and  fixing  prices - according to the Commission.

However, the  steel makers say they sought guidance from the industry directorates and received conflicting advice or none at all.

But the story is even more complicated. Although the Commission has ruled that the exchange of confidential information and splitting up of markets violates competiton rules, it is itself operating a sort of unoffical  cartel on the steel makers' behalf.

One analyst said: "Brussels faxes out to the  steel community every month a list of guidelines for production, country by country. So Brussels is dictating how much each country is making. Within those boundaries, the  steel makers must negotiate what each produces." He said it was puzzling that the Commission should be "hitting someone for a  cartel, then orchestrating the market".

This fixing  has been effective in hardening prices over the past 18 months. Demand for  steel has continued to fall while supply has remained broadly the same. Yet prices have risen by 15 to 20 per cent
- although the cost of raw materials has dropped. Part of the Commission's objection, then, seems to be to control of the market being vested in others.

If the Commission has a political agenda, so do the privately owned  steel makers. The industry is split roughly equally between the private producers and state-owned operations that get huge subsidies. The private steel makers understandably object to such bail-outs.

They are especially upset by a plan backed by the city of Bremen to rescue its Klockner-Werke  steel mill. The mill went bust last year and - had it been closed - would have taken out about 3 million tonnes of capacity. Under pressure to cut capacity to maintain prices, the private  steel makers argue against any subsidies to prop up inefficient operators.

British Steel also points to its closure of Ravenscraig in January 1992, with a loss of 1,200 jobs. John Graham, steel analyst at SG Warburg, said: "British  Steel has been one of the prime movers in cutting capacity and whiter than white on subsidies."

This is true since privatisation in October 1989. But other analysts point out that in the early 1980s, the company received state handouts to help it sort itself out before privatisation. They say British  Steel is trying to deny other companies the right to similar help.
British  Steel also argues that it has built up its market share in continental Europe from 50,000 to
414,000 tonnes in 1993 - hardly consistent, it says, with a cosy  cartel.

Despite a record #28.8m  fine, the company refuses to make any further big cutbacks, report Andrew
Lorenz and Jonathan Todd

FOR Brian Moffat, chairman of British  Steel, dinner last Tuesday in a private room at an exclusive restaurant near Brussels was a strained affair.

TD
Moffat, along with his counterparts who head Europe's non-subsidised steelmakers, had been invited there by Karel Van Miert, the  European Commission's head of competition, and Martin Bangemann, its industry commissioner.

Van Miert and Bangemann wanted to persuade the  steel chiefs to back the EC's plan to cut production by almost 15% in a bid to restore profitability to the struggling European industry. But when Moffat and company arrived last Tuesday, they found that sticks, not carrots, were on the menu and British  Steel was the biggest target.

The following morning, Van Miert announced what had already been widely leaked the previous day: fines totalling #78m against 16 steelmakers allegedly involved in a price-fixing  cartel on beams supplied to the construction industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

More than one-third of the total penalty #28.8m was levied on British  Steel, earning the UK giant the dubious distinction of receiving the biggest  fine ever imposed by the EC on a single company.

Van Miert said British  Steel was hardest hit because it had been the worst offender. "This is a case where everything that can be infringed, has been infringed," he said. "We have to be tough."

The decision caused uproar at Westminster, where MPs railed against the  fine. But Moffat, despite being reportedly staggered by the size of the  fine, kept his cool. So did the City, where British  Steel's share price 1441/2p, valuing the company at #2.9billion barely missed a beat after the  fine was announced.

Now, while British  Steel begins the tortuous process of appealing against the judgment, Moffat is focusing on what many believe to be the heart of the matter not the sins, real or imagined, of the past, but the problems of the present and the future.

Steel-industry insiders have little doubt that Van Miert and Bangemann's #78m broadside was designed to "encourage" the unsubsidised  steel companies to accept the capacity cuts plan that they have so far resisted. "The EC approach appears to be based on the idea that when you have hit people in their pockets, their hearts and minds will surely follow," said one analyst.

To offer the companies some more positive incentive, Bangemann then indicated that the EC's target for unsubsidised-sector production cuts of 25m tonnes a year out of a European total of 165m tonnes could be reduced to 19m tonnes. The steelmakers have refused to offer cuts of more than 13m tonnes and British  Steel has made it clear that after all the plant closures of the 1980s, it does not intend to make any further significant reductions. Moffat has indicated that British  Steel would contribute cash to finance other companies' cutbacks but only if it was convinced that the EC would fulfil its part of the capacity-cuts bargain.



Page 117 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The commitment that British  Steel wants from Brussels is that no more money will be allowed to be pumped into Europe's subsidised steelmakers, such as Italy's Ilva, Spain's CSI and Germany's Ekostahl. The EC has pledged to prevent further subsidies but neither Moffat nor other unsubsidised manufacturers are convinced that it will live up to its promise.

A test case is now in progress. A consortium has been formed in Bremen to inject about #100m into the ailing steel operations of Klockner-Werke, which owns an integrated  steel works in the north German city with annual capacity of 3m tonnes. The EC is investigating the scheme, but several of the unsubsidised manufacturers are sceptical about Brussels' willingness to block it.

Until and unless the EC banishes those doubts with the kind of firepower it directed at British  Steel last week, the grand capacity-reduction design will continue to be shunned.

That outlook is far from ideal for British  Steel, but the British company is well placed to weather it. Last week's fine is a fleabite. Financially, with negligible net debt and profits forecast by John Graham of Warburg Securities at #90m this year and #250m next, British  Steel is Europe's strongest steelmaker and set to remain so.

Peter Fish of the Sheffield-based  steel consultancy MEPS says: "British  Steel is likely to stay in the forefront of the European industry through this decade."

HD         BRITISH STEEL CUSTOMERS CONSIDER LEGAL ACTION. BY         By ANDREW BAXTER.

Steel fabricators are considering legal action against British  Steel after the company was fined ECU
32m (#24.3m) by the  European Commission last week for allegedly taking part in a cartel that rigged
the market for beams and girders.

The fabricators - which buy beams from British  Steel, cut and weld them and then erect them on building sites - have asked their representative organisation, the British Constructional Steelwork Association, to see whether there are grounds for legal action.

TD
Mr Derek Tordoff, association director, said member companies were worried that they may have paid too much for the beams between 1984 and 1990, when the commission says a well-organised  cartel was operating.

British  Steel, which plans to appeal against the commission's judgment, said the facts did not support any legal action by the fabricators.

The association hopes to discuss the issue with British  Steel, which is the only supplier in the UK of beams used in construction. It manufactures them at its Teesside works.

Mr Tordoff stressed that the association was not trying to pick a fight with British  Steel and admitted it was in a delicate position.

The steelmaker, the association and its members have successfully worked together to market  steel frames in buildings. Last year, they were used in 62% of buildings of two or more storeys compared with only 30% in 1980.

In addition, both the fabricators and British  Steel are fighting  steel subsidies in Spain and Italy which are underpinning imports of fabrications into the UK market.

Some fabricators believe they may have been paying #50 a tonne too much for their beams from 1984 to 1990.
For a small operator using 30,000 tonnes over that period, the overpayment would have been #1.5m. British  Steel says effective UK prices for beams rose by only 9% between 1986 and 1990, less than the
rise in the retail prices index. It said the fabricators' problems stemmed from the recession, which had
caused business to dry up after the period when the  cartel was alleged to have operated.

The #28m fine imposed by the European Commission upon British  Steel for its membership of a price
fixing  cartel is unlikely to make the Brussels body any friends within the British Isles.

No matter how convincing the evidence, the action will be interpreted by the considerable body of British Europhobes as further reason for implacable opposition to the European Union and all it represents. The proximity to the European elections will give a further unfortunate dimension, and a boost to candidates intent on disrupting the business of Brussels and Strasbourg.

TD
The EU may be all very  fine for business, but its insensitivity is making it increasingly unpopular. Not that we should suggest that if laws are being broken they should be ignored. But there is the perception that while the British move with alacrity to obey Common Market laws, they are for the most part cheerfully ignored elsewhere.
The man in the British street will make a shrewd guess that while British Steel's crime will cost it all of its
1993 profits, and several hundred jobs, the other miscreants in the steel cartel will ignore the summons
entirely, demand further subsidies and quietly increase their manufacturing capacity. He may well be
completely wrong in this assessment, but it is the perception that counts at a time when Europe is
becoming almost a term of abuse.

Coming hard on the revelation that each British MEP costs a cool #1m to keep in place, and some of the more outrageous scams being practised by those who have learned to use the Eurosystems to their advantage, there is clearly some room for improving our awareness of Europe.

Regardless of any progress towards federalism, the mere mention of which will now almost provoke armed conflict among the more restive elements in Denmark, France and the UK, the whole concept of the EU is now a matter for deep suspicion.

In Britain the notion that "we are the only people who abide by the rules" is now completely entrenched, with the militant French fishermen, Italian political scandals and German interpretations of subsidy limits being quoted as chapter and verse for this scepticism. The EU has got to look to its image, but also be aware of the reality. (c) of Lloyds of London Press Limited 1994.

BRUSSELS, 22/02/1994 (AGENCE EUROPE) - Several members of the EP Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy have questioned the wisdom of the very harsh sanctions imposed recently by the  European Commission against 16 steel enterprises involved in the beam  cartel (see EUROPE of 17 February, page 7). They have asked that the  European Commission make a formal statement at the next EP plenary session (no doubt next Thursday morning).

TD
Alan Donnelly (Labour, UK) recalled that the Commission itself organized the cooperation between  steel enterprises in the early 1980s when the sector was in a crisis situation. The Commission representative replied that the Commission subsequently asked the enterprises to put an end to their concerted arrangements which were no longer justified by the economic situation. British Conservative Ben Pattersen said that it is not the cartels that disturb markets but the state aids on which the Commission has no possibility of manoeuvre (the Commission now conducts inspections in enterprises which receive subsidies, replied the Commission representative). Fernand Herman (EPP, Belgian) commented that the Commission should not have fined the enterprises so heavily given the crisis in the  steel industry and that it should
have demonstrated political sensitivity rather than taking decisions based solely on Treaty provisions.

British  Steel retreated further from Scotland yesterday by selling the Clydesdale and Imperial works in
Lanarkshire to Vallourec of France.

In Paris, Vallourec said there would be no job reductions and that there would be no change in the future. The Lanarkshire workforce, though, was not convinced.

TD
Union officials described it as a "kick in the teeth" for the workforce. The Scottish TUC, however, was more sanguine; deputy general secretary Bill Speirs said no-one in Scotland would be feeling much heartache over the departure of the "butchers of our once proud and profitable industry".

The sell-off of Clydesdale at Mossend and its linked works Imperial at Airdrie, leaves British  Steel with only the 600 workers manufacturing plates at Dalzell and its finishing facilities at Clydebridge. Six
years ago, BS employed 6000 workers in Scotland.

Clydesdale and Imperial employ about 440 workers in finishing  steel tubes for the North Sea oil and gas fields.

In 1987, Clydesdale alone employed over 1500 workers but, since the closure of Ravenscraig, it was scaled down to merely finishing off by quenching and tempering so-called green tubes manufactured in France, Germany, and Italy - including tubes made by Vallourec in Normandy.

From Clydesdale, the tube is then sent to the Imperial Works at Airdrie for final finishing, including threading.

Clydesdale works convener Pat Donnelly said the workers were despondent at the news because it meant a lot of uncertainty over the future and that there are now "real fears for jobs".

"This is a disgraceful move. It is a kick in the teeth for the workforce who have been tremendously successful in recent years.

"We are very disappointed indeed that BS has handed over these plants on a plate to a French company when there is a ready market in the North Sea that could easily be serviced by a British company," he added.

Union leaders will be holding talks with local management and the new owners today to seek assurances over jobs.
Nevertheless, reaction in the City was that it should be good for the local economy.

The operations, which have been under some threat, will now be better placed as part of a bigger player in the sector committed to the business, it is argued.

The Scottish National Party was also cautious in its response. Employment spokesman Nicola Sturgeon said that, while they would want assurances over the jobs, she conceded it could, in fact, be a welcome shot in the arm for Scotland's  steel industry.

Page 123 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It is known that BS has been in discussions with Vallourec - a subsidiary of  steel group Usinor-Sacilor and the sixth largest seamless tube producer in the world - since late last year.

However, no purchase price has been disclosed. A company spokesman said the decision to sell was due to continued over-capacity in the  steel industry and low prices.
Criticism of BS came from Councillor Harry McGuigan, in charge of economic development at
Motherwell District Council, who said it was a pathetic reflection of the company's strategic policy.
None the less, he said the council would offer Vallourec what assistance it could.

There appears to be no threat to the Dalzell plant until BS can justify internally the building of the mooted #500m plate mill on Tees-side.

* Last week, BS was  fined almost #29m by the  European Commission on the grounds that it was the ringleader in an illegal price-fixing  cartel.

Vigorous response from Mr Van Miert.

TD
STRASBOURG, 24/02/1994 (AGENCE EUROPE) - In the affair concerning the  cartel of beam producers, "all articles which could have been violated have been" whether it is a question of price agreements, market sharing,  or confidential exchanges of information. This was stated on Thursday morning by European Commissioner Karel Van Miert talking to MEPs who had attacked the Commission for having imposed upon the enterprises in question  fines of an amount without precedence. The  European Commission has done its duty, said Mr Van Miert, noting that inquiries cannot be influenced by the economic situation (the infractions in question, moreover, were committed in periods of full expansion when enterprises could have made profits). This was a very complex and sophisticated  cartel, said Mr Van Miert, who pointed out that EUROFER's "beam  cartel" met almost every month to discuss prices, exchange confidential information, etc. He cited a "pearl" in the minutes of a meeting of this Committee which was held in Milan on 16 May
1990 during which an agreement between British  Steel and Spanish enterprises had been pointed out: the text read that the aim of the agreement was to bring prices up in both countries in question and to ensure that "everyone remains in his own place".

Most MEPs strongly criticised the Commission. Mr Fayot, Luxembourg Socialist, said he wondered whether there was a "direct relation between the moment when  fines were decided upon and the efforts made for restructuring the  steel industry": had not the Commission wanted "to give a strong-arm warning to the sector"? Luxembourg Christian Democrat Mrs Lulling asked the  European Commission whether it was willing, if not to come back on its decisions, at least to review them and, speaking to Mr Van Miert, she said: "if you had to be elected, like us, then you might have reacted differently" (the Commissioner replied that, effectively, after the debate, he had the feeling that "elections are very close"). Mr Herman (EPP, B)
affirmed that the main current distortions on the  steel market are the result of keeping subsidies for companies in difficulty rather than "illicit action that goes back several years". He even wondered if the power of "managing competition" should be left up to the  European Commission, or whether it would be better to give such responsibility to aseparate institute. Belgian Green member Mrs Ernst de la Graete asked in a more conciliatory tone whether the Commission strategy was good and, stressing the job losses in the Wallonia  steel sector, said she hoped that enterprises would receive positive incentives so that they might aim at more successful production that would respect the environment. Mr Speciale (Socialist Group, I) did not dispute the legitimacy of the Commission decision but criticised the moment and the volume of fines. Furthermore, PDS member elect and rapporteur on restructuring of the  steel industry expressed his
hope there would be a more general and thorough debate of the  steel issue. He was particularly concerned about the fate of the social chapter for restructuring. Mr Pasty (RDE, F) reproached the Commission for a decision which, he says, is in contradiction with its past attitude. Had it not encouraged industry to get organised with the Davignon plan in the years 80-88? In his view, the Commission decision is "weakening our position in the tussle with the Americans" regarding the  steel industry. Several Spanish MEPs took the floor to complain of the treatment received by enterprises in their countries: thus, Mr Siso Cruellas (EPP) said he felt that the  fines were out of proportion and unjust towards the Spanish. Mrs Garcia Rias
(Socialist) recalled the specific situation of Spain where  steel demand had increased considerably in
1989-90 because of the Olympic Games and the Universal Fair (producers in other countries took
advantage of this, and prices fell in Spain, she said). Several British MEPs expressed particularly harsh
criticism. Two Conservatives, Messrs Patterson and Jackson, spoke of the problem of subsidies to public
enterprises that the Commission is unable to abolish, although it imposes  fines on the private sector. It is,
said Mr Patterson, as if, not daring to hit the big brother who throws stones at the windows, we go and hit
the little brother. Mr Jackson said he felt we are faced with two "wrongs" (the  cartel on one hand and state
aid on the other) and that there is no clear linkage between them. He asks the Commission whether it does
Page 125 of 132 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
not wish to revise the  fine against British  Steel which is quite "out of proportion". The most violent criticism was voiced by British Labour member Mr Donnelly who spoke of "blatant and carefully timed blackmail" (Mr Van Miert replied he did not accept the term "blackmail"). He said that, instead of hitting a profitable company like B ritish  Steel, the Commission should aim at industries subsidised elsewhere in Europe.

Mr Van Miert reacted strongly by denouncing the contradictions of MEPs. As far as the date on which  fines were imposed is concerned, Mr Van Miert exclaimed: "it is never the right moment to impose  fines ... What would you have said if it had been done last December, or in the middle of last year?". Although there was
a certain delay in the decision after the inquiry, said Mr Van Miert, it is possible some firms had asked the Commissioner who was his predecessor (Sir Leon Brittan) to grant supplementary delays in which to reply ("one should respect the right to a fair hearing and that can take a very long time"). With regard to the general problem, Mr Van Miert said he regretted he was not able to offer more reductions in capacities (for example, in Italy, other than offers made by the small producers, such as Bresciani, it is "more than likely that there will be no further offers of reduction in capacities"). We are discussing with the sector, concluded Mr Van Miert, and added that the Commission will discuss the issue again in March and then once more with the Council in April.

HD    SPECIALISTS STALK BRITISH STEEL - STEELWORK SPECIALISTS CONSIDER LEGAL ACTION. BY    By Alastair Stewart.

#28m fine opens door to legal action.
Up to one-third of the UK's 180 constructional steelwork specialists are considering legal action against
British Steel following last week's #28m  fine for price rigging imposed by the  European Commission.

TD
The British Constructional Steelwork Association was set to confront the UK's only  steel producer with complaints about its pricing policy at a meeting on Tuesday. The BCSA has received requests from more than 50 members for legal advice on whether they can claim against BS after last Wednesday's record fine.

BS's  fine was the largest of a total #70m penalty imposed on 17 European producers for operating an illegal price fixing  and market sharing  cartel in steel beams between 1985 and 1990. Prices rose by one-quarter between these dates.

But BS - which was accused of being the  cartel ring leader - has said it will appeal. It claims the agreement was set up with the EC's blessing in an attempt to cut overcapacity.

BCSA president Allan Collins said before yesterday's meeting with BS: "We've had complaints about high prices for a long time. Since last week we've had members phoning up to ask if we would review the situation and whether they had grounds for making claims."

But Collins said the BCSA would not comment on the  fines until it saw the EC's judgment. He said the BCSA will not take action itself but its lawyers will examine the judgment and advise members considering claims.
John Avons, the managing director of 100-strong fabricator Dyer (Structural  Steel) said: "If it is proven to
be the case that (a  cartel) cost us money, we have to seek redress." Avons said he would wait to see if BS
launches an appeal before he makes a final decision.

In the past three years prices fell back to 1985 levels, but in the past 12 months they rose again in four increases totalling 23%. Collins said this was from "a position of commercial strength" and that there is no evidence of collusion.
BS has a 60% share of the UK beams market.

British  Steel is reviewing its corporate advertising account after a year in which it has been practically dormant.

It is believed that the company, which was  fined #24m by the European Commission last month for illegal price fixing,  is considering expanding its advertising to position it against its European  steel rivals. But internal talks are continuing about the company's advertising needs.

TD
The account has been handled by Dewe Rogerson since the company was privatised in 1988 and was worth just under #500,000 in 1992. Dewe Rogerson is believed to be one of four agencies that have had talks with British  Steel. The others are Abbott Mead Vickers.BBDO, Leagas Delaney and BMP DDB Needham.

British  Steel corporate communications director Charles Lewis refuses to confirm the review. "If we have been engaged in discussions, those discussions are between ourselves and the agencies involved."

Within the next 18 months some 90,000 jobs will be lost among European  steel manufacturers. The problem is over capacity; European mills are churning out close to 30m tonnes of steel which is surplus
to demand. The pressure on the industry is such that the European Commission last month handed out fines of over #80m to 16 companies for operating a clandestine cartel to rig prices and markets. The problems affecting Irish  Steel are only less than those affecting its European counterparts in terms of scale; if they are not put right, the very existence of the business will be at risk.

The mill at Haulbowline, the only one in the State, is one of the most modern of its size in Europe. With turnover of #59m a year, it accounts for only one per cent of European production. In addition, it has built up a niche for itself in the production of sections or girders for the construction industry and manages to find export customers for almost 90% of its produce.

TD
However, there is no merit in winning orders, even in the medium term, if the cost of manufacture exceeds the sale price. Irish  Steel operated at a loss of over #1m a month last year. If it pushed up its prices to cover its costs never mind to generate a profit it would lose its customer base. Haulbowline has a derogation from the  European Commission because the plant is deemed to have a strategic significance for the State so it cannot be closed down by an order from Brussels. This though is of little importance; if it cannot bring its manufacturing costs below its selling price then bankruptcy, will close it down anyway.

The report by management consultants hired by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Mr Quinn, is highly critical of many aspects of the company's operations and recommends "major cost cutting". The report is particularly alarming because of its summary dismissal of the management's strategy for survival; in very blunt language it says the management plan won't work and that, in addition, the
company is burdened with too many layers of management. It is disturbing too that a company which has lost so much money is still, according to the report, playing host to restrictive practices which guarantee inefficiencies. Equally disturbing is the consultants' concern that the company might be simply incapable of putting a satisfactory restructuring into place.

Irish Steel is in a similar situation to that which pertained at Aer Lingus. The  European Commission is prepared to allow more State aid on a temporary basis but the Government cannot justify assistance until the company has been put on a profitable footing. In the long term, the best option for the company is to enter into an alliance with another company but in order to achieve that it must get its costs down; otherwise it will have no hope of attracting a partner. The last thing Irish  Steel needs now is
prevarication. As the Aer Lingus case illustrated, the sooner the restructuring is put in place the quicker will be the return to profitability and, hopefully, redundancies can be kept to the minimum.

LONDON, March 9 (Reuter) - A British parliamentary committee said a  steel deal struck by the European Union's industrial council in December was "unsatisfactory" and a major overhaul of the steel industry was overdue.

The European Communities committee of the House of Lords said that, if cuts in the state-aided capacity of 4.6 million tonnes foreseen under the deal were achieved, the private sector would be expected to cut another 20 million.

TD
"There was always doubt that this target would be met," it said in a report. "The 'lack of robustness' in the Council of Ministers has made this more difficult."

"Major restructuring is long overdue and...an industry-led solution is appropriate, with financial and social assistance to ease the pain of closures," the report said.

The committee declined to comment on the legal merits of the European Commission's subsequent decision to impose fines on 16 steel companies for price-fixing.

But it said, "It (the  fines) is unlikely to be conducive to a satisfactory outcome to the future restructuring programme, which is now so heavily dependent on the goodwill and cooperation of the major private companies."
The success of the deal also depended on the commission's political will, the committee said.

"In our view, the commission and the council have now accepted a strict duty to enforce the rules on subsidies and, if evidence emerges of illegal subsidy, neither must shirk their responsibilities," it said.

"There was always doubt that this target would be met," it said in a report. "The 'lack of robustness' in the Council of Ministers has made this more difficult."

"Major restructuring is long overdue and...an industry-led solution is appropriate, with financial and social assistance to ease the pain of closures," the report said.

The committee declined to comment on the legal merits of the European Commission's subsequent decision to impose fines on 16 steel companies for price-fixing.

But it said: "It (the  fines) is unlikely to be conducive to a satisfactory outcome to the future restructuring programme, which is now so heavily dependent on the goodwill and cooperation of the major private companies."
The success of the deal also depended on the commission's political will, the committee said.

"In our view, the commission and the council have now accepted a strict duty to enforce the rules on subsidies and, if evidence emerges of illegal subsidy, neither must shirk their responsibilities," it said.

LUXEMBOURG -- Despite an economic upturn in 1994, the short-term outlook for European  steel companies "remains unencouraging," said Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed SA in the February edition of its newsletter Arbed News.

In the newletter, Arbed said although  steel production rose 1.7% in industrialized countries, "1993 was, for European steelmakers, the most disappointing year since 1975." Prices were 30% to 40% down from 1990, pushing  steel company losses to levels never seen before, it said.

Arbed added that pressure from low-cost imports makes this a particularly bad time for the  European Commission to impose fines on private companies, after having approved state subsidies valued at around 300 million Luxembourg francs ($8.5 million) to state-owned companies in Italy, Spain and Germany.

Arbed was among 16 European steel companies fined a total of 104 million European currency units ($117.3 million) for operating a price-fixing  cartel for steel beams. Arbed has been  fined 11.2 million ECUs.
