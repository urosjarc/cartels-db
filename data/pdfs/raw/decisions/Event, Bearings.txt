RESULTS OVERVIEW

2013 was a year of significant progress on a number of fronts. We continued to deliver positive results for our shareholders and, during the course of the year, reshaped our business through the disposal of the Beverage Dispense and Merchandising divisions which completed on 1 January 2014.

On a continuing basis, excluding the Beverage Dispense and Merchandising divisions, reported revenues were GBP1,743m, up 1% on an organic basis (2012: GBP1,694m). Segmental operating profits grew 7% to GBP321.6m (2012: GBP300.1m), and operating margins improved from 17.7% to 18.4%. Adjusted basic earnings per share increased 12% to 72.6p (2012: 64.7p).

The Severe Service division delivered a strong performance with organic revenue growing 8% to GBP394m in the second half (2012 H2: GBP360m) and 3% to GBP716m for the full year (2012: GBP686m). In the year orders were up 12% with good momentum in the Petrochemical sector and we were awarded a record single order in Oil & Gas. Operating margins improved from 14.0% in 2012 to
16.3% in 2013 with a significant uplift to 17.2% in the second half. While Fluid Power revenues at GBP723m were down 1% on an organic basis for the full year (2012: GBP717m), momentum improved in the second half when organic revenues increased 3% to GBP360m (2012 H2: GBP344m). Operating margins were slightly down at 19.4% (2012: 19.8%). Indoor Climate saw a return to growth in the second half with organic revenues up 2% to GBP159m (2012 H2: GBP151m) and increasing 1% for the full year
to GBP305m (2012: GBP293m). Operating margins were slightly ahead of last year at 21.1% (2012:
21.0%).

The Beverage Dispense and Merchandising divisions delivered mixed results during the year. Merchandising performed strongly but the Beverage Dispense business saw a decline in revenues. The segmental operating profit from these discontinued businesses increased 11% to GBP81.0m (2012: GBP72.9m) and the operating margin increased to 15.9% (2012: 14.7%).
Dividend
Given the strong overall results the Board is recommending that the final dividend be increased by 9% to
22.5p (2012: 20.7p). This makes a total dividend for the year of 35.3p, an increase of 9% over last year's
32.5p.
Strategic developments

In March 2013 we announced that we were exploring options to divest the majority of our Merchandising business. During this process we received an unsolicited offer from The Marmon Group, a Berkshire Hathaway company, for both our Beverage Dispense business and our Merchandising business for an enterprise value of $1,100m (GBP690m).

We successfully concluded this transaction in early January 2014 and, in line with our capital allocation policy and the Board's commitment to maintain an efficient balance sheet, GBP620m of cash is being returned to shareholders. An additional cash contribution of GBP70m is being made to the IMI UK Pension Fund (the 'Fund') to support the on-going strategy to reduce the Fund's volatility risk and move towards self-sufficiency funding levels over the next few years.

During the year, the Group bought back GBP164m of shares in the share repurchase programme that was announced in March 2013. This programme was introduced to ensure that net debt was maintained at an efficient level. At the end of 2013 the Group's net debt was GBP199m, with the ratio of net debt to continuing EBITDA at 0.6 times. A further programme of share buy backs is not proposed for the time being.
Board changes

As previously announced Mark Selway joined the IMI Board on 1 October 2013 as Chief Executive designate following the announcement of Martin Lamb's retirement from the Company after 33 years. After a three month transition period, Martin stepped down as Chief Executive on 31 December 2013 and will retire from the Board at the Annual General Meeting in May, 2014. Mark was appointed Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2014.
Outlook

As IMI moves into the next phase of its development a review of all parts of the Group has been initiated. While this review work is ongoing, positive early findings are already emerging. These findings, together with IMI's inherent strengths, including its robust balance sheet, indicate that the Group is well positioned to exploit a range of growth opportunities over the medium term.

Looking at the year ahead: in 2014, based on current market conditions and excluding the adverse impact of exchange rates, we expect the Group to deliver modest organic revenue growth in the first half with margins slightly lower than in the first half of last year and an improved overall performance in the year.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW A strong foundation
As the refocused IMI business enters the next phase of its development, which coincides with my appointment as Chief Executive and the fresh perspective I bring, now is the ideal time to undertake a review of all parts of the Group. The purpose of this review is to ensure we have the plans and strategy in place to enable us to outperform in our chosen markets, deliver sustainable accelerated top and bottom line growth and build long-term shareholder value.

We have many strengths: we have a committed workforce, great engineering expertise and deep end market knowledge. We also have strong long-term relationships with world-class customers across all of our businesses and, by providing these customers with products and technologies that deliver tangible benefits, we have successfully deployed a value-based pricing strategy.

Furthermore, the Group has some excellent financial characteristics: a disciplined approach to financial performance and a balance sheet that is in excellent shape which provides both headroom and flexibility to support a range of organic and acquisitive growth opportunities.

My objective as Chief Executive is to build on this strong foundation to ensure that the Group harnesses and delivers its full potential.
Assessing full potential

The review, which I initiated shortly after my arrival, is currently underway and is covering every IMI company. It is primarily being undertaken by our employees, in order to secure maximum buy-in and garner their enthusiasm for the future direction of the Group, with input from a small number of expert consultants. It includes a number of key work streams as follows:

- A review of our existing markets, customers, products, peers and competition. The findings of this work will ensure that as the Group moves forward, we fully leverage our geographic, product and process strengths; [ 06-03-14 0700GMT ]

- An assessment of the Group's current capabilities with particular emphasis on our manufacturing operations, product development processes, operating systems and controls;

- An assessment of how we can improve collaboration and exploit synergies and economies of scale across the whole of IMI regardless of geographic or divisional boundaries; and

- A process to identify where future investment could be best deployed, both within our existing businesses and through strategically complementary acquisitions focused on delivering growth and attractive returns to shareholders.
Assessing full potential - early findings
While the review is not yet complete, it is appropriate to highlight some of its early findings:-

- Operational performance: to date we have undertaken a sample assessment of major manufacturing plants across a spread of geographies in the Group's three divisions. These assessments which include product development processes, operational performance and operating systems, have been benchmarked against both best-in-class world standards and best current IMI practice. Findings based on this sample benchmarking exercise indicate that there are significant opportunities to improve the Group's operational performance which will result in improved efficiencies and better working capital utilisation;

- Collaboration: until this year, throughout its history IMI has operated as a diverse engineering group with significant  autonomy provided to each of the underlying businesses. Given this structure there has been limited incentive for inter-divisional collaboration. Our more focused portfolio now provides an opportunity to improve how our businesses work together. A project to develop greater collaboration amongst our talented group of engineers has already been initiated and has identified considerable opportunities for synergies and economies of scale which promise to enhance the competitiveness of many of our companies;

- Product development: the Group's competitive advantage and leading position at the forefront of flow control technology is reliant on the continued development of the existing product portfolio and an innovative new product pipeline. Investment in new products will be a key priority, as will focusing on those products and technologies which deliver sustainable competitive advantage; and

- Customer alignment: the Group has strong long-term customer relationships with many of the world's leading companies. The competitive dynamics of the industries we serve demand a continued focus on the value and benefits we bring to these customers including responsiveness to market demand and geographical alignment in terms of manufacturing.

Building on the Group's inherent strengths, the positive early findings emerging from the review indicate that the Group is well placed to exploit a range of growth opportunities over the medium term.

The review is planned to be completed around the time of the Group's 2014 interim results at which time we expect to share the key findings and provide an update on the Group's future direction.
DIVISIONAL REVIEW

The following review relates to our continuing businesses: Severe Service, Fluid Power and Indoor Climate. It compares their performance, as reported under IFRS8: Operating Segments, during the year ended 31 December 2013 with their performance in the year ended 31 December 2012. The results of the Beverage Dispense and Merchandising divisions, which were sold on 1 January 2014, are set out in note
2 to the financial statements. References to organic growth are on a constant currency basis and exclude the results of acquisitions during the period for which there is no comparator. This section also comments on current market conditions and the outlook for each of our continuing businesses.

SEVERE SERVICE

IMI Severe Service designs and manufactures highly engineered valves, actuators and controls which are able to withstand extremes of temperature and pressure and intensely abrasive and corrosive cyclical operations.




Revenue          GBP716m    (2012: GBP686m) Operating profit   GBP116.8m  (2012: GBP96.3m) Operating margin   16.3%      (2012: 14.0%)

Performance

The full year order intake at GBP741.7m was up 12% year-on-year (2012: GBP660.1m). A number of our end markets performed particularly well, including Oil & Gas, where orders were up 27% and we were successful in winning one of the largest ever orders in our history, which was for a high integrity pressure protection system (HIPPS) for installation on a gas field in the Middle East. In the Petrochemical sector, orders were up 11%. Fossil Power orders were also up 16% on the prior year, with good growth in China, India and Korea. Nuclear orders were up 19%, despite the on-going difficult market conditions following the Fukushima incident, as more safety upgrade projects become available. Orders to support the aftermarket were up 9%. While the majority of our markets saw good bookings momentum in 2013, order intake in Iron & Steel was down 49% reflecting the on-going challenges in that market.
Revenues increased 3% to GBP716m on an organic basis (2012: GBP686m) and operating profit grew
21% to GBP116.8m (2012: GBP96.3m). This strong profit growth reflects the impact of  careful project
selection and efficiency improvements achieved in our manufacturing processes and supply chain. As a
result, margins increased to 16.3% from 14.0% in 2012.
Key Achievements
-- Winning the HIPPS order for a gas field in the Middle East, one of the largest single orders in Severe
Service's history
-- Increasing Fossil Power orders by 16% by targeting the growth regions of China, India and Korea

-- Achieving an increase in global Petrochemical orders of 11%, helped by securing a number of orders in the US where opportunities have increased as a result of shale oil and gas activity

-- Shipping 84 large bespoke valves, from our Zimmermann & Jansen business in Germany to a Catofin petrochemical project in Houston, US

-- Improving significantly the operational performance of our Brno manufacturing facility and our supply chain management

-- Bringing to market two new product ranges: highly engineered ball valves for Oil & Gas applications and quarter turn actuators
Outlook

The substantial opening order book combined with good operating performance and the effect of the large HIPPS order is expected to deliver good revenue growth on an organic basis in both the first half and the full year. Full year margins are expected to show continued progress on last year with first half margins slightly ahead of the first half last year despite increased investment in growth initiatives.
FLUID POWER

Fluid Power specialises in the design and manufacture of pneumatic and other flow control technologies for applications where precision, speed and reliability are essential.




Revenue            GBP723m    (2012: GBP717m) Operating profit   GBP140.5m  (2012: GBP142.3m) Operating margin   19.4%      (2012: 19.8%)


Page 7 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Performance

Fluid Power markets improved in the second half of 2013, with revenues growing 3% on an organic basis to GBP360m (2012 H2: GBP344m), following a more challenging first half of the year. Overall revenues for the full year were GBP723m (2012: GBP717m), a 1% rise on a reported basis and a 1% decline on an organic basis.

Our sector business, which focuses on providing highly engineered solutions to leading original equipment manufacturers operating in global niche markets, was flat on an organic basis. Following a soft first half, our Commercial Vehicle sector grew 1% in the second half with our European  truck business up 18%, benefiting from some pre-buy before the introduction of Euro VI engines in 2014. In contrast, the North American truck market continued to be challenging throughout the year and as a result, overall, Commercial Vehicle revenues were down 3% for the year. We saw good revenue growth in the Energy sector, up 7%, and in the Rail sector, up 11% while the Food & Beverage sector was flat and Life
Sciences lower.

During the year we acquired two small technology companies to support our sector strategy. In August we acquired Analytical Flow Products (AFP), which has an innovative range of chromatography valves which will enhance our capabilities in the Life Science and Energy sectors, and in October we acquired
Nano-Porous Solutions Ltd (NPSL), a UK based company which has patented technology for high performance air dryers for the Rail sector.

The industrial  automation business was down 3% on an organic basis with Europe lower, North America flat, Asia Pacific slightly up and good growth in Latin America.
Operating profit was GBP140.5m (2012: GBP142.3m) and operating margins at 19.4% (2012: 19.8%)
were slightly down reflecting the lower level of sales.
Key Achievements


--     Growing revenues in the Energy sector by 7% and in the Rail sector by 11%
-- Good progress on two major new product initiatives: high performance dryers for Rail and waste heat
recovery systems for Commercial Vehicles

-- Continued investment in Norgren Express, our market leading internet, phone and catalogue-based aftermarket solution
-- Acquiring Analytical Flow Products and Nano-Porous Solutions Ltd to enhance our sector strategy
Outlook

The Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs), which are typically a good lead indicator for the Fluid Power business, suggest improving prospects in the general industrial sector. In the Commercial Vehicle sector growth in the first half will be impacted by the Euro V pre-buy in Europe last year and the ending of a large contract in North America. Based on this market environment and current order trends we expect modest organic revenue growth in the first half with margins broadly similar to the first half last year.




INDOOR CLIMATE

[ 06-03-14 0700GMT ]

Indoor Climate is the leading global provider of technologies that deliver operational and energy efficient water-based heating and cooling systems inside buildings.



Revenue            GBP305m   (2012: GBP293m) Operating profit   GBP64.3m  (2012: GBP61.5m) Operating margin   21.1%     (2012: 21.0%)

Performance



Page 8 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Revenues of GBP305m were up 1% on an organic basis (2012: GBP293m) and 4% higher on a reported basis. Growth in Europe of 4% was partially offset by declines in the emerging markets (including China where a number of construction projects delayed into 2014) and in our  automatic balancing valve business in North America. Since the year-end we have scaled back our interest in a number of the smaller, less profitable emerging markets to focus our efforts on those markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia, where we see the best opportunities for future growth.

Operating profit at GBP64.3m increased 5% (2012: GBP61.5m) driven by efficiency improvements in our operations and more cost effective procurement activities. Operating margins of 21.1% increased marginally when compared to last year (2012: 21.0%).
Key Achievements

-- Bringing to market nine new products including a complete new range of pressure independent balancing and control valves, branded TA-FUS1ON, and a new technology for  automatic thermostatic control, the A-Exact


--    Filing four new patents, significantly enhancing the new product pipeline
--     Achieving good sales growth in the key German market
-- Continuing to win flagship projects around the world, including two high value state of the art multi-building hospital developments in Belgium and Sweden
Outlook

We expect the European construction market to stabilise in 2014 in both residential and non-residential buildings with some countries, including Germany, growing while others continue to weaken. During the first half of 2014 the benefit from new product launches in the core European markets is expected to largely offset the impact of the Group's decision to scale back our interest in a number of smaller lower margin emerging markets. Consequently, Indoor Climate's first half revenues in 2014 are expected to be broadly flat on an organic basis. Operating margins in the first half are expected to be lower compared to the first half of 2013 reflecting additional costs relating to the new product launches and the emerging market exits. In the second half of the year operating margins are expected to return to more normal levels.
FINANCIAL REVIEW Results summary
Reported revenues increased by 3% to GBP1,743m (2012 restated: GBP1,694m). After adjusting for an exchange rate impact of GBP31m and the contribution from acquisitions, the organic revenue increase was 1%. Segmental operating profit was GBP321.6m, compared to GBP300.1m (restated) in 2012. At constant exchange rates and excluding acquisitions segmental operating profit rose by 6%. The segmental operating margin was 18.4% (2012 restated: 17.7%).

Operating profit was GBP270.5m (2012 restated: GBP249.4m) after the deduction of exceptional items. Restructuring costs in the year reduced to GBP14.2m (2012 restated: GBP18.9m) following the completion of a number of projects, with the 2013 spend principally comprising a German site closure in
our Fluid Power business and strategic cost reduction exercises in our Indoor Climate and Severe Service businesses.

Acquired intangible amortisation decreased to GBP21.9m (2012: GBP29.6m) because the first-year charge relating to AFP and NPSL was considerably lower than the first year charges for Remosa and InterAtiva in 2012. Pre-closing costs associated with the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses amounted to GBP8.0m and, due to their one-off nature, have been disclosed as exceptional in accordance with our policy. Other acquisition-related costs were GBP1.9m (2012: GBP6.3m).

Continuing interest costs on net borrowings were GBP16.0m (2012 restated: GBP17.5m). These were covered 21 times (2012 restated: 18 times) by continuing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of GBP329m (2012 restated: GBP318m).The net pension financing charge under IAS19 was GBP7.9m (2012 restated: GBP7.8m). In 2014, this charge is expected to decrease to about GBP3.3m. A net gain arose on the revaluation of financial instruments and derivatives under IAS39 of GBP2.7m (2012: GBP5.8m) principally reflecting movements in exchange rates during the year on forward foreign
exchange contracts.
Basic EPS increased 5% to 71.0p (2012 restated: 67.9p) and diluted EPS was 70.1p (2012 restated:
67.0p). The Board considers that a more meaningful indication of the underlying performance of the
Page 9 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Group is provided by earnings before charging/(crediting) exceptional items after tax. On this basis the adjusted EPS from continuing operations was 72.6p, an increase of 12% over last year's 64.7p (as restated). Post tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 19.6% compared to 18.9% as restated in 2012.
Exchange rates

The movement in average exchange rates between 2012 and 2013 resulted in our reported 2013 segmental revenue and segmental operating profit each being 2% higher as the average Euro and US Dollar rates against Sterling were 4% and 2% stronger, respectively. If the average exchange rates to the end of February 2014 of US$1.65 and EUR1.21 had been applied to our 2013 results, it is estimated that segmental revenue and segmental operating profit would have both been 4% lower.
Dividend

The Board has recommended a final dividend in respect of 2013 of 22.5p (2012: 20.7p) per share, an increase of 9% over the 2012 final dividend. This makes the total dividend for 2013 35.3p (2012: 32.5p). The cost of the final dividend is expected to be GBP60.7m (2012: GBP66.1m) leading to a total dividend cost of GBP100.9m (2012: GBP103.6m) in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings for the continuing businesses is 2.1 times (2012 restated: 2.0 times).
Disposal of Retail Dispense businesses and discontinued operations

As noted earlier in this announcement, on 1 January 2014 our Retail Dispense businesses were sold to the Marmon Group ("Marmon"), a Berkshire Hathaway company, for cash consideration of $1,100m (GBP666.7m at year-end rates), subject to adjustments for working capital, cash and debt in the business at completion. The transaction was priced in US dollars, but the return of capital from these proceeds was announced in sterling, which exposed the Group to the risk of movements in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate, from the date of exchange of contracts in October 2013. This exposure was hedged using a deal-contingent forward exchange contract.

The Retail Dispense businesses represent a "major class of business" for the Group and because this disposal was considered to be highly probable prior to the end of the accounting period, these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of these businesses have been reported in one line, net of tax, below profit after tax in the Income Statement. Comparatives have been restated on the same basis and a full analysis of the results of these discontinued operations is given in note 3. The effect of this restatement on 2012's adjusted earnings per share is a reduction of 15.0p from
79.7p (as restated for IAS19 revised - see below) to 64.7p.
Restatement for adoption of IAS19

The consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2012 have been restated to take account of the adoption of IAS19: Employee Benefits (revised 2011). The principal impact on the Group has been that
the return on plan assets included in the income statement is now based on the discount rate applied to the liabilities. Prior to this revision, the plan assets' expected return was included in the income statement.

The effect of this restatement on 2012's adjusted earnings per share was a reduction of 4.6p from 84.3p to 79.7p. As noted above, the effect of the restatement of 2012's results for discontinued operations reduced adjusted EPS by a further 15.0p to result in a restated adjusted EPS of 64.7p for 2012.
Acquisitions

On 22 August the Group completed the acquisition of Analytical Flow Products ("AFP") for initial consideration of GBP2.2m and potential future payments of up to GBP32.4m based on future performance. On 29 October the Group completed the acquisition of Nano-Porous Solutions Limited ("NPSL") for initial consideration of GBP5.4m and potential future payments of up to GBP2.4m based on revenue in 2016.
Cash flow

The net cash inflow from operating activities was GBP319m, compared to GBP211m last year, which included a working capital outflow of GBP26m (2012: GBP31m), as receivables increased due to a strong sales performance towards the end of the year and payables reduced due to the timings of payments to suppliers. Cash spent on property, plant and equipment and other non-acquired intangibles in the year was GBP53m (2012: GBP47m) which was equivalent to 1.2 times (2012: 1.0 times) depreciation and amortisation thereon. Other major cash outflows in the year included dividends of GBP106m and share buybacks of GBP164m.The Group made additional contributions of GBP34m into the UK pension fund including 2013's GBP17m payment in line with the agreed funding recovery plan, as well as the


Page 10 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
advancement of the equivalent July 2014 payment. A net drawdown of GBP51m from current facilities was made and the total cash outflow for the year was GBP56m (2012: GBP25m).
Balance Sheet

During the year, it became clear that the value of the assets and liabilities of the Retail Dispense businesses were expected to be recovered through their sale, rather than from their continuing use. Therefore these were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale and are shown separately in current assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. These assets and liabilities amounted to, respectively GBP289.4m and GBP77.3m as at 31 December 2013. [ 06-03-14 0700GMT ]

Net debt (including net cash of GBP26.5m shown as held for sale) at the year-end was GBP199m compared to GBP144m at the end of the previous year. The ratio of year-end net debt to continuing EBITDA was 0.6 times.

The value of the Group's intangible assets decreased to GBP430m at 31 December 2013 (2012: GBP545m) principally as a result of the transfer of the net book value of intangible assets relating to Retail Dispense of GBP117.5m to assets held for sale during the year. Additions to intangible assets in the normal course of business and from the two acquisitions in the year broadly offset the continuing amortisation charge, foreign exchange movements and the disposals (excluding transfers to 'held for
sale').

The net book value of the Group's investment in property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2013 was GBP223m (2012: GBP245m) after transfers to assets held for sale of GBP23.5m. Capital expenditure on PPE of GBP44.3m (2012: GBP39.1m) represented 117% (2012: 95%) of depreciation of GBP37.9m (2012: GBP41.3m).
Taxation

The effective tax rate for the Group before exceptional items reduced to 22% (2012 restated: 24%) as a result of further business reorganisation, a strong focus on claiming Government-approved tax incentives around the world and the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate. In addition, an exceptional tax credit of GBP9.8m (2012 restated: GBP10.4m) arose in connection with continuing business restructuring and other exceptional costs. The total tax charge for the year on continuing operations was therefore GBP55.7m (2012 restated: GBP55.6m) and continuing profit after tax was GBP193.6m (2012 restated: GBP174.3m). Taxes of GBP41.7m (2012: GBP102.9m) were paid in the year.
Pensions

The net liability for defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 was GBP158m (2012: GBP232m). In addition GBP1m relating to the ten schemes divested as part of the Retail Dispense disposal is included in liabilities held for sale.
The UK fund deficit was GBP63m as at 31 December 2013 (2012: GBP111m) and constituted 83% (2012:
82%) of the total defined benefit liabilities and 89% (2012: 89%) of the total defined benefit assets. The
decrease in the deficit in the UK fund in 2013 principally arose from strong asset returns in the year
supplemented by additional cash contributions of GBP33.6m. This was offset by an increase in liabilities
as the impact of an increased inflation assumption of 0.5% exceeded the reduction resulting from the
0.2% increase in the discount rate.

The deficit in the overseas funds as at 31 December 2013 was GBP95m (2012: GBP121m). The principal reason for the decrease was an increase in the discount rates used to determine the liabilities, however funded plans experienced strong asset returns and a number of plans saw returns in excess of the current service and financing costs.

NOTES RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Restatements and changes in accounting estimates
Restatement in respect of the treatment of the Retail Dispense businesses as discontinued operations

Because the sale of the Retail Dispense businesses, which completed on 1 January 2014, represents the disposal of a "major class of business" for the Group and because this disposal was considered to be highly probable from a point prior to the end of the accounting period, these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS5 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. Accordingly, the results of these businesses are now reported in one line, net of tax, below profit after tax and the comparative figures have been restated. A full analysis of the financial effect of this restatement is given in note 3.

IFRS5 also requires that the assets and liabilities associated with these discontinued operations should be shown in separate lines in current assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet, but that the prior year information is not restated to be shown on a similar basis.
Restatement in respect of IAS19 'Employee Benefits (Revised 2011)'
The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2012 has been restated for the adoption of IAS19
'Employee Benefits' (revised 2011). IAS19 as revised includes a number of amendments to the
accounting for defined benefit plans, but the principal impact on the Group is that the return on plan assets
recognised in the income statement is now based on the discount rate applied to the liabilities. Prior to the
revision, the expected return on assets was recognised through the income statement.

The retrospective impact on the Group for the 2012 full year comparatives was a decrease in the net financing credit of GBP19.2m and an associated reduction in the tax charge of GBP4.5m. The equivalent credits and associated taxation impacts to these income statement charges have been recognised in other comprehensive income, consequently there was no overall net balance sheet effect. The principal impact of the other amendments to IAS19 for the Group relate to the new disclosure requirements, which have been included in note 11.

2. Segmental analysis

Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements for each of the Group's operating segments. The operating segment reporting format reflects the Group's management and internal reporting structures and represents the information that is presented to the chief operating decision-maker, being the Executive Committee. Inter-segment revenue is insignificant. The Group comprises the following five operating segments and activities, but as discussed earlier in these financial statements, the Retail Dispense businesses were disposed of on 1 January 2014, subsequent to the
year-end, and consequently their results are shown as discontinued operations in the Income Statement, while their assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale in the Balance Sheet.
Fluid Controls - continuing operations
Severe Service

The Severe Service division is a world leading provider of highly-engineered flow control solutions for critical applications that are able to withstand temperature and pressure extremes and intensely abrasive and corrosive cyclical operations.
Fluid Power

The Fluid Power division specialises in developing motion and fluid control technologies for applications where precision, speed and reliability are essential.
Indoor Climate

The Indoor Climate division designs and manufactures technologies which deliver optimal and energy efficient heating and cooling systems inside buildings.
Retail Dispense - discontinued operations
Beverage Dispense

Design, manufacture and supply of still and  carbonated beverage dispense systems and associated merchandising equipment for brand owners and retailers.
Merchandising

Design, manufacture and supply of permanent point of purchase display systems for brand owners and retailers.

Performance is measured based on segmental operating profit which is the profit reported by the business, stated before exceptional items including the reversal of economic hedge contract gains and losses, the net credit on special pension events, restructuring costs, costs associated with the disposal of the Retail Dispense business, acquired intangible amortisation and other acquisition-related costs.

Businesses enter into forward currency and metal contracts to provide economic hedges against the impact on profitability of swings in rates and values in accordance with the Group's policy to minimise the risk of volatility in revenues, costs and margins. Segmental operating profits are therefore charged/credited with the impact of these contracts. In accordance with IAS39, these contracts do not meet the technical provisions required for hedge accounting and gains and losses are reversed out of segmental profit and are recorded in net financial income and expense for the purposes of the consolidated income statement.



The following table illustrates how the results for the segments reconcile to the overall results reported in the Income Statement.

4. Post balance sheet events
The Group disposed of its Retail Dispense Operations on 1 January 2014, subsequent to the year-end. The proceeds of the disposal were $1,100m, adjusted for net debt in the business at the date of disposal
and a customary completion accounts mechanism. These proceeds were hedged using a deal contingent
forward exchange contract to protect the Group from adverse movements in the sterling/dollar exchange
rate between exchange of contract on 15 October 2013 and completion on 1 January 2014. After
deducting transaction costs, the Retail Dispense net assets, taxation and after recycling the cumulative
historical exchange gain on the assets disposed, we estimate that the profit on disposal of this business to
be recorded in 2014 will be in the region of GBP475m.
Return of Cash and share consolidation

As envisaged in the announcement of the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses, we are returning cash of about GBP620m to shareholders via a "B and C share scheme", which was approved in the general meeting in February 2014.

The B and C Share Scheme was accompanied by a seven for eight share consolidation, which is a commonly used arrangement to ensure that the Group's share price after the return of cash is broadly equivalent to the share price prior to the return of capital, which ensures that targets and prices in the Group's various share-based remuneration schemes remain appropriate.
The return of Cash will reduce retained earnings in the 2014 Balance Sheet by about GBP620m.

5. Acquisitions
Analytical Flow Products ("AFP")

AFP is the trade name for Mécanique Analytique Inc, a Canadian product development company specialising in the Fluid Power Life Science and Energy sectors. The Group acquired AFP on 21 August
2013 for initial cash consideration of GBP2.2m (CA$3.7m). Further amounts may be payable based on the business's performance in the three to five years following the acquisition, which (including a bonus payable to one employee) have a range of GBP14.2m to GBP32.4m (CA$25m to CA$57m at year-end exchange rates).
Nano-Porous Solutions Limited ("NPSL") [ 06-03-14 0700GMT ]

The acquisition of NPSL completed on 29 October 2013. NPSL is a UK company based in Newcastle specialising in products that increase the efficiency of the removal of moisture from compressed air systems, particularly in Fluid Power's Rail Sector. Consideration for the acquisition comprised GBP5.4m payable on completion and an earn-out arrangement based on the business's performance in the 2016 calendar year, capped at GBP2.4m.

Included in financial instruments are current year trading gains and losses on economically effective transactions which for management reporting purposes are included in segmental operating profit (see note 2). For statutory purposes these are required to be shown within net financial income and expense above. Gains or losses for future year transactions are in respect of financial instruments held by the Group to provide stability of future trading cash flows.
7. Taxation

The effective tax rate for the Group before exceptional items reduced to 22% (2012 restated: 24%) as a result of further business reorganisation, a strong focus on claiming Government-approved tax incentives around the world and the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate. In addition, exceptional tax relief of GBP9.8m (2012 restated: GBP10.4m) arose in connection with business restructuring and other exceptional costs. The total tax charge for the year on continuing operations was therefore GBP55.7m (2012 restated: GBP55.6m) and continuing profit after tax was GBP193.6m (2012 restated: GBP174.3m). Taxes of GBP41.7m (2012: GBP102.9m) were paid in the year. IMI seeks to manage its tax affairs wholly within the company's core tax principles of compliance, fairness, value and transparency, in accordance with the IMI Way.

9. Exceptional items
The following items are considered to be exceptional in these financial statements. Reversal of net economic hedge contract gains:
For segmental reporting purposes, changes in the fair value of economic hedges which are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, together with the gains and losses on their settlements, are included in the segmental revenues and operating profit of the relevant business segment. The exceptional item at the operating level reverses this treatment. The financing exceptional items reflect the change in value or settlement of these contracts with the financial institutions with whom they were transacted. The former amounted to a charge of GBP5.1m (2012: GBP6.8m) and the latter amounted to a credit of GBP2.7m (2012: GBP5.8m). The GBP2.7m credit reported in 2013 includes a charge of GBP3.0m for the cost of the deal-contingent element of the forward contract hedging the proceeds of the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses.
Restructuring costs and acquired intangible amortisation:

The restructuring costs of GBP14.2m (2012 restated: GBP18.9m) arising in the year principally comprise a German site closure in our Fluid Power business and strategic cost reduction exercises in our Indoor Climate and Severe Service businesses. Acquired intangible amortisation decreased to GBP21.9m (2012: GBP29.6m).
Costs associated with the disposal of our retail dispense operations:

Costs associated with the disposal of our retail dispense operations amounted to GBP8.0m and principally represented costs payable to the legal and financial advisors assisting with the origination and completion of the transaction.
Other acquisition-related costs:
Other acquisition-related costs comprise the following:

- The accrual of GBP0.1m and GBP0.9m for additional consideration payable to the vendors of respectively, the NPSL and AFP acquisitions, which are discussed in detail in note 5.

Page 29 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- Acquisition costs of GBP0.6m and GBP0.3m respectively in relation to these acquisitions.
Net credit on special pension events:
In 2012, the net credit on special pension events of GBP10.9m comprised:
- A GBP9.0m past service credit arising on a pension increase exchange exercise relating to the UK
pension scheme.

- A GBP3.2m past service credit in two of our Swiss schemes, resulting from a change in these schemes' rules during the year.
- A GBP1.3m cost arising in Japan relating to the exit of a state-sponsored scheme during the year. Taxation
The tax effects of the above items are included in the exceptional column of the income statement. In addition, in 2013, exceptional tax charges of GBP14.7m have been incurred in association with the pre-sale restructuring of certain of the Retail Dispense businesses sold and included in discontinued operations.
10. Dividend

The directors recommend a final dividend of 22.5p per share (2012: 20.7p) payable on 19 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 11 April 2014, which will absorb around GBP60.7m (2012: GBP66.1m) cash. Together with the interim dividend of 12.8p per share paid on 11 October 2013, this makes a total distribution of 35.3p per share (2012: 32.5p per share). In accordance with IAS10
'Events after the Balance Sheet date', this final proposed dividend has not been reflected in the 31
December 2013 balance sheet.
11. Employee Benefits

The Group has 74 (2012: 79) defined benefit obligations in operation as at 31 December 2013. Ten of these schemes were divested with the Retail Dispense businesses on 1 January 2014. The Group recognises there is a funding and investment risk inherent within defined benefit arrangements and seeks to continue its programme of closing overseas defined benefit plans where they are neither mandatory nor an operational necessity and providing in their place appropriate defined contribution arrangements.

The net liability for defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2013 was GBP158m (2012: GBP232m). In addition GBP1m relating to the ten schemes divested as part of the Retail Dispense disposal is included in liabilities held for sale.

The overall deficit is split between the IMI Pension Fund in the UK ('the Fund') which has been closed to future accrual since 31 December 2010, and overseas schemes. The UK fund deficit was GBP63m as at
31 December 2013 (2012: GBP111m) and constituted 83% (2012: 82%) of the total defined benefit liabilities and 89% (2012: 89%) of the total defined benefit assets. The decrease in the deficit in the UK fund in 2013 principally arose from strong asset returns in the year supplemented by additional cash contributions of GBP33.6m. This was offset by an increase in liabilities as the impact of an increase in the inflation assumption of 0.5% exceeded the reduction resulting from the 0.2% increase in the discount rate.

The last formal triennial actuarial valuation of the Fund was  carried  out as at 31 March 2011 and the next will be conducted as at 31 March 2014. The statement of funding principles agreed with the Trustee
during the 2011 valuation resulted in an actuarial deficit of GBP120m whereupon it was agreed to pay contributions of GBP16.8m each July from 2012 to 2016 inclusive as part of the recovery plan to close the deficit by 2016. The 2014 payment under this plan was accelerated into December 2013. Following the disposal of the Retail Dispense businesses, the Company is making a further one-off payment of GBP70m into the UK Fund in two tranches in 2014, the first of which, GBP53.2m, was made in January 2014. The Group continues to explore various options with the Trustee to reduce further the funding and investment risk in respect of the Fund.

The deficit in the overseas funds as at 31 December 2013 was GBP95m (2012: GBP121m). The principal reason for the decrease was an increase in the discount rates used to determine the liabilities, however funded plans experienced strong asset returns and a number of plans saw returns in excess of the current service and financing costs.

13. Contingent liabilities

As described in last year's accounts, in May 2012 companies belonging to a British builders' merchant served damages claims against IMI plc and others relating to alleged financial losses incurred in the UK as a result of anti-competitive behaviour undertaken by a number of manufacturers of copper plumbing tubes and copper plumbing fittings. An investigation by the  European Commission was commenced in
2001 and found cartel activity for which it imposed  fines in 2004 (tubes) and 2006 (fittings). IMI plc disposed of its former copper plumbing tubes and fittings businesses in 2002. There are separate tubes and fittings cases in the English High Court. IMI is defending both claims robustly and has brought in all other appropriate parties as contributors. At the year-end, the Directors recorded their best estimate of any settlement in respect of the cases. However, due to the stage of the ongoing negotiation and the potential impact on the outcome of the claim, the amount provided is not disclosed.



14. Exchange rates

The income statements of overseas operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year, balance sheets are translated at year end rates. The most significant currencies are the Euro and
the US Dollar - the relevant rates of exchange were:

The movement in average exchange rates between 2012 and 2013 resulted in our reported 2013 segmental revenue and segmental operating profit each being 2% higher as the average Euro and US Dollar rates against Sterling were 4% and 2% stronger, respectively. If the average exchange
rates to the end of February 2014 of US$1.65 and EUR1.21 had been applied to our 2013 results, it is estimated that segmental revenue and segmental operating profit would have both been 4% lower.

15. Financial information

The preliminary statement of results was approved by the Board on 5 March 2014. The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory accounts for the years ended 31
December 2013 or 2012 but is derived from the 2013 accounts. Statutory accounts for 2012 have been delivered to the registrar of companies and those for 2013 will be delivered in due course. Ernst & Young LLP has reported on both the 2012 and 2013 accounts. Their reports were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include references to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying its reports and (iii) did not contain statements under section S498(2) or S498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.

This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of the preparation of this announcement and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements. Nothing in this preliminary announcement should be construed as a profit forecast.

This preliminary statement has been prepared for the Group as a whole and therefore gives greater emphasis to those matters which are significant to IMI plc and its subsidiaries when viewed as a whole.

References in the commentary to segmental operating profit, operating margins and profit before tax, unless otherwise stated, relate to reported numbers after adjustment for exceptional items. Segmental operating profit is reported as if economic currency and metals hedges were effective for financial reporting purposes. Business segments enter into forward currency and metal contracts to provide
Page 32 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
economic hedges against the impact on profitability of swings in rates and values in accordance with the Group's policy to minimise the risk of volatility in revenues, costs and margins. Business segmental operating profits are therefore charged/credited with the impact of those settled contracts. In accordance with IAS39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement', these contracts do not meet the technical provisions required for hedge accounting and gains and losses are reversed out of segmental profit and are recorded in net financial income and expense for the purposes of the statutory consolidated income statement. References to EPS, unless otherwise stated, relate to reported EPS adjusted for the per share after-tax impact of exceptional items. The directors consider that the quantum, one-off nature or volatility of these adjustments can distort the underlying performance of the Group and for this reason the commentary discusses these adjusted amounts.

References to organic growth are to like-for-like or underlying growth and exclude the impact of exchange rate translation and acquisitions or disposals that are included in headline reported growth figures. The organic growth is derived from excluding any contribution from acquired companies to revenues or profits in the current period until the first anniversary of their acquisition. It also excludes the contribution to revenues or profits in both the current and comparative period from any business that has been disposed of or sold. This adjusted growth in revenues or profits will then be compared to the adjusted prior period after its re-translation at the average exchange rates of the current period to provide the organic growth rate.

The Company's 2013 Annual Report and notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting will be posted to shareholders on 1 April 2014.

The European Commission announced Wednesday it had slapped fines totalling nearly 1 billion euros on a cartel of European and Japanese companies that supply ball bearings  to car and truck manufacturers.

The six "companies colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy vis-a-vis  automotive customers for more than seven years" said the Commission in announcing the 953 million euros ($1.3 billion) in fines.

The European Commission announced Wednesday it has slapped fines totalling nearly 1 billion euros on a cartel of European and Japanese companies that supply ball bearings  to car and truck manufacturers.

The six companies "colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy vis-a-vis  automotive customers for more than seven years" said the Commission in announcing the 953 million euros ($1.3 billion) in fines.

TD
The biggest  fine of 370.5 million euros was imposed on Germany's Schaeffler, followed by Sweden's
SKF at 315.1 million euros.
Of the four Japanese companies, three were  fined: NTN 201.4 million euros, NSK 62.4 million euros and
NFC nearly four million euros.
The fourth company, JTEKT, escaped a  fine as it reported the  cartel to the European Commission. The other five companies had their  fines reduced as they agreed to settle with the Commission.
"Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts," said Competition Commission Joaquin Almunia.

The Commission said the companies colluded from 2004 to 2011 to pass along steel cost increases to vehicle manufacturers.

European vehicle manufacturers, which are estimated to have bought over 2 billion euros in  bearings annually, would request bids to select their suppliers for the metal spheres which reduce friction between moving parts in cars and trucks.

The commission said the six  bearings  manufacturers had colluded and shared sensitive information in submitting bids.
The Commission has also busted producers of  automotive electric wiring and foam used in  car seats.

"I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry," said Almunia.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," he added.

Sweden's SKF, the world's biggest maker of industrial  bearings,  said it had intensified its compliance and training programmes, and acknowledged the coordination of bids had been unacceptable.

"While we strongly believe that no damage has been caused to our business partners this conduct is in clear violation of our values and the SKF code of conduct," said chief executive Tom Johnstone.

LP
The European Commission has continued its fight against collusion by imposing hefty  fines on a number of European and Japanese producers of  automotive bearings.  The firms stood accused of long-term price coordination.

The EU executive announced Wednesday it had found two European and four Japanese companies guilty of operating a  cartel in the market for  automotive bearings.  These parts are used in  cars and trucks  to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle.

TD
The Commission imposed a total  fine of some 953 million euros (1.33 billion), with Germany's Schaeffler having to pay the lion's share of 370.5 billion euros despite receiving reductions for its cooperation in the investigation.
Japanese company JTEKT was not  fined at all as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's
Leniency Notes for revealing the existence of the  cartel.
More probes underway

The EU executive had found that the firms in question had engaged in secret price fixing for more than seven years in a row, notably between April 2004 and July 2011.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's effort to bust  cartels in the market for  car parts, after sanctions we imposed on producers of electric wires and industrial foam used in  car seats," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"I hope the  fines will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behavior and help restore competition in this industry," he added.

The EU executive is also investigating more products such as airbags, safety belts and steering wheels.

19 Mar 2014 08:04 EDT EU Slaps EUR953 Mln  Fines on Car, Truck Bearings  Makers


By Tom Fairless
TD
BRUSSELS--The European Union's antitrust watchdog slapped almost EUR1 billion ($1.4 billion) of fines on six companies for operating a  cartel for car and truck ball-bearings,  in the latest phase of its investigation into competition breaches in the car-parts sector.

The European Commission, which acts as the bloc's central antitrust authority, said Wednesday that the companies colluded over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the whole European Economic Area.
The cartel involved two European companies--Sweden's SKF AB and Germany's Schaeffler
Group--and four Japanese companies-- JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN--the commission said.
"This is a blatant breach of EU rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said.
The scale of the  fines, totaling EUR953 million, "reflects the economic importance of the  cartelized
sector as well as the scope and duration of infringement," Mr. Almunia said.

The fines are the fourth highest that the commission has issued for operating a  cartel, according to its website.

The antitrust watchdog found that the companies coordinated price increases, colluded on quotations and annual price reductions for customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

All companies agreed to settle with the commission and "recognize their wrongdoing," Mr. Almunia said. JTEKT wasn't  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel.
Schaeffler and SKF received the biggest  fines of EUR370 million and EUR315 million, respectively. The size of the EU market for  automotive bearings  is estimated to be at least EUR2 billion a year, the
commission said.

The settlement is part of a broader investigation into suspected  cartels in the car-parts sector. The commission fined five companies EUR142 million last July for operating cartels for wire harnesses, and issued fines totaling EUR114 million in January to companies operating cartels for flexible foam used in car seats. It is investigating other products such as air bags, safety belts and steering wheels.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," Mr. Almunia said.

The European Commission has slapped fines totaling nearly €1 billion on a  cartel of European and
Japanese companies that supply ball bearings  to car and truck manufacturers.
The six companies "colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy vis-a-vis automotive
customers for more than seven years" said the Commission in announcing the €953m in fines.

TD
The biggest  fine of €370.5m was imposed on Germany's Schaeffler, followed by Sweden's SKF at
€315.1m.
Of the four Japanese companies, three were  fined: NTN €201.4m, NSK €62.4m and NFC nearly €4m. JTEKT escaped a  fine as it reported the  cartel to the European Commission.
The other five companies had their  fines reduced as they agreed to settle with the Commission.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts," said Joaquin Almunia, the Commission vice president in charge of competition policy.

BRUSSELS, March 19 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators fined German engineering group Schaeffler <IPO-SHF.F>, Sweden's SKF and three Japanese car parts makers a total 953.3 million euros ($1.3 billion) for taking part in a ball  bearings cartel.

The sanctions, announced on Wednesday, are the latest from the European Commission which is investigating price-fixing of more than 100  car parts by more than 70 companies in the auto industry.

Regulators in the United States, Japan and Canada have also  fined several car parts makers in recent years for fixing prices of products ranging from seatbelts, radiators and windshield wipers to air-conditioning systems.
The EU antitrust authority said the cartel lasted for more than seven years between April 2004 and
July 2011 in Europe where the ball bearings  market is worth at least 2 billion euros annually.

Schaeffler received the biggest  fine, 370.5 million euros, while SKF's was 315.1 million euros, the second-largest. Ball  bearings  are used to reduce friction in products from aircraft to hairdryers.

The fines for Japanese firms NTN, NSK and NFC were 201.35 million euros, 62.4 million and 3.96 million respectively. The five companies acknowledged taking part in the  cartel in return for a 10 percent cut in their penalties.

JTEKT escaped a sanction as it told the  European Commission about the  cartel, prompting raids on the cartel members by the regulator in November 2011.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

The European Commission has fined automotive suppliers almost €1bn for colluding and fixing the prices of ball bearings,  the latest in Brussels' far-reaching probe into  cartels across the industry.

Sweden's SKF, the world's largest ball bearing manufacturer, and Germany's Schaeffler were among five companies hit by a combined €953.3m fine, as the commission warned of more penalties to come.

TD
Cartelisation of the automotive supply chain has become a major worry for  car and truck manufacturers as well as regulators, because of the dominance of a small number of global suppliers for individual components, and increasing rationalisation of parts between rivals.
Global antitrust bodies have stepped up efforts against  cartels in the industry over the past few years. More than 20 car parts producers have been  fined a total of more than $2bn in a US probe into
price-fixing in the industry, while the EU is currently probing suspected  cartelisation among air bag,
seatbelt, steering-wheel and other producers, in an investigation covering as many as 70
manufacturers.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts," said Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner.

"This decision is part of a wider effort to investigate  cartels in the car parts industries . . . one of the largest cartel investigations ever conducted," said Mr Almunia, who has imposed sanctions on  cartels in the electric wire and foam seat producers over the past year.

The probe concluded on Wednesday found that the six companies colluded to secretly fix prices of automotive bearings  - used by cars and trucks  to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle - for more than seven years starting in 2004.

The average car contains between 100 and 150 ball  bearings,  in a total EU market for the component worth about €2bn, according to the commission.
The commission found that SKF, Schaeffler and Japanese producers NSK, NFC, NTN and JTEKT in
Japan colluded to co-ordinate pricing strategy.
Schaeffler was hit by the biggest  fine overall, at €370.5m, while SKF will have to pay a €315.1m
penalty. Japan's NTN was  fined €201.4m, NSK received a €62.4m penalty and NFC was  fined €3.96m.
JTEKT escaped a €86m penalty for exposing the  cartel to the EU's antitrust body.

"I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry," said Mr Almunia. "If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair
the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy cars."

BRUSSELS—The European Union antitrust watchdog fined five companies a combined €953 million ($1.32 billion) for fixing prices for car and truck ball bearings  in the latest phase of its investigation into competition breaches in the auto-parts market.

The European Commission, which acts as the bloc's central antitrust authority, said Wednesday that six companies in all colluded over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the European Economic Area.

TD
The cartel involved two European companies—Sweden's SKF AB and Germany's Schaeffler Group—and four Japanese companies—JTEKT Corp., NSK Ltd., NFC and NTN Corp.—the commission said.

"This is a blatant breach of EU rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said. The scale of the  fines "reflects the economic importance of the  cartelized  sector, as well as the scope and duration of infringement," he added.
The fines are the fourth-largest the commission has issued for operating a  cartel, it said.

The antitrust watchdog found that the companies coordinated price increases, colluded on quotations and annual price reductions for customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

All companies agreed to settle with the commission and "recognize their wrongdoing," Mr. Almunia said. JTEKT wasn't  fined because it disclosed the  cartel.

The size of the EU market for  automotive bearings  is estimated to be at least €2 billion a year, the commission said.
Schaeffler and SKF received the biggest  fines of €370 million and €315 million, respectively.

"I deeply regret that this has happened," said SKF Chief Executive Tom Johnstone in a statement, adding that the company had improved its compliance and training programs in response to the investigation.

JTEKT President Tetsuo Agata said in a statement that the company "treats this matter with utmost seriousness," and had taken steps to prevent its recurrence.

A spokesman for Schaeffler said the company had cooperated with the commission, and had made a provision of €380 million in December to cover its  fine. NSK, NFC and NTN didn't reply to requests for comment.

The settlement is part of a broader investigation into suspected  cartels in auto-parts. The commission fined five companies €142 million last July for price-fixing in wire harnesses, and issued

Page 51 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
fines totaling €114 million in January to companies operating  cartels for flexible foam used in  car
seats. It is probing other products such as air bags, safety belts and steering wheels.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," Mr. Almunia said.

BRUSSELS, March 19 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators fined German engineering group Schaeffler <IPO-SHF.F>, Sweden's SKF and three Japanese car parts makers a total 953.3 million euros ($1.33 billion) on Wednesday for taking part in a ball bearings  cartel.

TD
Schaeffler received the biggest  fine at 370.5 million euros while SKF's sanction came to 315.1 million euros, the second-largest.

The fines for NTN, NSK and NFC were 201.35 million euros, 62.4 million and 3.96 million respectively. The five companies acknowledged taking part in the  cartel in return for a 10 percent cut in their penalties.
JTEKT escaped a sanction as it alerted the  cartel to the European Commission.
The EU antitrust authority said the  cartel lasted for more than seven years between April 2004 and July
2011.

(FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 3/20/14) By Tom Fairless
BRUSSELS -- The European Union antitrust watchdog fined five companies a combined 953 million
euros ($1.32 billion) for fixing prices for  car and truck ball bearings  in the latest phase of its
investigation into competition breaches in the auto-parts market.

TD
The European Commission, which acts as the bloc's central antitrust authority, said Wednesday that six companies in all colluded over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the European Economic Area.

The cartel involved two European companies -- Sweden's SKF AB and Germany's Schaeffler Group -- and four Japanese companies -- JTEKT Corp., NSK Ltd., NFC and NTN Corp. -- the commission said.

"This is a blatant breach of EU rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said. The scale of the  fines "reflects the economic importance of the  cartelized  sector, as well as the scope and duration of infringement," he added.
The fines are the fourth-largest the commission has issued for operating a  cartel, it said.

The antitrust watchdog found that the companies coordinated price increases, colluded on quotations and annual price reductions for customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

All companies agreed to settle with the commission and "recognize their wrongdoing," Mr. Almunia said. JTEKT wasn't  fined because it disclosed the  cartel.

The size of the EU market for  automotive bearings  is estimated to be at least 2 billion euros a year, the commission said.
Schaeffler and SKF received the biggest  fines of 370 million euros and 315 million euros, respectively. "I deeply regret that this has happened," said SKF Chief Executive Tom Johnstone in a statement,
adding that the company had improved its compliance and training programs in response to the
investigation.

JTEKT President Tetsuo Agata said in a statement that the company "treats this matter with utmost seriousness," and had taken steps to prevent its recurrence.

A spokesman for Schaeffler said the company had cooperated with the commission, and had made a provision of 380 million euros in December to cover its  fine. NSK, NFC and NTN didn't reply to requests for comment.

The settlement is part of a broader investigation into suspected  cartels in auto-parts. The commission fined five companies 142 million euros last July for price-fixing in wire harnesses, and issued fines totaling 114 million euros in January to companies operating  cartels for flexible foam used in car
seats. It is probing other products such as air bags, safety belts and steering wheels.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," Mr. Almunia said.

Brussels (dpa) - The  European Commission has fined two European and four Japanese  car parts manufacturers 953 million euros (1.3 billion dollars) in a settlement over price fixing, the European Union's executive announced Wednesday.
The companies had secretly coordinated their pricing strategies for automotive bearings  between April
2004 and July 2011, the commission said. These are used by  car, truck and car part manufacturers to
reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle.

TD
"This is not a component of minor importance," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, adding that an average  car contains 100 to 150  bearings,  creating a European market worth at least 2 billion euros annually.

The highest share of the  fine goes to Germany's Schaeffler, which must pay almost 370.5 million euros, while Swedish manufacturer SKF was  fined 315 million euros.

Japanese companies NTN, NSK and NFC face  fines totalling almost 268 million euros. A fourth Japanese manufacturer, JTEKT, was not  fined as it had blown the whistle on the  cartel, the commission said.

All other companies had their  fines reduced for cooperating with the investigation and for agreeing to a settlement.
The settlement is part of a wider commission investigation into suspected  cartels in the sector of  car
parts. It has already found  cartels for wire harnesses in cars and for the foam used in  car seats.

The EU's executive may  fine companies up to 10 per cent of their turnover for anti-competitive behaviour because such practices can drive up prices and harm customers.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog slapped almost EUR1 billion ($1.4 billion) of  fines on six companies for operating a cartel for car and truck ball-bearings,  in the latest phase of its investigation into competition breaches in the car-parts sector.

Brussels, 19/03/2014 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 19 March, the  European Commission decided to fine two European companies (SKF and Schaeffler) and four Japanese companies (JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN with its French subsidiary NTN-SNR) a total of €953 million for operating a  cartel in the automotive ball bearings  industry,

After an investigation that began in 2011, the Commission found that the companies had operated a cartel across the European Economic Area between April 2004 and July 2011 in order to secretly agree on prices for the  car industry. The companies coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their automotive customers, colluded in requests for quotations and for annual price reductions from customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

TD
Japanese company JTEKT was not  fined as it benefited from immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel. NSK, NFC, SKF and Schaeffler received reductions of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the Commission's leniency programme. Since all companies agreed to settle the case with the Commission, their  fines were further reduced by 10%. NSK's  fine has therefore been halved and NFC's reduced by 40%.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: “It is incredible to see that yet another  car component was cartelised. I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry”. (EL)

The European regulator has slapped a total of 953 million ($1.32 billion) fine on six European and Japanese auto-part companies for fixing prices of ball  bearings  supplied to car and truck manufacturers.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust cartels in the markets for car parts. It is incredible to see that one more  car component was cartelized,''  said, Joaquin Almunia, vice president in charge of competition policy at the European Commission (EC).

TD
Companies involved in the  cartel included two European firms, SKF, the world's largest maker of ball bearings,  and Germany's Schaeffler Group, and four Japanese companies, JTEKT Corp, NSK Ltd, NFC and NTN Corp.

The Brussels-based regulator said that the six companies operated as a  cartel over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the European Economic Area in the market for automotive bearings  in the EU, which is estimated to be at least 2 billion a year.

Automotive bearings  are used by car, truck and car part manufacturers to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle, like wheel bearings,  bearings  for gearbox, transmission, alternator or air conditioning systems.
The EC said that the companies colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy vis-a-vis
automotive customers.

The cartel coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their  automotive customers, colluded on requests for quotations and for annual price reductions from customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

Japanese company JTEKT escaped a 86-million  fine for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the EC, while NSK, NFC, SKF and Schaeffler received reductions in  fines for cooperating in the investigation.

Since all companies agreed to settle the case with the EC, their  fines were further reduced by 10 per cent.
Schaeffler and SKF received the biggest  fines of 370 million and 315 million, respectively, while NTN
was fined 201.4 million, NSK 62.4 million, and NFC 3.96 million.

"I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry,'' said, Almunia.

The European Commission has found that two European companies (SKF and Schaeffler) and four Japanese companies (JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN with its French subsidiary NTN-SNR) operated a cartel in the market for automotive bearings.  The Commission has imposed  fines totalling 953 306
000. Automotive bearings  are used by car, truck and car part manufacturers to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle.

Cars and trucks  contain numerous bearings,  for example wheel  bearings,  bearings  for gearbox, transmission, alternator or air conditioning systems. The companies colluded to secretly coordinate theirpricing strategy vis-a-vis  automotive customers for more than seven years, from April 2004 until July 2011, in the whole European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
Japanese company JTEKT was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's 2006
Leniency Notice for revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission. NSK, NFC, SKF and
Schaeffler received reductions of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation under the
Commission's leniency programme. Since all companies agreed to settle the case with the Commission,
their fines were further reduced by 10 per cent.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, Joaquin Almunia, said, "Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for  car parts, after the sanctions we imposed on producers of electric wires and of foam used in  car seats. It is incredible to see that one more  car component was cartelised. I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry. If left unchallenged, cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars."

Automotive bearings  are usually customer-specific products. To select their suppliers, customers (i.e. car, truck or car part manufacturers) generally issue Requests for Quotations. The whole selection process may last several months to one year. Customers often request yearly discounts from the bearings  suppliers, usually referred to as Annual Price Reduction requests, to reflect yearly production efficiencies over the course of the contract.

The companies involved in this secret  cartel coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their automotive customers, colluded on Requests for Quotations and for Annual Price Reductions from customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information. This occurred through multi-, tri- and bilateral contacts. The size of the EU market for  automotive bearings  is estimated to be at least 2 billion a year.

The decision is part of a major investigative effort into suspected  cartels in the sector of  car parts. The Commission already found  cartels for wire harnesses in cars (IP/13/673) and for flexible foam used in car seats (IP/14/88). The Commission is investigating more products, such as airbags, safety belts and steering wheels (see MEMO/11/395), air conditioning and engine cooling products (see MEMO/12/563) and lighting systems.

Fines

The fines were set on the basis of the Commission's 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 andMEMO/06/256).

In setting the level of  fines, the Commission took into account the companies' sales of the products concerned, the serious nature of the infringement, its geographic scope and its duration.
JTEKT received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel and thereby avoided a  fine of 86
037 000 for its participation in the infringement.

NSK, NFC, SKF and Schaeffler benefited from reductions of  fines under the 2006 Leniency Notice for their cooperation. The reductions reflect the timing of their cooperation and the extent to which the evidence they provided helped the Commission to prove the existence of the  cartel.

Moreover, under the Commission's 2008 Settlement Notice, the Commission reduced the  fines imposed on all the companies by 10% as they acknowledged their participation in the  cartel and their liability in this respect.
Background

Automotive bearings  are bearings  supplied to automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), which are car, truck and automotive component manufacturers (together also referred to as "automotive customers"). Bearings  are machine parts with rolling elements used in rotating parts to reduce friction and are used in several distinct  car parts.
The Commission's investigation started with unannounced inspections in November 2011 (see MEMO
11/766).

More information on this case will be available under the case number 39922 in the public case register on the Commission's competition website, once confidentiality issues have been dealt with. For more information on the Commission's action against  cartels, see its cartels website.

Dagens Industri, 20 Mar 2014, p.26:- On 19 March, the European Commission imposed a fine of EUR
315mn (USD 435.27mn) on Swedish  bearing manufacturer SKF. A total fine of SEK 8.40bn was
imposed on SKF and five other companies for participating in a price cartel concerning ball bearings  for
motor vehicles. All companies have admitted to the allegations which prompted the Commission to
reduce fines by 10%. SKF received a further  fine reduction of 20% due to its cooperation with the
commission during the investigation. To cover potential  fines, SKF allocated SEK 3bn in its financial
statements at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.

HD       CARTELS : PRODUCERS OF CAR AND TRUCK BEARINGS FINED 953 MN EURO WC     410 words

The Commission has fined two European and four Japanese companies for operating a  cartel on the
automotive bearings  market

The European Commission has dismantled yet another cartel in the car parts sector, this time on the market for automotive bearings  used by car, truck and car part manufacturers to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle. This market in the EU alone is worth around €2 billion a year. The
Commission carried  out surprise inspections in the sector in November 2011 (see Europolitics 4302), and has now handed down harsh punishments: €953 million in  fines for six companies (two in Europe and
four in Japan).

TD
The Commission's Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Joaquín Almunia, said: "Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for  car parts, after the sanctions we imposed on producers of electric wires and of foam used in  car seats".

The six groups concerned had colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy vis-à-vis  automotive customers for more than seven years, from April 2004 until July 2011, in the whole of the European Economic Area (EEA). The companies involved in this secret cartel coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their  automotive customers (manufacturers of cars, lorries and parts).  Automotive     bearings  are generally manufactured at the request of clients, who issue 'requests for quotations'. Companies in the cartel colluded on these requests, and also exchanged commercially sensitive information.

The Commission's list of targets is impressive; it includes the Swedish company SKF AB, the largest global manufacturer of  bearings,  which has been fined €315,109,000, and the German company Schaeffler AG, another major operator. This group received the largest  fine of €370,481,000. Next on the list is the Japanese company NTN, which was  fined €201,354,000, followed by NSK, which must pay
€62,406,000, and NFC, which faces a  fine of €3,956,000. However, JTEKT received full immunity for revealing the existence of the  cartel, and thereby avoided a  fine of €86,037,000 for its participation in the infringement.
NSK, NFC, SKF and Schaeffler have had their initial fines reduced for cooperating in the
inquiry. Moreover, the Commission reduced the fines imposed on all the companies by 10% since they
acknowledged their participation in the  cartel, and therefore their liability.

HD        Deal struck  on compensation claims for victims of cartels

Defendants must disclose hard-to-find evidence
Commission imposed fines of €1.83bn in 2013

TD
Cartel victims across Europe will have greater chances of obtaining compensation after MEPs and member state negotiators struck a deal on new legislation on Tuesday (18 March).

The new rules will make it easier for victims to win claims in court against infringers of antitrust legislation. In particular, courts across the European Union will gain the power to order defendants to disclose hard-to-find evidence, and will allow many victims more time to file their claims.

Action has been taken against offenders by competition authorities in Europe. In 2013, the  European    Commission imposed fines totalling €1.83 billion on 19 companies and associations. A further one hundred cartel infringements were punished at the national level. But victims seeking compensation
from participants in  cartels face obstacles in litigation. Reasons range from the difficulty of obtaining evidence to the time-barring of proceedings and the prohibitive costs of court cases. While a number of follow-on actions have been filed in the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, victims find it hard to assert their rights before courts in other member states.

Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for competition, said: “This directive will remove the barriers that currently prevent the victims of antitrust infringements in the EU from obtaining effective compensation. At the same time, it will ensure an adequate and balanced interaction between actions for damages and the effective public enforcement of competition law by the Commission and national competition authorities.”
Rights

But the arrangements do not go as far as some would have liked in bolstering victims’ rights. For example, MEPs’ pressure proved insufficient to overcome the Commission’s refusal to give victims access to all the documentation collected during the course of its antitrust investigations. The Commission was concerned this would constitute a major disincentive for companies in cartels to participate in the EU’s leniency programme, which has proved so successful in uncovering cartels since it was established in 1996. Member states also diluted a proposal by the Commission to require courts throughout the EU to recognise decisions by national competition authorities – which would have made it easier for victims to prove that a  cartel existed.
Price-fixing
Two European and three Japanese suppliers of ball  bearings  were fined just under €1 billion by the
European Commission yesterday (19 March) for fixing prices over a seven-year period.

German engineering firm Schaeffler picked up the largest  fine at €370.5 million, followed by Swedish company SKF with €315m.
The firms co-ordinated their responses to invitations to tender made by large car and truck
manufacturers. Japanese firm JTEKT escaped a sanction as it revealed the cartel to the Commission.

The car parts sector currently faces a barrage of antitrust investigations. This is the second decision fining a cartel in this market, after the Commission  fined wire-harness manufacturers €141m last year.

In addition, the Commission continues to investigate several alleged  cartels affecting the supply of other car parts, such as airbags and lights.  Car and truck manufacturers have already started to press claims for compensation against parts suppliers.

(SeeNews) - Mar 20, 2014 - German  car parts supplier Schaeffler has to pay a  fine of EUR 370 million
(USD 510m) imposed by the European Union's antitrust authority on account of illegal price fixing,
news agency dpa-AFX reported.
Schaeffler participated in a cartel with five competitors, which held artificially high prices on rolling
bearings  for cars and trucks  for seven years, according to the findings of the European Commission.

TD
The total  fine imposed on the cartel members, including Swedish SKF and four Japanese  auto
suppliers, adds up to EUR 953 million.

The European rolling  bearings  market has a volume of EUR 2 billion. Therefore, the  fines appear substantial because the market is important for the entire economy and the  cartel lasted for a long time
-- from 2004 to 2011, European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in Brussels.

HD      EU fines SFK, Schaeffler,  and three other bearings  suppliers USD1.3 bil. in price-fixing probe

The European Commission has found six bearings  suppliers – Schaeffler, SKF, JTEKT, NSK, Nachi-Fujikoshi, and NTN with its French subsidiary NTN-SNR – to be involved in price fixing of automotive bearings,  according to a press release. The Commission has imposed a total fine of EUR953.3 million (USD1.3 billion) on five of these suppliers; JTEKT has been let off without a fine for blowing the whistle on the  cartel. According to the Commission, these six  bearings  makers colluded to secretly co-ordinate their pricing strategy for  automotive customers for more than seven years, from April
2004 to July 2011, across the European Economic Area (EEA). According to the press release, these suppliers co-ordinated in passing on steel price increases to their customers, colluded on requests for quotations (RFQ) and annual price reductions (APR) from customers, and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

TD
Schaeffler was handed the largest  fine of EUR370.5 million, followed by SKF with EUR315.1 million, and
NTN with EUR201.3 million. NSK agreed to pay EUR62.4 million while another Japanese supplier,
Nachi-Fujikoshi Corporation (NFC), will pay EUR3.9 million. These suppliers are eligible for a 10%
reduction in return for their co-operation with the Commission during its investigation. JTEKT managed to
escape a fine of EUR86 million. Schaeffler, SKF, and NTN were expecting the  fines from the
Commission and had set aside provisions to pay them.

Significance: The Commission began its probe into the alleged price-fixing cartel in 2011. As part of the investigations, the Commission conducted raids on several automotive bearings  suppliers. Automotive suppliers are under scrutiny in key markets including the United States, Europe, Japan, and South Korea for their alleged participation in fixing the price of components sold to  automakers. In the United States, for example, 23 companies and 26 executives have been charged by the Department of Justice and have agreed to pay a total of USD1.8 billion in  fines. In Europe, last year the Commission imposed a combined fine of EUR141.8 million on four wiring harness suppliers for taking part in five  cartels. In January this year, three suppliers Recticel,  Carpenter Group, and Greiner Holding agreed to pay the Commission a EUR114-million  fine to settle a probe into foam used in mattress and  car seats. The Commission is expanding its anti-competition probe to other products including airbags and lighting systems. "We will not stop here – we are still investigating suspected  cartels for airbags as well as lighting systems of the  cars to mention a few examples," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels following the announcement of the  fines.

European Commission authorities have foundtwo European companies (SKF and Schaeffler) and four Japanese companies (JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN with its French subsidiary NTN-SNR), operated a cartel in the market for  automotive bearings  and have imposed fines totalling nearly EUR953m (US$1.3bn).

Brussels says the companies colluded to secretly coordinate their pricing strategy for more than seven years, from April, 2004 until July, 2011, in the whole European Economic Area (EEA).

TD
Japanese company, JTEKT, was not  fined as it benefited from immunity under the Commission's2006
Leniency Noticefor revealing the existence of the  cartel to the Commission.

NSK, NFC, SKF and Schaeffler received reductions of their  fines for their cooperation in the investigation in the Commission's leniency programme. Since all companies agreed to settle the case with the Commission, their  fines were further reduced by 10%.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the Commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts, after the sanctions we imposed on producers of electric wires and of foam used in  car seats," said Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, Joaquin Almunia.

"It is incredible to see one more  car component was cartelised. I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars."

The EC noted companies involved in the secret  cartel coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their automotive customers, colluded on Requests for Quotations and for Annual Price Reductions
from customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.
This occurred through multi-, tri- and bilateral contacts. The size of the EU market for automotive           
bearings  is estimated to be at least EUR2bn per year.
The decision is part of a major investigative effort into suspected  cartels in the sector of  car parts.

The Commission is investigating more products, such as airbags, safety belts and steering wheels, air conditioning and engine cooling products, as well as lighting systems.

The European Commission has fined automotive suppliers almost €1bn for colluding and fixing the prices of ball bearings,  the latest in Brussels' far-reaching probe into  cartels across the industry.

Sweden's SKF, the world's largest ball bearing manufacturer, and Germany's Schaeffler were among five companies hit by a combined €953.3m fine. One company escaped an €86m penalty for exposing the cartel to the EU's antitrust body.

TD
Cartelisation of the automotive supply chain has become a big worry for  car and truck manufacturers as well as regulators, because of the dominance of a small number of global suppliers for individual components, and increasing rationalisation of parts between rivals.
Global antitrust bodies have stepped up efforts against  cartels in the industry over the past few years. More than 20 car parts producers have been fined more than $2bn in a US probe into price-fixing in
the industry, while the EU is probing suspected cartelisation among air bag, seatbelt, steering-wheel
and other producers, in an investigation covering as many as 70 manufacturers.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts," said Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner. "This decision is part of a wider effort to investigate  cartels in the car parts industries."
The probe, which concluded yesterday, found that the six companies colluded to secretly fix prices of
automotive bearings  for more than seven years starting in 2004.

Six groups fixed ball  bearing prices

The European Commission has fined automotive suppliers almost €1bn for colluding and fixing the prices of ball bearings,  the latest in Brussels' far-reaching probe into  cartels across the industry.

TD
Sweden's SKF, the world's largest ball bearing manufacturer, and Germany's Schaeffler were among five companies hit by a combined €953.3m fine, as the commission warned of more penalties to come.

Cartelisation of the motor supply chain has become a big worry for  car and truck manufacturers as well as regulators, because of the dominance of a small number of global suppliers for individual components, and increasing rationalisation of parts between rivals.
Global antitrust bodies have stepped up efforts against  cartels in the industry over the past few years. More than 20 car parts producers have been  fined a total of more than $2bn in a US probe into
price-fixing in the industry, while the EU is currently probing suspected  cartelisation among air bag,
seatbelt, steering-wheel and other producers, in an investigation covering as many as 70
manufacturers.

"Today's decision is a further milestone in the commission's ongoing effort to bust  cartels in the markets for car parts," said Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner.

"This decision is part of a wider effort to investigate  cartels in the car parts industries . . . one of the largest cartel investigations ever conducted," said Mr Almunia, who has imposed sanctions on  cartels in the electric wire and foam seat producers over the past year.

The probe concluded yesterday found that the six companies colluded to secretly fix prices of motor bearings  - used by cars and trucks  to reduce friction between moving parts inside a vehicle - for more than seven years starting in 2004.

The average car contains between 100 and 150 ball  bearings,  in a total EU market for the component worth about €2bn, according to the commission.
The commission found that SKF, Schaeffler and Japanese producers NSK, NFC, NTN and JTEKT in
Japan colluded to co-ordinate pricing strategy.

Schaeffler was hit by the biggest  fine overall, at €370.5m, while SKF will have to pay a €315.1m penalty.
Japan's NTN was  fined €201.4m, NSK received a €62.4m penalty and NFC was  fined €3.96m. JTEKT escaped an €86m penalty for exposing the  cartel to the EU's antitrust body.

"I hope the  fines imposed will deter companies from engaging in such illegal behaviour and help restore competition in this industry," said Mr Almunia.

"If left unchallenged,  cartels for car parts might impair the competitiveness of the  automotive sector and artificially raise the price paid by European consumers who buy  cars," he added.

HD       EU fines bearing manufacturers for steel price collusion

The European Commission yesterday imposed fines totaling €953 million on five manufacturers of bearings  for cars and trucks  for having operated an illegal  cartel for more than seven years. A sixth company was exempted from  fines after it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the EU Commission.

The largest  fines went to Germany’s Schaeffler (€370 million) and Sweden’s SKF (€315 million). The other companies penalised were Japanese: NTN (€201 million), NSK (€62 million) and NFC (€4 million). Another Japanese company, JTEKT, was granted the exemption under the EU's practice of leniency for whistle-blowers.

TD
The Commission said the companies colluded to fix prices between April 2004 and July 2011. “The companies involved in this secret  cartel coordinated the passing-on of steel price increases to their automotive customers, colluded on requests for quotations and for annual price reductions from customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information,” it said.

The Brussels antitrust authorities are conducting a major investigative effort into suspected  cartels among suppliers of automotive components. These include wiring harnesses, steering wheels and safety belts.

Last year Germany’s federal  cartel office conducted unannounced inspections at three steel companies suspected of anti-competitive behaviour in the supply of certain  auto body sheets: no results have yet been disclosed and the office said Wednesday its investigation is continuing.

HD            EU Fines Five Over Auto-Parts Cartel --- Schaeffler,  SKF, Japanese Firms to Pay Combined
$1.32 Billion for Price-Fixing in Ball-Bearings Market

BRUSSELS -- The European Union antitrust watchdog  fined five firms a combined 953 euros ($1.32 billion) for fixing prices for car and truck ball-bearings  in the latest phase of its investigation into competition breaches in the auto-parts market.

The European Commission, which acts as the bloc's central antitrust authority, said on Wednesday that the companies colluded over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the European Economic Area.

TD
The cartel involved two European companies -- Sweden's SKF AB and Germany's Schaeffler Group
-- and four Japanese companies -- JTEKT Corp., NSK Ltd., NFC and NTN Corp. -- the commission
said.

"This is a blatant breach of EU rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said. The scale of the  fines "reflects the economic importance of the  cartelized  sector as well as the scope and duration of infringement," he added.
The fines are the fourth largest the commission has issued for operating a  cartel, it said.

The antitrust watchdog found that the companies coordinated price increases, colluded on quotations and annual price reductions for customers and exchanged commercially sensitive information.

All companies agreed to settle with the commission and "recognize their wrongdoing," Mr. Almunia said. JTEKT wasn't  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel.

Schaeffler and SKF received the biggest  fines of 370 million euros and 315 million euros, respectively.

"I deeply regret that this has happened," said SKF CEO Tom Johnstone in a statement, adding that the company had improved its compliance and training programs in response to the investigation.

JTEKT President Tetsuo Agata said in a statement that the company "treats this matter with utmost seriousness" and had taken steps to prevent its recurrence.

A spokesman for Schaeffler said the company had cooperated with the commission, and had made a provision of 380 million euros in December to cover its  fine.
NSK, NFC and NTN didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

The size of the EU market for  automotive bearings  is estimated to be at least 2 billion euros a year, the commission said.

The settlement is part of a broader investigation into suspected  cartels in auto-parts. The commission fined five companies 142 million euros last July for price-fixing in wire harnesses, and issued fines totaling 114 million euros in January to companies operating  cartels for flexible foam used in car seats. It is probing other products such as air bags, safety belts and steering wheels.

From the WSJ's Tom Fairless:

The European Union's antitrust watchdog slapped almost EUR1 billion ($1.4 billion) of  fines on six companies for operating a cartel for car and truck ball-bearings,  in the latest phase of its investigation into competition breaches in the car-parts sector.

TD
The European Commission, which acts as the bloc's central antitrust authority, said Wednesday that the companies colluded over a seven-year period, from April 2004 until July 2011, across the whole European Economic Area.
The cartel involved two European companies--Sweden's SKF AB and Germany's Schaeffler
Group--and four Japanese companies-- JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN--the commission said.
"This is a blatant breach of EU rules," EU antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said.

It might be a blatant breach, but it's not the biggest -- via the WSJ's Rani Molla, here's a look at the largest cartels ever busted by the EU, as measure by the size of the  fines levied:

Nominal principal amounts represent the amounts at risk should the contracts be fully drawn upon and clients default. The amount of the loan commitments shown above reflects, where relevant, the expected level of take-up of
pre-approved loan offers made by mailshots to personal customers. As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements.
Guarantees

HSBC provides guarantees and similar undertakings on behalf of both third-party customers and other entities within the HSBC Group. These guarantees are generally provided in the normal course of HSBC's banking business. The principal types of guarantees provided
and the maximum potential amount of future payments which HSBC could be required to make at 31 December
2013 were as follows:

1 Financial guarantees are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the
Page 88 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
holder for a loss incurred because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.

2 Credit-related guarantees are contracts that have similar features to financial guarantee contracts but fail to meet the definition of a financial guarantee contract under IAS 39.

The amounts disclosed in the above table are nominal principal amounts and reflect HSBC's maximum exposure under a large number of individual guarantee undertakings. The risks and exposures arising from guarantees are captured and managed in accordance with HSBC's overall credit risk management policies and procedures. Approximately half of the above guarantees have a term of less than one year. Guarantees with
terms of more than one year are subject to HSBC's annual credit review process.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme

The Financial Services Compensation Scheme ('FSCS') has provided compensation to consumers following the collapse of a number of deposit takers. The compensation paid out to consumers is currently funded through loans from the Bank of England and HM Treasury which at 31 December 2013 stood at approximately GBP17 billion (US$28.1bn).

In order to repay the loan principal which is not expected to be recovered, the FSCS confirmed in February 2013 that it would levy approximately GBP363m (US$587m)
in Scheme Year 2013/2014 and in the following two Scheme Years on participating financial institutions. In January 2014, the FSCS announced that the expected levy on participating financial institutions for Scheme Year 2014/2015 would be GBP399m (US$660m).

HSBC could be liable to pay a further proportion of the outstanding borrowings that the FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury.

The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapses cannot currently be estimated reliably as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS and changes in the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Capital commitments

In addition to the commitments disclosed on page 548, at 31 December 2013 HSBC had US$401m (2012: US$607m) of capital commitments contracted but not provided for and US$112m (2012: US$197m) of capital commitments authorised but not contracted for.
Associates

HSBC's share of associates' contingent liabilities amounted to US$46,574m at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$46,148m). No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.

At 31 December 2013, future minimum sublease payments of US$10m (2012: US$14m) were expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at the balance sheet date.

In 2013, US$1,425m (2012: US$1,166m; 2011: US$973m) was charged to 'General and administrative expenses' in respect of lease and sublease agreements, of which US$1,098m (2012: US$1,149m; 2011: US$952m) related to minimum lease payments, US$326m (2012: US$17m; 2011: US$20m) to
contingent rents, and US$1m (2012: US$0.4m; 2011: US$1m) to sublease payments.

The contingent rent represents escalation payments made to landlords for operating, tax and other escalation expenses.
Finance lease receivables

HSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft), property and general plant and machinery. At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms. Lessees may participate in any sales proceeds achieved. Lease rentals arising during the lease terms will either be fixed in quantum or be varied to reflect changes in, for example, tax or interest rates. Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.

At 31 December 2013, unguaranteed residual values of US$205m (2012: US$253m) had been accrued, and the accumulated allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments receivable amounted to US$7m (2012: US$3m). No contingent rents were received in 2013 (2012: nil).


42  Structured entities
HSBC is involved with structured entities, mainly through securitisation of financial assets, conduits and
investment funds.

HSBC arrangements that involve structured entities are authorised centrally when they are established to ensure appropriate purpose and governance. The activities of structured entities administered by HSBC are closely monitored by senior management. HSBC has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, which may be established by HSBC
or by a third party, as detailed below.

Structured entities are assessed for consolidation in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note
1(e).

Conduits

HSBC has established and manages two types of conduits: securities investment conduits ('SIC's) and multi-seller conduits. These entities have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant
factor in deciding who has control; in such cases, the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangement. The conduits are consolidated as HSBC is exposed or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
its returns through its power over the entity.
Securities investment conduits

Solitaire, HSBC's principal SIC, purchases highly rated asset-backed securities ('ABS's) to facilitate tailored investment opportunities. At 31 December 2013, Solitaire held US$9.0bn of ABSs (2012: US$10.0bn). These are included within the disclosures of ABS 'held through consolidated structured entities' on page 206. HSBC's other SICs, Mazarin, Barion and Malachite, evolved from the restructuring of HSBC's structured investment vehicles ('SIV's) in 2008.

-- Solitaire - Solitaire is currently funded entirely by commercial paper 'CP' issued to HSBC. Although HSBC continues to provide a liquidity facility, Solitaire has no need to draw on it so long as HSBC purchases the CP issued, which it intends to do for the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2013, HSBC held US$11.0bn of CP (2012: US$13.0bn).

-- Mazarin - HSBC is exposed to the par value of Mazarin's assets through the provision of a liquidity facility equal to the lesser of the amortised cost of issued senior debt and the amortised cost of non-defaulted assets. At 31 December 2013, this amounted to US$7.4bn (2012: US$8.4bn). First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by Mazarin, which are substantially all held by third parties.

At 31 December 2013, HSBC held 1.3% of Mazarin's capital notes (2012: 1.3%) with a par value of US$17m (2012: US$17m) and a  carrying amount of US$0.3m (2012: nil).

-- Barion and Malachite - HSBC's primary exposure to these SICs is represented by the amortised cost of the debt required to support the non-cash assets of the
Page 94 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
vehicles. At 31 December 2013, this amounted to US$6.3bn (2012: US$7.4bn). First loss protection is provided through the capital notes issued by these vehicles, which are substantially all held by third parties.

At 31 December 2013, HSBC held 3.8 % of the capital notes (2012: 3.7%) issued by these vehicles with a par value of US$37m (2012: US$36m) and a  carrying amount of US$3.3m (2012: US$1.7m).
Multi-seller conduits

These vehicles were established for the purpose of providing access to flexible market-based sources of finance for HSBC's clients.

HSBC bears risk equal to transaction-specific liquidity facilities offered to the multi-seller conduits amounting to US$15.7bn at 31 December 2013 (2012: US$14.3bn). First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of
programme-wide enhancement facilities.
Securitisations [ 25-03-14 1709GMT ]

HSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash
or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.
HSBC managed funds

HSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds. Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls and hence consolidates these funds.
Other

HSBC has also entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business which include asset and structured finance transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds.
Unconsolidated structured entities

The term 'unconsolidated structured entities' refers to all structured entities that are not controlled by HSBC. HSBC enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.

The table below shows the total assets of unconsolidated structured entities in which HSBC has
an interest at the reporting date, as well as its maximum exposure to loss in relation to those interests.

The maximum exposure to loss from HSBC's interests in unconsolidated structured entities represents the

Page 95 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
maximum loss that HSBC could incur as a result of HSBC's involvement with unconsolidated structured entities regardless of the probability of the loss being incurred.

-- For commitments and guarantees, and written credit default swaps, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.

-- For retained and purchased investments in and loans to unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss is the  carrying value of these interests at the balance sheet reporting date.

The maximumexposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate HSBC's exposure to loss.

HSBC has interests in unconsolidated securitisation vehicles through holding notes issued by these entities.
HSBC managed funds



Page 98 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HSBC establishes and manages money market funds and non-money market investment funds to provide customers with investment opportunities. Further information on 'Funds under management' is provided on page 130.

HSBC, as fund manager, may be entitled to receive management and performance fees based on the assets under management. HSBC may also retain units in
these funds.
Non-HSBC managed funds

HSBC purchases and holds units of third-party managed funds in order to facilitate both business and customer needs.
Other

HSBC has established structured entities in the normal course of business such as structured credit transactions for customers, to provide finance to public and private sector infrastructure projects, and for asset and structured finance transactions.
HSBC sponsored structured entities
The definition of a sponsor is given in Note 2(o).

In some cases, HSBC does not have an interest in these entities at the reporting date.

The amount of assets transferred to and income received from such sponsored entities during 2013 was not significant.


43  Legal proceedings and regulatory matters
HSBC is party to legal proceedings and regulatory
matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its
normal business operations. The recognition of
provisions is determined in accordance with the
accounting policies set out in Note 2. Apart from the
matters described below, HSBC considers that none of
these matters are material, either individually or in the
aggregate. Where an individual provision is material, the
fact that a provision has been made is stated and
quantified. Any provision recognised does not constitute
an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. While the
outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain,
management believes that, based on the information
available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in
respect of legal proceedings and regulatory matters as
at 31 December 2013 (see Note 31). It is not practicable
to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for
our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class
of contingent liabilities.
Securities litigation

As a result of an August 2002 restatement of previously reported consolidated financial statements and other corporate events, including the 2002 settlement with 46 states and the District of Columbia relating to real estate lending practices, Household International and certain former officers were named as defendants in a class action lawsuit, Jaffe v. Household International, Inc., et
Page 99 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
al. (N.D. Ill. No. 02 C5893), filed 19 August 2002 in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ('District Court'). The complaint asserted claims under --
10 and -- 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and alleged that the defendants knowingly or recklessly
made false and misleading statements of material fact relating to Household International's Consumer Lending operations, including collections, sales and lending practices, some of which ultimately led to the 2002 state settlement agreement, and facts relating to accounting practices evidenced by the restatement. Ultimately, a class was certified on behalf of all persons who acquired and disposed of Household International common stock between 30 July 1999 and 11 October 2002.

A jury trial concluded in April 2009, which was decided partly in favour of the plaintiffs. Various legal challenges to the verdict were raised in post-trial briefing. [ 25-03-14
1709GMT ]

In December 2011, following the submission of claim forms by class members, the Court-appointed claims administrator to the District Court reported that the total number of claims that generated an allowed loss was
45,921, and that the aggregate amount of these claims was approximately US$2.2bn. The defendants filed legal challenges regarding the presumption of reliance as to the class and compliance with the claims form requirements, which the District Court in September
2012 rejected for the most part. The District Court directed further proceedings before a court-appointed Special Master to address certain claim submission issues.

On 4 October 2013, the District Court denied the defendants' additional post-trial motions for judgement as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial, and granted plaintiffs' motions for a partial final judgement and awarded pre-judgement interest at the Prime rate, compounded annually. Subsequently, on 17
October 2013, the District Court entered a partial final judgement against the defendants in the amount of approximately US$2.46bn. In addition to the partial judgement that has been entered, there also remain approximately US$527m in claims, prior to imposition of prejudgement interest, that still are subject to objections that have not yet been ruled upon by the District Court.

The defendants have filed a Notice of Appeal of the partial final judgement. The defendants have also filed a Supersedeas Bond in the approximate amount of the judgement (US$2.46bn) in order to stay execution on
the judgement pending appeal. Despite the jury verdict, the various rulings of the District Court, and the partial final judgement, we continue to believe that we have meritorious grounds for appeal. The timing and outcome of the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain.

Given the complexity and uncertainties associated with the actual determination of damages, including the outcome of any appeals, there is a wide range of possible damages. We believe we have meritorious grounds for appeal on matters of both liability and
damages, and will argue on appeal that damages should be zero or a relatively insignificant amount. If the
Appeals Court rejects or only partially accepts our arguments, the amount of damages, based upon the
Page 100 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
claims submitted and the application of pre-judgement interest at the Prime rate as ordered by the District Court, may lie in a range from a relatively insignificant amount to an amount up to or exceeding US$3.5bn.
Once a judgement is entered (such as the approximately
US$2.46bn partial final judgement entered on 17
October 2013), post-judgement interest accrues on the
judgement at a rate equal to the weekly average of the
1-year constant maturity treasury yield as published by
the Federal Reserve System. A provision has been
made based on management's best estimate of

In December 2008, Bernard L. Madoff ('Madoff') was arrested for running a Ponzi scheme and a trustee was appointed for the liquidation of his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC ('Madoff Securities'), an SEC-registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. Since his appointment, the trustee has been recovering assets and processing claims of Madoff Securities customers. Madoff subsequently pleaded guilty to various charges and is serving a 150 year
prison sentence. He has acknowledged, in essence, that while purporting to invest his customers' money in securities and, upon request, return their profits and principal, he in fact never invested in securities and used other customers' money to fulfil requests for the return of profits and principal. The relevant US authorities are continuing their investigations into his fraud, and have brought charges against others, including certain former employees and the former auditor of Madoff Securities. Madoff was sentenced in June 2009.

Various non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds incorporated outside the US whose assets were
invested with Madoff Securities. Based on information provided by Madoff Securities, as at 30 November 2008, the purported aggregate value of these funds was US$8.4bn, an amount that includes fictitious profits reported by Madoff. Based on information available to HSBC to date, we estimate that the funds' actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual withdrawals from Madoff Securities during the time that HSBC serviced the funds totalled approximately
US$4bn.

Plaintiffs (including funds, fund investors, and the Madoff Securities trustee) have commenced Madoff-related proceedings against numerous defendants in a
multitude of jurisdictions. Various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in suits in the US, Ireland, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions. Certain suits (which include US putative class actions) allege that the HSBC defendants knew or should have known of Madoff's fraud and breached various duties to the funds and fund investors.

In December 2011, claims against HSBC and other defendants by fund investors in three related putative class actions pending in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York were dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens. In September 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
the dismissal of the claims. The plaintiffs have requested
Page 101 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
a rehearing of their appeal, and that request remains pending.

In July and December 2013, settlements were reached in respect of the claim by Thema International Fund plc and AA (Alternative Advantage) Plc respectively against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited in the Irish High Court.

The Madoff Securities Trustee has commenced suits against various HSBC companies in the US Bankruptcy Court and in the English High Court. The US action (which also names certain funds, investment managers, and other entities and individuals) sought US$9bn in damages and additional recoveries from HSBC and the various co-defendants and alleged that HSBC aided and abetted Madoff's fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. In July 2011, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the trustee's various common
law claims on the grounds that the trustee lacks
standing to assert them, and that dismissal was affirmed
in a decision issued by the Second Circuit in June 2013.
On 9 October 2013, the Trustee filed a petition for writ of
certiorari to review the Second Circuit's decision with the
US Supreme Court. The HSBC defendants filed their
response to the petition for writ of certiorari on 16
December 2013. The Supreme Court has issued an
order inviting the US Solicitor General to file a brief in
the case expressing the views of the US government on
the petition. The Trustee's remaining US claims seek,
pursuant to US bankruptcy law, recovery of unspecified
amounts received by HSBC from funds invested with
Madoff, including amounts that HSBC received when it
redeemed units HSBC held in the various funds in
connection with financing transactions HSBC had
entered into with various clients, as well as fees earned
by HSBC for providing custodial, administration and
similar services to the funds. These claims remain
pending.

The trustee's English action seeks recovery of unspecified transfers of money from Madoff Securities to or through HSBC, on the ground that the HSBC defendants actually or constructively knew of Madoff's fraud. HSBC has not been served with the trustee's English action.

Between October 2009 and April 2012, Fairfield Sentry Limited, Fairfield Sigma Limited and Fairfield Lambda Limited ('Fairfield'), funds whose assets were directly or indirectly invested with Madoff Securities, commenced multiple suits in the British Virgin Islands ('BVI') and the US against numerous fund shareholders, including various HSBC companies that acted as nominees for clients of HSBC's private banking business and other clients who invested in the Fairfield funds. The Fairfield actions seek restitution of amounts paid to the
defendants in connection with share redemptions, on the ground that such payments were made by mistake, based on inflated values resulting from Madoff's fraud, and some actions also seek recovery of the share redemptions under BVI insolvency law. The actions in
the US are currently stayed in the Bankruptcy Court pending developments in related appellate litigation in the BVI.

There are many factors which may affect the range of possible outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of the various Madoff-related proceedings, including but
not limited to the circumstances of the fraud, the multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been
brought and the number of different plaintiffs and defendants in such proceedings. For these reasons, among others, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to estimate reliably the aggregate liabilities, or ranges of liabilities, that might arise as a result of all such claims but they could be significant. In any event, HSBC considers that it has good defences to these claims and will continue to defend them vigorously.
US mortgage-related investigations

In April 2011, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease and desist order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC') and HSBC Finance and HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ('HNAH') entered into a similar consent order with the Federal Reserve Board (together with the OCC, the 'Servicing Consent Orders') following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry residential mortgage foreclosure practices. These consent orders require prescribed actions to address the deficiencies noted in the joint examination and described in the consent orders. HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and HNAH continue to work with the
OCC and the Federal Reserve Board to align their processes with the requirements of the consent orders and are implementing operational changes as required. [
25-03-14 1709GMT ]

The Servicing Consent Orders required an independent review of foreclosures (the 'Independent Foreclosure Review') pending or completed between January 2009 and December 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. As required by the Servicing Consent Orders, an independent consultant was retained to conduct that review.

On 28 February 2013, HSBC Bank USA entered into an agreement with the OCC, and HSBC Finance and
HNAH entered into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board, (together the 'IFR Settlement Agreements'), pursuant to which the Independent Foreclosure Review has ceased and been replaced by a broader framework under which we and 12 other participating servicers will, in the aggregate, provide in excess of US$9.3bn in cash payments and other assistance to help eligible borrowers. Pursuant to the
IFR Settlement Agreements, HNAH has made a cash payment of US$96m into a fund used to make payments to borrowers that were in active foreclosure during 2009 and 2010, and in addition, will provide other assistance (e.g. loan modifications) to help eligible borrowers. Borrowers who receive compensation will not be
required to execute a release or waiver of rights and will not be precluded from pursuing litigation concerning foreclosure or other mortgage servicing practices. For participating servicers, including HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Finance, fulfilment of the terms of the IFR Settlement Agreements will satisfy the Independent Foreclosure Review requirements of the Servicing


Page 103 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Consent Orders, including the wind down of the
Independent Foreclosure Review.
The Servicing Consent Orders do not preclude
additional enforcement actions against HSBC Bank USA,
HSBC Finance or HNAH by bank regulatory,
governmental or law enforcement agencies, such as the
US Department of Justice ('DoJ') or State Attorneys
General, which could include the imposition of civil
money penalties and other sanctions relating to the
activities that are the subject of the Servicing Consent
Orders. Pursuant to the IFR Settlement Agreement with
the OCC, however, the OCC has agreed that it will not
assess civil money penalties or initiate any further
enforcement action with respect to past mortgage
servicing and foreclosure-related practices addressed in
the Servicing Consent Orders, provided the terms of the
IFR Settlement Agreement are fulfilled. The OCC's
agreement not to assess civil money penalties is further
conditioned on HNAH making payments or providing
borrower assistance pursuant to any agreement that
may be entered into with the DoJ in connection with the
servicing of residential mortgage loans within two years.
The Federal Reserve Board has agreed that any
assessment of civil money penalties by the Federal
Reserve Board will reflect a number of adjustments,
including amounts expended in consumer relief and
payments made pursuant to any agreement that may be
entered into with the DoJ in connection with the
servicing of residential mortgage loans. In addition, the
IFR Settlement Agreements do not preclude private
litigation concerning these practices.

Separate from the Servicing Consent Orders and the settlement related to the Independent Foreclosure Review discussed above, in February 2012 five of the largest US mortgage servicers (not including HSBC companies) reached a settlement with the DoJ, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and State Attorneys General of 49 states with respect to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices. Following this settlement, these government agencies initiated discussions with mortgage industry servicers. HNAH, HSBC Bank USA and HSBC Finance have had discussions with US bank regulators and other governmental agencies regarding a potential resolution, although the timing of any settlement is not currently known. HSBC has recognised a provision to reflect the estimated liability associated with a proposed settlement of this matter. Any such settlement, however, may not completely preclude other enforcement actions by state or federal agencies, regulators or law enforcement bodies related to foreclosure and other mortgage servicing practices, including, but not limited to matters relating to the securitisation of mortgages for investors. These practices have in the past resulted in private litigation and such a settlement would not preclude further private litigation concerning these practices.
US mortgage securitisation activity and litigation

HSBC Bank USA has been involved as a sponsor/seller of loans used to facilitate whole loan securitisations underwritten by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ('HSI'). During 2005-2007, HSBC Bank USA purchased and sold US$24bn of such loans to HSI which were

Page 104 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
subsequently securitised and sold by HSI to third parties. The outstanding principal balance on these
loans was approximately US$6.4bn and US$7.4bn at 31
December 2013 and 31 December 2012, respectively.

Participants in the US mortgage securitisation market that purchased and repackaged whole loans have been the subject of lawsuits and governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries, which have been directed at groups within the US mortgage market, such as servicers, originators, underwriters, trustees or sponsors of securitisations, and at particular participants within these groups. As the industry's residential mortgage foreclosure issues continue, HSBC Bank USA has taken title to an increasing number of foreclosed homes as trustee on behalf of various securitisation trusts. As nominal record owner of these properties, HSBC Bank USA has been sued by municipalities and tenants alleging various violations of law, including laws regarding property upkeep and tenants' rights. While HSBC believes and continues to maintain that the obligations at issue and the related liability are properly those of the servicer of each trust, HSBC continues to receive significant and adverse publicity in connection with these and similar matters, including foreclosures
that are serviced by others in the name of 'HSBC, as trustee'.

Various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in a number of actions in connection with residential mortgage-backed securities ('RMBS') offerings, which generally allege that the offering documents for securities issued by securitisation trusts contained material misstatements and omissions, including statements regarding the underwriting standards governing the underlying mortgage loans. These include an action filed in September 2011 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ('FHFA'), acting in its capacity as conservator for the Federal National Mortgage Association ('Fannie Mae') and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ('Freddie Mac') in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'District Court') against HSBC Bank USA, HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ('HNAH'), HSI and HSI Asset Securitization ('HASCO') and five former and current officers and directors of HASCO, seeking damages or rescission of mortgage-backed securities purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were either underwritten or sponsored by HSBC companies. The aggregate unpaid principal balance of the securities was approximately US$1.6bn at 31 December 2013.
This action, captioned Federal Housing Finance Agency, as Conservator for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation v. HSBC North America Holdings Inc., et al. (S.D.N.Y. No. CV 11-6189-LAK), is one of a series of similar actions filed against 17 financial institutions alleging violations of federal and state securities laws in connection with the sale of private-label RMBS purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, primarily from 2005 to 2008. These actions were transferred to a single judge, who directed the defendant in the first-filed matter, UBS, to file a motion to dismiss. In May 2012,
the District Court filed its decision denying the motion to dismiss FHFA's securities law claims and granting the motion to dismiss FHFA's negligent misrepresentation

Page 105 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
claims. The District Court's ruling formed the basis for rulings on the other matters, including the action filed against HSBC Bank USA and its affiliates. On 5 April
2013, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the District Court. In January 2013, the FHFA parties met with the Magistrate Judge to discuss how to structure mediation. Since that time, a number of the FHFA defendants have resolved their lawsuits.

Discovery in HSBC's case continues. Factual discovery closed in December 2013. Expertdiscovery is scheduled to continue through the end of July 2014, with the summary judgement motion scheduled to be fully briefed by the end of July 2014. These dates are subject to change by the court.

The timing and outcome of this matter is uncertain. It is possible that HSBC could be found liable to pay damages. Based upon the information currently available, it is possible that these damages could be as high as US$1.6bn.

HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Finance and Decision One Mortgage Company LLC (a subsidiary of HSBC Finance) have been named as defendants in a number of mortgage loan repurchase actions brought by trustees of securitisation trusts. These actions include (i) Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee of HASCO
2007-NC1 v. HSBC Bank USA; (ii) Deutsche Bank, as Trustee of MSAC 2007-HE6 v. Decision One and HSBC Finance Corp., and (iii) Deutsche Bank, as Trustee of HASCO 2007-HE2 v. Decision One, HSBC Finance and HSBC Bank USA. In the aggregate, these actions seek to have the HSBC defendants repurchase mortgage loans, or pay compensatory damages in lieu of repurchase, totalling at least US$1bn. On 13 January
2014 HSBC Bank USA filed a motion to dismiss the Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee of HASCO 2007-NC1 v. HSBC Bank USA matter. HSBC Finance was dismissed, on motion, as a defendant in Deutsche Bank, as Trustee of MSAC 2007-HE6 v. Decision One and HSBC Finance Corp., but the case remains pending against Decision One Mortgage Company LLC. One other mortgage loan repurchase action against [ 25-03-14 1709GMT ]

Decision One, Seagull Point LLC, individually and on behalf of the MSAC 2007-HE5 Trust v. Decision One Mortgage Company LLC, et al. was dismissed voluntarily in January 2014.

In December 2010 and February 2011, HSBC Bank USA received subpoenas from the SEC seeking production of documents and information relating to its involvement and the involvement of its affiliates in specified private-label RMBS transactions as an issuer, sponsor, underwriter, depositor, trustee, custodian or servicer. HSBC Bank USA has also had preliminary contacts with other government authorities exploring the role of trustees in private-label RMBS transactions. In February 2011, HSBC Bank USA also received a subpoena from the US Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York seeking production of documents and information relating to loss mitigation efforts with respect to residential mortgages in the State of New York. In January 2012, HSI was served with a Civil Investigative Demand from the Massachusetts State
Page 106 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Attorney General seeking documents, information and testimony related to the sale of RMBS to public and private customers in the State of Massachusetts from January 2005 to the present.

HSBC expects this level of focus will continue. As a result, HSBC companies may be subject to additional claims, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to its participation in the US mortgage securitisation market, either individually or as a member of a group.

The timing and outcome of the ultimate resolution of these matters, and the amount of any possible obligations, is highly uncertain.
Anti-money laundering and sanctions-related

In October 2010, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease and desist order with the OCC and the indirect parent of that company, HNAH, entered into a consent cease and desist order with the Federal Reserve Board (the 'Orders'). These Orders required improvements to establish an effective compliance risk management programme across HSBC's US
businesses, including various issues relating to US Bank Secrecy Act ('BSA') and anti-money laundering ('AML') compliance. Steps continue to be taken to address the requirements of the Orders to ensure compliance, and that effective policies and procedures are maintained.

In addition, in December 2012, HSBC Holdings, HNAH and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements with US and UK government agencies regarding past inadequate compliance with the BSA and AML and sanctions laws. Among those agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA entered into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DoJ, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia (the 'US DPA'), HSBC Holdings entered into a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the New York County
District Attorney (the 'DANY DPA'), and HSBC Holdings consented to a cease and desist order and HSBC Holdings and HNAH consented to a monetary penalty order with the Federal Reserve Board ('FRB'). In addition, HSBC Bank USA entered into a monetary penalty consent order with FinCEN and a separate monetary penalty order with the OCC. HSBC Holdings also entered into an agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control ('OFAC') regarding historical
transactions involving parties subject to OFAC sanctions and an undertaking with the UK Financial Services Authority, now a Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') Direction, to comply with certain forward-looking AML- and sanctions-related obligations.

Under these agreements, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA made payments totalling US$1,921m to US authorities and are continuing to comply with ongoing obligations. On 1 July 2013, the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York approved the US DPA and retained authority to oversee implementation of the same. Under the agreements with the DoJ, FCA, and
the FRB, an independent monitor (who is, for FCA purposes, a 'skilled person' under Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act) will evaluate and
Page 107 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
regularly assess the effectiveness of HSBC's AML and sanctions compliance function and HSBC's progress in implementing its remedial obligations under the agreements. The monitorship, which began on 22 July
2013, is proceeding as anticipated.

If HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank USA fulfil all of the requirements imposed by the US DPA, the DoJ charges against those entities will be dismissed at the end of the five-year period of that agreement. Similarly, if HSBC Holdings fulfils all of the requirements imposed by the DANY DPA, DANY's charges against it will be dismissed at the end of the two-year period of that agreement. The DoJ may prosecute HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank USA in relation to the matters which are the subject of the US DPA if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank USA breaches
the terms of the US DPA, and DANY may prosecute HSBC Holdings in relation to the matters which are subject of the DANY DPA if HSBC Holdings violates the terms of the DANY DPA.

HSBC Bank USA also entered into a separate consent order with the OCC requiring it to correct the circumstances and conditions as noted in the OCC's then most recent report of examination and imposing certain restrictions on HSBC Bank USA directly or indirectly acquiring control of, or holding an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, or commencing a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. HSBC Bank USA
also entered into a separate consent order with the OCC requiring it to adopt an enterprise wide compliance programme.

The settlement with US and UK authorities does not preclude private litigation relating to, among other things, HSBC's compliance with applicable AML, BSA and sanctions laws or other regulatory or law enforcement actions for AML/BSA or sanctions matters not covered by the various agreements.
US tax and broker-dealer investigations

HSBC continues to cooperate in ongoing investigations by the DoJ and the US Internal Revenue Service regarding whether certain HSBC companies and employees acted appropriately in relation to certain customers who had US tax reporting requirements. In connection with these investigations, HSBC Private Bank Suisse SA, with due regard for Swiss law, has produced records and other documents to the DoJ and
is cooperating with the investigation. In August 2013, the
DoJ informed HSBC Private Bank Suisse SA that it is
not eligible for the 'Program for Non-Prosecution
Agreements or Non-Target Letters for Swiss Banks'
since a formal investigation had been authorised. The
DoJ also requested additional information from HSBC
Private Bank Suisse SA and other Swiss banks
regarding the transfer of assets to and from US person
related accounts and employees who serviced those
accounts. It is preparing this data, in a manner
consistent with Swiss law.

Other HSBC companies are also cooperating with the relevant US authorities, including with respect to
US-based clients of an HSBC company in India.

Page 108 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In April 2011, HSBC Bank USA received a summons from the US Internal Revenue Service directing HSBC Bank USA to produce records with respect to US-based clients of an HSBC company in India. HSBC Bank USA has cooperated fully by providing responsive documents in its possession in the US to the US Internal Revenue Service.

Also in April 2011, HSBC Bank USA received a subpoena from the SEC directing HSBC Bank USA to produce records in the US related to, among other things, HSBC Private Bank Suisse SA's cross-border policies and procedures and adherence to US
broker-dealer and investment adviser rules and regulations when dealing with US resident clients. HSBC Bank USA continues to cooperate with the SEC. HSBC Private Bank Suisse SA has also produced records and other documents to the SEC and is cooperating with the SEC's investigation.

Based on the facts currently known in respect of each of these investigations, there is a high degree of
uncertainty as to the terms on which the ongoing investigations will be resolved and the timing of such resolution, including the amounts of  fines and/or penalties. As matters progress, it is possible that  fines and/or penalties could be significant.

London interbank offered rates, European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest and foreign exchange rate investigations and litigation

Various regulators and competition and enforcement authorities around the world including in the UK, the US, the EU, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea and elsewhere are conducting investigations and
reviews related to certain past submissions made by panel banks and the processes for making submissions in connection with the setting of London interbank offered rates ('Libor'), European interbank offered rates ('Euribor') and other benchmark interest and foreign exchange rates. As certain HSBC companies are
members of such panels, HSBC has been the subject of regulatory demands for information and is cooperating with those investigations and reviews.

On 14 June 2013, in conjunction with the completion of its review, the Monetary Authority of Singapore ('MAS') censured The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd ('HBAP') for deficiencies in governance, risk management, internal controls and surveillance systems in connection with its participation on the contributing panel with respect to certain foreign exchange spot benchmarks that are commonly used to settle non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts. At the same time, HBAP was directed to
adopt measures to address the identified deficiencies, to appoint a party to ensure the robustness of its remedial measures, and to maintain additional statutory reserves with the MAS at zero interest for a period of one year. HBAP was one of twenty banks subjected to supervisory action by the MAS as a result of its review. [ 25-03-14

On 4 December 2013, the European Commission ('Commission') announced that it had imposed fines on eight financial institutions under its  cartel settlement
Page 109 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
procedure for their participation in illegal activity related to Euro interest rate derivatives and/or yen interest rate derivatives. Although HSBC was not one of the financial institutions  fined, the Commission announced that it had opened proceedings against HSBC in connection with
its Euribor-related investigation of Euro interest rate derivatives only. This investigation will continue under the standard Commission  cartel procedure.

On 3 January 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau notified HSBC that it was discontinuing its investigation into alleged collusive conduct in the setting of Japanese yen Libor on the basis that the evidence collected was insufficient to justify prosecution under applicable law.

As for ongoing regulatory investigations, reviews and proceedings, based on the facts currently known in respect of each of these, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which the ongoing investigations, reviews or proceedings will be resolved and the timing of such resolutions, including the
amounts of  fines and/or penalties. As matters progress, it is possible that  fines and/or penalties could be significant.

The Financial Conduct Authority is also conducting investigations alongside several other law enforcement and/or regulatory agencies in various countries into a number of firms, including HSBC, related to trading on the foreign exchange market. We are cooperating with the investigations which are ongoing. It is not practicable at this stage for HSBC to estimate reliably any possible liability that might arise.

In addition, HSBC and other panel banks have been named as defendants in a number of private lawsuits filed in the US with respect to the setting of US dollar Libor. These lawsuits include individual and putative class actions, most of which have been transferred and/or consolidated for pre-trial purposes before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints in those actions assert claims against HSBC and other US dollar Libor panel banks under various US laws including US antitrust and racketeering laws, the US Commodity Exchange Act ('CEA'), and state law.

In March 2013, the US District Court Judge overseeing the consolidated proceeding that encompasses a number of pending actions related to US dollar Libor issued an opinion and order in the six oldest actions dismissing the plaintiffs' federal and state antitrust claims, racketeering claims, and unjust enrichment claims in their entirety, but allowing certain of their CEA claims that were not barred by the applicable statute of limitations to proceed. Some of those plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal opinion and order to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals has dismissed those appeals on the grounds that they are premature and plaintiffs' subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied. Other plaintiffs have filed amended complaints in the District Court to assert additional allegations, and the defendants have filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints. The District Court held oral argument on the motions to
dismiss in February 2014, and it has stayed proceedings with respect to all other actions in the consolidated

Page 110 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
proceeding pending its decision on the motions to dismiss.

Separately, HSBC and other panel banks have also been named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the US on behalf of persons and entities who transacted in euroyen futures and options contracts related to the euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate ('Tibor'). The complaint alleges, amongst other things, misconduct related to euroyen Tibor, although HSBC is not a member of the Japanese Bankers Association's euroyen Tibor panel, as well as Japanese yen Libor, in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA, and state law. In April 2013, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint which the defendants moved to dismiss in June 2013. Oral argument on the motion to dismiss is scheduled for March 2014.

In November 2013, HSBC and other panel banks were also named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the US on behalf of persons who transacted in futures contracts and other financial instruments related to Euribor. The complaint alleges, amongst other things, misconduct related to Euribor in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA, and state law. HSBC has not yet responded to the complaint and an amended complaint
is expected by the end of March 2014. HSBC expects to file a motion to dismiss thereafter.

In late 2013 and early 2014, HSBC and a number of other banks were named as defendants in various putative class actions filed in the US on behalf of persons who executed foreign currency trades that settled on the basis of foreign exchange rates published by WM/Reuters or that otherwise occurred during the time periods when the WM/Reuters rates were being
set. The complaints allege, amongst other things, that
the defendants conspired to manipulate the WM/Reuters
foreign exchange rates in violation of US antitrust laws.
In February 2014, the US District Court Judge appointed
interim lead class counsel and ordered the plaintiffs to
file a consolidated amended complaint. HSBC has not
yet responded, but intends to do so at the appropriate
time set by the court.

Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these private lawsuits, including the timing and potential impact on.
Credit default swap regulatory investigation and litigation

In July 2013, HSBC received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission relating to its ongoing investigation of alleged anti-competitive activity by a number of market participants in the credit derivatives market between 2006 and 2009. The Statement of Objections sets out the  European Commission's preliminary views and does not prejudge the final outcome of its investigation. HSBC has submitted a response to the  European Commission. Based on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of the  European             Commission's investigation, including the timing or impact on HSBC.


Page 111 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank have been named as defendants, among others, in numerous putative class actions filed in federal courts located in New York and Chicago. These class actions allege that the defendants, which include ISDA, Markit and several financial institutions, conspired to restrain trade in violation of the federal anti-trust laws by, among other things, restricting access to credit default swap pricing exchanges and blocking new entrants into the exchange market, with the purpose and effect of artificially inflating the bid/ask spread paid to buy and
sell credit default swaps in the US. The plaintiffs in these suits purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased credit default swaps from or sold credit
default swaps to defendants primarily in the US. On 16
October 2013, the Judicial Panel on Multi-district
Litigation ordered that all cases be consolidated in the
Southern District of New York as In re Credit Default
Swaps Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2476. On 5
December 2013, the District Court held its Initial Pretrial
Conference, at which time it selected Lead Interim Class
Counsel and set a schedule for the filing of an amended,
consolidated complaint and motions to dismiss that
complaint. The amended, consolidated complaint was
filed on 31 January 2014 and names HSBC Bank USA
and HSBC Bank, but not HSBC Holdings, as
defendants, among others. Based on the facts currently
known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to
predict the resolution of these lawsuits, including the
timing and potential impact on HSBC.
Economic plans: HSBC Bank Brasil S.A.

Economic plans were introduced in the mid 1980's and early 1990's by the government of Brazil to reduce escalating inflation. The implementation of certain of these plans adversely impacted savings account holders, thousands of which consequently commenced legal proceedings against financial institutions in Brazil, including HSBC Bank Brasil S.A. ('HSBC Brazil'), alleging, inter alia, that savings account balances were
adjusted by a different price index than that contractually agreed, which caused them a loss of income. Certain of these cases have reached the Brazilian Supreme Court ('Supreme Court'). The proceedings in the Supreme Court are currently due to commence in February 2014. The Supreme Court has suspended all cases pending before lower courts until it delivers a final judgement on the constitutionality of the changes resulting from the economic plans. It is anticipated that the outcome of the Supreme Court's final judgement will set a precedent for all cases pending before the lower courts. Separately,
the Brazilian Superior Civil Court ('Superior Civil Court') is considering matters relating to, among other things, contractual and punitive interest rates to be applied to calculate any loss of income.

There is a high degree of uncertainty as to the terms on which the proceedings in the Supreme Court and Superior Civil Court will be resolved and the timing of such resolution including the amount of losses HSBC Brazil may be

liable to pay in the event of an unfavourable judgement. Such losses may lie in a range from a relatively insignificant amount to an amount up to US$600m,

The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties.

Post-employment benefit plans

At 31 December 2013, US$5.2bn (2012: US$5bn) of HSBC post-employment benefit plan assets were under management by HSBC companies. Fees of US$23m (2012: US$20m) were earned by HSBC companies for these management services provided to its
post-employment benefit plans. HSBC's
post-employment benefit plans had placed deposits of
US$620m (2012: US$285m) with its banking
subsidiaries, on which interest payable to the schemes
amounted to US$1m (2012: US$2m). The above
outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of
business and on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and security, as for comparable
transactions with third-party counterparties.

HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC as part of the management of the inflation and interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. At 31 December 2013, the gross notional value of the
swaps was US$38bn (2012: US$31bn), the swaps had a positive fair value of US$2.8bn (2012: positive fair value of US$5.2bn) to the scheme and HSBC had delivered collateral of US$3.8bn (2012: US$7.1bn) to the scheme in respect of these swaps, on which HSBC earned US$33m of interest (2012: US$31m). All swaps were executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads. Previously there were special collateral provisions for the swap transactions between HSBC and the scheme. Those provisions stipulated that the scheme never posted collateral to HSBC, although HSBC posted collateral to the scheme. From December
2013, the swap transactions between HSBC and the scheme are now on substantially the same terms as for comparable transactions with third party counterparties, including the two-way posting of collateral.

The International Staff Retirement Benefit Scheme entered into swap transactions with HSBC to manage the inflation and interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities and selected assets. At 31 December 2013, the gross notional value of the swaps was US$1.8bn (2012:
US$1.8bn) and the swaps had a net positive fair value of US$399m to the scheme (2012: US$328m). All swaps were executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads.

HD      EU raids automobile exhaust companies amid cartel suspicions

Brussels (dpa) - European Union inspectors have raided companies in the  automobile sector amid suspicions over a cartel in exhaust systems, the bloc's executive said Tuesday.
The firms and their locations were not named by the  European Commission. It only spoke of
"companies active in the  automotive exhaust systems industry in several member states."

TD
The parts involved include everything from catalytic converters to mufflers and tubes, it said.

"The commission has concerns that the companies concerned may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position," the commission said in a statement.

But it added that Tuesday's unannounced inspections do "not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour."

There is no deadline for the commission to complete its probe. It can impose a  fine of up to 10 per cent of a company's annual worldwide turnover if EU laws have been breached.

The bloc has been cracking down on  cartels in the automobile industry. Earlier this month, the commission fined two European and four Japanese car parts manufacturers almost 1 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars) for illegally fixing prices for automotive bearings.

(Corrects the dollar value of Eberspaecher's 2012 sales in paragraph 8)
By Foo Yun Chee

TD
BRUSSELS, March 25 (Reuters) - EU competition regulators have raided several  car parts makers involved in producing vehicle exhaust systems, including French firm Faurecia , Germany's Eberspaecher Group and TenneCo of the United States, as part of a wider probe into suspected price fixing in the  auto industry.

Regulators in the United States, Japan, Europe and Canada have already levied multi-dollar  fines in recent years against various  car parts makers for fixing prices of various products including seatbelts, radiators, windscreen wipers and air conditioning systems.

The European Commission said on Tuesday the companies targeted in the latest investigation into the exhaust systems market may also have operated a  cartel and abused their dominance. It did not name the companies nor the countries where the raids took place, in line with its usual policy.

However, Faurecia, which is 52-percent owned by French  carmakerPeugeot Citroen, confirmed the raid.

"The European Commission antitrust authorities have launched investigations into suppliers of emission control systems," the company said. "Faurecia is cooperating fully with the European Union authorities."

Meanwhile TenneCo said the EU regulator raided its Edenkoben administrative facility in Germany and that it had also received a related subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice.
"The company is fully cooperating with the authorities," TenneCo said.

Eberspaecher, which is based in Esslingen, near Stuttgart, has around 7,300 employees and generated sales of more than 2.8 billion euros ($3.86 billion) in 2012, also confirmed the EU raids.
A spokesman for Belgian  car parts supplier Bosal said his company was not involved in the EU
investigation.

The Commission, which can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules, is investigating suspected cartels involving more than 100 vehicle components made by more than 70 companies.
Earlier this month it hit German engineering group Schaeffler, Sweden's SKF and three Japanese car
parts makers with a total 953.3 million-euro  fine for operating a  cartel for car and truck ball bearings.

HD      EU regulators raid Faurecia, Eberspächer, Tenneco in price-fixing probe

European Union (EU) regulators have raided several  automotive exhaust systems suppliers yesterday
(25 March), in relation to allegedly violating antitrust rules, reports Reuters.

TD
The European Commission said in a statement that it could confirm that "officials undertook unannounced inspections at the premises of companies active in the  automotive exhaust systems industry in several Member States." It added that it "has concerns that the companies concerned may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit  cartels and restrictive business practices and/or abuse of a dominant market position (Articles 101 and 102 respectively of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)." Faurecia, Eberspächer and Tenneco have all confirmed that they were included in the raids, with the latter stating that as well as the EU regulator raiding its Edenkoben (Germany) administrative facility it has also received a related subpoena from the US Department of Justice (DOJ).

Significance: The unannounced investigation is a preliminary step into suspected anti-competitive practices, although the commission added that raids do not mean that these suppliers are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour. Nevertheless, antitrust regulators in major  automotive markets such as
Japan, South Korea, Europe and the United States have stepped up investigations on price-fixing in  auto parts industry. Last week, the European Commission found six companies as being involved in fixing prices of automotive bearings,  and imposed a combined  fine of EUR953 million (USD1.32 billion) on
five suppliers while the sixth was let off without a  fine for blowing the whistle on the  cartel. In the United States, the DOJ has charged 23 companies and 26 executives. These companies and executives have agreed to pay a total of USD1.8 billion in  fines. As a part of plea agreement, some executives have even agreed to serve prison terms in the United States. Noting the growing issue, earlier this year EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that price-fixing among  auto suppliers had "attained an unbelievable magnitude, affecting virtually any part a  car was made of". He reiterated this last week, stating, "we will not stop here. We are still investigating suspected  cartels for airbags as well as lighting systems of cars, to mention a few examples."

Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) has announced the following:
NSK Ltd. Shelf Registration (Bonds): A-, Assigned (Preliminary)

TD
RATIONALE:

NSK Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of bearings.  The company has established a robust earnings base for products such as automotive bearings,  electric power steering and  automatic transmission components as well as industrial machinery bearings  and precision machinery and parts. The  automotive business, which is enjoying solid sales in North America and Asia, is driving the recovery of overall earnings. The industrial machinery business is gradually recovering, as shown by an upturn in sales of aftermarket products. NSK was imposed a fine of approximately 8.8 billion yen by the  European Commission in March 2014, for an alleged price cartel on bearings.  The impact on the rating, however, is limited. By continuously maintaining a certain level of free cash flow, the company will likely moderately improve the balance between debt and cash flow and the debt-equity structure.

The primary rating methodologies applied to this rating are provided at "Basic Methodologies for R&I's Credit Rating" and "Automobile Components". The methodologies are available at the web site listed below, together with other rating methodologies that are taken into consideration when assigning the rating. http://www.r-i.co.jp/eng/cfp/about/methodology/index.html

IN THE NEWS

European Commission imposes fines on participants in  automotive bearings cartel

TD
Click hereThe European Commission has imposed fines totalling over €953 million on participants in a cartel in the automotive bearings  sector. The Commission held that between April 2004 and July 2011, two European companies (SKF and Schaeffler) and four Japanese companies (JTEKT, NSK, NFC and NTN) secretly colluded to co-ordinate their pricing strategy in respect of  automotive customers throughout the EEA. JTEKT received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency policy, whilst each of the other companies engaged in the settlement procedure and accordingly benefitted from a 10% fine reduction, in addition to leniency reductions. .

General Court delivers judgment on Reagen's request for access to Commission documents in heat stabilisers cartel

Click hereThe General Court has delivered its judgment in respect of an action by Reagens seeking the annulment of the European Commission's decision to refuse it access to certain documents relating to the heat stabilisers cartel. As the addressee of the  cartel decision, Reagens requested, but was refused access to, certain documents relating to applications made by two other  cartel participants concerning their alleged inability to pay  fines. The Commission further refused to disclose to Reagens its own requests for further information and the undertakings' replies to those requests. The General Court did not consider that the non-confidential versions of the undertakings' initial inability to pay requests and the Commission's standard first request for further information were covered by the exception from disclosure relating to protection of commercial information. However, the Commission was entitled to conclude that the undertakings' responses to the first questionnaire, the second targeted and specific questionnaires sent by the Commission, and the undertakings' replies to those questionnaires were protected from disclosure. .

European Commission adopts revised competition regime for technology transfer agreements

Click hereThe European Commission has adopted a new technology transfer block exemption regulation (TTBER) and revised guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU to technology transfer agreements. The revised regulation does not make radical changes to the current rules, with the most significant changes having been made to restrictions excluded from the scope of the block exemption. Specifically, all exclusive grant-back obligations will now fall outside the block exemption, as will clauses allowing the licensor to terminate where a licensee challenges the validity of the licensed technology (unless the licence is exclusive). The new block exemption regulation will apply from 1 May 2014 until 30
April 2026. .

The CC has provisionally concluded that the collection of tangible and intangible assets acquired meets the legal definition of an "enterprise", in
that together they constitute the activities or part of the activities of a business. The CC accordingly considers that, in this case, two enterprises did cease to be distinct, therefore allowing the CC jurisdiction to review the merger. .
OFT

Click hereThe OFT has issued a decision finding that Hamsard (and its subsidiaries Quantum and Tomms Pharmacy), and Celesio AG (and its subsidiary, Lloyds), have infringed the Chapter I prohibition of the Competition Act 1998, by having entered into a market sharing agreement in relation to the supply of prescription medicines to  care homes in England, between May 2011 and November 2011. Following a settlement agreement in December, Hamsard agreed to pay a maximum  fine of £387,856. Hamsard was granted an additional reduction in fine because of further development of its competition compliance programme, reducing the final fine imposed to £370,226. Since Celesio/Lloyds brought the matter to the OFT's attention, it benefitted from full immunity from  fines under the OFT's leniency policy. .

Click hereThe OFT has decided to refer the completed acquisition by Alliance Medical Limited of manufacturing assets of IBA Molecular UK Limited (used to produce Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F (FDG-18)) to the CC under the Enterprise Act 2002. The OFT was concerned that in the south of England there is only one other supplier and the parties have high combined market shares, such that the merger could lead to an increase in the price of FDG-18 and a decline in the reliability of supplies. .

Click hereFollowing its market study, the OFT has found that competition could work better in the purchase and supply of ICT products and services to the public sector. The OFT considers that certain structural features of the market (particularly barriers to switching, entry and expansion) could give suppliers some market power, and recommends these concerns be addressed through the public sector improving the way it procures and manages contracts with suppliers, and through suppliers being more transparent with their public sector customers. .

Cartels: Just one more fix

Trustbusters have got better at detecting  cartels and bolder in punishing them. But incentives to fix prices remain strong

TD
THE International  Cartel Workshop might sound like a coaching session for would-be price-fixers. But the biennial event, run by the International Bar Association, is in fact an opportunity for lawyers to learn how their clients can avoid falling foul of the law, how to respond if they do and what is on the minds of the competition officials who attend. The latest get-together, held in Rome in February, featured a
three-day-long "hypothetical" in which delegates acted out a loosely scripted scenario featuring a fictional American camera-maker that discovers its sales team has been colluding with European and Japanese rivals, and tries to limit the damage by reporting the sin to the authorities.

Grey suits, wooden acting and hour-long scenes about document discovery are not everyone’s idea of gripping drama. But  cartel enforcement is a hot topic in boardrooms.  Fines and jail terms have shot up in recent years, greatly raising the costs of collusion. Big firms such as GE and Bosch have assembled teams of in-house lawyers that focus solely on the issue.

Even for the biggest companies, ensuring compliance is hard. On March 20th Brazil’s  cartel office announced a probe into 18 firms involved in the construction of train systems, including Siemens of Germany (which alerted authorities to the alleged conspiracy) and Alstom of France. The 15 rail contracts being investigated had a combined value of 9.4 billion reais ($4 billion);  fines could be for a similar amount. This week prosecutors charged 30 executives from a dozen of the companies.

Collusion comes in many forms: agreements to raise, freeze or even lower prices, to co-operate in tenders, not to compete in certain markets and so on. Price-fixing can be "horizontal" (among competitors in a particular product) or "vertical" (involving, say, a manufacturer and its dealers).

There is agreement on right and left (a few über-libertarians apart) that  cartels are bad. They impose higher prices on customers, reduce incentives to innovate and raise barriers to entry. One estimate suggests that overcharging costs consumers in poor countries around the same as those countries get in foreign aid. "It’s tempting to see it as victimless because each customer is hurt only a little," says Mark Whitacre. "But it’s bank robbery without the mask and gun." He should know. In 1992 he blew the whistle on a global conspiracy to fix the price of lysine, an animal-feed additive. His story inspired a 2009 film, "The Informant", starring Matt Damon.

Cartels have historically tended to form in industries with standardised products that inspire little customer loyalty, such as industrial components or road-building. Studies suggest that two-thirds of cartels are in industries in which the top four firms have 75% or more of the relevant market. Their median duration is five years, but some last decades.

In recent years, however, international conspiracies have been bust in fields as diverse as seat belts, seafood, air freight, computer monitors, lifts and even candle wax. A growing number of cases are in digital commerce, such as e-books, and in finance, most recently interest-rate and foreign-exchange benchmarks. The financial-market version of a smoke-filled room is the online chat room for traders.

Some of these  cartels have involved a dizzying number of alleged conspirators. According to court filings, representatives of 20 or more airlines met in airports, restaurants and other places to discuss the pricing of international air-cargo services. They were caught in 2006 and forced to pay penalties of more than $3 billion.

Cartels often form in response to tectonic shifts in the competitive landscape, such as falling trade barriers or the advent of disruptive technologies. Manufacturers and retailers react to such pressures by squeezing their suppliers. Squeeze too hard, though, and those suppliers might feel forced into an "existential response", says John Connor of Purdue University.

That appears to have happened in America in  car parts, the subject of the largest criminal investigation yet pursued by the antitrust unit of the Department of Justice (DoJ), according to Brent Snyder, who heads its criminal-enforcement efforts. Companies used code names, met in remote locations to fix the prices of starter motors, seat belts, radiators and more, and followed up with each other "to make sure the collusive agreements were being adhered to," the DoJ alleges. It began raiding the companies in
2010.

Twenty-six firms, many of them Japanese, have already pleaded guilty and agreed to $2 billion in  fines. Two dozen people have been charged. There is more pain to come: cases brought so far involve 30
parts, but trustbusters believe the prices of 100-150 may have been manipulated. Other cartel authorities are on the case, too. On March 19th, the European Commissionfined five makers of automotive ball bearings  €953m ($1.3 billion). Five days later the commission said it was investigating several car-parts makers suspected of fixing prices for exhaust systems.

The scale of the  car-parts case owes something to the structure of the industry. By approving just a few suppliers of each part, which erected barriers to entry and encouraged supplier concentration, the direct victims, carmakers,  may have created fertile conditions for  cartel activity. Some may have been ripped off by firms they part-owned. Toyota owns 22% of Denso, which allegedly swapped information with rivals on "requests for quotation" made by Toyota for heater panels.

Only in the past quarter-century has price-fixing been treated as worse than a misdemeanour. Before then, most companies "saw it as like going 5mph over the speed limit," says Roxann Henry of Morrison & Foerster, a law firm. Collusion has been illegal in America since passage of the Sherman Act in 1890.
But the nation’s enforcers started to get tough only when the brazenness of the lysine conspiracy became apparent in the 1990s (members were recorded joking with each other about the FBI infiltrating their meetings).

Since then, policing and penalties have grown harsher. The maximum corporate  fine in America has increased tenfold. The  European Commission can fine companies up to 10% of group turnover.  Fines levied on both sides of the Atlantic have jumped over the past decade (see chart). Europe’s national cartel offices are busier, too. This year Germany’s has  fined brewers €106m and sugar distributors
€280m.

America leads in putting price-fixers behind bars. The average jail term has risen, from eight months in the 1990s to more than two years. The DoJ uses Interpol red notices (arrest warrants) to put pressure on foreigners indicted in  cartel cases to submit to American jurisdiction. The  European Commission can only bring civil cases, but criminal penalties can be imposed in Ireland and Britain, where they are being strengthened. Authorities in large emerging markets are also getting tougher. In India, the worst that colluding firms needed to fear before 2009 was a cease-and-desist order. Now they face heavy  fines.
A cartel-busting cartel

With a growing share of  cartels being global in scope, competition authorities are doing more of what those they police are not supposed to do: sharing information and working in tandem. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission played an important role in the American-led investigation into  car parts. In the biggest cases, offenders can be hit with suits in a dozen countries.

Japan’s tougher stance matters because its companies have long had a lax attitude to collusion. A lawyer tells of a meeting last year with an executive at a Japanese manufacturer who claimed that collusion was a thing of the past; the lawyer’s next meeting at the firm was with a middle manager who said he had been taken to meet several competitors soon after being hired. Asian firms often treat employees convicted of price-fixing as "a soldier who took a bullet for the company", says Robert Lande of the University of Baltimore’s law school--though this is not solely an eastern habit. When Mr Lande looked to see what had become of dozens of price-fixers from various countries who had been jailed between 1995 and 2010, he found that roughly half had been rehired by their old employer or by another firm in the same industry.


Page 132 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Cartels are difficult to root out without help from insiders. To aid detection, the DoJ developed a leniency programme that provides incentives for companies to confess and snitch on rivals. This has become so successful that around 50 other countries have copied it. Most big cases today stem from such confessions.

Under the American programme, the firm that spills the beans can avoid  fines, and its employees are spared prison. The second and third through the door can secure lesser benefits, though no criminal immunity, if they provide useful information. Under a policy known as "amnesty plus", a co-operating firm that exposes a separate conspiracy can secure partial immunity in that investigation, too. Samsung, for instance, was the source for several probes into computer monitors and television tubes. Leniency schemes are designed to be "trees that grow more and more branches" as edgy companies, fearful that rivals will squeal first, reveal hidden sins, says Ms Henry.

The flip side of leniency is that authorities take a particularly hard line against firms that, when admitting to one conspiracy, do not confess to participation in others. In 2011 Bridgestone paid a fine for colluding over marine-hose prices. Because it failed to disclose that it was up to the same tricks in car parts, it had to pay an elevated  fine of $425m for the second transgression.

Some countries are employing eggheads to search for suspicious price patterns by "screening" markets. These statistical tests have proved most effective in markets with lots of data, such as financial benchmarks and derivatives, though they have also been useful in cement and fishing: they provided the first evidence of manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in 2008 and, last year, of foreign-exchange rates.

Not everyone is convinced by screening. The DoJ ditched it after concluding that it produced too many false positives. "Grand-jury subpoenas can rock companies," says Scott Hammond, a former DoJ
cartel-enforcement chief, now with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, another law firm. It is a mistake to unleash them based on tests that have falsely pointed to wrongdoing.

Rosa Abrantes-Metz of New York University’s Stern School of Business, whose number-crunching helped expose the LIBOR affair, thinks the Americans are too sceptical. She argues that market screening, like the medical sort, is useful as an indicator that prompts further investigation.

Price-fixers also have to worry about the growth of civil litigation, which almost always follows action by competition authorities, and in which  cartelists can face treble damages. Private suits in America generated awards and settlements of $33 billion--four times the level of official  fines--between 1990 and
2008.

Most suits are class actions brought by consumers or corporate customers, but large companies are increasingly opting out of these to bring their own cases, as Ford has done in  car parts. In all, 28
car-parts suits have been filed in American courts. Adding to the pain, state attorneys-general have become more forceful in asserting claims on behalf of government purchasers and state residents.

Class actions are less common but on the rise in Europe, with Britain, Germany and the Netherlands leading the way. In some countries impediments remain, for example rules that hamper document discovery. To remove these the  European Commission has proposed a directive that would harmonise laws and procedures.
The wages of sin

Despite more-severe punishments, cartels still form all the time. Messrs Connor and Lande think they know why. In a joint paper, "Cartels as Rational Business Strategy: Crime Pays", they argue that deterrence is still too weak. They studied 75  cartels and concluded that these could typically raise prices by 20%. That is double the estimate used by America’s Sentencing Commission when setting guidelines for fines and jail terms. Factor in the small chance of being detected, which the authors put at one in five, and American cartel sanctions are only 9-21% as large as they need to be to offer "optimal" deterrence.
A lawyer at the Rome conference recounted a recent meeting with an executive from a large cement group: "He said it’s hard to stop fixing prices when it’s still so worthwhile."

The authors suggest increasing not only sanctions but also the chances of detection by increasing enforcement budgets, which are tiny compared with the  fines levied: in 2012 the DoJ’s antitrust arm took in 16 times more than it cost to run. Presumably, the DoJ’s Mr Snyder would not turn down an increased appropriation, but he is less keen on quintupling penalties, which he fears would bankrupt companies
and thus crimp competition. "We want [cartelists] to feel adequate pain but we also want them to remain viable. We’re not in the business of reducing competition."

Despite evidence that penalties are still too small, defence lawyers complain that the authorities cause alleged cartelists unnecessary pain by applying antitrust laws extraterritorially. Each jurisdiction is meant
Page 133 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
to base its penalties on the amount of business affected in its territory. But when commerce crosses borders there is sometimes double-counting (known in the trade as "the bump"). Jurisdictions often
co-ordinate their actions but they do not have to take account of each other’s  fines, and do not always agree.

Some firms have fought back. After AU Optronics of Taiwan was indicted and  fined $500m by America for collusion in LCD panels, the company and two executives challenged their convictions, arguing that much of the alleged activity took place elsewhere. Last December a court ordered the executives to be released, pending appeal, suggesting that the panel of judges had doubts about the government’s case. However, the state is usually hard to beat once a case goes to trial: in 2003-12 it won 657 of the civil and criminal antitrust cases it brought before American courts; just 28 were lost or dismissed.

The outcome of private actions is more even. Many cases are dismissed for lack of evidence. Take the suit brought by grocers against America’s three big chocolate-makers, Hershey, Mars and Nestlé, alleging co-ordinated price increases in 2002-07. A judge recently sided with the defendants, stating that "their pricing decisions, while largely identical and effectively simultaneous, were nonetheless timed and orchestrated in such a way to achieve whatever momentary pricing advantage they could over their competitors."

Trials expose grey areas in  cartel law.Emails that reveal overt price-fixing make for a cut-and-dried case. But is it a conspiracy if a firm announces a price increase and soon afterwards rivals raise their prices to the same level? Has technology that allows rapid-fire price changes, such as the algorithms used in
online travel, blurred the meaning of "agreement" and made it difficult to distinguish announcements from discussions among rivals?

One problem is that competitive and collusive markets can look very similar. If firms are pricing at marginal cost, and costs (of commodity inputs, for instance) are bouncing around, then prices shift together in a perfectly competitive industry, just as they might in a  cartel. Competition authorities try to get around this problem by looking not only at pricing but at profitability too; profits in collusive environments are higher than those in competitive ones.

Trustbusters have worked hard to spell out where they consider the line between right and wrong to be, says Brady Dugan of Squire Sanders, another law firm. But their thinking is not uniform. The  European   Commission, for instance, often treats an exchange of information as collusion, even if there is no agreement to fix prices. The DoJ needs to see an agreement, though this does not have to be in writing.

These ambiguities mean it can be difficult for firms accused of collusion to decide whether to settle or fight. For  cartelists that have not yet been accused, the decision over whether to confess or sit tight can be a tough one, too. Confession is usually the best option if the company is sure it is the first in the  cartel to step forward and it senses a growing risk of detection. But for a firm that suspects others have already confessed, thus securing all the available immunity slots or penalty discounts, it might make sense to keep quiet, then litigate rather than capitulate when accused--particularly in jurisdictions where trustbusters wield civil penalties only.

The European Commission, for instance, has sometimes struggled to make its case, especially when much of the conduct took place on other continents. Of the 25 airlines it initially went after for fixing
air-freight prices, 13 that offered little or no co-operation avoided  fines. "Competition authorities want all our clients to believe that coming clean is always the best option," says an antitrust lawyer who represents large European companies. "But from the board’s perspective that’s sometimes simply irrational."

BRUSSELS—European Union antitrust authorities slapped  fines totaling €301.64 million ($416 million) on a group of cable makers and Goldman Sachs Group for fixing the prices of high-voltage power cables.

The European Commission, which acts as the central competition authority for the 28-member bloc, said the companies "shared markets and allocated customers between themselves on an almost
world-wide scale" for nearly a decade, starting in 1999.

TD
"These companies knew very well that what they were doing was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great secrecy," Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, said in a statement.

The power-cable cartel involved most of the biggest companies in the sector, including six European companies, three Japanese and two Korean, the commission said.

Goldman Sachs shared a €37.3 million  fine with Prysmian SpA, an Italian cable maker that the U.S. investment bank's private equity arm bought in 2005, but has since sold.

Mr. Almunia said the commission had evidence of Goldman's "direct involvement" in management decisions at Prysmian during the period in which the  cartel was operating.

"Goldman Sachs was adopting real management decisions orienting the management of this company" during the time of the  cartel, the commissioner said. He stressed that financial investors have a responsibility to look closely at the way their portfolio companies comply with EU law.
A spokeswoman for Goldman said the bank is considering appealing the commission's decision. "There is no suggestion that Goldman Sachs or its people had any knowledge or involvement in the
purported collusive behavior," the spokeswoman said.

Besides Prysmian, the  cartel's participants were ABB, Nexans, J-Power Systems, VISCAS, EXSYM, Brugg, NKT, Silec, LS Cable and Taihan.

Prysmian received the highest  fine at €104.6 million, part of which was shared with Goldman and part with its former owner Pirelli & C SpA. ABB wasn't  fined because it revealed the  cartel's existence to the commission.

High-voltage power cables are used to connect generators to a country's electricity grid, or to connect power grids in different countries.

Also on Wednesday, the commission said it had  fined producers of steel abrasives €30.7 million for operating a cartel.


Page 135 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fines come two weeks after the commission levied a combined €953 million in fines on five companies for a cartel in car and truck ball bearings,  the fourth-highest ever fines issued by the authority over a cartel, as part of a broader investigation into competition breaches in the  auto-parts market.

In its decision of 2 April 2014 in relation to the underground and submarine high voltage power cables cartel case, the European Commission (Commission) held the parent companies of the producers involved liable, on the basis that they had exercised decisive influence over the producers. One of the businesses found liable was Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian, which is one of the companies that allegedly participated in the  cartel. This case confirms that, in principle, the Commission does not view private equity funds differently to other businesses for the purpose of the application of the parental liability doctrine.

In its decision of 2 April 2014 in relation to the underground and submarine high voltage power cables cartel case (COMP/39610), the  European Commission (Commission) held the parent companies of the producers involved liable, on the basis that they had exercised decisive influence over the producers. The fines levied by the Commission in this case totalled €301.6 million. One of the businesses found liable was Goldman Sachs, the former owner of Prysmian, which is one of the companies that allegedly participated in the  cartel.

This case has important implications for private equity funds. It confirms that, in principle, the Commission does not view private equity funds differently to other businesses for the purpose of the application of the parental liability doctrine.
Parental Liability

Under the parental liability doctrine, the Commission can attribute liability to a parent company that exercises a "decisive influence" over a subsidiary entity. Decisive influence is presumed for a
wholly-owned subsidiary, and it is extremely difficult for parent companies to rebut the presumption in practice. Any economic, organisational or legal link between the parent and the entity would, in principle, be sufficient to meet the decisive influence test, which is why portfolio companies of private equity funds fall within its scope.

Parental liability may arise even after the disposal of a subsidiary or portfolio company. Goldman Sachs acquired Prysmian in 2005 through its private equity fund and completely divested it in 2010. The fact that Goldman Sachs' private equity fund no longer owned Prysmian did not prevent the Commission from
fining Goldman Sachs, as it was the entity ultimately exercising decisive influence over Prysmian at the time of the alleged infringements.

This is not the first time that the Commission has imposed  fines on private equity funds for alleged infringements by their portfolio companies. In 2009, the Commission  fined the German company SKW Stahl-Metallurgie (SKW) and its former parent companies, amongst which the investment company Arques Industries, for alleged participation in the calcium  carbide cartel from 2004 to 2007. During that period, SKW was owned by several parent companies and the Commission held each one liable for its
respective period of ownership. The Commission's decision was confirmed by the EU General Court in 23
January 2014.
Next Steps
In order to minimise potential risks, private equity firms should take the following steps:


Page 145 of 151 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Determine whether or not their due diligence processes are sufficient to cover potential antitrust law infringements by prospective subsidiaries.

Ensure that existing and prospective subsidiaries have in place tailored and effective antitrust compliance programmes and codes of ethics, and that these are rigorously implemented. Such programs and codes should, amongst other things, provide for the dismissal of employees and directors who fail or refuse to comply with antitrust rules. In Parker ITR and Parker-Hannifin v Commission T-146/09 (currently under appeal), the General Court dismissed Parker's argument that the conduct of its subsidiary's directors prevented Parker from exercising its control over the subsidiary. The General Court held that there was nothing to prevent Parker from dismissing the directors who deliberately ignored the group's code of
ethics which, amongst other things, prohibited its employees from taking part in collusive activities.

Consider the feasibility of contractual arrangements that provide for allocation of liability between infringers and parent companies, and/or indemnity. It is worth  bearing in mind, however, that such clauses might be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions.

Private equity funds are well advised to consider  carefully the potential implications of the conduct of their portfolio companies as they may be exposed to potential significant liabilities in case of antirust infringements. The fact that private equity funds are only involved in the high level strategy and commercial policy of their portfolio companies does not exclude them from liability under the parental liability doctrine.

15 Apr 2014 03:27 ET SKF Sees Demand Developing as 1Q Profits Rise
By Christina Zander

STOCKHOLM--The world's largest manufacturer of ball  bearings,  SKF AB (SKF-B.SK), said Tuesday it expects demand to develop as it reported a rise in first-quarter profit.
"Manufacturing will be higher year on year and slightly higher compared to the first quarter," Chief
Executive Tom Johnstone said in a statement.

Net income for the first quarter was 1.24 billion Swedish krona ($189.1 million) , up from SEK793 million for the year-earlier period.

SKF, a global supplier to the  automotive and energy sectors, said its sales performance was mixed, with its automotive business and industrial sales in Asia doing well.

The Gothenburg-based company, which generates about half of its sales in Europe and a quarter in Asia, said demand for its products and services in the second quarter is expected to be slightly higher for the Group, North America and Asia compared with the year-earlier period, while Europe is expected to
remain little changed, while it will decline slightly in Latin America. Its ball  bearings  are used to reduce rotational friction in parts in  cars, industrial machinery and turbines.

Sales in the first quarter totaled SEK16.73 billion--in line with analysts' forecasts-- but up from SEK15.15 billion for the year earlier. Operating profit rose to SEK2.02 billion, from SEK1.73 billion.

SKF also said it reached an agreement in the quarter with the  European Commission regarding its investigation into an  automotive-parts cartel and is within the amount taken as a provision in the fourth quarter last year. This will be paid in June and will affect cash flow in the second quarter. SKF will pay a fine of SEK2.8 billion.
Shares closed at SEK169.90 Monday.

HD     UPDATE - Brussels moves forward  with infringement procedures against Hungary (adds details) WC    233 words

Budapest, April 16 (MTI) - The  European Commission onWednesday said it has taken three infringement procedures against Hungary to the next level.

The procedures concern antitrust law for the farm sector, excise duties on spirits and trade of tobacco products.

TD
In each of the cases, the commission requested that Hungary take action in a "reasoned opinion", the second step of EU infringement procedures.

If the country fails to bring domestic legislation in line with EU law, the commission may decide to refer the cases to the European Court of Justice.

The commission asked Hungary to comply with rules that require  cartel members be fined, noting that the country had earlier adopted a law "which essentially prevents the Hungarian competition authority from sanctioning  cartels on agricultural products".

It asked Hungary to apply one, rather than two, excise duty rates on spirits, as required by an EU directive. It said one of the excise tax rates Hungary levies on spirits is "significantly higher than the other".

The commission also asked Hungary to amend legislation that restricts the sale of tobacco products after the introduction of new tax rates. At present, following a change in the VAT or excise tax rates, tobacco products with tax markings  bearing the old rate may not be sold by wholesalers or importers after a period of 15 days.

HD      SKF's Q1 net income rises 56% y/y to USD196 mil. BY       Ian Fletcher

SKF has announced a significant improvement in profitability during the first quarter on higher sales. For the three months ending 31 March, the company's sales revenues increased by 10.4% y/y to SEK16.7 billion (USD2.54 billion), led primarily by volume growth gaining by 6.2% y/y. Higher sales helped SKF to report a 36.8% y/y increase in operating profit to SEK2 billion, resulting in a corresponding improvement in operating margin from 9.8% to 12.1%. This was also boosted by a SEK150-million reversal of a provision it took before the outcome of a probe conducted by the European Commission related to being part of a  cartel in supplying ball bearings  to automakers, having been fined EUR315.1 million (USD435.2 million). Net income rose 55.9% y/y to SEK1.3 billion. The company's Automotive business reported a 7.7% y/y increase in sales to SEK4.5 billion, driven by 8% organic growth, but slightly outweighed by negative currency translations.

TD
This helped the segment to record 29% y/y growth in operating profit to SEK200 million. Tom Johnstone, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company said in a statement that, "Sales developed well in the first quarter compared to the low first quarter last year and were relatively unchanged compared to the fourth quarter... We continued to have a negative mix in our sales with a stronger development of our  automotive business and our industrial OEM sales in Asia. The possible pre-buy ahead of the price increase in the aftermarket in Europe and North America was not as anticipated."

Significance: SKF reported strong growth in sales and earnings in the first quarter driven by a robust performance by its  automotive business. It was also helped by gains in many markets, including Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and Middle East. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, SKF expects demand for its products in the second quarter of 2014 to be slightly higher in North America and Asia, relatively unchanged in Europe and slightly lower in Latin America. The company also expects demand for its  automotive business unit higher than second quarter of 2013. Johnstone added, "Going forward we expect demand to develop positively both sequentially and compared to the second quarter last year. Manufacturing will be higher year on year and slightly higher compared to the first quarter.”
