BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) - The European  Commission said it has fined 30 copper companies belonging to 12 groups a total of 314.7 mln eur for participating in a copper fittings cartel.

The groups implicated are Mueller Industries Inc, IMI, Delta, Frabo, Aalberts Industries, Viegener, Legris, Advanced Fluid Connections, Sanha Kaimer, Tomkins, Flowflex and Aquatis France.

TD
IMI was fined 48.3 mln eur, Delta 28.3 mln, Frabo 1.6 mln, Aalberts 100.8 mln, Viegner 54.3 mln, Legris
46.8 mln, Advanced Fluid Connections 18.1 mln, Sanha Kaimer 8.0 mln, Tomkins 5.3 mln, Flowflex 1.3
mln and Aquatis France 2. 0 mln.

Between 1988 and 2004, the groups fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information, said the EU executive.

Four of these groups, namely Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris had their  fines increased by 60 pct because they continued their illegal arrangements after the  commission's initial inspections.

Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50 pct for providing the  commission with misleading information.

Mueller -- initially  fined 10.5 mln eur -- eventually received full immunity as it was the first company to come forward with information about the  cartel.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out."

The product concerned is copper  fittings, including copper alloy  fittings (gunmetal, brass and other copper-based alloys). A  fitting connects tubes used to conduct water, air, gas, etc in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations.

There are various types of fittings known as end-feed, solder ring, compression, press and push-fit which were all covered by the cartel.
The fine of 314.7 mln eur is the fifth-largest imposed by EU regulators for a single  cartel. simon.zekaria@afxnews.com sz/cml

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - European markets at midday

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - Leading shares remained slightly higher at midday, with a scattering of upbeat broker recommendations and bid talk offsetting further weakness across commodity stocks, dealers said.

TD
By 12.10 pm, the FTSE 100 index was up 4.6 points at 5,836.4, although the broader indices were mixed.

FRANKFURT (XFN-ASIA) - Shares were higher in midday trade, as they shrugged off a slump in the ZEW economic expectations index yesterday with M&A speculation continuing to fuel the top gainers, dealers said.
At 1.21 pm, the Dax was up 39.28 points or 0.67 pct higher at 5,912.74.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - Share prices were broadly higher in midday trading, helped by fresh declines for oil prices and anticipation that the US Federal Reserve will indicate that it has no plans to raise interest rates further at its meeting later today, dealers said.
At 12.25 pm, the CAC-40 index was up 26.81 points or 0.5 pct at 5,142.80, on volume of 1.4 bln eur. AMSTERDAM (XFN-ASIA) - Shares were up in early afternoon trade as investors looked to US futures,
which indicated a higher opening on Wall Street, while Aalberts Industries fell after being  fined 100.8 mln
eur, dealers said.

At 12.53 pm, the AEX was up 2.52 points or 0.54 pct to 472.84, after opening at 470.45 and trading in a range of 470.04-473.00.

MADRID (XFN-ASIA) - Share prices were higher midday as firm US futures offset concerns ahead of today's FOMC rate decision, with main blue chips in demand, dealers said.

At 12.10 pm, the IBEX-35 index gained 65.0 points to 12,307.2, after trading in a range of 12,216-12,310, on turnover of 1.055 bln eur.

MILAN (XFN-ASIA) - Share prices were slightly higher at midday, with sentiment benefiting from decreasing crude oil prices, and cooperative banks higher in a rebound following recent weakness on easing merger speculation, dealers said.

At 12.43 pm, the OMX Helsinki 25 was 0.16 pct lower at 2,545.95 points and the OMX Helsinki was down

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - There has been no financial impact as yet from the coup in Thailand, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

"We are following the developments very closely and we certainly have not seen up to now any financial consequences," IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato told reporters at the close of the annual general assembly of the IMF and World Bank.

The Thai baht fell against the dollar as markets reacted nervously to news that Thailand's armed forces had seized power yesterday from Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a late-night bloodless coup.

Thailand's financial markets were closed today following the announcement of the coup and the imposition of martial law. They are expected to reopen tomorrow.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co) unit Airbus will probably reduce the number of planned 2007 deliveries of its super-jumbo A380 passenger jet, resulting in additional delays for most buyers, sources close to the company told Agence France-Presse.

One source said planned A380 deliveries next year could be halved, due to difficulties in adapting the plane's electrical cabling to the varied specifications being required by clients.

BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) - The European  Commission said it has fined 30 copper companies belonging to 12 groups a total of 314.7 mln eur for participating in a copper fittings cartel.

The groups implicated are Mueller Industries Inc, IMI, Delta, Frabo, Aalberts Industries, Viegener, Legris, Advanced Fluid Connections, Sanha Kaimer, Tomkins, Flowflex and Aquatis France.

BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) - The European  Commission said the UK is only "just on track" to get its deficit in line with EU fiscal rules this year, but warned that its efforts are "vulnerable to negative surprises".
Commenting on the UK's action since member states recommended in January that it take steps by July
24 to comply with the stability and growth pact's deficit limit of 3 pct of GDP, the  commission said no
further disciplinary measures are required.

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - The UK government's public finances worsened by more than expected in August as government spending exceeded receipts, with borrowing at its highest ever level recorded for the month, official figures showed.

The office for National Statistics revealed that public sector net borrowing, the government's preferred measure of the public finances, stood at 7.6 bln stg in August, compared with 5.5 bln stg in the same month last year.

MOSCOW (XFN-ASIA) - Aeroflot will buy 22 Boeing planes and 22 Airbus planes over the next 10 years, the company's chief executive Valery Okulov said.

"We intend to buy both Boeings and Airbuses: 22 Boeing planes" from 2010 to 2012 and 22 Airbuses from 2012 to 2016, the Interfax agency quoted Okulov as saying.
Aeroflot had been weighing the purchase of an estimated 3 bln eur of passenger jets from either EADS
unit Airbus or Boeing.
MADRID (XFN-ASIA) - Industria de Diseno Textil SA CEO Pablo Isla said the company maintains its
target for a "stable" gross margin in the full-year to Jan 2007, after reporting a 54.9 pct gross margin in the
first half to July.
In June, the group reiterated its gross margin target of 56.2 pct for the full-year.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - Arcelor-Mittal said it has implemented emergency planning procedures at its other mines following an explosion and fire at a Kazakhstan coal mine that killed 18 people and left another 25 missing.

A spokesman could not immediately clarify if the procedures referred to safety-related actions or stepped-up production to compensate for any lost coal output.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - French Finance Minister Thierry Breton predicted the parliamentary bill to authorise the merger of Gaz de France and Suez will pass with a crushing majority.

He made the comment on France Inter radio, where he also said the risks are "very limited" that there would be a public offer to acquire Gaz de France after its privatisation -- referring to the entity generated by the planned merger with Suez --, noting that the state would still have a blocking minority of shares.

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - The International Monetary Fund has restored some of its credibility with a sweeping reform plan but the organization still faces questions over its relevance in a rapidly shifting economic landscape, analysts said.

"Globalization of finance, and the fact that Asian countries hold most of the world's (forex) reserves, have lessened reliance on IMF resources by creditworthy countries," said Professor Mukul Asher at the National University of Singapore.

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - Mortgage lending in the UK set a new all-time record August despite the unexpected rise in borrowing costs during the month, the Council of Mortgage Lending said.

Gross mortgage lending reached 32.7 bln stg in August -- the highest ever for the month and the highest ever on record. The previous all time high was set in June, at 32.4 bln stg.

Sep 20, 2006 (DJCS via Comtex) --

The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.

TD
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988.

Hand-written notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated customers, and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission said in a
statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million  fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts Industries
NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Sep 20, 2006 (DJCS via Comtex) --

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

TD
Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine.
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the  commission
misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the  commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

HD     EC fines 30 companies Eur315 million over copper fittings cartel

The European Commission has fined 30 companies a total of Eur314.7 million ($398.7 million) for participating in a copper fittings cartel, the EC said Wednesday.

The 11 groups to which these companies belong are: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

TD
Between 1988 and 2004, the companies "fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the EC said in a statement.

Four of these groups--Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris--had their  fines increased by 60% because they continued their illegal arrangements after the  Commission's initial inspections, while Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50% for providing the  Commission with misleading information, the EC said.

US-based Mueller received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency program, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, it added.

"We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out. We will not only punish firms severely for cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the statement.

The total  fines imposed in this case make it the fifth-largest set of  fines ever imposed on a single cartel, the EC said..

The product concerned is copper  fittings, including copper alloy  fittings (such as gunmetal, brass and other copper-based alloys), the EC said, adding that a  fitting connects tubes used to conduct water, air, gas, etc. in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations.

There are various types of fittings known as end-feed, solder ring, compression, press and push-fit which were all covered by the cartel, with the result that business and retail consumers were paying higher prices, it noted.

"As far back as 1988, hand-written notes reveal that the UK competitors increased prices based on a specific coded figure for each company," the EC said, adding: "The competitors agreed to implement the price increase 'following the same procedure as last time.'"

In 1991, several hand-written notes record the new price lists the competitors had agreed on for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, UK, Portugal and Sweden, and indicated the planned order in which those price hikes would be implemented, it said.
On 26 January 2001, competitors met in Paris to discuss the state of play of price increases,
country-by-country and company-by-company, the EC continued, adding: "Hand-written notes show that
the price increase that the competitors planned together had been achieved in France, was still ongoing in
Germany and was delayed in Spain. The competitors also discussed a new price structure and price level

for the UK. Finally, the companies took care to explain that the collusive meetings would continue despite the fact that Delta (now Advanced Fluid Connections) was to be sold to another company."

IMI may appeal a  fine of Eur48.3 million ($61.2 million) imposed by the European  Commission in relation to its former copper  fittings business, the UK-based engineering group said Wednesday.

The EC said earlier Wednesday it had  fined 30 companies a total of Eur314.7 million for participating in a copper fittings cartel. IMI "will assess the possibility of appeal following receipt of details of the decision," the company said in a statement.

IMI sold its copper  fittings business in 2002, the company noted.

HD      EC fines 30 companies Eur315 million over copper fittings cartel

The European Commission has fined 30 companies a total of Eur314.7 million ($398.7 million) for participating in a copper fittings cartel, the EC said Wednesday.

The 11 groups to which these companies belong are: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

TD
Between 1988 and 2004, the companies "fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the EC said in a statement.

Four of these groups--Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris--had their  fines increased by 60% because they continued their illegal arrangements after the  Commission's initial inspections, while Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50% for providing the  Commission with misleading information, the EC said.

US-based Mueller received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency program, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, it added.

"We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out. We will not only punish firms severely for cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the statement.

The total  fines imposed in this case make it the fifth-largest set of  fines ever imposed on a single cartel, the EC said..

The product concerned is copper  fittings, including copper alloy  fittings (such as gunmetal, brass and other copper-based alloys), the EC said, adding that a  fitting connects tubes used to conduct water, air, gas, etc. in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations.

There are various types of fittings known as end-feed, solder ring, compression, press and push-fit which were all covered by the cartel, with the result that business and retail consumers were paying higher prices, it noted.

"As far back as 1988, hand-written notes reveal that the UK competitors increased prices based on a specific coded figure for each company," the EC said, adding: "The competitors agreed to implement the price increase 'following the same procedure as last time.'"

In 1991, several hand-written notes record the new price lists the competitors had agreed on for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, UK, Portugal and Sweden, and indicated the planned order in which those price hikes would be implemented, it said.
On 26 January 2001, competitors met in Paris to discuss the state of play of price increases,
country-by-country and company-by-company, the EC continued, adding: "Hand-written notes show that
the price increase that the competitors planned together had been achieved in France, was still ongoing
in Germany and was delayed in Spain. The competitors also discussed a new price structure and price

level for the UK. Finally, the companies took care to explain that the collusive meetings would continue despite the fact that Delta (now Advanced Fluid Connections) was to be sold to another company."
In 2004, the EC  fined a group of companies a total of Eur222.3 million for operating a  cartel in the
European market for water, heating and gas tubes for a period of up to 12 years.

HD     EU fines companies in copper fittings cartel €314.7 million

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday  fined 30 companies €314.7 million (US$399.4 million) for taking part in a copper  fittings cartel -- its fifth largest ever such  fine.

The companies belong to 11 groups, it said: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

TD
"Between 1988 and 2004, the companies fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the European  Commission said.

Copper fittings connect tubes used to carry water, air or gas in plumbing or heating systems. The Commission said the cartel covered various types of  fittings -- including brass and other alloys -- which meant businesses and retail customers were paying higher prices.
The Netherlands' Aalberts received the largest  fine of €100.8 million (US$127.6 million).

Germany's Viegener must pay the second-largest  fine at €54.29 million (US$68.7 million), followed by Britain's IMI at €48.3 million (US$61.1 million) and France's Legris/Comap at €46.8 million (US$59.2 million).

U.S.-based Mueller received full immunity from fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel in 2001, escaping a potential €10.4 million (US$13.2 million) fine.

The EU said it had increased the original fine for Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris by 60 percent, saying they had kept the cartel going even after officials had started the probe.

And it also increased Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine by 50 percent to €18.08 million (US$22.88 million), saying it had given investigators misleading information.

Italy's Frabo and British companies IMI PLC and Delta also got their  fines reduced for answering an EU plea for information. Delta must now pay €28.3 million (US$35.8 million) and Frabo €1.6 million (US$2 million).

Delta said it would be able to pay the  fine within the next three months from its existing cash resources but had made no provision before now as it did not know how much the  fine would be.

There were no reductions for Germany-based Sanha Kaimer, which was ordered to pay €7.97 million (US$10.1 million), or for Britain's Tomkins/Pegler --  fined €5.3 million (US$6.6 million). Aquatis France and Simplex Armaturen was also  fined €2 million (US$2.6 million) and British firm Flowflex €1.3 million (US$1.7 million).

EU officials said they uncovered some 80,000 documents detailing the  cartel which ran for 13 1/2 years, including hand-written notes between British rivals agreeing how each would increase prices in 1988,
more notes detailing how prices would go up across Europe in 1991 and notes from a 2001 Paris meeting to discuss the state of play.
"These practices are a very serious infringement of EC Treaty rules," the  Commission said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday  fined 30 companies a total of
EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

TD
The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European  Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated
customers, and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission
said in a statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts
Industries NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company said it has "not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the
commission misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.



Page 19 of 101 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.

"We haven't participated in any  price-fixing or anti-competitive behavior, said Bernd Kaimer, Sanha Kaimer's executive manager.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated customers,
and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission said in a
statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million  fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts Industries
NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company said it has "not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the  commission
misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.

"We haven't participated in any  price-fixing or anti-competitive behavior, said Bernd Kaimer, Sanha
Kaimer's executive manager.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the  commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

Dutch metalworking and industrial service company Aalberts Industries NV has been imposed a 100.8 mln euro ($127.8 mln)  fine by the European  Commission (EC) for forming copper  fittings cartel, the EC said on September 20, 2006.

A total 30 companies were  fined for some 314.7 mln euro ($399 mln) for  cartel forming in the period between 1988 and 2004.

TD
According to the EC, the companies, including Aalberts, German Viegener, U.S.-based Mueller, UK IMI, Delta, Tomkins/Pegler and Flowflex, Advanced Fluid Connections, French Legris, Italian Frabo, and Germany-based Sanha Kaimer, made price and discount agreements, swapped customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information in the reported period.

Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris said their  fines were increased 60 pct as their illegal practices continued after the first inspections of the EU competition authorities.

For the time being Aalberts (  www.aalberts.nl ) refused to comment on the issue. The size of the  fine, however, exceeds the company's net profit for 2005 of 83.1 mln euro ($105.4 mln). For the first half of
2006, Aalberts reported a net profit of 51 mln euro ($64.7 mln).

Dutch metalworking and industrial service company Aalberts Industries NV said on September 20,
2006 it would appeal the 100.8 mln euro ($127.8 mln)  fine imposed by the European  Commission
(EC) for forming copper  fittings cartel.

The Dutch company, however, believes it has not violated any competition rules.

The imposed fine also relates to Aalberts' subsidiaries in Germany and France, in which companies that were acquired from third parties were integrated. It is not clear if the  fine relates to the period before these companies were acquired by Aalberts (  www.aalberts.nl ), the company said.

A total 30 companies, including German Viegener, U.S.-based Mueller, UK IMI, Delta, Tomkins/Pegler and Flowflex, Advanced Fluid Connections, French Legris, Italian Frabo, and Germany-based Sanha Kaimerwere, were  fined for some 314.7 mln euro ($399.1 mln) for  cartel forming in the period between

HD         Copper fittings producers fined by EU for price-fixing

BRUSSELS, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Thirty companies have been  fined a total of 314.7 million euros (400 million U.S. dollars) by the European  Commission for participating in a copper  fittings cartel, said the commission on Wednesday.
The total  fines are the fifth largest set of  fines ever imposed on a single cartel.

TD
The companies belong to 11 groups: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

Between 1988 and 2004, the companies fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and
confidential information, said the  commission.

Four of these groups -- Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris -- had their fines increased by 60 percent because they continued their illegal arrangements after the commission's initial inspections.
Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50 percent for providing the  commission
with misleading information.

Mueller received full immunity from  fines under the commission' s leniency program, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, the commission said.
"We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out," said EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information."
The product concerned is copper  fittings, including copper alloy  fittings.

A fitting connects tubes used to conduct, among others, water, air, gas in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations.

Apart from the  fines, the companies also face damages sought by consumers affected -- individual citizens or firms.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday  fined 30 companies a total of
EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

TD
The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European  Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated
customers, and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission
said in a statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts
Industries NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company that "the company has itself not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the
commission misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

Aalberts is part of a larger group of companies that were  fined for a total of EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

(Updates 0955 GMT story with company reaction.)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday  fined 30 companies a total of
EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

TD
The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated customers,
and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission said in a
statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million  fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts Industries
NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company that "the company has itself not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the  commission
misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the  commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

HD        EU fines copper fittings cartel €314.7m

The European Commission has fined 30 copper companies a total of €314.7 million ($399 million) for participating in a copper fittings cartel over a period of 16 years.
The eleven groups these companies belong to include Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid
Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

TD
Between 1988 and 2004, the implicated companies allegedly fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to co-ordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information, the  commission said.
IMI was fined €48.3 million, Delta €28.3 million, Frabo €1.6 million, Aalberts €100.8 million, Viegener
€54.3 million, Legris €46.8 million, Advanced Fluid Connections €18.1 million, Sanha Kaimer €8 million,
Tomkins €5.3 million, Flowflex €1.3 million and Aquatis France €2 million.

"We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information."

Four of the groups, Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris, saw their  fines increase by 60 percent from the initial estimations by the EU because they reportedly continued their illegal arrangements after the first inspections.
Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50 percent for providing the  commission
with misleading information.

Mueller, though, which was initially  fined €10.5 million, received full immunity from  fines under the commission's leniency programme, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, the commission said.

Some of the evidence is based on hand-written notes, which record price lists the competitors had agreed on for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, UK, Portugal and Sweden.

The total amount of the  fines imposed in this case makes it the fifth largest set of  fines ever imposed on a single cartel.

The commission called for parties affected by anti-competitive behaviour to step forward and seek damages.
Copper fittings are used in tubes for plumbing, heating and sanitation.

IMI may appeal against the  fine of just under €50 million ($63 million) imposed by the European
Commission for the company's participation in a copper  fittings cartel.

"The European Commission has today announced the imposition of a  fine of €48.3 million on IMI in relation to its former copper fittings business, which was sold in 2002. IMI will assess the possibility of appeal following receipt of details of the decision," said a spokesman for the London-listed engineering and industrial company.

TD
The spokesman could not say when a decision about an appeal will be made, but said it might take a few weeks to receive the details of the EU's decision on the  cartel, which fixed prices for 16 years.
The commission has fined 30 copper companies a total of €314.7 million for participating in a copper
fittings cartel.

agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially
important and confidential information, the  commission said.

As well as the  fine on IMI, Delta was  fined €28.3 million, Frabo €1.6 million, Aalberts €100.8 million, Viegener €54.3 million, Legris €46.8 million, Advanced Fluid Connections €18.1 million, Sanha Kaimer
€8 million, Tomkins €5.3 million, Flowflex €1.3 million and Aquatis France €2 million.

European Union regulators Wednesday  fined 30 companies a total of EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated customers,
and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission said in a
statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million  fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts Industries
NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company that "the company has itself not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the  commission
misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the  commission's penalties.

EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

(Adds Aalberts, IMI, Delta reaction, updates shares)

BRUSSELS, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Europe's top antitrust authority slapped a 314.7 million euro ($398.4 million) fine on 30 companies for taking part in a copper  fittings cartel, the fifth-biggest penalty ever imposed by EU competition watchdogs.

TD
Aalberts of the Netherlands received about a third of the total penalty, which was announced on Wednesday. The company was  fined 100.8 million euros -- almost double its first-half net profit of 51 million euros.

Shares in Aalberts sank 8 percent to 57.75 euros in Amsterdam. It said it did not plan to take a provision for the fine as it was investigating whether to appeal.

The 30 companies belong to the groups IMI , Delta , Advanced Fluid Connections , Legris, Frabo, Mueller , Tomkins , Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer as well as Aalberts, the European Commission said.

Britain's IMI and Delta were  fined 48.3 million euros and 28.3 million respectively. Germany's Viegener was fined 54.3 million euros and Legris of France 46.8 million.
Shares in Tomkins were down 1.2 percent at 238 pence after hitting their lowest for the year. IMI and
Delta were flat.

The Commission said in a statement its investigation had found that companies had met in Paris to discuss prices and had uncovered scribbled notes by British competitors signalling price rises using a specific code for each company.

The cartel took place between 1988 and 2004, with price lists agreed for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Britain, Portugal and Sweden.

Some of the companies had continued with the cartel or had given misleading information to Brussels after it began probing the industry, resulting in their fines being increased, the  Commission said.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Copper fittings are used in tubes for plumbing, heating and sanitation and their prices were higher because of the cartel.
Mueller had its fine waived for blowing the whistle on the scheme.

The EU executive increased the  fines for Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris by 60 percent because they had continued their illegal arrangements after the  Commission's initial inspections.

Page 55 of 101 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fine for Advanced Fluid Connections was raised by a further 50 percent for providing misleading information, the  Commission said.

IMI owned Aquatis France and Simplex Armaturen, which were  fined a total of 2 million euros, during part of the  cartel period, but sold them in 2002. The British engineering firm said it may appeal against its fine.

Delta said the  fine was payable within three months and could be met from its cash resources, though the group might appeal.

The move came just a week after the  Commission fined 14 companies a total of 266.7 million euros, including a 108 million euro penalty for Shell , for fixing prices of road surface material bitumen in the Netherlands.

LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - British engineer IMI Plc said on Wednesday it had been  fined 48.3 million euros ($61 million) by the European  Commission in relation to the company's former copper fittings business which was sold in 2002.

TD
"IMI will assess the possibility of appeal following receipt of details of the decision," it said in a statement.

Earlier, the European  Commission said it had imposed a 314.7 million euros  fine, its fifth-biggest ever penalty, on 30 companies for taking part in a copper  fittings cartel.

Some of the companies had continued with the cartel or gave misleading information to the EU after it began probing the industry, resulting in their fines being increased, the  Commission said. Aalberts of the Netherlands received the largest  fine, 100.8 million euros.
At 1125 GMT, IMI shares were up 0.6 percent at 492.5 pence.

(Adds details from company statement)

AMSTERDAM, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Dutch industrial group Aalberts Industries does not currently plan to take a provision for a 100.8-million-euro ($127.8 million)  fine imposed by the European Union's
anti-trust authorities, the firm said.

TD
Shares in Aalberts dropped as much as 12.6 percent on Wednesday after the EU  fined 30 companies for taking part in a copper  fittings cartel, with Aalberts receiving the biggest  fine.

"It is not clear what the impact of the  fine will be on earnings since the information we received is very fresh. At the moment we will not take a provision," an Aalberts spokesman said.

"Aalberts Industries considers that the company has itself not acted in breach of competition laws," the company said in a statement, adding it would appeal against the EU decision.

"The fines that were imposed on Aalberts Industries relate to subsidiaries in Germany and France in which companies that were acquired from third parties were integrated. It is unclear whether the  fines relate to the period before these companies were acquired by Aalberts Industries," the company said in a statement.

Aalberts said the purchase agreements for the companies limited its liability with regards to competition violations that occured before the acquisitions.

"Aalberts Industries will also consult with the sellers on the steps to be taken further to the  fine imposed by the Commission."
Aalberts shares were down 7.3 percent at 58.10 euros by 1314 GMT.

(Updates 1402 GMT story with more company reaction)
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union regulators Wednesday  fined 30 companies a total of
EUR314.8 million for fixing prices for copper-pipe  fittings.

TD
The fines were levied after U.S.-based Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European Commission. Because it was the whistleblower, Mueller was given immunity and what would have been a EUR10.5 million  fine was erased.
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed that the companies involved coordinated price hikes, allocated customers,
and shared key commercial information in several E.U. countries, the  commission said in a
statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR314.8 million  fine ranks as the fifth-most severe penalty the regulator has imposed.
The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, the Netherland's Aalberts Industries
NV (33134.AE) received the highest  fine, of EUR100.8 million.

Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice. In a statement, the company said it has "not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either refused to comment or said they were also considering appeals.
Germany's Franz Viegener II GmbH & Co. KG was  fined EUR54.3 million.
The U.K.'s IMI PLC (IMI.LN) received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the
commission's investigation and was  fined EUR48.3 million.

Aalberts and three other companies - the U.K.'s Delta PLC (DLTA.LN) and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC (AFC.LN), and France's Legris - received 60% increases to their penalties because they continued to fix prices after the  commission started its investigation.

Delta was fined EUR28.3 million, Advanced Fluid Connections was  fined EUR18 million, and Legris received a EUR46.8 million  fine. Delta said that it was considering appealing. No provision had been made for the  fine, but the company insisted this amount could be met from "existing available cash resources."
Advanced Fluid Connection was hit with a further 50% rise in its penalty for giving the  commission
misleading information.

"We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behavior, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing (to fix prices)," Kroes said in a statement.

The other  fined companies included Germany's Sanha Kaimer GmbH & Co. KG, which was  fined EUR8 million, and the U.K.'s Tomkins PLC (TKS), which was  fined EUR5.3 million. Several smaller, privately held companies received  fines of between EUR1.3 million and EUR2 million.
Page 59 of 101 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We haven't participated in any  price-fixing or anti-competitive behavior, said Bernd Kaimer, Sanha
Kaimer's executive manager.

The companies can contest their  fines at an E.U. appeals court in Luxembourg. This process can take several years, but in some previous cases, judges have reduced or overturned the  commission's penalties.

In 2001, eight vitamin makers were  fined a total of EUR855.2 million, the  commission's largest-ever penalty.
Earlier this year, judges reduced BASF AG's (BF) share of that  fine to EUR236.8 million from
EUR296.2 million, saying the  commission had failed to prove that the company led the  cartel.

Aalberts Industries "does not agree" with the results of a European  Commission investigation which
saw the company fined Eur100.8 million ($127.8 million) for participation in an alleged copper fittings  
price fixing  cartel, and plans to appeal the decision, the Dutch industrial group said Wednesday.

The EC said earlier Wednesday it had fined 30 companies, including Aalberts, a total of Eur314.7 million for participating in a copper fittings cartel. Aalberts was one of four groups which had their  fines increased by 60% because, the EC said, they continued their illegal arrangements after the Commission's initial inspections.

TD
Aalberts Industries "has not yet received the arguments of the decision whereby also other companies in the industry were  fined," the company said in a statement.

The fines that were imposed on Aalberts relate to subsidiaries in Germany and France in which companies that were acquired from third parties were integrated, the company said, adding: "It is unclear whether the  fines relate to the period before these companies were acquired by Aalberts Industries."

When Aalberts Industries acquired these companies, arrangements were agreed in case the companies had violated competition laws before Aalberts Industries acquired them, it added.

"After receipt of the arguments Aalberts Industries will also consult with the sellers on the steps to be taken further to the  fine imposed by the Commission," the company said.

Aalberts "considers that the company has itself not acted in breach of competition laws. Therefore Aalberts Industries does as far as it is concerned not agree with the result of the investigation and will file an appeal against the decision," the company said.

UK engineering group Delta is reserving the right to appeal against a Eur28.31 million ($35.9 million)
fine imposed on it by the European Commission for participation in an alleged copper fittings price    
fixing  cartel, the company said Wednesday.

The EC said earlier Wednesday it had fined 30 companies, including Delta, a total of Eur314.7 million for participating in a copper fittings cartel.

TD
"Delta is reviewing the findings of the European  Commission with the assistance of legal counsel and reserves its position with respect to an appeal against the decision," the company said in a statement.

The fine is payable within three months from Wednesday's announcement and can be met from Delta's existing available cash resources, the company added.

The fine follows an investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour among certain manufacturers of copper plumbing  fittings, including Delta's former plumbing business, International Building Products, which was sold to Oystertec in November 2001.

Oystertec subsequently changed its name to Advanced Fluid Connections, under which name the company has been fined Eur18.088 million by the EC as a result of the same investigation.

But in March of this year, Advanced Fluid Connections announced that it had entered into administrative receivership, citing significant increases in raw material costs and noting that copper prices had risen by
45% since June 30, 2005.

London-listed Delta's businesses include engineered steel products, galvanizing services and manganese materials.

By Geoff Meade, PA Europe Editor, in Brussels
Five UK companies producing copper fittings were part of an illegal  price-fixing cartel which was
fined a total of £212 million by the European Commission today.

TD
For 16 years the  cartel of 30 producers broke EU competition law by colluding on price discounts and rebates and the timing of price rises, the European  Commission said.
They also exchanged commercially important and confidential information in what Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes described as a 'very serious'' infringement of the EU Treaty.
The cartel was uncovered after America's Mueller group decided to take advantage of the EU's
'Leniency Notice'' to cooperate in exposing the  cartel of which it was a part.
As a result Mueller's  fine was cancelled today, and several other  cartel members had their fines
reduced, including the UK's IMI and Delta groups. IMI was  fined £32.4 million and Delta £19 million.

A third UK participant, Advanced Fluid Connections, was  fined £12.2 million. It co-operated with Brussels but received no  fine reduction 'as the information was misleading', said a  Commission statement.

The two other UK groups involved were Tomkins and Flowflex,  fined £3.5 million and £907,000 respectively.

Ms Kroes said the  cartel, running from 1988 to 2004, had clearly pushed up prices for business and retail customers buying copper  fittings used in plumbing, heating sanitation and other building installations.

She commented: 'We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out. We will not only punish firms severely for  cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information.''
The Commission inquiry resulted in 80,000 pages of evidence of the  cartel.

EU investigators found hand-written notes dating back to 1988 revealing that UK copper  fittings competitors were increasing prices based on a specific coded figure for each company. The competitors agreed to implement the price increase 'following the same procedure as last time'', according to inquiry documents.

In 1991, several hand-written notes record new price lists the competitors had agreed on for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, UK, Portugal and Sweden. Paperwork also indicated the planned order in which those price hikes would be implemented.
The total  fine of £212 million is the fifth largest ever imposed by the  Commission on a single cartel.

Birmingham engineering giant IMI was yesterday named among 30 companies hammered by the
European Commission for a copper fittings cartel.

The groups implicated are Mueller Industries, IMI, Delta, Frabo, Aalberts Industries, Viegener, Legris, Advanced Fluid Connections, Sanha Kaimer, Tomkins, Flowflex and Aquatis France.

TD
IMI, with its headquarters on Birmingham Business Park, was  fined 48.3 million euros (£32.6 million).

Delta was fined 28.3 million (£19.1 million), Frabo 1.6 million euros (£1.08 million), Aalberts 100.8 million euros (£68.1 million), Viegner 54.3 million euros (£36.6 million), Legris 46.8 million euros (£31.6 million), Advanced Fluid Connections 18.1 million euros (£12.2 million), Sanha Kaimer 8 million euros (£5.4 million), Tomkins 5.3 million euros (£3.58 million), Flowflex 1.3 million euros (£878,378) and Aquatis France two million euros (£1.35 million).

In a statement the  Commission said between 1988 and 2004, the group fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.

Four - Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris - had their  fines increased by 60 per cent because they continued their illegal arrangements after initial inspections.
Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by 50 per cent for providing misleading information. Mueller - initially  fined 10.5 million euros (£7.09 million) - eventually received full immunity as it was the
first company to come forward with information about the  cartel.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out."
The fine was the fifth-largest imposed by EU regulators for a single  cartel.

IMI and Delta have both said that they would be considering the possibility of launching an appeal against their  fines.

LIFE insurer Resolution (down 1/2p to 6021/2p) is on the lookout for further acquisitions of life and pension funds that are closed to new customers, as it squeezes out costs and achieves economies of scale.

Chief executive Paul Thompson said the group achieved an 11pc return in the first half, compared to just 6pc-7pc at most closed funds.

TD
The group has yet to reap the rewards from its purchase of Abbey's closed funds, and remained silent on whether assets belonging to Prudential or GE Life were of interest.

Pretax profits climbed from £160m to £165m, with underlying earnings up 35pc. Of more interest was the 15pc hike in the interim dividend to 6.64p.

LORD ASHCROFT IN LINE FOR £200M FROM BCA SALE

TORY Party backer Lord Ashcroft could collect up to £200m from the sale of British Car Auctions to buyout group Montagu for £450m.

BCA, which sold 1m cars valued at £3.2bn last year, was bought out of Ashcroft's ADT Group in 1995 by a group of 40 investors led by David Hammond, who is its chairman.

It expanded into Europe and reported 2004 operating profits of £36m. The share register includes several stakes held in Belize and the British Virgin Islands.
BCA is the largest car auction firm in Europe with 40 sites in 11 countries. PLUMBING FIRMS  FINED
ENGINEERS IMI, Delta and Tomkins were among 11 companies  fined a total of £210m by the EU
Commission for price fixing  in plumbing fittings.

Tomkins' share fall was sparked by fears of another profit warning after Dresdner Kleinwort became the latest broker to cut its forecasts. A spokesman for Tomkins, which warned of a US downturn last month, said: 'We have given no new guidance to the market.'
FED WARNS OF RATES HIKE

THE US Federal Reserve pegged rates for a second month but warned another hike may yet be needed in future.

A 'cooling' economy and a housing market slowdown are helping to damp inflation pressures, the central bank said, after leaving rates at 51/4pc.
The decision was widely expected, but the committee kept traders on their toes by warning that
'additional firming' of rates could lie ahead.
One member of the committee, Jeffrey Lacker, opposed the decision and voted for an increase.

AALBERTS

F. Van Lanschot Bankiers downgraded its recommendation on Dutch metalworking and industrial service company Aalberts Industries NV's stock to 'reduce' from 'accumulate' in a reaction of the 100.8 mln euro ($127.8 mln)  fine imposed on the company by the European  Commission (EC) for forming a copper fittings cartel. The share price target for Aalberts was also reduced, to 55 euro ($70.07) from
67 euro ($85.36).

TD
ABN AMRO cut the share price target for Aalberts to 71 euro ($90.45) from 73 euro ($93), reiterating its
'buy' stock rating.
Rabo Securities decreased the share price target for the company to 69 euro ($87.91) from 71 euro
($90.45), maintaining its 'buy' recommendation on the company's stock.
Petercam also reduced Aalberts' share price target to 69.5 euro ($88.54) from 73.8 euro ($94.02)
following the EC's  fine. The stock recommendation remains 'add', the broker said.

(Editor's note: Aalberts said it would appeal the  fine as the company believes it has not violated any competition rules, as the Dutch News Digest reported on September 20, 2006.)

The European  Commission slapped a record fine on 20 September - the fifth largest ever imposed on a cartel - on a group of copper  fittings producers (used to connect tubes used to conduct water, gas, air, etc). The companies concerned will have to pay a total of €314.7 million for their participation in a
price-fixing agreement. The 30 companies concerned are part of 11 groups: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer. Between 1998 and 2004, they agreed on prices and discounts, developed mechanisms to coordinate their price increases, and exchanged confidential commercial information. All these practices are serious infringements of EC Treaty rules (Article 81), for which they will now have to pay a stiff price.

TD
The Commission learned of the illegal practices in January 2001, when the US group Mueller contacted it pursuant to the 1996 communication on leniency, which enables a company to keep from being  fined if it is the first to unmask a  cartel. Mueller consequently will enjoy full immunity and will not have to dig into its pockets for the €10.45 million  fine its practices should have cost it. SOME GETTING OFF LIGHTLYOther companies are also getting off more lightly because they cooperated with, and provided information to, the  Commission: IMI (United Kingdom) will pay only half the normal  fine (€48.3 million rather than €96.6 million), and Delta (United Kingdom) and Frabo (Italy) will get a 20% reduction. In contrast, some groups - among them Aalberts, which has the biggest  fine to pay (€100.8 million) - have had their original  fines increased by 60% because they continued the illegal arrangements after the
Commission's investigation got under way. The  fine imposed on Advanced Fluid Connections was raised by 50% because this firm provided misleading information during the investigation.

All types of copper  fittings were concerned by the  cartel arrangement, with the result that professionals and retail consumers were forced to pay higher prices. The  Commission explains in a press release that any company or individual consumer affected by the anti-competitive practices may bring the matter before the courts of the member states for damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal.

EC RULING: 32.5m Euro penalty for city-based group

THE City today shrugged off a fresh 32.5 million Euro  fine on Birmingham engineering giant IMI over the cartel scandal which engulfed the copper industry.

TD
The Birmingham Business Park-based group's share price survived virtually unscathed when the news emerged yesterday, even adding 1p in early trading today to stand at 487p. IMI will have to pay the latest European  Commission-levied penalty upfront while it considers grounds for appeal.

The company was one of 30 firms to be hit by the new  fines, which in IMI's case relates to its long jettisoned copper  fittings businesses Aquatis France and Simplex Armaturan.

IMI has already been handed a separate £31.3 million bill from the  cartel inquiry into its copper tubes operation and is awaiting results of an appeal.

The 30 companies in the latest case belonged to the groups IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer as well as Aalberts. UK firm Delta was fined £19.1 million.

EC commissioners found companies met in Paris to discuss prices and uncovered scribbled notes signalling price rises using a specific code for each company.

The cartel took place between 1988 and 2004, with price lists agreed for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Britain, Portugal and Sweden.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out."

Graham Trusscott, IMI communications director, said: "How they have come up with the value we don't know. We expect to receive more details from them in a couple of weeks when we will review the material and see whether there are grounds for an appeal."

HD          Cartel fines swell EU's budget. BY         By TOBIAS BUCK

The European  Commission will this year raise more money through cartel fines than ever before, a result of the marked increase in individual  fines imposed by Brussels in recent price-fixing cases.

Yesterday alone, the Commission imposed fines worth Euros 314.7m (Dollars 399.5m) on 30 companies involved in a cartel that had rigged the market for copper  fittings between 1988 and 2004.

TD
It was the fifth-highest  cartel fine ever imposed by the European Union's competition regulator, and brought the total for this year to Euros 1.314bn.

With several more  cartel decisions scheduled for the coming months, the  Commission is almost certain to break the record it set in 2001, when it imposed  cartel fines worth Euros 1.84bn. The funds are used to finance the EU's budget.

Several groups involved in the copper  fittings cartel saw their fines substantially increased because theycontinued their unlawful arrangement even after Commission officials raided their premises in connection with the probe.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said yesterday: "We will not only punish firms severely for cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information."
Aalberts, a Dutch group, received the highest  fine of Euros 100.8m.

HD       Market forces:  Corus finds approval  among traders

Corus shares shone yesterday after Morgan Stanley told clients it expected the steel company to announce a partnership with a low-cost producer before long.

At a recent investor lunch, according to the US broker, the Corus management said it was spending more than 50% of its time to achieve such a combination. "Not only has our confidence increased in a deal occurring within the coming months, but we have raised our estimates of the potential synergies," said the US broker.

TD
Morgan Stanley said a link-up with a rival in Russia, Brazil, India or China could produce annual savings of about pounds 250m, worth 20p a share. The bad news for workers at Port Talbot is that Morgan believes any such deal would lead to the substitution of nearly 5m tons of high cost slabs currently produced there.

Possible partners include Russia's Evraz and NLMK, and Corus is also looking at opportunities in India, though these look more limited. Morgan Stanley said a deal may well be structured as a reverse takeover, much like the proposed - albeit unsuccessful - move on Arcelor by Severstal this year. If such a deal did come off, it would make the merged company the number two player in the industry behind Arcelor-Mittal. The upshot was that Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation on the company from equal weight to overweight, and raised its target for the shares from 470p to 490p. Corus closed 10p higher at 369.75p.

Leading shares picked up pace during the day ahead of the US interest rate decision. With Wall Street moving higher during London trading hours, partly owing to good results from Morgan Stanley, the FTSE
100 ended 34.4 points higher at 5866.2.

The markets seemed relatively unmoved by the coup in Thailand, even though the baht suffered its biggest one-day fall in three years on Tuesday's news and the country's stock market, which was closed yesterday, was predicted to fall 5% when it reopens. Niall Paul, head of equities at Morley Fund Management, said: "The effects [of the coup] appear to be fairly contained and it is likely to have a minimal impact on other markets."

Tesco , which has 3% of its sales and profits in Thailand, added 1p to 372.25p as Panmure Gordon advised clients to buy. "The coup should not impact Tesco shares," said the broker, "and we would prefer to focus on the good mix of top-line organic growth, property value and share buybacks. The shares should test our 400p price target."

Standard Chartered Bank , which is also strong in the region, recovered 37p to 1357p after Tuesday's decline.

There was some early concern about worse than expected UK public finances figures, but economists took comfort from the minutes of the last Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting, when the eight members voted unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged.

Among the risers, British Airways added 17p to 437.75p on the benefit the falling oil price will bring to the company. Collins Stewart advised clients to buy the shares, saying Terminal 5 will give a substantial boost to profits in 18 months time and forecasting the shares will trade at around 500p by next year. Cheaper fuel costs also lifted easyJet 17.75p to 472.25p and Ryanair by 3.7% to euros 8.1.

Among other risers hedge fund manager Man Group added 10.25p to 436p. The shares were responding to news that the net asset value of its AHL Diversified Futures fund had risen 1.17% last week, and also a report here that traders were speculating it may be a takeover target for the likes of Goldman Sachs.

Continuing falls in metals prices - copper was down another 4.5% - left miners nursing losses. Kazakhmys fell 46p to pounds 11.62 while Antofagasta lost 3p to 435.25p as its shares went
ex-dividend. Also going ex-div was pallet maker Bram bles, down 25p to 448p. BG Group slipped 14.5p to 645.5p as the recent bid speculation cooled, while power plant owner Drax was still out of favour, down 20.5p to 835p.

Strong results overnight from US software and services group Oracle and suggestions it was on the takeover trail caused some interest. Bridgewell analysts said companies such as Autonomy , up 12.5p to
433.5p, and Dicom , steady at 242.5p, could be targets for the likes of Oracle or rival SAP. News of a euros 315m fine on 30 companies from the European  commission over a copper fittings cartel sent shares in some of the businesses lower. IMI lost 3.5p to 486p while Tomkins fell 3.75p to 237.25p, additionally unsettled by talk it had been giving out new guidance to analysts. In fact, company sources said Tomkins had just been briefing an analyst who had been on holiday when it issued its recent profit warning. It gave out no information it had not already told the City, but the analyst had lowered his forecasts after the meeting.

Newport Networks , chaired by multi millionaire Welsh entrepreneur Sir Terry Matthews, lost almost half its value, down 2.425p to 3.25p, after it reported half year losses had increased from pounds 5.6m to pounds 6.9m. It also warned it was planning more cost cutting to reduce its cash burn.

Accident takes toll

The repercussions of an accident in February when an exhibition centre roof collapsed in Poland , killing several people, continue to hinder Expomedia . The exhibitions and conference group has a 51% stake in the building's owner, MTK, and was not involved in construction of the centre but Polish police have still held one executive since February. The inquiry has also been a drain on management time . Yesterday the company reported a rise in operating losses from euros 1.9m (pounds 1.3m) to euros
2.1m for the half year, and analysts believe it has missed its goal of a full-year profit. Teather & Greenwood's Conor O'Shea reckons it could lose euros 5m this year, and is not likely to be profitable before 2008. He downgraded his recommendation on the shares to 107.5p, to reduce.

This article is from the (RED) edition of The Independent of 21 September 2006, guest-designed by
Giorgio Armani. Half the revenue from the edition will be donated to the Global Fund to Fight Aids
Three British engineering groups, Tomkins, IMI and Delta, were among 30 companies fined
EUR314.7m (£211m) by the European  Commission yesterday for forming a copper-fitting cartel.

TD
The fine is the fifth-biggest penalty imposed by Europe's top antitrust authority. The Dutch firm, Aalberts, received the largest fine of EUR100.8m, while IMI was  fined EUR48.3m and Delta
EUR28.3m. Tomkins was fined EUR5m in relation to its former subsidiary, Pegler, which was sold to its management in 2004. Tomkins and Delta, which sold its former plumbing businesses in 2001, said they were undecided whether to appeal against the ruling. IMI, whose former copper-fittings business was sold in 2002, said it would consider an appeal.

The cartel resulted in consumers paying higher prices. Copper  fittings are used in tubes for plumbing, heating and sanitation.

The EC said: "Between 1988 and 2004, the companies fixed prices, discount and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to co-ordinat price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."
Mueller's fine was waived as it was the first to come forward with information about the  cartel.

HD            EU Fines 30 Companies  $399.1 Million  Total

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators fined 30 companies a total of 314.8 million euros ($399.1 million) for fixing prices for copper-pipe fittings.

The fines were levied after Mueller Industries Inc., of Memphis, Tenn., disclosed the illegal  cartel to the European  Commission. Mueller was given immunity, and what would have been a 10.5 million euros fine was erased.

TD
In 2001, the company gave Brussels regulators evidence of  price-fixing dating back to 1988. Handwritten notes showed the companies involved coordinated price increases, allocated customers and shared commercial information in several EU countries, the  commission said.

The 30 fittings makers were controlled by 11 groups. Of these, Dutch industrial holding company Aalberts Industries NV received the highest  fine, 100.8 million euros. Aalberts said it would appeal the fine to the European Court of Justice. The company said it had "not acted in breach of competition laws." Other companies involved either declined to comment or said they were also considering appeals.

Franz Viegener II GmbH of Germany was  fined 54.3 million euros. Product-engineering company IMI PLC of the United Kingdom received a 50% reduction in its penalty for cooperating with the commission's investigation and was  fined 48.3 million euros.

Aalberts and three other companies -- Delta PLC and Advanced Fluid Connections PLC of the U.K. and Legris of France -- received 60% increases to their  fines because they allegedly continued to fix prices after the  commission started its probe.

The French company Legris, which designs, makes and sells industrial products, has been charged,
along with 10 other groups, with  cartel-forming by the European  Commission. The 11 groups in question
have been fined a total of 314.7m euros for engaging in the illegal practice on the copper and copper
alloy fittings market.

Legris has been fined 46.8m euros. The  cartel began between some of the 30 guilty companies owned by the 11 groups as long ago as 1988, and affected a whole range of copper and copper alloy  fittings, used to assemble pipes used in carrying gas, water or air in plumbing or heating systems.

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - There has been no financial impact as yet from the coup in Thailand, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

"We are following the developments very closely and we certainly have not seen up to now any financial consequences," IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato told reporters at the close of the annual general assembly of the IMF and World Bank.

The Thai baht fell against the dollar as markets reacted nervously to news that Thailand's armed forces had seized power yesterday from Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a late-night bloodless coup.

Thailand's financial markets were closed today following the announcement of the coup and the imposition of martial law. They are expected to reopen tomorrow.

PARIS (XFN-ASIA) - EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co) unit Airbus will probably reduce the number of planned 2007 deliveries of its super-jumbo A380 passenger jet, resulting in additional delays for most buyers, sources close to the company told Agence France-Presse.

One source said planned A380 deliveries next year could be halved, due to difficulties in adapting the plane's electrical cabling to the varied specifications being required by clients.

FRANKFURT (XFN-ASIA) - Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it has ordered 35 Airbus planes, 30 of which are to be delivered from 2007.

"We intend to buy both Boeings and Airbuses: 22 Boeing planes" from 2010 to 2012 and 22 Airbuses from 2012 to 2016, the Interfax agency quoted Okulov as saying.
Aeroflot had been weighing the purchase of an estimated 3 bln eur of passenger jets from either EADS
unit Airbus or Boeing.
MADRID (XFN-ASIA) - Industria de Diseno Textil SA CEO Pablo Isla said the company maintains its
target for a "stable" gross margin in the full-year to Jan 2007, after reporting a 54.9 pct gross margin in the
first half to July.
In June, the group reiterated its gross margin target of 56.2 pct for the full-year.

LONDON (XFN-ASIA) - The UK government's public finances worsened by more than expected in August as government spending exceeded receipts, with borrowing at its highest ever level recorded for the month, official figures showed.

The office for National Statistics revealed that public sector net borrowing, the government's preferred measure of the public finances, stood at 7.6 bln stg in August, compared with 5.5 bln stg in the same month last year.

Commenting on the UK's action since member states recommended in January that it take steps by July
24 to comply with the stability and growth pact's deficit limit of 3 pct of GDP, the  commission said no
further disciplinary measures are required.

Brussels, 20/09/2006 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the Commission fined 30 companies which produce copper fittings a total of 314.7 million EUR for having taken part in a price-fixing agreement between 1988 and 2004. This sum, the fifth-highest ever for a  cartel, concerns 11 groups of companies which set prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information. (A  fitting connects tubes used to conduct water, air, gas, etc in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations). During its investigation, which it launched in January 2001, the  Commission noted that all types of  fittings were covered by the arrangement. Many documents, company statements and interviews with witnesses
contain elements of evidence covering the entire duration of the  cartel, the Commission states in a press release.

TD
Aalberts of the Netherlands (100.8 million EUR in  fines), Delta of the United Kingdom (28.310 million), Legris of France (46.8) and Advanced Fluid Connections had their  fines increased by 60%, because they continued their illegal arrangements after the  Commission's initial investigations. Advanced Fluid Connections had its  fine increased by an additional 50% for providing the  Commission with misleading information (18.088 million). IMI (United Kingdom) will pay a  fine of 41.3 million, Frabo (Italy) 1.58, Viegener (Germany) 54.292, Sanha Kaimer (Germany) 7.97, Tomkins/Pegler (United Kingdom) 5.25, Flowflex (United Kingdom) 1.349 and Aquatis France and Simplex Armaturen 2.042. Mueller, of the United States, received full immunity, escaping a  fine of 10.45 million EUR.

The European  Commission yesterday fined 30 companies Euro 314 million (Pounds 211 million) for operating a copper plumbing fittings cartel that fixed prices for 16 years.

The fines take to Euro 1.3 billion the penalties that Brussels regulators have imposed this year on four cartels as they step up a fight against serious violations of EU competition rules.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out."

A Commission inquiry began in January 2001 when Mueller, the US company, came forward with details of the cartel in exchange for immunity from  fines.

Aalberts, a Dutch company, received the biggest  fine, of Euro 100 million. Five British businesses were also fined. They were IMI (Euro 48.3 million), Delta (Euro 28.3 million), Advanced Fluid Connections (Euro 18.1 million), Tomkins/Pegler (Euro 5.3 million) and Flowflex (Euro 1.4 million).

IMI and Delta had  fines cut after assisting the  Commission inquiry. IMI, whose  fittings business was sold in 2002, said that it would study the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

The European Union has  fined IMI PLC, Delta PLC and 28 other engineering firms 314.7 million euros for colluding to fix prices for copper  fittings used in plumbing and heating.
The fines were worth about $450.37 million (Canadian) at yesterday's exchange rate.

TD
The fines are the third time since 2003 that the  commission has penalized companies in the copper-tube industry.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes has vowed to make fighting  price fixing  a main priority in her five-year term.
The regulator can  fine violators as much as 10 per cent of sales.

HD        EC fines 30 companies over copper fittings cartel

The European  Commission last week handed down the fifth-largest set of  fines it has ever imposed on a single cartel, hitting 30 companies with total combined  fine of Eur314.7 million ($398.7 million) for participating in a copper  fittings cartel.

The 11 groups to which these companies belong are: Aalberts, IMI, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Tomkins, Flowflex, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

TD
But the matter may not end there, as one of the companies in question—Dutch industrial group Aalberts—immediately signaled its intention to appeal the decision, while IMI and Delta, both of the UK, indicated they were also considering the possibility of an appeal.

Between 1988 and 2004, the companies "fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to coordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged commercially important and confidential information," the EC said in a statement.

Four of these groups—Aalberts, Delta, Advanced Fluid Connections and Legris—had their fines increased by 60% because they continued their illegal arrangements after the Commission's initial inspections, while Advanced Fluid Connections'  fine was increased by a further 50% for providing the Commission with misleading information, the EC said.

US-based Mueller received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's leniency program, as it was the first company to come forward with information about the cartel, it added.

"We will not tolerate cartels and will take all measures to stamp them out. We will not only punish firms severely for cartel behaviour, but also increase the  fines for flagrantly continuing after a  Commission dawn raid and for providing wrong or misleading information," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the statement.

The product concerned is copper  fittings, including copper alloy  fittings (such as gunmetal, brass and other copper-based alloys), the EC said, adding that a  fitting connects tubes used to conduct water, air, gas, etc., in plumbing, heating, sanitation and other installations.

There are various types of fittings known as end-feed, solder ring, compression, press and push-fit which were all covered by the cartel, with the result that business and retail consumers were paying higher prices, it noted.

"As far back as 1988, hand-written notes reveal that the UK competitors increased prices based on a specific coded figure for each company," the EC said, adding: "The competitors agreed to implement the price increase 'following the same procedure as last time.'"

In 1991, several hand-written notes record the new price lists the competitors had agreed on for Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, UK, Portugal and Sweden, and indicated the planned order in which those price hikes would be implemented, it said.

On January 26, 2001, competitors met in Paris to discuss the state of play of price increases,
country-by-country and company-by-company, the EC continued, adding: "Hand-written notes show that

Page 93 of 101 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the price increase that the competitors planned together had been achieved in France, was still ongoing in Germany and was delayed in Spain. The competitors also discussed a new price structure and price level for the UK. Finally, the companies took care to explain that the collusive meetings would continue despite the fact that Delta (now Advanced Fluid Connections) was to be sold to another company."
In 2004, the EC  fined a group of companies a total of Eur222.3 million for operating a  cartel in the
European market for water, heating and gas tubes for a period of up to 12 years—Andy Blamey

HD     Five UK plumbing firms have been fined a total of ?68m for price fixing  in... BY      Kathy Watson

Five UK plumbing firms have been fined a total of ?68m for  price fixing  in copper fittings over the last
20 years by the European Commission.
They now face censure and possible expulsion from the Association of Plumbing and Heating Contractors
(APHC) if their appeals fail.

TD
The lion?s share of the fines was levied on IMI UK (?32.4m) and Delta UK (?18.98m), with Advanced
Fluid Connections being fined ?12.1m, Tomkins Pegler UK ?3.5m and Flowflex UK ?904,000.

They were part of a  cartel of 30 companies throughout Europe  fined a total of ?211m last week, that includes Aalberts, Legris, Frabo, Mueller, Viegener and Sanha Kaimer.

The Commission claims that between 1988 and 2004 the companies fixed prices, discounts and rebates, agreed on mechanisms to co-ordinate price increases, allocated customers and exchanged confidential information.

APHC chief executive Clive Dickin said: ?This will inevitably have resulted in higher prices and affected the total profitability of a project for our members and other organisations.?
IMI and Delta are the two largest members of the APHC in the pipes section. If their appeals to the
Commission fail, they could possibly be expelled.
Four of the groups, including Delta and Advanced Fluid Connections (AFC), had their  fines increased by
60% because they continued their illegal arrangements after the Commission?s initial inspections.
AFC?s fine was increased by a further 50% for providing the commission with misleading information.

Mueller was given full immunity from  fines under the Commission?s leniency programme as a whistleblower. It came clean after documents were discovered during on-site inspections. By the close of the investigation, the  Commission had amassed 80,000 pages of documents spanning nearly 20 years.

As far back as 1988, hand-written notes revealed that the UK competitors increased prices based on a specific coded figure for each company. In 2001, all the competitors met in Paris to discuss price
increases country by country and company by company. They discussed a new price structure for the UK.
It is understood that some of those  fined plan to appeal. AFC went into receivership in the spring.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union antitrust regulators Friday suggested harmonizing the bloc's leniency schemes for  cartel whistleblowers.

The Commission's leniency rules are "a formidable and successful tool to detect and terminate cartels. These changes will make it even more effective," the E.U.'s top antitrust regulator Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

Harmonized rules for leniency applications at both a national level and pan-European level will move the continent closer to a one-stop  cartel shop, the  Commission said.

The Brussels-based  Commission in 2002 created a new leniency policy giving  cartel offenders more incentives to turn themselves in and avoid penalties.

Since then, the  Commission has seen some confusion among whistleblowers about where to file their applications and what information to include.
Kroes, who took office almost two years ago, has cracked down on cartels ranging from
road-paving materials to copper-pipe  fittings. In June, she revised the  Commission's guidelines
for cartel fines to make penalties more severe.

HD            EU TO STREAMLINE WHISTLE-BLOWER LENIENCY RULES WC           386 words

By Geoff Meade, PA Europe editor, Brussels

European Union governments today vowed to streamline their national rules on leniency for companies who blow the whistle and help the crackdown on illegal cartels.

TD
The Model Leniency Programme, approved by the European  Commission and national competition authorities in the 25 member states, is an attempt to clarify differing leniency arrangements.

Only last week the  Commission announced multi-million pound  fines against five UK companies involved in an illegal market-rigging scam in the copper  fittings sector.

The cartel had been exposed by an American company taking advantage of the  Commission's current leniency arrangements to co-operate in spilling the beans on the  cartel of which it was a part.
As a result, the whistle-blower's potential massive  fine was cancelled, while other producers in the
cartel received hefty reductions if they co-operated.

Today's move is part of efforts to encourage more corporate whistle-blowing by removing anomalies in leniency deals which can vary depending on which EU country the whistle is blown on
multi-national cartels.

A Commission spokesman said: 'Busting cartels is good for EU consumers because it is a blow against artificially-high prices - and leniency is a successful and powerful tool to detect and terminate those cartels.

'A well-functioning leniency programme can also destabilise existing cartels and prevent the creation of new cartels, so it is in everyone's interest to ensure that European leniency programmes remain efficient and attractive.

'If the national leniency provisions for whistle-blowers are more closely aligned it will further enhance the detection and punishment of these anti-competitive cross-border arrangements.''
The programme was developed under the chairmanship of the UK's Office of Fair Trading and its
French counterpart.

OFT chief executive John Fingleton said the result was a good example of effective European enforcement policy co-ordination.

He added: 'The leading role played by the OFT reflects our commitment to work closely with other competition authorities in the fight against cartels.''

The OFT's own national leniency policy, in operation since 2000, requires no 'substantive'' changes under the new EU-wide leniency guidelines endorsed today.
However, the agreement is not legally-binding and its effectiveness will be reviewed in 2008.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union antitrust regulators Friday suggested harmonizing the bloc's leniency schemes for  cartel whistleblowers.

The plan will make it easier for companies to disclose illegal cartels in exchange for leniency, especially in cross-border cases where jurisdiction isn't clear, the European  Commission said in a statement. [ 09-29-06 0552ET ]

The Commission's leniency rules are "a formidable and successful tool to detect and terminate cartels. These changes will make it even more effective," the E.U.'s top antitrust regulator Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

Harmonized rules for leniency applications at both a national level and pan-European level will move the continent closer to a one-stop  cartel shop, the  Commission said.

The Brussels-based  Commission in 2002 created a new leniency policy giving  cartel offenders more incentives to turn themselves in and avoid penalties.

Since then, the  Commission has seen some confusion among whistleblowers about where to file their applications and what information to include.

Kroes, who took office almost two years ago, has cracked down on cartels ranging from road-paving materials to copper-pipe  fittings. In June, she revised the  Commission's guidelines for  cartel fines to make penalties more severe.
