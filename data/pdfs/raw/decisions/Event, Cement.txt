HD          Commission may decide this week on alleged cement cartel. BY          By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Nov 21 (Reuter) - The European Commission may decide this week after a five-year investigation to  fine as many as 30 European cement companies for carving up markets and  fixing prices, Commission and industry officials said on Monday.

"There is little doubt that the European  cement industry was operating a  cartel, but the big question is whether intra- Community trade was affected as a result of that," a Commission official told Reuters.

TD
The advisory committee of national competition experts in the European Union was to have a final meeting on the issue on Wednesday morning, making it possible for the Commission to take a decision the same day.

"They have got to be quick if they want to avoid leaks on the levels of the  fines and the inevitable speculation on the shares of the companies concerned," a Brussels-based industry official said.

There was no mention of the companies involved or the  fines, the sources said, adding that the list would be drafted at the very last moment to avoid turmoil in the companies' shares.

The probe originally concerned the whole sector, including giants Holderbank of Switzerland, Italy's Italcementi, France's Lafarge Coppee, Belgium's CBR, Britain's Blue Circle, Germany's Dyckerhoff, Portugal's Cimpor and even national and European  cement associations.

Agreements run at national level, however, had been dropped from the inquiry on the grounds that they would better be dealt with by national anti-trust authorities, the sources said.

A final decision could have to wait until next week if discussion at the level of EU commissioners' aides proved too controversial, the sources said.

Shares in Lafarge Coppee fell last week on a press report that the firm had made no provisions for a possible fine. The French company denied the allegations.

Companies can be fined up to 10 percent of their previous year's turnover if they are found to be running a cartel under regulation 17/62 which enshrined articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.

Already this year the Commission has imposed record  fines of 100 million European currency units on steel companies for operating a  cartel in the steel beams sector and of 130 million Ecus on
carton-board manufacturers.

But the sources doubted whether a new record would be set given the nature of the  cement industry. High transport costs usually discourage selling  cement across borders or even in a different region within a EU state.
"It would be stupid to sell  cement beyond a 200-km radius," an industry source said recently. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

HD        CEMENT COMPANIES FACE BIG EU FINES.

The European Commission this week may announce record  fines against some of the region's biggest
cement companies after a five-year investigation into alleged illegal market-sharing agreements.

European Union officials said yesterday they were very close to announcing a decision, which some observers believe could come later this week.

TD
Some 30 companies are thought to be involved in the inquiry, which, under commission rules, could result in fines of up to 10% of the European turnover of the worst offenders.

The investigation originally involved more than 70 companies. The shortened list is thought to include all the big suppliers including British, French, German and Italian companies.

It would be the fourth time this year that the  fines would have been imposed by the commission for alleged market sharing or price  fixing  by European companies.

The commission in July imposed record  fines totalling ECU 132.15m ($167.8m) on 19 carton-board producers accused of operating Europe's 'most pernicious' price-fixing cartel.

In February, Brussels  fined 14 steel producers more than ECU 100m for price  fixing  and market sharing.

Fines against cement companies, if imposed, are likely to be staggered, with lesser offenders being
fined smaller amounts, as occurred in the carton-board case.
The EU investigations began in 1989 when officials staged a dawn raid on the offices of 10 leading
cement producers in France, Belgium and Germany.

The raids were ordered after customers complained of a low level of  cement imports in spite of large price variations between neighbouring European countries.
Imports have risen since the late 1980s but still provide a low proportion of total sales in most EU
countries.

Reuter adds from Brussels: Neither the names of companies involved, nor the size of any  fines have been disclosed, officials said. The list would be drafted at the very last moment to avoid turmoil in the companies' shares.

The probe originally concerned the whole sector, including Holderbank of Switzerland, Italy's Italcementi, France's Lafarge Coppee, Belgium's CBR, Britain's Blue Circle, Germany's Dyckerhoff, and Portugal's Cimpor, along with national and European  cement associations. Shares in Lafarge Coppee fell last
week on a press report that the company had made no provisions for a possible  fine. The French company denied the allegations.

WIESBADEN, Germany, Nov 22 (Reuter) - German cement manufacturer Dyckerhoff AG said it was on the European Commission's shortlist of 30 European cement companies investigated for  cartel practices.

The European Commission's committee of national competition experts is expected to meet tomorrow to discuss the issue. Hefty  fines may result for the firms investigated.

TD
A Dyckerhoff spokesman today rejected claims that the company had sealed off the domestic  cement
market, noting that the company is the largest German  cement exporter.

He said the company had not set up any special reserves to cope with a possible  fine and declined to speculate on the size of a  fine.

The European Commission launched its investigation of 70 European  cement companies five years ago.

PARIS, Nov 22 (Reuter) -  Cement company Lafarge Coppee said it was calm and serene as it waited to hear the outcome, possibly tomorrow, of the  European Commission's five-year probe into alleged price fixing  in the cement industry.
"We are waiting in all serenity, calmly and with sang froid," said a Lafarge Coppee spokesman.

TD
He added that there had been intense competition in the  cement business over the last five years and if the Commission  fined Lafarge Coppee, the company would probably appeal.

Lafarge Coppee has financially covered any risk from the investigation by making general provisions, he said.

The Commission may decide this week to  fine as many as 30 European  cement companies for carving up markets and fixing  prices, Commission and industry officials said on Monday.

"There is little doubt that the European  cement industry was operating a  cartel, but the big question is whether intra- Community trade was affected as a result of that," a Commission official told Reuters.

BRUSSELS, Nov 23 (Reuter) - The  European Commission's decision on the alleged European
cement cartel involving more than 30 firms is expected next week, Commission officials said.

"I think the decision will be taken next week," a senior Commission official said. He declined to give any details.

TD
Speculation by industry and Commission officials that the decision could be taken by commissioners before their weekly meeting next Wednesday was dismissed by a Commission spokesman.
"I would be very surprised if it was not the (full) Commission that took such an important decision on a
fine -- that is if there is to be a  fine," he told journalists.

Another senior Commission official also said today that the formal decision would be left to the full meeting of the 17 commissioners. He was speaking after a seven-hour meeting on a 300-page document on the case which ended on Tuesday night.

The Commission was tight-lipped on the companies concerned or the size of the  fines to be applied for rigging prices and carving up markets. But there was no doubt that the five-year investigation would result in penalties.

Germany's Dickerhoff and Belgium's CBR confirmed they were part of the final list of companies being investigated which was reduced from an initial 76 firms.

Among other companies likely to be on the list were Holderbank of Switzerland, Italy's Italcementi, France's Lafarge Coppee, Britain's Blue Circle and Portugal's Cimpor, a Commission official said.

Industry and Commission officials initially thought that the decision could be taken at the Commission's weekly meeting today after EU commissioners's aides met on the issue on Tuesday and the EU's advisory committee of national competition experts met this morning.

PARIS, Nov 23 (Reuter) - French cement maker Lafarge Coppee said any effect on its 1994 results would be negligible if the European Commission decided to fine the company after its investigation into alleged price-fixing  in the cement industry.

"We have not made a specific provision because we believe we have clearly shown that the group is not guilty in this affair," a Lafarge Coppee spokesman said,

TD
He added, however, the risk was financially covered as its reserve of provisions would allow it to meet the risk.
"The impact on 1994 results for Lafarge should be, in consequence, negligible," he said.

The European Commission is expected shortly to give its decision on whether to  fine as many as 30 companies, after a five year inquiry into industry practice.

THE European Commission's decision on the alleged  cement cartel involving more than 30 companies is imminent. The full meeting of the 17 commissioners in Brussels next Wednesday will consider a 300-page document on the case, and there is little doubt that the five-year investigation into rigging prices and carving up markets will end in financial penalties possibly one of the largest  fines imposed on industry by the commission. Germany's Dickerhoff and Belgium's CBR confirmed they were part of the final list of companies being investigated, which was reduced from 76 firms at first.

BRUSSELS, Nov 29 (Reuter) - The European Commission is due to decide on Wednesday heavy
fines on European cement companies for operating a cartel, a Commission official said.

The official said a total of 33 companies, eight national associations and a European association were on the Commission's final list after a five-year investigation.

TD
"Decision will be taken tomorrow," the official said.

EU and industry sources said among companies concerned were Germany's Dyckerhoff, Belgium's CBR, France's Lafarge Coppee and Ciments Francais, Britain's Blue Circle  Cement and Rugby Cement, Portugal's Cimpor, Spain's Asland SA, Hisalba and Uniland Cementera SA, Italy's Italcementi and Switzerland's Holderbank.
There was mounting speculation among Commission and industry officials that the record 130 million
Ecus-fine imposed on carton-board manufacturers in July would be exceeded.
This was because of the greater number of companies involved and to give a further sign that the
Commission would not tolerate serious violations of competition law.
"I think that total  fines will be higher (than in the carton board  cartel)," a Commission official said. However, not all companies and associations were expected to be penalised and in some cases  fines
could be symbolic, as with the steel beams  cartel which was also unveiled this year, the sources said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 29 (Reuter) - The European Commission has collected strong evidence during its five-year investigation into allegations that the European cement sector was carving up markets and fixing  prices, a senior Commission official said.
"There is solid evidence that the (cement) cartel used practices such as market sharing and price
fixing,"  the official said, speaking on condition on anonymity.

TD
"When you have huge price differences for  cement it's a sign that something is wrong in the (EU's)
single market," he said.

Consequently, Commission was expected to impose heavy  fines on up to 42 companies and associations on Wednesday, he said.

The size of the  fines and the final list of the companies to be fined still had to be decided, the senior official said, adding that it was up for discussion whether national cement associations and the European cement body CEMBUREAU were also to be penalised.

The official did not say what the price differences were or for which period of time, but added that the sector's anti-competitive practices had ceased.
The Commission started its investigation in 1989.

In two decisions this year to impose  fines of 100 million European currency units on steel companies and of 130 million Ecus on carton-board makers, both for operating cartels, the Commission punished the Finnish Board Mills Association but took a lenient approach regarding the European steel association Eurofer.

"I think that total  fines will be higher (than in the carton board  cartel)," a Commission official said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (AFP) - The European Commission on Wednesday slapped record  fines totaling
248 million ecus (304 million dollars) on 33 European cement-makers and eight of their trade associations
for having set up a  cartel, a commission spokesman announced in Brussels.

The fines are the biggest ever imposed by the commission at one go for illicit understandings among companies. They have to be paid within three months.

TD
The commission spokesman said that, starting in 1986, the 33 European  cement producers and eight trade organizations set up trans-national arrangements for dividing up markets and for exchanges of information.
The commission's decision relates to both grey and white cements, representing total annual sales in the
European Union of around seven billion ecus (8.5 billion dollars).

The European  Cement Association (Cembureau) was  fined by the commission for having supplied members with information about the levels of their production, sales and prices.

The majority of cases recorded relate to market sharing agreements and exchange of information about prices to try to avoid competition.
French grup Lafarge-Coppee will have to pay a  fine of 22.87 million ecus in connection with grey
cements, and 1.03 million for white cements. French group Ciments Francais will be charged 24.72 million
for grey, and 1.05 million for white cements.

The official said the  cartel lasted 10 years and consisted mainly in market sharing practices although the companies were also found to have shared price information.

The decision on the  fines is expected to be formally announced at 1600 GMT.

The decision to base the  fine on the companies' 1992 turnover was particularly harmful for firms in countries where currencies had been devalued such as Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined 33 cement companies a record 248 million European currency units for carving up the market with a cartel.
Also included in the  fine were eight national associations and the European  Cement Association.

TD
The Commission said in a statement it had  fined companies in the European Union, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland because they had been found to be running a  cartel for a long time which affected most European  cement production.

"The producers cannot deny that they knew perfectly well that they were engaged in illegal activities when, during a meeting of the European group their president told them 'It almost goes without saying that there will be no minutes of our meetings'," the Commission said in a statement.
Among the  fines were 32.5 million Ecus in Italy's Italcementi, 24.7 Ecus million on France's Ciments
Francaise and 15.8 million Ecus on Britain's Blue Circle.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The European Commission has imposed record fines on 33 companies, eight national associations and the European Cement Association after a five-year investigation into a  cement industry cartel, an EU official said on Wednesday.

The official said the companies had been  fined between five and six percent of their turnover. Another official added that the fines had been imposed on the companies' 1992 turnover, the year when they stopped running the cartel.

TD
The officials could not give details of which companies had been penalised. Formal announcement of the fines is due at 1600 GMT.

European Union and industry sources have said the companies on the list included Germany's Dyckerhoff, Belgium's CBR, France's Lafarge Coppee and Ciments Francais, Britain's Blue Circle, Portugal's Cimpor, Spain's Asland SA, Hisalba, Uniland Cementera, Italy's Italcementi and Switzerland's Holderbank.

Asked whether the Commission' record 130-million European currency unit ($158 million)  fine imposed in July on carton board manufacturers had been exceeded the official said: "Yes, it will be higher."

Fines imposed on the associations were only symbolic, he added.

In the carton board  cartel case, the fines were as high as nine percent of turnover for a total of 23 companies and associations.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it had  fined 33 cement companies a record 248 million european currency units ($305 million) for carving up the market with a  cartel.
Also included in the  fine were eight national associations and the European  Cement Association.

TD
The Commission said in a statement it had  fined companies in the European Union, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland because they had been found to be running a  cartel for a long time which affected most European  cement production.

"The producers cannot deny that they knew perfectly well that they were engaged in illegal activities when, during a meeting of the European group their president told them 'It almost goes without saying that there will be no minutes of our meetings'," the Commission said in a statement.

Among the  fines were 32.5 million Ecus ($39.9 million) in Italy's Italcementi, 24.7 Ecus million ($30.4 million) on France's Ciments Francaise and 15.8 million Ecus ($19.4 million) on Britain's Blue Circle.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The European Cement Association (CEMBUREAU) said on
Wednesday it would appeal against the European Commission's decision to  fine it a symbolic
100,000 European currency units for participating in a cement cartel.

"The association intends to lodge an appeal against the Commission's decision," CEMBUREAU's spokesman Jean-Pierre Jacobs told Reuters. Formal decision to this effect would be taken by the board of CEMBUREAU on December 2, he said.

TD
"As has been the case throughout the whole procedure started in 1989, CEMBUREAU yet again vigorously denies the charges of anti-competitive behaviour brought forward by the Commission."
A spokesman for Britain's Blue Circle Industries in London also said his company would appeal. Blue
Circle was fined 15.8 million Ecus.

A Holderbank spokesman said in response to inquiries that the company had not yet directly received information from Brussels and wanted to wait until this had taken place.

"It's quite simply too early for a comment," a spokesman said.
The EU said earlier it had  fined 33 European cement companies, eight national associations and the

HD         Belgian shares end 0.5 pct up despite UM. WC        402 words

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Belgian shares profited from the firmer dollar and fresh gains on Wall Street to close 0.52 percent higher despite unabated pressure on non-ferrous metals firm Union Miniere.

The Bel-20 index ended 7.35 points, or 0.52 percent, higher at 1,409.56 on the penultimate day of the forward market trading account.

TD
Total volume in Belgian shares was worth 1.4 billion francs and included several Belix baskets of Bel-20 shares. About one third of the overall volume was accounted for by Union Miniere (UM), which again fell victim to warrants-related selling.

One dealer said an increasing number of people believed in an end-of-year rally. "But the more (that) believe it, the less likely it is to happen," he said jokingly. Any further rise will depend on the dollar and Dow, he added.
UM, which already shed 1.2 percent on Tuesday on selling related to its covered call warrants, ended
0.4 percent down at 2,525 francs. The Brussels bourse earlier decided to extend the CATS listing of the
warrants to December 15.

One dealer said he thought UM's parent company, Societe Generale de Belgique, was supporting UM's share price.

Dealers noted that UM had fallen from 2,750 francs recently despite a considerable rise of the dollar as well as higher zinc and copper prices.

"But it's been forced down on its knees by some three million warrants brought on the market in one month. Nobody now dares touch it," one dealer said.

Cement maker CBR appeared unaffected by news the European Union set record fines on 33 cement firms, and closed 25 francs higher at 12,125 francs. But after the close of trading the European Commission announced it fined CBR a total 8.03 million Ecus for its involvement in an alleged
cement cartel.

Polyurethane foam producer Recticel was among the biggest losers, its ordinary stock falling 2.1 percent to 472 francs and its preferred stock sliding 2.8 percent to 626.

One dealer said he thought the fall might be linked to news earlier this week the company is involved in a trial over compensation claims by ex-managers of a former subsidiary.
The trial was due to start on Wednesday. Recticel was not available for comment. (c) Reuters Limited 1994

ZURICH, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Analysts and markets warmly welcomed news that Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG, the world's largest cement producer, had only been  fined 5.33 million European currency units (Ecus) by the European Commission and predicted sharp gains for its stock on Thursday.

Initially, analysts reacted with incredulity to the  fine, levied for involvement in a  cartel, which was a fraction of what had been anticipated.

TD
"This is very good news compared with the worst-case scenario," said analyst Maarten Slenderbroek of
Smith New Court.

On Wednesday Holderbank's bearer share in Zurich had closed down eight Swiss francs at 1,029 francs before the  fine was announced from Brussels.

Analysts said there had been rumours in the market of Holderbank being imposed a  fine of up to 100 million francs.
"This is fantastically good news for Holderbank," said Robert Macotta of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Although Holderbank had never commented on the possible  fine, Slenderbroek said it had warned
markets that a  fine in the worst case could amount to 10 percent of its European Union revenue, or
around 80 million Swiss francs.
Holderbank's fine of 5.33 million Ecus equals around 8.6 million Swiss francs. "A fine of eight million francs is absolutely nothing," said Macotta.

BONN, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Germany's Dyckerhoff AG said it expected to appeal against a  fine levied against it by the European Commission as one of 33 companies and eight national associations alleged to have run a cartel.
In a statement, Dyckerhoff said its share of the  fine was 13.28 million Ecu.

TD
Dyckerhoff said the Commission appeared to be accusing it and other companies of conniving to protect home markets.

"No such agreement exists or has existed, or certainly we have no knowledge of it and are certainly not involved," Dyckerhoff said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The European  Cement Association (CEMBUREAU) said it would appeal against the  European Commission's decision to fine it a symbolic 100,000 European currency units ($121,000) for participating in a cement cartel.

"The association intends to lodge an appeal against the Commission's decision," CEMBUREAU's spokesman Jean-Pierre Jacobs told Reuters. Formal decision to this effect would be taken by the board of CEMBUREAU on December 2, he said.

TD
"As has been the case throughout the whole procedure started in 1989, CEMBUREAU yet again vigorously denies the charges of anti-competitive behaviour brought forward by the Commission."

HD        Holderbank says fines don't change forecast. WC        487 words

ZURICH, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Swiss Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG, the world's largest  cement maker, said fines imposed by the European Commission would have no bearing on its year-end forecasts for the holding company and the group.

Holderbank also said in a statement that its own forecast for consolidated net earnings for the current year remains unchanged at 600 million Swiss francs, a 37 percent increase from 1993.

TD
Holderbank's statement was issued after the European Commission fined 33 European cement companies, eight national associations and the European Cement Association a total of 248 million European currency units for involvement in a  cartel.

Holderbank also said it may decide to appeal the decision by the  European Commission, but it would first conduct a meticulous review of the documents before deciding.
It would issue a statement once its response was decided.
The EU Commission imposed a  fine of 5.331 million Ecu on the Holderbank holding company and  fines
on European subsidiaries.

The total  fine for the Holderbank group amounts to 15.328 million Ecu, around 24.7 million Swiss francs.
Analysts and markets had feared a  fine in the worst case could amount to some 80 million francs.
In early November Holderbank forecast a 37 percent rise in its group net profit for 1994, up from 1993's
438 million.

"The fines imposed by the EC Commission will have no bearing on the year-end forecasts for the holding company and the group as published by Holderbank on November 4, 1994," it said.

It added provisions for general business risks had been maintained in the holding company, which should be able to raise 1994 net earnings by eight percent to 92 million francs.

"The consolidated earnings forecast for this year also remains unchanged at 600 million francs, up 37 percent, as a potential  fine was factored into the related projection," Holderbank said.

Holderbank added its parent company and subsidiaries that had been  fined "were not aware of having taken any actions detrimental to competition" and had always rejected the Commision's allegations.

It may therefore decide to appeal to the Court of First Instance of the EU in Luxembourg and even take the matter to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

In addition to the Holderbank holding company, Holderbank's subsidiaries that were  fined include Hamburg-based Alsen-Breitenburg Zement- und Kalkwerke GmbH (a  fine of 3.841 million Ecu), Nordcement AG of Hanover (1.850 million Ecu), CEDEST of Thionville, France (2.522 million Ecu) and HISALBA of Madrid (1.784 million Ecu).

The EC Commission's investigation against European  cement producers was launched in the late
1980s, and in November 1991 it accused a large number of companies and industry associations of
restricting competition and of having reached agreements with each other, Holderbank said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Belgian cement company Cimenteries CBR said it contested a fine of
8.03 million Ecus set by the European Commission for the firm's involvement in an alleged cement
cartel.
CBR was fined 7.196 million Ecus for grey  cement and 836,000 Ecus for white  cement.

TD
"CBR contests the conclusions inferred by the Commission from the data of the dossier and will examine the most appropriate reaction to the decision in the forthcoming weeks," the company said in a statement.

CBR said it already started legal action for violation of the defendant's rights at a Luxembourg court in early 1992.
"Once more, CBR will invoke these objections," the statement said.
The Commission also fined the Belgian  cement federation 100,000 Ecus and a Luxembourg  cement
unit of Arbed SA ARBBt.LU 1.05 million Ecus.

A statement from the  cement association said the Spanish companies were "indignant" and disagreed with the position taken by the  European Commission.

"The real worry of European producers for the disloyal practices stemming from elevated state aid and international dumping has been reinterpreted by the Commission, giving as proof a non-existent cartel," the statement said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - The European Commission fined the majority of the 33 European cement companies it accused of running a cartel four percent of 1992 turnover because they seriously, and for a long time, broke European competition rules, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday.
About 10 smaller companies were  fined 2.8 percent of 1992 turnover.

TD
The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their turnover.

"In the first group are companies which participated actively in the  cartel during the 10 years it lasted," Van Miert told a news conference.
All the leading European  cement groups, including Holderbank, Lafarge Coppee, Italcementi, Ciment
Francais, Blue Circle and Heidelberger, are in the first group.

Fines have to be paid at the current exchange rate in Ecus, Van Miert said. This means they are particularly heavy for companies in countries were currencies have devalued since 1992, especially Italcementi, which together with Ciments Francais, which it has controlled since 1992, was  fined a total of 57 million Ecus.
Van Miert said that for Swiss and Swedish companies, the  fine was based on the turnover for  cement
only, because they were not part of the EU and therefore did not have an EU turnover.

He said the Commission had taken into account when fining Greek companies the fact that they had tried to leave the  cartel but were more or less forced back into it by a "carrot and stick".

He also said that for Portuguese and Spanish firms the Commission had taken into account that they only took part in the  cartel after they entered the EU in 1986

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Belgian shares profited from the firmer dollar and fresh gains on Wall Street to close 0.52 percent higher despite unabated pressure on non-ferrous metals firm Union Miniere.

The Bel-20 index ended 7.35 points, or 0.52 percent, higher at 1,409.56 on the penultimate day of the forward market trading account.

TD
Total volume in Belgian shares was worth 1.4 billion francs and included several Belix baskets of Bel-20 shares. About one third was accounted for by Union Miniere, which again fell victim to warrants-related selling.

One dealer said an increasing number of people believed in an end-of-year rally. "But the more (that) believe it, the less likely it is to happen," he said jokingly. Any further rise will depend on the dollar and Dow, he added.

Union Miniere (UM), which already shed 1.2 percent on Tuesday on selling related to its covered call warrants, ended 0.4 percent down at 2,525 francs. The Brussels bourse earlier decided to extend the CATS listing of the warrants to December 15.

One dealer said he thought UM's parent company, Societe Generale de Belgique, was supporting UM's share price.

Dealers noted that UM had fallen from 2,750 francs recently despite a considerable rise of the dollar as well as higher zinc and copper prices.

"But it's been forced down on its knees by some three million warrants brought on the market in one month. Nobody now dares touch it," one dealer said.

Cement maker CBR appeared unaffected by news the European Union set record fines on 33 cement firms, and closed 25 francs higher at 12,125 francs. But after the close of trading the European Commission announced it fined CBR a total 8.03 million Ecus for its involvement in an alleged
cement cartel.

Polyurethane foam producer Recticel was among the biggest losers, its ordinary stock falling 2.1 percent to 472 francs and its preferred stock sliding 2.8 percent to 626.

One dealer said he thought the fall might be linked to news earlier this week the company is involved in a trial over compensation claims by ex-managers of a former subsidiary.
The trial was due to start on Wednesday. Recticel was not available for comment.

LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Blue Circle Industries Plc, the biggest UK  cement company, said it will appeal in an EU court against a  European Commission ruling fining it 15.8 million Ecus after a cement cartel inquiry.

"Blue Circle are going to appeal against the Commission's ruling...Blue Circle does not believe it was part of a cartel," a company spokesman told Reuters. The appeal will be made to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

TD
The Commission earlier said it was fining 33 European  cement companies, eight national associations and the European  Cement Association 248 million Ecus after a lengthy  cartel inquiry.

The spokesman for Blue Circle said no  fine had to be paid over before the court's verdict -- which could take years -- and that any payment ultimately made would be entered as an exceptional charge in the group's accounts.

A Blue Circle statement later said: "BCI (Blue Circle Industries) has defended itself vigorously against the Commission's allegations and has previously challenged the manner in which the Commission conducted the investigation."

A statement issued by the Commission in Brussels said: "The producers cannot deny that they knew perfectly well that they were engaged in illegal activities when, during a meeting of the European group, their president told them 'It almost goes without saying that there will be no minutes of our meetings'."
The fine imposed on Blue Circle was far from the harshest. Italy's Italcementi was  fined 32.49 million
Ecus. -- Brian Love, London newsroom +44 71 324 7719

LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuter) - Blue Circle Industries Plc, the UK's largest cement producer, can breathe a sigh of relief after news of a 15.8-million-Ecu European Commission fine which was not nearly as hefty as many had expected, share analysts said.

"It's a record (overall)  fine...but the result is relatively better than we were braced for," said Robert Fleming analyst Martin Murch, adding that the  fine, if paid, would have only a small impact on earnings.

TD
The Commission earlier imposed an overall  fine of 248 million Ecus on  cement firms across Europe for carving up the market to keep prices high. Blue Circle's was third highest.

"It's out of the way now," Panmure Gordon analyst Howard Proctor said. "It's lifted a cloud from the shares."

Proctor said the company would have to write off the amount as an exceptional item in the current year's accounts but that this meant little as far as underlying profits were concerned.
"It makes no difference to the underlying figure.."
Both analysts agreed that a  fine imposed in the same case on Rugby Group Plc, the third largest UK
cement producer, would have little impact.
Rugby was fined 5.1 million Ecus in the Commission ruling.

Rugby and Blue Circle said they would appeal against the  fines, which means they do not have to pay over any money until the case is dealt with by the European Court of Justice.
Murch noted that some continental European firms might be harder hit by the  fines.

But he said the Commission had "failed to pin the industry down" to the extent some thought it might have and noted that some  fines could ultimately be quashed in the European court. -- Brian Love +44

The UK's second biggest  cement producer, Castle  Cement Ltd, was fined 7.96 million Ecus in the same cartel case.

HD         EU levies huge fine on cement cartel. BY         By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuter) - A muscle-flexing European Commission on Wednesday clobbered 33
cement firms and nine trade associations with a huge fine for colluding to keep prices high.

It said the companies, including most of the largest in Western Europe, had created a  cartel to carve up the market.

TD
The fines totalling 248 million European currency units (about $305 million) was the largest the
Commission has levied.

Underlining the seriousness of the move, the Commission said it had given the companies three months to pay, far less leeway than given before to companies found to be colluding.

"The producers cannot deny that they knew perfectly well that they were engaged in illegal activities when, during a meeting of the European group, their president told them "It almost goes without saying that there will be no minutes of our meetings'," the Commission, the EU's executive, said in a statement.

Fines were levied on 33 companies in the European Union, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, eight national associations and the European  Cement Association.

Among the  fines were 32.5 million Ecus ($39.9 million) on Italy's Italcementi, 24.7 million Ecus ($30.4 million) on France's Ciments Francais and 15.8 million Ecus ($19.4 million) on Britain's Blue Circle. All fines were calculated on the companies' 1992 turnover.
The Italcementi group was one of the worst hit because it has controlled Ciments Francais since 1992. The Commission has responsibility for anti-trust enforcement in the European Union and can  fine
non-EU companies that do business in the bloc.

It has become increasingly aggressive over the past few years in rooting out collusion among businesses, but the  cement producers' fine was the strongest response yet.

"This case is the biggest case that we have ever had to deal with. The infraction lasted for a long time," Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference.

He warned that the Commission would continue to put heavy punishments on companies found to be violating the EU's competition rules. "There are still cartels in some areas...the fight is going to be more and more complicated, but this policy is going to be continued with determination," he said.

The Commission's previous record for a  fine was 130 million Ecus ($158 million) imposed in July on 23 carton board manufacturers and associations.
A number of the  cement producers said they would appeal against the  fine to the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg.

"Blue Circle are going to appeal against the Commission's ruling...Blue Circle does not believe it was part of a cartel," a company spokesman told Reuters in London.

The Brussels-based European  Cement Association, CEMBUREAU, also said it would appeal. It was
fined a symbolic 100,000 Ecus, about $121,000.

"CEMBUREAU yet again vigorously denies the charges of anti-competitive behaviour brought forward by the Commission," a spokesman said.
Others fined included Germany's Dyckerhoff, 12.3 million Ecus ($15 million) and Heidelberg Zement,
15.7 million Ecus ($19.2 million); France's Lafarge Coppee 22.9 million Ecus ($27.9 million), and Italy's
Unicem's 11.7 ($14.3 million).

HD   COMMISSION IMPOSES HIGHEST FINE EVER ON CEMENT CARTEL MEMBERS. WC  354 words
PD   1 December 1994

LP
Brussels, 30/11/1994 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, on the initiative of Commissioner Karel Van Miert, the  European Commission condemned the cement cartel by imposing record fines (248 million ecus in total) on companies and enterprise associations that made up the  cartel. These companies are located in all of the twelve Member States and in three EFTA countries: Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

Speaking at a press conference, Mr Van Miert explained the reasons for this condemnation and the size of the fines: the long duration of the violation (since 1983); the extent of the  cartel (which covers almost all European production); the seriousness of the violations (market sharing, regular exchanges of information); the size of the market (some 7 billion ecus in annual turnover); the high number of associated companies
(8) and companies involved (33).

TD
According to Mr Van Miert, the producers were aware of the illegal nature of their behaviour. The Commission has nevertheless taken into account, in deciding the amount of fines to be paid, that the Community companies had to face up to increased and sudden flows in cement imports during the period taken into consideration in the inquiry at a time when Community industry was finding it difficult to emerge from a bad economic situation.

EUROPE has reason to believe that the Commission decision was adopted by majority, with a number of commissioners feeling it would have been appropriate to take some extenuating circumstances into account.

The agreement had been formed within Cembureau, an organisation in which a number of principles had been developed aimed in particular at the respect of national markets, market sharing, and a coalition of producers in order to face up to the threat of low-price  cement exports from Greece and export agreements.
The largest  fines were imposed on: Italcementi (Italy): 32.5 million ecus; Societe des Ciments Francais:
24.7 million; Lafarge Coppee (France): 22.8 million; Blue Circle Industry (UK): 15.8 million; Heidelberger
Zement (Germany): 15.6 million; Dyckerhoff (Germany): 12.3 million; Unicem (Italy): 11.6 million.

Cimpor and Secil are to appeal over  fines imposed by the European Commission over a cement cartel involving 33 European companies. Cimpor has been  fined ECU 9.32m (Esc 1.8bn), Secil has been set a fine of ECU 3.01m (Esc 558m) while the  cement association ATIC faces a  fine of ECU 70,000 (Esc 13m).

Cimpor said its behaviour did not break EU rules. The  fine of almost Esc 1.8bn would not affect this year's results nor the level of the dividend. However, it would be a burden on previous financial years.

TD
The president of the executive committee at Secil, Carlos Alves, told Diario de Noticias that there was no arrangement with Spanish  cement companies. Secil did not export to Spain because it lacked the capacity to do so. Only this year would Secil export to its Iberian neighbour because of the freeing up of some capacity on the Portuguese market.

ATIC secretary general Lourenco Antunes expressed his complete surprise over the  fine since they were just a technical association. There was no provision for the  fine whlie the annual budget for the ATIC was only Esc 50m. Cimpor and Secil are members of the association.

Spanish cement companies have received fines from the European Commission over secret
agreements to distort competition, which operated on an Europe wide basis. For instance, Asland has been
fined ECU 5m or 853m ptas.  Fines for the Spanish and Portuguese  cement companies have been set at a
level of 70% to reflect the 1986 entry of the two countries to the European Community. Valenciana de
Cementos and Hisalba have only been  fined at a rate of 2.8% since they either broke the illegal
agreement or did not fulfill it in relation to exports.

The European Commission imposed a record industry  fine of 248 million European Currency Units ($419 million) on 33 of Europe's largest  cement companies for operating a cartel. The fine signals an increasingly tough stand by the European Union's executive against price fixing  and other
anti-competitive practices. The commission  fined cartonboard makers in July and steel makers in February. The biggest  fine was imposed on Italy's Italcementi SpA. The fines reflect the size of each company and their degree of involvement in the  cartel. The European Cement Association, a Brussels-based trade group, said the  fines were unjustified and it would appeal.

The European Commission's ECU 248m  fine on the European  cement cartel is a record but may have little impact on the share prices of the companies concerned. Large penalties had already been fully discounted by the market. In fact, the  fines - at up to 6% of relevant 1992 turnover - were lower than the
10% some had feared. So share prices could even benefit a bit.

TD
The bigger danger for  cement makers would be if the Commission's crackdown led to a more competitive market. Certainly, they would be extremely foolish to collude to carve up the market. But collusion may
not be necessary to keep competition at bay. The high cost of transporting  cement means the market is naturally divided into local monopolies. It typically does not pay one manufacturer to ship  cement to a different territory even if prices there are high. Nor is there much incentive to build new plants in
high-price locations. There is no need for new capacity and in any case #100m in capital would have to be sunk into a new 1m tonne plant. The risk that an established operator would react to a new entrant by slashing prices is too great for most companies to contemplate.

Still, there are situations where more competition may develop. Coastal regions are vulnerable since it is cheaper to transport  cement by sea than land. Cheap Greek imports have already had an impact on prices on the shores of Spain and France. The French hinterland could also prove tempting to competitors since prices there are much higher than the European average. But so well dug-in are the French companies that a serious invasion would require great bravery.

Investors have long suspected that Argyll is more vulnerable to intense competition in food retailing than J. Sainsbury or Tesco. The fears were borne out yesterday and, as a result, the shares fell 6% despite pre-tax profits up in line with expectations.

There are three problems. First, the decline in like-for-like sales in the first half worsened in the first six weeks of the second half. This is worrying since like-for-like sales are rising at Sainsbury and Tesco, which appear to have beaten off the threat from discounters. Second, gross margins slipped in the first half, and are unlikely to show any marked improvement over the full year as the group continues to cut prices. Third, there will be no announcement on the group's long-awaited restructuring, expected to cut costs by at least #30m, until the spring. It would have been damaging to morale to announce job cuts in the busy period ahead of Christmas. But the group should not have given the impression earlier in the year that details would be revealed by now.

These issues apart, the group is taking the right steps to entice high-spending young families into its stores. Moreover, the fact that sales per square foot are far behind its bigger rivals means there is scope for an acceleration in earnings growth as the gap is narrowed. The shares are unlikely to fall significantly further after yesterday's correction as they are underpinned by a yield of nearly 6% assuming a full year dividend of 12p.

The UK's private finance initiative has so far been characterised by much noise and little action. The chancellor's claim this week that #5bn of contracts would be awarded by the end of 1995 may prove accurate but that is not saying much: for a start, the figure includes the #2.7bn Channel tunnel rail link which is not scheduled to finish until 2002. In the short term, the most the construction industry can expect from the initiative is a palliative for the cuts in infrastructure spending announced in the Budget.

Nonetheless, there now seems sufficient political commitment to make a success of the initiative in the long term. One effect will be to polarise the construction sector. Companies such as John Laing and Tarmac, which have strong enough balance sheets to make equity investments, may find the volatility of their earnings eventually reduced. If they can properly balance risk with return they should also generate good profits.

Smaller groups will be reduced to participating as minor partners in large consortia. In theory, their financial weakness should trigger industry consolidation. However, hostile bids are unlikely because little is publicly known about the value of construction companies' contracts. Friendly mergers are also unlikely. Most groups continue to be led by powerful personalities reluctant to cede control.

Hoechst is showing atypical dynamism. Yesterday's results were better than expected. That was partly due to an early dividend from its PVC joint-venture. But aggressive cost reduction also played an important role: the number of parent company employees has fallen 12% year on year. Margins may still look low by comparison with other German chemicals groups, but these have been depressed by restructuring charges.

Mr Jurgen Dormann, who became chairman this year, has also been sorting out Hoechst's problem businesses. The dyestuffs, fibres and acrylics operations have each been spun off or merged with other groups. Yesterday Mr Dormann publicly announced he would strengthen the drugs business by making a US acquisition. It certainly needs help: margins last year were just 10% compared with Bayer's 19%. An acquisition will not be a panacea. It may add market share but more will be needed to boost Hoechst's unproductive research and development.

Although Hoechst's pre-tax profits rose 83% during the first nine months, its shares are where they started the year - primarily because of worries about the US economy. Until a drugs deal is announced, they will probably continue to tread water. Hoechst's cash-flow may be substantial. But unlike BASF and Bayer, it has net debt, making investors more concerned about acquisitions. Provided the group can allay such fears, the combination of strong volume growth and the full benefit of price rises should drive Hoechst's shares forward.

European cement manufacturers put in mixed performances as they awaited details of the fines imposed by the European Commission on 33 companies after a five-year investigation into a cement industry cartel. Details were made public after most markets closed, and subsequently a number of the companies announced their intentions to appeal.
Mr Martin Murch at Robert Fleming Securities said the  fines, which averaged 5 to 6% of the companies'
1992 turnovers, were sharply less than the 10% maximum which could have been imposed, and which
some people had feared. Mr Murch believed that shares could bounce higher in coming days in further
response.

TD
In Italy, Italcementi, which earned the highest  fine, fell L184 to L10,336, but in the opposite direction, Lafarge Coppee, in France, rose FFr 16.10 or 4% to FFr 413.10 and Ciments Francaise picked up FFr 1 to FFr 170. Holderbank, in Switzerland, was marked SwFr 8 lower late in the day to SwFr 1,029, while CBR, in Belgium, was BFr 75 down at BFr 11,950. In Germany, Dyckerhoff fell DM 30 to DM 650 and Heidelberger rose DM 29 to DM 1,255.
FRANKFURT moved modestly higher amid low turnover. The Dax ended official hours with a gain of
3.98 at 2,048.26, and then climbed to 2,057.28 in the Ibis session. Turnover was DM 5bn. Dealers
remarked that the bund future lifted stocks late in the day.

Hoechst finished with a gain of 50 pfennings at DM 314.50 in the official session, adding a similar amount in the Ibis after reporting a rise of more than 80% in pre-tax profits to September, above analysts' expectations. Goldman Sachs, which raised its full-year forecast to above DM 2bn, noted that there was scope for further outperformance, 'helped by the more rapid feed-through of higher earnings and dividends'.
Elsewhere in the sector, Bayer was up DM 1.60 to DM 343.80 and then to DM 347.40 in the post, and
BASF, down to DM 304.20 in normal hours, recovered to DM 305.50 later.

Deutsche Babcock lost DM 6.50 to DM 205.50 and then rose to DM 206.7 in the post following losses earlier in the week on weaker-than-expected results.

PARIS found its motivation mainly in technical factors as the November CAC-40 futures contract expired. In the cash market the CAC 40 index put on 36.69 or 2% to 1,976.66, in higher than average turnover of above FFr 5bn.
Thomson-CSF, which is thought to be a candidate for an overseas defence contract, gained FFr 8.20 or
5.1%, to FFr 169.

Accor made FFr 12 to FFr 587 on reports that it was likely to meet its target of selling some FFr 2.5bn of assets by the end of 1995.

Cap Gemini Sogeti rose FFr 3.90 to FFr 184.80 after announcing that, together with IBM France, it had won a FFr 500m contract.

MILAN turned its attention to worries that the day's last-ditch talks between the government and unions on budget reform and the budget plan would fail to prevent tomorrow's planned general strike and the Comit index eased 1.24 to 625.72.

Olivetti gained L48 to L1,927 after the cabinet gave the green light to the mobile phone contract awarded to its Omnitel consortium.

Credito Romagnolo, which resumed trading after a two day suspension, picked up L568 or 3.3% to L17,664 on expectations that Credito Italiano would make an improved bid. Italiano picked up L29 to L17,664 after recent losses, amid doubts by some analysts that it would necessarily succeed in winning over the Bologna-based bank this time round.

ZURICH put in a firm performance in low volumes, the SMI index finishing 10.2 higher at 2,594.9, supported by rising bond futures.
Nestle took its lead from the firmer dollar, rising SwFr 17 to SwFr 1,232 while a SwFr 6.50 slide in SMH
to SwFr 141.50 was attributed to a Goldman Sachs downgrade.
AMSTERDAM was supported overall by the dollar. The AEX index ended with a gain of 2.66 to 409.49. Nedlloyd put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 53.00 after reporting slightly firmer third quarter net profits, and saying that
it expected full year figures of around Fl 90m.

Unilever added Fl 1.30 to Fl 172.80, with Royal Dutch Petroleum up Fl 1.90 at Fl 190.70, and Philips 60 cents firmer at Fl 53.20.

HD        EC FINES CEMENT GROUPS AFTER CLAIMS OF RIGGING. BY         By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR.

The European Commission yesterday imposed record  fines on 33 European cement producers, accusing them of using secret agreements to rig the market for more than 10 years.

Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said the producers, eight national associations and the European Cement Association which masterminded the illegal operations, had three months to pay penalties totalling ECU 248m (#193m).

TD
The biggest producers in Italy, France, Britain and Germany said last night that they would appeal against the decision to the European Court in Luxembourg. Most of the other companies are expected to follow suit.

Companies will have to pay the  fines, or provide equivalent bank guarantees, pending the outcome of the appeal.
The stinging  fines reflect the Commission's determination to clamp down on producers which infringe
EU competition law. They were the third such penalties to be imposed on cartels so far this year.

'I hope now everyone has got the message,' said Mr Van Miert. 'There are still cartels out there that will do everything they can to stop us finding the evidence ... but we will continue, and we will upgrade our means for tackling cartels.'

The biggest  fine, of ECU 32.5m, was imposed on Italcementi of Italy, Europe's biggest  cement producer. The Swiss company Holderbank was  fined ECU 5.3m. La Societe des Ciments Francais, controlled by Italcementi, was  fined ECU 24.7m.

Italcementi said the Commission's charges were unfounded and that it would appeal, adding that the system of cement pricing in Italy meant it would have been impossible for the company to be part of a pan-European cartel.

Lafarge Coppee, the largest French producer, which was  fined ECU 22.8m, and Blue Circle, the largest British producer,  fined ECU 15.8m, also intend to appeal, as does Heidelberger, the largest German producer.

Blue Circle said it could take 18 months to two years before the appeal would be heard with judgment likely to take a further six months.  Cement producers from all 12 member states of the EU were affected.

Earlier this year Mr Van Miert levied  fines totalling ECU 100m on steel beam makers and ECU 132m on cartonboard producers.

The principle accusation against the  cement companies and associations is that from 1983 they colluded to reduce price differences between EU member states plus Norway, Sweden and Switzerland so as to remove any temptation to export and to get those producers which did export to align their prices with those of local producers.


Page 70 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
They thus blatantly breached the principles of the single market by maintaining artificial frontiers on the basis of domestic markets in an industry with an annual turnover of ECU 7bn.

The producers could not hope to deny their illegal activities, said the Commission. It alleged that at a meeting of the European group, the chairman stated that 'needless to say there will be no minutes of this meeting'.

The Commission said that it had taken into account the fact that EU companies had been faced with a surge in cement imports, just as they were struggling to emerge from recession.

EC takes tough line on breaches of competition rules

THE European Commission yesterday slapped record  fines totalling 248 million ecus (#193.5 million) on 33 cement companies - including Britain's Blue Circle Industries, Castle  Cement and Rugby - for operating a cartel to carve up the European market.

TD
The competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said the high penalties imposed in this and two other cartel cases earlier this year showed the commission was determined to crack down on serious breaches of EU competition rules. "After what happened this year, I hope that everyone has got the message," Mr Van Miert said.
Blue Circle was fined #12.3 million, Castle  Cement received a fine of #6.2 million, and Rugby was
fined #4 million.
The highest penalty, totalling 33.6 million ecus (#26.2 million), was imposed on Italcementi, while
Ciments Francais and Lafarge Coppee of France were each  fined more than 20 million ecus.

In addition to 33 companies in the EU, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway, the commission  fined eight national cement associations and the European  Cement Association.
Many of the company's immediately announced they would appeal.

Blue Circle said in a statement: "BCI has defended itself vigorously against the commission's allegations and has previously challenged the manner in which the commission conducted the investigation. BCI intends to appeal."

Yesterday's penalties were nearly twice those imposed on cardboard companies last July in what was then a record cartel case. The commission earlier this year also slapped hefty penalties on steel companies for running a  cartel.
Mr Van Miert said the  cement case was the biggest ever dealt with by the commission, with more than
70 companies initially under investigation.
According to the commission, the companies began working together in 1983 to divide up the 7
billion-ecu European  cement market along national lines. The firms agreed to avoid sales to customers
in other EU countries, and this "princ iple was underpinned by concerted practices involving the
exchange of information on price," the commission said.

The aim of the  cartel was to reduce price differences between national markets to "remove any temptation to export and to get those producers who did export to align their prices on those of local producers and thus avoid disrupting the market in the importing country," the commission added.

"The producers cannot deny that they were perfectly aware that they were engaging in unlawful activities since at a meeting of the European group, the chairman stated that 'needless to say there will be no minutes of this meeting'," the commission statement said.

According to Mr Van Miert, there was "very heavy-handed action" to keep  cement makers in line with the cartel. He said the companies were  fined either 4 per cent or 2.8 per cent of their European cement turnover, depending on how fully they participated in the  cartel.

_F By TOM STEVENSON.
Blue Circle has been  fined #12.3m for its part in a European price-fixing  and market protection  cartel
in the early 1980s.

TD
Its punishment is part of a total of #193m in  fines handed out by the European Commission to more than 30 companies, eight national  cement associations and the European Cement Association.

The Commission said: "The producers cannot deny that they knew they were engaged in illegal practices when, during a meeting of the European group, their president told them: `It goes without saying that there will be no minutes of our meeting.' "
Blue Circle said it would appeal against the  fine as it had previously complained about the way the
Commission was conducting its inquiry.

A spokesman said the company was confident of overturning the decision. The Commission has already admitted that the high expense of transporting  cement means local companies are likely to dominate domestic markets.

The market shrugged off the  fine, with Blue Circle's shares closing 3p higher at 304p. Market rumours had put a possible  fine at #20m, so there was a measure of relief that the company had come out of the affair relatively lightly.

In theory the  European Commission has the right to fine companies up to 10 per cent of their turnover. In Blue Circle's case that could have led to a fine of up to #100m.

In coming to its conclusions, the Commission ignored the claims of the  cement companies that some industry co-operation was necessary in the late 1980s to combat unfairly low pricing or dumping by Greek firms.

Irish Cement also said it would challenge a  fine of #2.7m for alleged anti-competitive practices. Its managing director, Declan Doyle, denied that Irish  Cement was in any way involved with the alleged violations.

HD           EU FINES CRH FIRM #2.8M FOR ITS ROLE IN CEMENT CARTEL. BY           By TOM MCENANEY.

IRISH Cement Ltd (ICL), a subsidiary of the CRH group, has been  fined almost #2.8m by the European Commission for being part of a European  cartel. The Irish company has rejected the Commission's verdict, which is says it will challenge.

As reported in yesterday's Irish Times, CRH has been found guilty of infringements of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. The specific allegations against the EU  cement industry include price  fixing, restrictive practices and general market sharing.

TD
In all 33 cement producers, eight national cement associations and the European  Cement Association (Cembureau) have been fined a total of 248m ecus (#196.3m) for being part of a  cartel since 1983. The  fine is the largest in the history of the EU.

Two levels were set in deciding how much individual firms should be  fined, a spokesman for the Commission's Competition Directorate said yesterday. "Companies which were involved in some aspects of the infraction were fined 2.8% of their turnover while firms which were involved in all aspects of the infraction were fined 4% of their turnover," he said.

Irish Cement was fined 4% of its 1992 turnover, or 3.524m ecus. Its parent, CRH, is Ireland's second largest industrial group and is the fourth largest public company in the country.

Irish Cement last night denied any wrongdoing. "ICL has demonstrated in very detailed submissions to the Commission that it is not in any way involved with Article 85 infringements. Despite today's announcement our position remains the same," the company said in a statement last night.

"We intend to challenge the imposition of this  fine on Irish Cement, in the appropriate manner, once we have studied the full report."

In his report the Commissioner responsible for competition policy, Mr Karel van Miert, said the level of the fines was justified for a number of reasons:
. The infringement had gone on for a long time (since 1983);. The acts committed were serious;
. The market was a substantial one, estimated at 7bn ecus (#5.54bn).

The Commission said it had taken account of the fact that European Union firms had been faced with a sudden surge in cement imports, "just when the Community industry was having difficulty emerging from the recession".

Commission investigations have shown that  cement may be supplied profitably over long distances. "Cement supplies are possible from Germany and Spain to the United Kingdom and Ireland," the Commission said.

The Commission found that a number of European manufacturers had set up information and coordination bodies such as the European  Cement Export Committee and the European Export Policy Committee. It found that these bodies had "monitored exports and export forecasts, compared supply and demand on home and export markets and exchanged information on prices."


Page 77 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"According to information found on the premises of the  cement producers, this principle was underpinned by concerted practices involving the exchange of information on prices.

"The aim was to reduce price differences between the various countries so as to remove any temptation to export and so as to get those producers who did export to align their prices on those of local producers and thus avoid disrupting the market in the importing country.

"The producers cannot deny that they were perfectly aware that they were engaging in unlawful activities since, at a meeting of the European group, the chairman stated that: `Needless to say there will be no minutes of this meeting'," the Commission said.

As well as documenting cross European collusion the Commission instanced a number of individual cases where companies had worked to hinder competition. Included in those cases were agreements between firms in France and Germany, France and Italy, and Portugal and Spain.
The Commission backed up its allegations with documents found during surprise inspections.

HD         EU FINES CARTEL CEMENT FIRMS AROUND FOUR PCT OF 92 TURNOVER. WC        285 words

BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuter) - The European Commission fined the majority of the 33 European cement companies it accused of running a cartel four percent of 1992 turnover because they seriously, and for a long time, broke European competition rules, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Wednesday.
About 10 smaller companies were  fined 2.8 percent of 1992 turnover.

TD
The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their turnover.

"In the first group are companies which participated actively in the  cartel during the 10 years it lasted," Van Miert told a news conference.
All the leading European  cement groups, including Holderbank, Lafarge Coppee, Italcementi, Ciment
Francais, Blue Circle and Heidelberger, are in the first group.

Fines have to be paid at the current exchange rate in Ecus, Van Miert said. This means they are particularly heavy for companies in countries were currencies have devalued since 1992, especially Italcementi, which together with Ciments Francais, which it has controlled since 1992, was  fined a total of 57 million Ecus.
Van Miert said that for Swiss and Swedish companies, the  fine was based on the turnover for  cement
only, because they were not part of the EU and therefore did not have an EU turnover.

He said the Commission had taken into account when fining Greek companies the fact that they had tried to leave the  cartel but were more or less forced back into it by a "carrot and stick".

He also said that for Portuguese and Spanish firms the Commission had taken into account that they only took part in the  cartel after they entered the EU in 1986

PARIS, Dec 1 (Reuter) - Shares in French cement companies Lafarge Coppee and Ciments Francais, a unit of Italcementi, fell following Wednesday's fines by the European Commission on alleged
anti-competitive practice.
Lafarge Coppee eased 2.60 francs to 410.50 on volume of 57,960 shares by 0924 GMT, while
Ciments Francais gave up 3.20 francs to 163.0 on turnover of 2,544.

TD
One trader said there was profit-taking on Lafarge Coppee, which rose four percent yesterday.

The French  cement industry is appealing the  fine. Lafarge Coppee said the penalty would not change its 1994 outlook.

The Commission fined Lafarge Coppee 190 million francs after its five-year long inquiry into alleged price fixing  in the European  cement industry.

The penalty was smaller than the market expected and the company said its general provisions covered the amount.

Lafarge Coppee has denied the allegation and said it has experienced tough competition in the last five years.

Brussels fined a total 32 European firms for allegedly running a  cartel, with a majority of those companies penalised for four percent of their 1992 turnover.

COPENHAGEN, Dec 1 (Reuter) - Danish Aalborg Portland A/S, half-owned by Britain's Blue Circle, said it will appeal to the European Court of Justice against a  European Commission ruling fining it
4.008 million Ecus after a  cement cartel inquiry.

A company statement said Aalborg had not taken part in and had not known about the alleged  cartel    agreement. It claimed the European Commission fine was based on a general assumption that all members of the European Cement Association automatically were parties in a deal to carve up the market.

TD
"It will be expected that the European Court of Justice makes a real evaluation of Aalborg Portland's role in the alleged  cartel deal," an Aalborg statement said.

The Commission said it was fining 33 European  cement companies, eight national associations and the European  Cement Association 248 million Ecus after a lengthy  cartel inquiry.

HD          EU's cartel-busting success  not matched on aid front. BY          By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Dec 1 (Reuter) - The  European Commission is proving increasingly efficient in fighting price-rigging practices, in sharp contrast to its difficulties in weaning some of Europe's top companies off state subsidies.

In a third show of strength this year, the European Union's competition watchdog hammered European cement firms with a record 248 million European currency units (Ecus) ($305 million) in  fines on Wednesday for running a  cartel.

TD
Four months earlier it had penalised European carton-board makers for agreeing a strategy to keep prices artificially high after fining steel beam producers in February for the same reasons.

But the Commission has proved much less successful in reining in public subsidies to major European companies, especially state-controlled ones.

Industry analysts and antitrust lawyers often blame the Commission for bowing to government pressure when it comes to big cases.

Only recently it cleared 20 billion francs ($3.7 billion) in aid to the French airline Air France and 2.5 billion Ecus ($3.05 billion) for Enichem, the chemical subgroup of Italy's state holding company ENI.

In a much smaller case, but one which has particular importance for heavily  fined cement firms like Italy's Italcementi, Germany's Dyckerhoff and France's Lafarge Coppee, it has also apparently failed to put an end to subsidies paid to Greek  cement companies.

"The Commission ruled that aid paid to Greek  cement was illegal, but nothing was done to stop it," an industry official told Reuters.

Cement companies involved in the  cartel have pleaded self-defence against low-price Greek exports and European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has admitted receiving complaints that subsidies were still being paid to Greek producers.

But he argued that distortion of competition by subsidised imports did not justify creating a  cartel to carve up markets.
"You cannot use that argument to take the law into your own hands," he told a news conference on
Wednesday.

Cement companies in the EU, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway were accused in particular of setting up a joint trading company to absorb Greek  cement and prevent if from being exported to certain markets, the Commission said.

But only if the Commission can tackle state subsidies to industry as convincingly as it deals with market-rigging will it's authority be fully recognised, anti-trust lawyers say.

It will soon have a chance to prove this is the case when the Spanish government seeks approval of a plan to inject more aid into its airline Iberia just two years after the Commission approved another aid package "for the last time".

LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuter) - Castle  Cement Ltd, which is owned by Euroc AB and Aker A/S and is the second biggest UK  cement producer, said it will probably appeal against a  European Commission    fine announced yesterday.

"The company continues to deny the charges and is likely to appeal," a spokesman for the company said.

TD
His firm was told to pay 7.96 million Ecus out of an overall  fine of 248 million Ecus which the European Commission imposed on cement producers across Europe on the grounds that they had operated an illegal cartel to control prices over 10 years.
Castle has about a quarter of the UK  cement market.

UK market leader Blue Circle Industries Plc, which has about half the market, and Rugby Group Plc, which has about 20 percent of the market, were also  fined 15.8 million Ecus and 5.1 million Ecus respectively.

Analysts say those two  fines are less severe than expected, have cleared the air after years of speculation about the damage which large  fines might cause and are unlikely to inflict any real pain on either company or their shares.
Both firms intend to appeal against the  fines in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

From Wolfgang Munchau in Brussels.

THE European Commission yesterday imposed a #200m  fine on 42 companies and associations in the cement industry. It was the largest anti-cartel penalty imposed in Europe.

TD
Blue Circle, one of the three British companies involved, was said to be a ringleader and has been
fined #12.3m. It said it would appeal against the  fine, but the group, which made profits of #165m in
1993, will be making a provision for the amount of the penalty.

The other British companies  fined were Castle Cement, controlled by Norwegian and Swedish companies, which was  fined #6.4m, and the Rugby Group, #4.1m. Italcementi, the Italian  cement company, was fined #26m and a further #20m for its French subsidiary, Societe des Ciments Francais.

The Commission said the  cartel in Europe's #5.3bn cemince 1983. The heavy concentration in the industry, with six companies, including Blue Circle, accounting for half the EU market, favoured cartels.

Evidence was collected in a series of dawn raids which found incriminating memorandums and oral evidence, including a statement from the chairman of one of the companies that "needless to say there will be no minutes of the meeting".
In one memo, an Italian company agreed to carve up the Cote d'Azure market with a French firm. "A
war is pointless. Agreements must be concluded to avoid conflict," the memo said.

At Cembureau, the European  cement manufacturers' organisation, the Commission found a memo encouraging members to "contribute to the establishment of healthy competition" and "establish rules of the game amongst themselves so as to avoid improper competition". In 1986, several members of Cembureau, which gave themselves the name of "European Task Force", decided to deal with low-price Greek cement imports by devising what they called a "carrot and stick" policy. Cembureau has also received a nominal fine.
The cartel operated in 15 countries, including three non-EU member states Switzerland, Sweden and
Norway. Spain, Germany and France were the countries with the most companies involved.

One flagrant example of the  cartel's behaviour was contained in a memo by a Spanish or Portuguese industry association. "The parties present, who may be regarded as the representatives of Spanish and Portuguese  cement producers, expressed their clear support for the principle that there should be no cement movements from Spain to Portugal or from Portugal to Spain."

The cartel operated through highly developed networks and front organisations, such as the European Cement Export Committee, whose aim was to monitor exports and forecasts, compare supply and demand on home and export markets, and exchange information on prices.

The Commission said "the purpose of these bodies was also to enforce the home market rule". Under EU law, the Commission can impose a maximum  fine of 10% of the companies' turnover. Yesterday's fines were well below that ceiling.

The Commission divided the manufacturers into prime offenders, who were charged 4% of their turnover, and lesser offenders, who will get away with 2.8%.

Many of the companies are expected to appeal, but the Commission's legal position has been strengthened recently by a European Court of Justice decision upholding a  fine levied on Tetra-Pak, of Sweden. Karel van Miert, the European Competition Commissioner, said: "I hope from now that industry has got the message. I do have a slight idea there are more cartels and they will do everything to
prevent us finding the evidence."

Wolfgang Munchau says investigators are going to need increased powers

Yesterday's clampdown on Europe's  cement industry shows that cartel-busting, of all aspects of European competition policy, is the most exciting. After a tip-off, the European Commission launched a dawn raid, which set in motion a predictable pattern of events.

TD
First came the pleas of innocence. Then a game of prisoners' dilemma, leading to the co-operation of
the most fainthearted suspects. Then came the lawyers and legal challenges. Then the pleas for mercy,
on the grounds of the "difficult economic climate" or some other excuse.

The Commission has this year curbed three large cartels in the industries of steel-beams, cardboard, and now cement. What the cases have in common is an almost cliche-like pattern of operating. When senior executives negotiate an illegal price-fixing agreement with their competitors, they do indeed meet in dimly lit backrooms of some hotel. They even take minutes of the meeting and follow up by sending out stiff memos, warning everybody to toe the line, or else.

The fight against cartels has become the single most successful element of European competition policy, which has otherwise lost all sense of purpose. State aid is mechanically approved, despite protestations to the contrary, as are mergers, except a few unlucky ones that are glaringly
anti-competitive and whose obstruction would also be politically acceptable. There have been only two such mergers over five years. Meanwhile, in the field of cartels, the Commission has struck three times this year alone. The reason is entirely political. One can defend an anti-competitive merger on some trumped-up political ground, but who would want to defend price collusion?

However, it is not certain whether the Commission can keep up the pace of its investigations. All three cases were launched several years ago, when Sir Leon Brittan still headed the competition section.

Furthermore, the Commission faces increasingly formidable legal obstacles. European lawyers, for whom cartel law has become an increasingly profitable area, have become more cunning at holding up an investigation.

Last year, one defence team complained successfully to the European Court of Justice that their client had not been given enough information by the Commission for them to present his case. However, in a test case earlier this year, the court ruled in favour of the Commission when it upheld the  fines imposed on Tetra-Pak of Sweden.

The most astonishing aspect of the cement cartel is that the industry should in theory not be particularly prone to international price  fixing.  The weight of cement and its relatively low price per pound, mean it makes little economic sense to transport it farther than 100 miles from its point of manufacture. There
are of course some overlaps, especially in those Benelux-France-Germany regions where 100 miles can span four countries.

Europe's  cement market is worth some #5.3bn a year. Despite the general rule that  cement does not travel, Britain was subject to what the British producers called "dumping" from Greece, an economic impossibility since Greece is a member of Europe's single market, while dumping applies only to imports. The British companies involved, Blue Circle and Rugby, apparently have used the dumping


Page 89 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
argument to excuse collusion. But that does not wash, especially since the industry could have used legal means to put an end to dumping or rather, anti-competitive selling-below-cost.

If cartel-busting were to become more serious, the amateurs might be crowded out the cardboard cartel, which imitated Al Capone, was the most hilarious but a more sophisticated class of colluders might be encouraged, people who do not meet in dark hotel rooms, write no self-implicating memos, or simply
use shredders. This year's successes are no reason for limitless optimism. The question of greater powers for cartel investigators will surface again sooner or later.

CEMENT MAKERS drew record  fines from the European Commission, which accused the concerns of carving up the European market. The fines against 33 cement producers and nine cement trade groups totaled $301 million -- nearly double the EU's previous record in a  cartel case. Many of the  cement companies -- including groups from Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- said they would appeal.

SEVERAL COMPANIES ANNOUNCE THEY WILL APPEAL TO THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE.

Brussels, 01/12/1994 (Agence Europe) - As EUROPE announced yesterday (pp.8-9), the European Commission has imposed a unprecedented  fine (Ecu 248 million) on 33 European cement producers and the associations having participated in the largest  cartel it has ever had to deal with. Several amongst them immediately announced their intention to appeal to the Courts against this decision which they dispute.

TD
Lengthy investigations and surprise inspections, since 1989, enabled the Commission to reconstruct what seemed to it to be true organization of competition between European  cement producers and a deliberate cutting up of the greater market. This infringement to the ban on concerted agreements (Art. 85 para 1 of the EEC Treaty) was operated at several levels:

1. the European  cement association Cembureau and its members were engaging in practices designed "to contribute to the establishment of a healthy competition and ...establish rules of the game amongst themselves so as to avoid improper competition"; the principle of respecting domestic markets had been established since 1983 and supported by information exchanges on prices, with the aim of reducing price differences between the various countries so as to remove any temptation to export and so as to get those producers who did export to align their prices on those of local producers. This  agreement apparently seemed effective as one of the conclusions drawn at a Cembureau meeting was that "pressure from
inter-member trade had slackened considerably through improved bilateral contacts";

2. the producers also agreed bilaterally to distribute markets among themselves (communication of tariffs and refusal to sell);

3. a coalition of  cement producers (European Task Force) was set up in 1986 within Cembureau to deal with the threat of low-price Greek  cement exports to a number of Member States after the Greeks had lost important markets in the Middle East. "Carrot" and "stick" measures were agreed on and a joint trading company (Intercement) was set up to absorb Greek  cement and prevent it from being exported to certain markets. According to the Commission, this single and continuous  agreement constituted an infringement to Article 85, having as goal to prevent  cement imports into the Community from Member States, of cutting up national markets to the benefit of local producers and to the detriment of the users.

4. several large European manufacturers set up information and coordination bodies with the purpose channelling production surpluses to third countries, so restricting the scope for members to sell within the Union, as well as creating a system of solidarity and monitoring to prevent competitors from encroaching on home markets within the Union; likewise, white-cement producers entered into restrictive practices
involving non-transhipment to home markets and the channelling of production surpluses to third countries, exchanging information on their individual production capacities, sales and prices.

The incriminated  cement producers were, according to the Commission, thus able to keep control of their national markets despite the establishment of the single market and benefit from high prices for their products, even if they did not directly fix prices through  agreement. At the outset, 80 companies were targeted in the Commission's investigation but their practices only had a Community scope for the 42 companies and groups incriminated. Amongst them, the Commission picked out: i) the companies which participated most actively and the longest in the  cartel (from 1983 to last year) by making them pay the heaviest fine, or 4% of the turnover they all made on the Community  cement market (including a Swiss cement producer, a Norwegian one and a Swedish one); ii) the Spanish and Portuguese  cement

producers which benefitted from the belated entry of the two countries into the Union, the Greeks who countered the logic of the  cartel having lost large outlets in the Middle East and a Luxembourg producer for his passivity in its participation (they were imposed 2.8%); iii) 8 national associations (D, B, Sp, F, Gr, Nl, UK) and Cembureau were also sanctioned; these  fines are intended to dissuade professional associations in future from initiating concerted agreements or from facilitating these. With these particularly stiff  fines (total value exceeding by far the Ecu 100 million and the Ecu 132 million, respectively, imposed on steel girder producers and carton producers), the Commission has more generally wanted to reaffirm its determination to pursue "all practices contravening the spirit of the greater market, both against consumers and against the economy in general". Commissioner van Miert, moreover, stressed that the infringements denounced, with proof, are undeniable. In spite of everything and despite the elements of proof it says it
has, the conclusions of the Commission are to be disputed beforethe Court of First Instance (notably by Belgian's CBR, the British group Rugby and Blue Circle, Irish  Cement, the Spanish Association Oficemen, and Cembureau.

HD   STANDARD FIREWORKS - BRITISH STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION. WC  2,235 words

LP
Has the BSI lost its grip as the country's standards-making organisation? Yes, say many who believe the BSI is being diverted from its proper task into making money from publishing, product testing and QA certification schemes. Graham Ridout reports on an explosive issue.

Fears are growing that an information overload, created by the welter of new British, European and international standards, is about to swamp construction.

TD
The thousands of new standards being generated are creating real problems for designers and product manufacturers which, in turn, are raising genuine concern about the British Standards Institution's ability to cope.

For designers, particularly smaller practices, the first question being asked is whether they will be able to keep abreast of the countless standards being issued, amended or withdrawn. Failure to conform with the relevant standards brings with it the risk of designers facing legal action for professional negligence if any faults arise in construction. A supplementary question is whether the cost of buying the standards - there could be more than 3500 of them - is too high for practices employing only a handful of people (see page
32).

Among product manufacturers, concern is growing that the amount of "unpaid-for time" they give by seconding staff to standard drafting committees, which is already considerable, is set to mushroom.

As for the BSI, the word is that the institution is struggling to cope with the scale of the undertaking and that it appears to be more interested in its publishing, product certification and BS 5750 quality management registration scheme activities.

Behind the propagation of all the new standards is the creation of the single market and with it the drive to remove all technical barriers to trade. At the heart of the matter is the Construction Products Directive. This sets out the basic performance requirements, such as for durability and thermal efficiency, around which
the European standards are being drafted.
The BSI estimates that about 2500 standards will be generated as a consequence of the directive. A further
1000 or so will be needed to cater for building services.

So far, relatively few of these 3500 standards have been finalised and published, for any number of reasons. These include difficulties in harmonising pan-European fire test requirements; internal bureaucracy slowing the work of the European Commission; and a general underestimation of the complexities involved in reaching agreement within the 12 member states and the six EFTA nations that are party to the European standards organisation CEN.

However, the EC's standards-making machinery is starting to crank up. An expert, who did not want to be named but who is involved in preparing standards, remarks: "The nightmare of it all is the number of drafts (complete standards or parts of standards sent out for comment) we are having to go through. In one month this year, 115 were issued. The average used to be between 40 and 60 a month. Over a
three-month period, I had a stack that stood over 3 ft high and weighed half-a-hundredweight."

He estimates that by the end of 1994, about 1000 standards will have been issued in draft form. Failure to put in an effective response to these draft standards brings with it the possibility that products, construction customs or design practices that are established in the UK could be unacceptable in the new wave of European requirements.

Page 95 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A fine example of this is the stock brick that gives so much character to many UK houses and buildings. The irregular dimensional properties and surface irregularities of stocks do not fit in with the EC "prescriptive" approach. The way the Eurostandard was drafted originally preferred the regular rectangular features found in the likes of engineering bricks. But for a concerted effort by the UK brick industry to stop it happening, the much-loved stock could have become unacceptable.

"My fear is that so many bits of paper are appearing as drafts that people will not realise the implications until they land on their desk as part of a standard, by which time they can do nothing about it," remarks the anonymous expert.

To give an example of the way the EC standards machine is working, he cites the standard that is being prepared covering particleboards. The document has been split into 38 sections and drafts of all these sections sent out for consultation. "I've also got 30 to 40 drafts at the moment just on plastic pipes." Another figure he mentions is that between 200 and 300 standards are in the pipeline covering doors, windows and ironmongery.

The reason there are so many standards and why they have been split into so many parts is because CEN, the European standards organisation, is trying to speed up the standardisation process. CEN reasons that dividing the standards into smaller bits means there is a better chance of  agreement being reached - and faster.

Every month the BSI lists the standards under review in BSi News - the magazine it sends to members of the institution. But as the expert points out: "The publishing schedule of BSi News means that sometimes people get only two months, not the full three months, to comment on the proposals if the BSI receives notification a day after the publication has gone to bed. And, of course, not everyone gets BSi News. So there are a lot of end-users who don't know what's going on."

Also, the way European standards are processed is different from the committee-reaching-a-consensus approach used by the BSI. With Eurostandards, a two-stage process is used. It involves finding a consensus through the BSI machinery and then briefing the UK delegation which has to press its case to the CEN committee. Like all matters European, the standards are as much about politics and maintaining national preferences as they are to do with technical details.

Traditionally in the UK, product manufacturers have played a leading role in standards-setting work by seconding staff, on an unpaid basis, to the drafting committees. But the extra cost involved in establishing European standards is making manufacturers think again.

Ken Hale, director for European affairs at the Building Material Producers, says: "Manufacturers are starting to balk at the cost of this exercise." E

E Last year, the BMP wrote to the Department of Trade and Industry expressing its concern. It said: "Standards are now primarily written at European level rather than within the BSI machinery, and they are no longer just voluntary expressions of technical consensus between producers and users, they are an extension to regulations written for the benefit of the nation. This is a fundamental change from the former need just of achieving technical consensus within the BSI, and it requires considerable commitment and a much broader understanding of political and commercial realities."

No figures are available on the cost of this exercise to British manufacturers, but one estimate is that it could be as high as #200m a year. The government used to fund standards work by matching industry contributions on a pound-for-pound basis. The current level of BSI funding amounts to #7m from the DTI, plus the DOE pays for any standards activities undertaken by the Building Research Establishment.

What jars with manufacturers is that the BSI's other business activities appear to have weakened its commitment to standards making. In the year to the end of March 1994, contributions to the BSI's turnover of #86.7m included #23m from publishing standards, #46m from its BS 5750 scheme, which registers firms with a quality management system, and a further #19m from product certification and testing.

When it was reviewing the role of the BSI last year, the DTI was told by the BMP that: "BSI QA and BSI Testing are separate businesses operating in a competitive marketplace. It would be irresponsible to
expose the financial viability of BSI Standards and the national interest it serves to the risks associated with the market performance of a competitive certification or testing body. There is the added concern that a relationship nurtured by commercial self-interest could foster allegations that BSI QA could influence standard making for its own benefit."

The DTI review has led to a reorganisation of the BSI. The institution has also had to cope with the loss of several key senior staff and has suffered the upheaval of moving to a newly refurbished headquarters building in Chiswick a few months ago.

Page 96 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Despite these mitigating circumstances, the criticisms of the BSI's capabilities will not go away. Another expert close to the institution, who also wanted to remain anonymous, says: "The BSI is losing out all round. The whole standardisation process is moving to Europe and the BSI is being marginalised. There is the real prospect that the BSI will be just a publisher of these new standards.

"Even then, it will not have a monopoly position because every country's standards organisation will be able to publish in any language it chooses. The Dutch are already publishing European standards in three languages and at a much cheaper price than the BSI."

He also says that one of the BSI's strong points, producing codes of practice, has been "left to drift and not been promoted, which has meant they have gradually been overtaken by other publications.

Lots of people - like the British  Cement Association, the Construction Industry Research and Information Association and even the DOE with the Building Regulations - are producing things that are replacing the codes of practice."

This prompted the setting-up of an advisory panel to recommend a strategy for general building codes. The panel supplied its report to the BSI in September. One member of the panel was Oliver Palmer, the former DOE senior official who wrote the original Approved Documents for the Building Regulations.

Palmer says: "One of the issues the BSI has to attack is that of pulling together all the many different guidance documents in a single framework document that practitioners can use.

"At present, it's a shambles. Someone on the drawing board with construction work ready to start and the bank manager screaming down the phone doesn't know where to turn.

"The BSI needs to be much more proactive. For example, it needs to tell the standards committees to do specific jobs and not let them just carry on in a vacuum as they do at present."

Another gripe, this time from architects, is that not only are standards expensive but also that the BSI is getting heavy handed with libraries that loan British Standards. For instance, Newcastle central library used to loan out British Standards and stocked every one of them. It has now stopped that service because the BSI asked for an annual licence fee of, reportedly, #20 000.
No comment was forthcoming from the BSI on this matter.

Frightening prospect. Architect Stephen Hodder had no idea there will soon be about 2500 new European standards.

"That prospect frightens me. The outlay and increase in overheads involved is bound to be of concern to all small practices," says the founder of Manchester-based, award-winning architect Hodder Associates.

"The time that architects get to design is already quite small. If it gets any less because of having to plough through all this new legislation, then heaven help us."

The seven-strong practice is not a member of the BSI but does subscribe to the specification and defects service offered by NBS Services. As for the BSI itself, Hodder says: "I can't say it's something I'm involved with or interested in."

To ensure the practice does not fall foul of current standards, Hodder says: "We surround ourselves with consultants who have the expertise. And we also find that the local authorities are very helpful and advise us. As a young practice, that's our way of compensating for our lack of knowledge."
Only part of the story

"Serving architects is only a small part of what the BSI does," says architect Peter Currie. "I think some people who are critical of the BSI have expectations that are too high."

Currie, who runs his own practice, Peter Currie Architects, is a BSI member. For just over #100 he receives an annual publications list and a monthly newsletter incorporating a list of new standards which he "skims and then throws in the bin". He estimates the practice spends about #100 a year on hard copies of standards that it uses extensively. He admits he does not try to keep up with changes as they happen. "If I did, it would be difficult," he concedes.

In addition, Currie subscribes to Barbour Microfile, which provides copies of up-to-date standards on microfiche at regular intervals throughout the year.

"I use them when I come across a particular technique that I'm not familiar with. For instance, a few years ago I was involved in work on a building in Yorkshire. I used two sources of information - a stonemason I

met up there and the relevant British Standard on rubble walls," he says. "The standards codify common practice in a form that any sensible builder can understand. But you have to ask whether they are applicable to what you're doing. I do a lot of work on older buildings where they don't often apply." - James Macneil.

Andrew Taylor points to high costs and a low value product in a cyclical industry.

The record fines announced on Wednesday by the European Commission on 33 cement companies for operating an illegal  cartel are not the first penalties European cement manufacturers have had imposed on them for allegedly trying to fix their markets.

TD
The German  Cartel Office in 1989 announced fines totalling DM 244m (#100m) against domestic manufacturers accused of operating a price-fixing  ring. In July 1992 the Italian anti-trust authority  fined cement producers L5bn (#2m) in the so-called Procal  cartel in southern Italy.

Not all cartels have been illegal. A 50-year-old legal common pricing  agreement in Britain was ended by manufacturers in 1987. Another legal  cement cartel in Switzerland established since 1911 is to be dismantled at the end of this year.

It will be replaced by a transport pooling arrangement to ensure that at least 51% of  cement is transported by rail to protect the environment. Rail traffic will be subsidised by a voluntary duty imposed on cement carried on roads.
In most cases however, such agreements are illegal.
What is it that makes  cement manufacturers so prone to operating market sharing and price-fixing
cartels?

The huge capital investment required to build a modern  cement works - a medium-sized plant costs about #100m - means that national markets increasingly have become dominated by a small number of large companies.

Cement is a relatively low value product, sold to a highly cyclical construction industry, making it even more tempting for producers to try to ensure price stability by making clandestine agreements.

Annual cement sales in the European Union, according to the European  Cement Association (Cembureau), rose by 22% during the five years between 1985 and 1990 only to fall by a tenth over the next three years.

Attempts to sell  cement across borders to offset big falls in domestic demand nonetheless have remained few. Imports as a proportion of total EU consumption have risen only from 5.8% to 12.7% between 1987 and 1993, according to Cembureau.

'Companies may be reluctant to sell substantial surplus volume in neighbouring countries as it could provoke retaliation and lead to a devastating regional price war,' says Mr Lawrence Amboldt, construction analyst with MP London Wall Equities.

For this reason few observers expect to see a dramatic change in the way in which large European cement producers operate in spite of the Commission's verdict. 'There may be some narrowing of price differentials between markets but I do not expect to see a great upsurge in cross border trade,' says Mr Amboldt.


Page 99 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
According to London Wall, seven large suppliers account for about half total European sales, excluding
Turkey, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Albania and former Yugoslavia.

The largest European supplier is Italcementi of Italy, although Holderbank of Switzerland is bigger worldwide. Italcementi, which has a European market share of more than 11%, also has a controlling interest in Ciments Francais, the second-largest French producer.

Other members of the big seven are: Heidelberger of Germany, which has a controlling interest in CBR, the largest Belgian producer, and has about 10% of the European market; Holderbank with almost 9%; Lafarge Coppee the largest French producer, almost 8%; Blue Circle of Britain, 4%; Dyckerhoff of Germany, 4%; and Euroc/Aker a Scandinavian joint venture with 3.5%.

Many of these companies control subsidiaries based in other EU markets but in most cases these make very modest cross-border sales.

Concentration of power is even greater in individual markets. Three companies, Blue Circle, Rugby and Castle, supply over 90% of  cement sold in Britain while four companies, Lafarge, Ciments Francais, Vicat and Holderbank supply over 90% of the French market.

The biggest threat to the large European producers comes from eastern European countries, such as Poland, which under communist rule established large  cement manufacturing capacity now searching for foreign currency alternative markets to sell surplus production.

Manufacturers in response have sought to gain control of eastern European producers as these have been privatised. 'Between them Holderbank, Heidelberger/CBR, Lafarge and Italcementi/Ciments Francais effectively have bought up the  cement industry in the Czech Republic,' says Mr Amboldt.

Emma Tucker on the  European Commission investigation of price-fixing.

The fat file sitting on European commissioner Karel Van Miert's desk is, he says, as good a read in places as a roman policier.

TD
Unfortunately for the curious, Mr Van Miert is not publishing his file but he could probably be forgiven the hyperbole given that it took three of the Commission's staff against 'an army of lawyers' five years to come up with its contents.

The file's contents relate to the alleged illegal manoeuvrings of 33 European  cement producers, plus one international cement association and eight national ones that over a period of 10 years colluded to rig Europe's cement market.

On Wednesday, a triumphant Mr Van Miert, competition commissioner, announced the imposition of record fines totalling ECU 248m (#193m) on the producers but warned that industry was getting better and better at hiding evidence of collusive behaviour.

'There are still cartels in some sectors and they will do anything they can to avoid us finding any evidence,' he said.
The chairman of one leading  cement producer is alleged to have said at the end of a collusive
get-together that no minutes of the meeting would be 'necessary'. The participants were, however, not
careful enough. A series of raids on the headquarters of all the leading EU  cement companies towards
the beginning of the investigation produced enough evidence to satisfy the Commission that a powerful
cartel was operating.
It alleges that the European  Cement Association - Cembureau - established what was known as the
'Cembureau agreement or principle of not transhipping to internal European markets'.

Through the exchange of information on prices the principle allowed producers to reduce price differences between countries so as to remove any temptation to export and to get those producers who did export to align their prices with those of local producers.

In effect, the system allowed the producers to maintain artificial frontiers on the basis of domestic markets. As Mr Van Miert said yesterday: 'If a German business wanted to buy  cement from a French producer, just 20km inside the frontier, it was not allowed to do so.'

Conclusions to one Cembureau meeting on intra-community trade said: 'Pressure from inter-member trade had slackened considerably through improved bilateral contacts. Exports had tended to shrink, but there was still a threat from outsiders'.

According to the Commission, exchanges of notes between French and Italian producers, for instance, reveal their decision to share the Cote d'Azur market. And at several meetings, the Portuguese and Spanish producers, represented by their associations, monitored  cement exports between the two countries so as to ensure that markets were shared.

One note from a meeting between the Spanish and Portuguese stated that: 'The parties present, who may be regarded as the repres-entatives of Spanish and Portuguese  cement producers, expressed their clear support for the principle that there should be no  cement movements from Spain to Portugal or
from Portugal to Spain.'

In 1986, after the loss of key Middle East markets, Greek producers started to threaten other markets with cheap exports. Cembureau reacted swiftly. It set up a joint trading company, called Interciment, to absorb Greek cement and prevent it from being exported to other markets.

Using heavy-arm tactics the Italian  cement producers also took action, ensuring that a big contract between an Italian buyer and Greek suppliers was broken. Meanwhile, other European  cement producers ended contracts with Greek producers to curb exports.

These practices continued right up until last year, according to the Commission. The companies - most of which are appealing - have three months to pay  fines that in some cases amount to 4% of their annual turnover in  cement.

The Commission hopes its action will introduce competition into Europe's  cement market. It has pointed out that  cement can be supplied profitably even over long distances.

'Cement supplies are possible from Germany and Spain to the UK and Ireland, while Italian producers are able to cross the Alps and supply  cement in Switzerland,' it said yesterday.

The relevant market is therefore Europe, it concluded. 'If the markets were sealed off by distance, there would be no reason for the behaviour of the firms as described in the infringement.'

WHAT are we to make of that #2.8m  fine imposed on Irish Cement by the European Commission for anti competitive practices? The Irish company was coy until the list was published. After The Irish Times reported last Wednesday that CRH's Irish Cement subsidiary was on the Commission's 33 strong  cartel busting list, the first response from Irish Cement appeared in the Evening Press. Managing director Mr Declan Doyle was quoted as saying he knew no more than what had appeared in The Irish Times. "CRH knows nothing of EC  fines for cartel practices" said the headline but later that afternoon the bad news came from Brussels and drew a quick riposte from Irish  Cement which called the Commission decision "totally unjustified". Mr Doyle added that the firm had provided "very detailed submissions" to the Commission on the cartel allegations.

LISBON, Dec 2 (Reuter) - The shares of Portugal's Cimpor dropped 70 escudos or 2.5 percent in early trade in reaction to a  fine imposed on it by the  European Commission for joining a cement industry cartel, but later recovered, dealers said.

"There is a correction in the Cimpor shares due to the  fine imposed by Brussels," a dealer said, referring to the early drop. "However, I think it is unlikely that we'll see a correction much bigger than the present one."

TD
Cimpor shares fell from Wednesday's close of 2,790 escudos to a low of 2,720 before recovering to stand up 10 at 2,800 at 0930 GMT. Thursday was a public holiday.

"The adjustment in Cimpor shares is not likely to be remarkable today," another dealer said. "There are few players in the market and they don't see much pressure to sell."

He added: "The Commission's decision is not the end of the matter as Cimpor is going to appeal and could win."
The government privatised a first 20 percent stake of Cimpor, Portugal's largest  cement company, in
July.

The EU Commission  fined Cimpor 9.324 million Ecus and  fined another Portuguese  cement company Secil - Companhia Geral de Cal e Cimento SA 3.017 million Ecus. Both firms have denied breaking EU trade rules and have said they will appeal.

Commission in connection with alleged violation of competition regulations.

Vicat said the  fine was unjust and disproportionate and maintained the Commission's ruling was not based on any evidence establishing Vicat's participation in any  agreement. It warned the  fine would have a detrimental effect on investment and jobs.

HD       CEMENT CARTEL FILES READ LIKE A THRILLER. BY       By Julie Wolf in Brussels,.

Guardian reporters on the record  fines.

It was a sign that the  European Commission has come of age as an anti-trust authority when the competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said with a mixture of pride and wonder that the voluminous file on Europe's  cement cartel read like a crime thriller.

TD
Mr Van Miert was outlining the commission's decision to impose record  fines on 33 companies and nine trade associations accused by Brussels of working together over a 10-year period to share out Europe's
#5.5 billion cement market.
The commissioner said the large penalties show that Brussels is determined to crack down on
anti-competive practices. "After what happened this year, I hope that everyone has got the message," Mr
Van Miert said.
Twenty years ago it was very different. In 1973, Stanley Adams, a Maltese national with British
citzenship, blew the whistle to the EC on his employer, the Swiss drugs firm Hoffmann-La Roche, after he
discovered that its price-fixing  policies on vitamins broke a free trade  agreement between Switzerland
and the EC.

EC officials failed to conceal his identity. When he re-entered Switzerland Mr Adams was arrested and imprisoned. His wife, told he would serve 20 years, committed suicide.

The commission's emergence as a bold competition regulator has been helped by two European Court judgments which allow dawn raids on the offices of companies suspected of running cartels or
price-fixing  arrangements.

The first signs that the hitherto timid commission was willing to use its considerable anti-trust powers under the Treaty of Rome came during the early 1980s under then competition commissioner Frans Andriessen. However, the ball really got rolling under Peter Sutherland, who served as competition commissioner from 1985-1988, and his successor Sir Leon Brittan.

Mr Van Miert has built on their actions by pushing up the level of fines imposed on those found to have participated in the cartels. The #193.5 million penalty slapped on 33 cement makers this week is the third time this year the EC has broken its own record for the size of  fine imposed. Steel producers and cardboard makers have also felt the weight of commission disapporoval. Some critics argue that Mr Van Miert's enthusiasm in cracking down on alleged cartels is partly aimed at counterbalancing the commissioner's less stringent attitude in the other main aspect of competition policy - state subsidies. Doubtless it is easier for Brussels to stand up to companies than to national governments, but
commission officials deny any political motivation.

Various factors can trigger a  cartel investigation: unusual price movements, complaints from customers and, occasionally, tip-offs from within the industry itself.

The commission is cagey about what prompted the  cement investigation, but it appears that one factor was the decision by Greek companies to export to the rest of Europe in the mid-1980s, when the war in Lebanon robbed them of traditional Middle East markets.
Page 107 of 127 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The impact of Greek exports produced complaints about government subsidies, but the Greek view is that the industry was simply newer. "As a result," said Dimitris Papalexopoulos, executive director of
Titan Cement SA, one of the main manufacturers in Greece, "it is more modern and cost-effective, which is why we are able to export so successfully."

To combat the fall in prices caused by Greek exports, European  cement companies allegedly set up a company to buy up Greek  cement and sell it outside Europe.
The sudden appearance of a new  cement-exporting company, Interciment, didn't go unnoticed in
Brussels.

The commission said it found evidence to back up its suspicions in raids carried out in 1989 at  cement companies and industry associations. Documents allegedly included bilateral market-sharing agreements between producers in Spain and Portugal and in France and Italy.

But most companies accused in recent  cartel cases have launched appeals, and the  cement makers are no exception.

Whatever the outcome, the affair is unlikely to make a significant impact on the structure of the European cement market, according to a NatWest Securities analyst, Robert Donald. He pointed out that the investigation had focussed on the  cement market in the Eighties and that the market was now more competitive.

He said there might be more vulnerability to imports - especially in France, which had the highest prices in Europe - while Europe's  cement producers would want to demonstrate that they were "whiter than white", and that might give some of their bigger customers a little more leverage on price.

But he played down any prospect of vertical integration -  cement companies forming corporate alliances with their customers - or cross-border acquisitions in the industry. Vertical integration would mean companies making more money in good times but suffering more in bad times, while takeovers among cement makers would be expensive and, to make it worthwhile, would have to mean higher prices.
"If the industry was to coalesce and then we had higher prices, what would the  European Commission
have to say about that?" he asked.

Prague, Dec 2 (CTK) -  Cement producers on which the European Commission on Tuesday imposed
a fine totalling 248 million ECU for participation in a cement cartel include five multinational companies
involved in the Czech Republic, the ADN agency wrote today.

The Italian Italcementi SpA will have to pay the highest, 33.58 million ECU  fine. It has a two-third stake in the Czech firms  Cement Hranice and Cemos Ostrava.

TD
The French Lafarge-Coppee SA has been  fined with 22.87 million ECU. It owns 50 percent of
Cizkovicka cementarna.

The German firm Heidelberger Zement AG, the most engaged in the Czech Republic, has been handed a 15.65 million ECU  fine. It fully owns Ceva Dvur Kralove, has a 75 percent stake in Pragocement Radotin and with its share in the Belgian Cimenteries CBR controls 45 percent of shares of the largest Czech cement factories Mokra and Malomerice. The two plants cover around two-thirds of the Czech market.

More than a half of overall Czech  cement production is directly or indirectly subject to German control, according to ADN. The Belgian CBR (with a  fine of 8.3 million ECU) owns more than 50 percent in Cementarny a vapenky Mokra and the Swiss Holderbank Financiere Glaris AG (5.33 million ECU) has a majority share in Ceva Prachovice.

Reports from Czech sources indicate that the Swiss are planning to buy the only company in the sector that is still in Czech hands - Cementarna Stramberk, ADN wrote.

ATHENS, Dec 5 (Reuter) - Greece's Federation of Cement Workers blasted the  European                 Commission's decision to impose heavy  fines on Greek cement companies for allegedly taking part in a cartel.

"The mask has fallen. The Commission, supposedly the custodian and guarantor of free competition, has placed perpetrators and victims in the same basket," it said in a statement.

TD
The Commission on Wednesday  fined cement firms across Europe a total of 248 million Ecus for alleged cartel activities.

Included were Greece's Titan  Cement (91.856 million Ecus), Heracles Cement(5.748 million Ecus), Halkis Cement Co. (1.856 million Ecus) and the Association for the Greek Cement Industry (100,000
Ecus).

The federation claimed Greek  cement companies were given unjustifiably heavy  fines compared to a light slap on the wrist for European multinational giants that were caught allegedly conspiring to undermine free competition.

"Obedient sheep to the orders of their big bosses, the Commissioners dissolved workers' hopes of a united Europe of tomorrow," the statement said.

The federation said it would be militant in opposing the ruin of one of the few healthy sectors of Greek industry by the  cement cartel.

It asked the government and political parties to reject a multi-speed Europe of north and south claiming the decision was favouring large monopolies at the expense of free competition.

"The government should not allow Greece to become a country of waiters and European leisure but safeguard national wealth," it said.

Everything suggests anti-dumping proceedings against Polish  cement instituted by the  European              Commission will be dropped within days. The same could happen before the end of 1994 in the case of similar proceedings against Polish producers of the artificial fertiliser UAN. The commission has found cement cartels operating within the European Union and has doled out  fines exceeding $300m. In such circumstances it is not possible to talk about market prices within the union or damage caused by Polish exports. It has also transpired that complaints about Polish  cement were lodged by companies which have now been fined. This notwithstanding, the commission did send its inspectors to Poland to investigate cement production with particular reference to costs. Rzeczpospolita has been told that the inspectors found no irregularities.

The case against Polish producers of UAN could well end in the same way before the end of 1994. The commission is investigating European Union producers of the fertiliser to see if, perhaps, they too are operating a cartel. When Poland was accused of dumping, a minimum price of ECU 89 a tonne was set for Polish UAN - much higher than its market price within the Twelve. As a result Polish producers have not sold any UAN to EU countries in the past six months. But it is puzzling why EU producers of UAN are not protesting against cheaper imports of the fertiliser from the US, to which minimum prices do not apply, which have taken the place of imports from Poland.

The European Commission has fined 33 cement companies and nine trade associations about $509-million for colluding to keep prices high.
It said the companies, including most of the European industry's largest, had got together as a
cartel to carve up the market.

The total of the  fines imposed - 248 million European Currency Units (about $509-million) - was the largest ever levied by the commission.

Fines were imposed on 33 companies in the European Union, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland, eight national associations and the European  Cement Association.
Among the  fines were 32.5 million ECUs on Italy's Italcementi, 24.7 million ECUs on France's
Ciments Francais and 15.8 million ECUs on Britain's Blue Circle.

Investigations by Brussels could trigger steep penalties.
By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW BAXTER.

TD
The European Commission is investigating the activities of at least eight European steel producing and distribution companies, suspecting they are running a price-fixing cartel in heavy duty steel tubes.

The investigations - carried out over the last two weeks - could lead to the imposition of steep  fines if the Commission considers that the companies have behaved illegally.

Companies involved include British Steel, Italy's Ilva, Vallourec in France, and Mannesmann and Thyssen of Germany. Europipe, a three-year-old joint venture between Mannesmannrohren-Werke, of Germany, and Dillinger Huttenwerke, a subsidiary of France's Usinor-Sacilor, is also under investigation.

The Commission suspects the companies of meeting regularly to collude on prices and share out contracts in the oil and gas industries. They allegedly ran a system whereby all but one company proposed a higher price for a contract, ensuring the work was channelled to the designated enterprise.

The inquiry comes as talks continue on bringing British Steel's large-diameter welded pipe business into the Europipe joint venture with Usinor-Sacilor and Mannesmann.

The investigation marks the latest in a series of drives by Brussels to stamp out uncompetitive activities by EU-based companies.

So far this year European steel makers, carton-board producers, and  cement manufacturers have been found guilty of collusion after probes by the Commission's competition authorities. They were  fined record amounts.

In February the Commission demanded ECU 104.4m (#82.16m) from 16 companies for allegedly operating a cartel in steel beams used in the construction industry.

Only last month it imposed even higher  fines on 33 cement producers accusing them of using secret agreements to rig the market for more than 10 years.

Following the Commission's decision, Mr Karel Van Miert, who is responsible for competition policy, hinted that other sectors of European industry were likely to come under investigation, but said evidence of collusive behaviour was becoming increasingly hard to detect.

The Commission investigates cartels when it suspects that collusive behaviour is affecting trade between EU members states or countries in the European Economic Area. Evidence is often hard to assemble as companies have become adept at covering their tracks - for example, by agreeing not to keep minutes of meetings where collusive practices are discussed.

In this latest case Commission officials were dispatched on dawn raids to the companies concerned to seize confidential documents.

If found guilty the Commission is allowed, under EU competition law, to  fine companies up to 10% of their turnover.

This year's record  fines on the cement, carton-board and

steel producers have boosted the reputation of Mr Karel Van Miert but infuriated the companies concerned, most of which have launched appeals in the European Court of Justice.

The levels of the  fines have to be agreed by the College of Commissioners in Brussels. Mr Van Miert was only just able to secure sufficient support for the  fines on the cement producers, as some commissioners were reluctant to penalise high-profile companies in their own states.

British Steel yesterday confirmed it had received a visit from Commission officials but declined to comment on the subject of the call.

The company's wide-diameter steel tubes are made at Hartlepool in north-eastern England and it is understood that both the Hartlepool plant and the headquarters of the company's tube business at Corby were visited by the investigators.

British Steel's tubular products business employs 2,100 people and had turnover in 1993/94 of #390m, but this includes smaller tubes and pipes made at Corby. Its heavy duty tubes are sold mainly to the offshore oil and gas industry and are also used in heavy construction.

HD         BRITISH STEEL RAIDED IN CARTEL INQUIRY. BY          By Julie Wolf in Brussels and Mark Milner.

EUROPEAN Commission officials have raided the offices of a number of Europe's leading steelmakers, including British Steel, as part of an inquiry into a suspected steel tubes  cartel.

A commission spokesman said anti-trust investigators carried out raids 15 days ago, although he declined to name the companies involved.

TD
British Steel said its tubes and pipes business in Corby was visited by EU officials, but would not comment further. Among the other companies visited by the EU inspectors were units of Mannesmann, Thyssen and Europipe in Germany, France's Vallourec and Italy's Ilva tubing subsidiary.

EU and industry sources said the companies are suspected of sharing out supply contracts for the oil and gas industry as well as agreeing on the prices to be charged. The investigation is expected to last some time.

Earlier this year, British Steel was among 14 steelmakers and industry associations  fined for taking part in a steel beam  cartel. The fines totalled #80 million, with British Steel's share standing at just over #24 million but, along with other firms involved, it is appealing against the commission's ruling.

The latest enquiry is a further sign that the commission is determined to crack down on cartels and other anti-competitive practices. Two weeks ago the commission slapped record  fines totalling 240 million European currency units ( #193.5 million) on 33 companies and nine trade associations accused of sharing out Europe's seven billion ecu (#5.5 billion)  cement market.

Cardboard box-makers had earlier felt the weight of the commission's wrath. This year the commission has broken its record for the level of  fines levied on companies alleged to have been running cartels on three occasions.

However some observers believe that the key test of the effectiveness of the commission's new approach will only come when the companies accused of running cartels mount legal challenges to the decisions.

At the time of the announcement of the  fines, commission officials hinted that there was at least one other cartel investigation under way.

The commission is also planning to reorganise its competition directorate to create a division assigned specifically to tackling cartels. At the moment, officials are responsible for industrial sectors and they look into everything from minor marketing agreements to cartels.

BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (AFP) - The European Commission has opened an investigation into seven steel manufacturers suspected of operating a cartel in the heavy duty steel tubes market, a Commission source said Monday.

The enquiry follows spot checks carried out by commission inspectors earlier this month at the request of a Norwegian tubes producer.

TD
The groups involved are understood to be British Steel, Germany's Mannesmann and Thyssen, France's Vallourec and its subsidiary Usinor-Sacilor, Italy's Ilva and Europipe, and a joint venture between Mannesmann and Dillinger Huettenwerke.
The Commission believes the groups have concluded agreements on pricing and market share in the
European oil and gas industries.
If found guilty, the companies face  fines of up to ten percent of their turnover.
The Commission has already this year slapped huge  fines on carton board producers and  cement
makers for breaches of EU competition rules.

BRUSSELS, Dec 19 (Reuter) - The  European Commission is investigating  cartel allegations concerning European producers of large steel tubes used in the oil and gas industries, Commission officials said on Monday.

"According to recommendations and the procedure the Commission has investigated the companies," a Commission spokeswoman said declining to give any names.

TD
British Steel Plc, Italy's Ilva SpA, France's Vallourec SA, Germany's Mannesmann and Thyssen and
Usinor-Sacilor are the main European makers of the tubes in question, an industry official said.

The investigation started some months ago and included a series of surprise visits recently to the premises of heavy duty steel tubes makers, the sources said.

Under cartel investigation rules, the next step could consist in the Commission sending the firms concerned so-called statement of objections detailing what accusations they might come against and giving them the oportunity to defend themselves.

The whole process was not expected to be completed for some time as the Commission usually takes years to complete  cartel investigations, such as the ones it revealed this year in the carton board, cement and steel sectors.
Only last month it imposed a record 248 million European currency units penalty on 42 European
cement companies and associations for carving up markets.

The steel companies involved in the current investigation are suspected of sharing out supply contracts for the oil and gas industry as well as agreeing on the prices to be charged, according to unconfirmed press reports.
Earlier this year the Commission  fined among others British Steel and Thyssen 32 million Ecus and
6.5 million Ecus respectively for running a price-fixing cartel in the steel beams sector.

Blue Circle has been  fined #12.3m for its part in a European price-fixing  and market protection cartel in the early 1980's. Its punishment is part of a total of #193m in fines handed out by the European Commission to more than 30 companies, 8 national cement associations and the European Cement Association. Blue Circle said it would appeal against the fine as it had previously complained about the way the Commission was conducting its enquiry. A spokesman said the company was confident of overturning the decision. The Commission has already admitted that the high expense of transporting cement means local companies are likely to dominate domestic markets. In theory the  European             Commission has the right to  fine companies up to 10% of their turnover. In Blue Circle's case that could have led to a fine of up to #100m.

TD
In coming to its conclusions, the Commission ignored the claims of the  cement companies that some industry cooperation was necessary in the late 1980s to combat unfairly low pricing or dumping by Greek firms. Irish  Cement also said it would challenge a fine of #2.7m for alleged anti-competitive practices. Its managing director, Declan Doyle, denied that Irish Cement was in any way involved with the alleged violations.

HD       EDITORIAL - A FINE SYMBOL? - FAR EASTERN FREIGHT CONFERENCE. WC      632 words

THE Far Eastern Freight Conference members, and indeed deepsea liner operators everywhere, have received a bleak Christmas message from the European Commission in the shape of "symbolic"  fines and an unfriendly judgment on the issue of inland price fixing.
While shippers' organisations rejoice at European competition commissioner Karel van Miert's backing
for the validity of their case, the owners argue that this is a blow against the whole concept of multimodal
transport, and the pure simplicity of systems designed for through transport facilitation.

TD
There has been little room for compromise in this prolonged dispute, which has revolved around points of important principle.

The conference has stressed its traditional role of a trade stabiliser, with landside services viewed as a logical extension of the sea leg.

To prohibit conference arrangements from applying on shore would call into question the whole rationale of through transport, actively encouraging an anarchic and illogical situation in which landside services fight furiously to handle cargo to and from the carefully constructed shipside tariffs and schedules.

The whole producer to consignee system should thus logically qualify for exemption from price  fixing prohibitions. The commission, which, it must be said, has consistently exhibited a far from neutral demeanour in its approach to the conference lines, and made little secret of its inherent hostility to every form of cartel, has naturally been unimpressed by these arguments.

Taking up the cudgels on behalf of German shippers (or more specifically their representative organisation), it has now judged that only those FEFC members which actually organise joint inland activities can qualify for exemption.

Merely to maintain that the permitted  cartel on the sea leg can be extended automatically on shore is unjustifiable, insists the commission, placing other inland transport services at a competitive disadvantage.

Throughout this lengthy dispute, which has been perhaps elevated and personalised into something of a symbolic clash of titans rather than an exercise in regulatory definition, there has been a tendency to simplify the issues.

It has largely ignored the fact that in other parts of the world notable for well-developed container trades, such as the US and Australia, precisely the opposite view has been taken and inland tariffs are permitted. So there is a clash of opinions between jurisdictions, which is something that will cause all manner of practical difficulty for global operators.

Of course, the issue is by no means over, as appeals will inevitably be considered and more years of good work for lawyers elapse before a final judgment once and for all.
