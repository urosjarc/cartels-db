LONDON - The European Union is expected to  fine Deutsche Post World Net for predatory pricing in the German parcel delivery market. United Parcel Service, which filed the original complaint against Deutsche Post in 1994, last year called for DP's profitable mail monopoly to be separated from its other units, including parcel delivery. UPS argued that a split would make it more difficult to cross-subsidize Deutsche Post's unprofitable activities.

The commission, which is due to take action before Easter, has refused to respond to German press reports that it will fine Deutsche Post 100 million euros ($93 million). The company has set aside $23 million to pay fines. The commission is not expected to seek the break-up of  Deutsche Post.

TD
The commission's investigations will not have a major impact on  Deutsche Post's acquisitions,
totaling more than $5 billion over the past 2 1/2 years, including AEI, the leading U.S. air forwarder, and
a controlling stake in DHL Worldwide Express, the global air express operator. Rivals say the spending
spree was unfairly financed by profits from  Deutsche Post's lucrative letter monopoly.

Deutsche Post's prospects have improved significantly since the German government ruled earlier this month that its domestic mail monopoly will be extended beyond the scheduled expiration at the end of
2002. The reason for the ruling was the failure of EU member states to agree on a timetable to deregulate postal monopolies in the 15-nation bloc.

Deutsche Post is expected to make further acquisitions, funded by real estate sales, but it has ruled out taking a stake in Lufthansa Cargo.

BRUSSELS, March 16 (Reuters) - The European  Commission will announce a fine against German post office  Deutsche Post AG on Tuesday for breaking competition law, but a European Union source said "there won't be tears" about its size.
The source would not say how large the  fine will be.

TD
The Commission said it investigated  Deutsche Post contracts with mail order customers that offered loyalty rebates which made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold.

It also looked into the high price of postal services in Germany and whether  Deutsche Post used profits from its monopoly letter service to purchase courier firms.

The Commission began the investigation in October and soon afterwards the company changed its practices.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's head office  fined German mail carrier Deutsche Post
24 million euros ($21.6 million) on Tuesday for anticompetitive practices following a complaint filed by rival
United Parcel Service.

In its decision, the European  Commission found Deutsche Post abused its dominant market position in Germany by offering special rates to mail-order companies in exchange for sending all parcels of a certain size with them.

TD
It also shipped packages for special customers at below cost prices since 1995, said  Commission
spokesman Michael Tscherny. "That's against the rules," he said.

In addition to stopping the practices and paying the  fine, Tscherny said  Deutsche Post has agreed to set up a new company to handle business parcel operations "to avoid cross-subsidization from the monopoly area - letters."

Parcels shipped by companies account for the "lion's share" of the business, which is growing due to the advent of e-commerce, he said.

David Thual, a spokesman in Brussels for the Atlanta-based UPS, said the EU's decision "makes sure there is more transparency of accounts and is very important for the future."

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - German mail carrier  Deutsche Post faces a 24 million euro (dlrs 21.6 million) fine for anticompetitive practices following a complaint filed with the European Union's head office by United Parcel Service, a source close to the case said Tuesday.

In a decision expected to be released Tuesday, the European  Commission found Deutsche Post abused its dominant market position in Germany by offering special rates to mail-order companies in exchange for sending all parcels of a certain size with them.

TD
The Commission said Deutsche Post also broke EU law by offering parcel transport to mail-order firms for less than its incremental costs.
"Deutsche Post must end without delay (these) infractions ... and avoid repeating them," said the
Commission in its decision, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

It said the  fine was determined based on the nature and duration of the infringement and  Deutsche Post's sales in Germany.

David Thual, a spokesman in Brussels for the U.S.-based UPS, said that the decision "makes sure there is more transparency of accounts and is very important for the future."

The Commission's decision calls on  Deutsche Post to set up a new company to run its commercial parcel operations.

Deutsche Post must publish every year a list of prices and give the  Commission copies of discount agreements the new company makes with its six largest mail-order clients for the next three years, the Commission said.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's head office  fined German mail carrier Deutsche Post 24 million euros ($21.6 million) on Tuesday for anticompetitive practices following a complaint filed by rival United Parcel Service.

In its decision, the European  Commission found Deutsche Post abused its dominant market position in Germany by offering special rates to mail-order companies in exchange for sending all parcels of a certain size with them.

TD
It also shipped packages for special customers at below cost prices since 1995, said  Commission
spokesman Michael Tscherny. "That's against the rules," he said.
In addition to stopping the practices and paying the  fine, Tscherny said  Deutsche Post has agreed
to set up a new company to handle business parcel operations "to avoid cross-subsidization from the
monopoly area - letters."

Parcels shipped by companies account for the "lion's share" of the business, which is growing due to the advent of e-commerce, he said.

David Thual, a spokesman in Brussels for the Atlanta-based UPS, said that the EU's decision "makes sure there is more transparency of accounts and is very important for the future."

THE German post office was today ordered to pay the biggest  fine ever imposed by Brussels on a privatised State service industry.

Deutsche Post was fined 24 million (Pounds 16 million) for breaking laws intended to foster competition in the world's third largest economy.

TD
The European  Commission ruled that  Deutsche Post's system of "fidelity rebates" amounted to kickbacks to loyal customers to stop them being lured away by rival carriers.
These "rebates" totalled millions of pounds.

Deutsche Post particularly targeted American carriers such as Fedex and DHL which the State bosses saw a real threat to the multibillion Deutschmark parcels and courier business.

The fine follows a finding by the EU's antitrust watchdog that  Deutsche Post abused its dominance by allowing large mail order traders substantial discounts if they sent all their parcels through  Deutsche    Post.
The company has since ditched the rebates but a separate probe rumbles on.

The Commission is looking into the high price of postal services in Germany and whether  Deutsche   Post illegally used profits from its monopoly letter service to finance a buying spree of courier companies.

Brussels March 20(PPI)The European Union  Commission ordered German postal company  Deutsche   Post on Tuesday to pay a  fine of 24 million euros (21.6 million dollars) for violating rebate rules on
service for large-scale mail-order companies.

The decision, announced by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, came after a seven-month cartel inquiry into the German postal company's "loyalty rebates" offered to the big mail-order houses between
1974 and October 2000.

BRUSSELS, March 20 (Xinhua) - The European Commission - the executive body of the 15-member Europen Union - said on Tuesday that it has fined German post office  Deutsche Post 24 million euros (21.6 million U.S. dollars) for breaking the community's competition law.

The fine followed a finding by the  commission, also the anti-trust watchdog of the EU, that  Deutsche   Post had abused its dominance in Germany to squeeze other firms out of the domestic parcels service market.

TD
The commission accused Deutsche Post of allowing large mail order traders substantial discounts if they agreed to send all their parcels through its service system.

Deutsche Post has already halted the practices the  commission has taken aim at and accused it of.

The German company said on Tuesday that it will not contest the  fines imposed by the commission. It may take the fines to the European Court of First Instance to reduce or even overturn them, but Deutsche Post said that it has no plans to do so.

European bourses closed higher on Tuesday as hopes grew that the Federal Reserve would cut US interest rates by as much as 75 basis points. Techs and telecoms stocks led the way, rebounding on the Nasdaq's 3 per cent gain overnight.

Market watchers were split on predictions for the Fed's move. Markets are generally viewed to have written in a cut of 50 basis points but there have been growing calls for a cut of 75 basis points following last week's stock market slump.

TD
The Fed has never cut 75 basis points at one time before, and a drop of that magnitude could prompt more panic in the markets.
As European trading drew to a close, the Nasdaq composite was up 8 at 1,959 while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was up 35 at 9,994.

In FRANKFURT, the Dax was up 126.3, or 2.2 per cent, at 5,783.59 as the index went into extended trading.
The Neuer Markt's Nemax 50 was up 77.52 at 1,664.21.

Deutsche Telekom was up 4.5 per cent as telecoms moved off early lows. The group said it would not consider listing its T-Mobile unit until market conditions improved.
T-Online, its internet unit, was up near 7 per cent.

Other techs were also higher, and SAP added 6.8 per cent, Epcos nearly 6 per cent and Siemens 3.4 per cent.

New Dax entrant  Deutsche Post led the decliners, off 3.8 per cent after the European  Commission saidit had fined the post office group E24m ($21.7m) for abusing its position to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.

In PARIS, the CAC 40 closed up 89.8 at 5,138.40, a gain of 1.8 per cent. Activity was muted ahead of the Fed's decision.

Heavyweight France Telecom added to the upside with a gain of more than 2 per cent after investors compared it favourably to British Telecom, whose debt levels are worrying shareholders.
Bouygues, the mobiles to construction group, was more than 4 per cent higher.
In the tech sector, Alcatel put on more than 5 per cent while STMicro was about 1 per cent higher. Aerospace and defence group EADS was down more than 5 per cent following Monday's weak
full-year figures.
LONDON gained 95.2 to 5,646.8 on the blue-chip FTSE 100, helped up by a near 3 per cent gain for
Vodafone as techs and telecoms took their lead from the Nasdaq's gains on Monday.

Misys was up 8.7 per cent, Spirent added 6.6 per cent and Sage put on 3.2 per cent.

British Telecom was up more than 5 per cent despite persistent worries about its debt levels. Elsewhere among telecoms, Colt added 4.2 per cent and Telewest 6.3 per cent.

Utilities were sold off as techs came back into favour. International Power was down nearly 4 per cent, Lattice nearly 3 per cent and National Grid about 2 per cent.

European technology, media and telecom sectors bounced back from lows on Tuesday ahead of the US Fed decision on interest rates.

Telecoms stocks also gained from a call by the European  Commission for governments to be more lenient over next generation mobile phone licences, possibly allowing companies to delay payments or share infrastructure.

TD
The telecoms industry has already invested about E140bn on licences, pushing debt to equity levels close to 50 per cent at operators such as BT, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.

France Telecom, which has annual results on Thursday,rose 2.8 per cent to E61.90, Deutsche Telecom rose 5.2 per cent to E26.63 and Telecom Italia rose 1.5 per cent to E11.19.
Telecom equipment makers were buoyant as the CeBIT technology fair opened in Germany. Alcatel was
6.9 per cent ahead at E39.30, Nokia up 5.3 per cent at E30, and Ericsson up 6.8 per cent at E62.50.

Software maker SAP rose 7.5 per cent to E137.62 in late trading. Kevin Ashton at Deutsche Bank said that although it was a big rise for the stock, "its share price has been hammered recently. I honestly see nothing unusual. All the software stocks we follow are up sharply today, with investors looking forward to the US rate cut".

But Philips Electronics fell 1.8 per cent to a 14-month low of E31.95 after it guided the market down on first quarter earnings. Its results are due out on April 17.

Philips, Europe's third biggest producer of semiconductors, said operating profits for this side of the business would fall by 10 per cent. But it said it expected to outperform the chip market by 5 per cent over the full year because of its lower exposure to the PC industry.

Several brokerage downgrades resulted, including German bank Merck Finck which cut its earnings per share forecast for 2001 from E2.24 to E1.91 and Deutsche Bank which cut its estimate for first quarter earnings by 15-20 per cent.

Other chip sector stocks were firmer, with ASM Lithography up 3.2 per cent to E23.63, STMicroelectronics up 3.4 per cent to E38.75 and Infineon up 4.1 per cent to E40.60.

The Swedish engineering company Atlas Copco fell 16 per cent to SKr169 after forecasting that first quarter results were likely to be flat, or only marginally higher than the same period last year. The shares have lost about 25 per cent in the last two weeks. The Rental Service unit, which accounts for 30 per
cent of revenues, was forecast to have a weak first quarter. The company said: "The slowdown in the construction and manufacturing industry activity has affected us more than anticipated."

Other Swedish engineering companies fell on the news. The Swiss-Swedish engineer ABB fell 3.7 per cent to SFr124.25 and the tool maker Sandvik fell 5.2 per cent to SKr198. ABB's chief executive Joergen Centerman said the group still expected higher earnings in 2001.

German graphite maker SGL Carbon dropped 12.7 per cent to E33.98 as it said a fourth quarter slump in the US steel sector had prompted it to cut its operating profits forecast for 2001. However, the group

Page 20 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
undertook to continue heavy investment in its new technology fields of fuel cell materials and carbon fibre brake discs. It is also seeking closer co-operation with Porsche and Volkswagen and a new US partner for aerospace applications.

Clariant slipped 3.2 per cent to close at SFr511, after an early 4.4 per cent tumble, as the Swiss speciality chemicals company warned of a weak start to 2001 and reported a 14 per cent drop in net profits for 2000.

Clariant blamed "the difficult situation in the motor industry", but said it expected its markets to pick up momentum as the year went on. It believed raw materials costs could start to ease from the second quarter.

Drugs group Sanofi-Synthelabo had a second good day, rising 4.9 per cent to E60, as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded the stock and set a E75 target price. Sanofi rose 7.1 per cent on Monday after an international study said its Plavix drug reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with heart problems.

Finnish pharmaceuticals group Orion dropped 10 per cent to E21.70 after the company said international sales of its Orion Pharma division were slower than expected. As recently as February, Orion said Pharma's international operations would show continued growth in 2001 but operating profit would fall because of marketing, research and development costs.

French drinks group Remy Cointreau soared 9 per cent to E32.59 after Sweden's Vin &Spirit, which owns Absolut Vodka, confirmed it had agreed to buy a 25 per cent stake in Maxxium, a distribution venture that includes Remy, Fortune Brands and Highland Distillers.

Deutsche Post lost 4.4 per cent to E20.93 on its second day of trading as a constituent of Germany's blue chip Dax index. The tumble came as the European  Commission announced a E24m  fine for the German post office for breaking competition laws.

Among financials, Deutsche Bank had a good day, rising 4.1 per cent to E81.58 as foreign investors covered short positions, tracking gains in US peers overnight.

Zurich Financial spurted sharply higher as the group announced its US-based Farmers Insurance arm had struck a deal with Bank of America to offer banking and insurance services. Zurich, which announces full year earnings figures on Thursday, closed with a gain of 4.4 per cent at SFr705.

Swedish mutual funds and insurance group Skandia shot 8.1 per cent higher to E98.50 as the company flatly dismissed a newspaper report that it was in talks to acquire Spanish telecoms operator Auna's 49 per cent stake in digital pay-TV company Quiero TV.

LONDON - The European  Commission today fined Germany's Deutsche Post World Net 24 million ($21.6 million) for abusing its dominant position in its domestic business parcels delivery market. The commission also ordered Deutsche Post to create a separate business parcels division to ensure that the parent company does not subsidize its activities. It said a system of transparent and market-based pricing between Deutsche Post and the new entity for products and services they might provide to one another is a suitable safeguard for  Deutsche Post's competitors that revenue from its mail monopoly will not be used to finance these services.

Today's announcement marks the  commission's first antitrust decision in the European Union's $75 billion-a-year postal market. Barring appeals, it also closes a case that originated in 1994 when United Parcel Service alleged that  Deutsche Post was subsidizing its money-losing parcel unit from its monopoly letter operations.

TD
The commission said it had fined Deutsche Post because the company had offered loyalty rebates to its major mail order customers, preventing private firms from entering the market.

The commission's action will be seen as little more than an irritant to  Deutsche Post, which has emerged as a global transport company following a two-year, $5 billion-plus spending spree that netted companies in Europe and the United States, including a piece of DHL Worldwide Express, AEI and Danzas.

Commissioner Pascal Lamy's official visit to Egypt on March 23-25.

Spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber said a meeting between the EU and Morocco on renewing a fisheries agreement next Monday was likely to take place in Brussels.

POST-GERMANY
Spokesman Michael Tscherny said the  Commission had fined German post office  Deutsche Post AG
24 million euros for abusing its dominance to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.

As a result of the investigation, he said,  Deutsche Post had agreed to set up a separate company for business parcel services.

The Commission had decided to impose the  fine after finding that  Deutsche Post had "abused its dominant position by granting fidelity rebates and engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services", it said in a statement.
This was the first formal decision the  Commission had taken in the postal sector under an article of the
EU treaty barring abuse of a dominant position, Tscherny said.

In a separate state aid probe, the  Commission is looking into whether  Deutsche Post illegally used profits from its monopoly letter service to finance a buying spree of courier companies. It is also looking into the high price of postal services in Germany.
- - - -
FRAUD-FLAX
In reply to a question, Kreuzhuber said the  Commission would study a report by the European
Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) on alleged fraud involving EU subsidies to Spanish flax producers, before
deciding on the discharge of the EU's budget for 1999.

RECORD  FINE FOR DEUTSCHE POST BY ALLAN HALLTHE-German post office was today ordered to pay the biggest  fine ever imposed by Brussels on a privatised State service industry.Deutsche Post was fined e24 million (#16 million) for breaking laws intended to foster competition in the world's third largest economy.The European  Commission ruled that  Deutsche Post's system of "fidelity rebates" amounted to kickbacks to loyal customers to stop them being lured away by rival carriers.These "rebates" totalled millions of pounds.Deutsche Post particularly targeted American carriers such as Fedex and DHL which the State bosses saw as a real threat to the multi-billion Deutschmark parcels and courier business.The fine follows a finding by the EU's anti-trust watchdog that  Deutsche Post abused its dominance by
allowing large mail order traders substantial discounts if they sent all their parcels through  Deutsche         Post.The company has since ditched the rebates but a separate probe rumbles on.

Deutsche Post is fined #15m THE German post office was today ordered to pay the biggest fine ever imposed by Brussels on a privatised State service industry, writes ALLAN HALl from Berlin.Deutsche Post was fined e24 million (#15 million) for breaking laws intended to foster competition in the world's
third largest economy.The European  Commission ruled that  Deutsche Post's system of "fidelity rebates" amounted to kickbacks to loyal customers to stop them being lured by rival carriers. The rebates totalled millions of pounds.

TD
Deutsche Post particularly targeted American carriers such as Fedex and DHL which it saw as a threat to its parcels and courier business.The  fine follows a finding by the EU's anti-trust watchdog that  Deutsche Post abused its dominance by allowing large mail-order traders substantial discounts if they sent all their parcels by Deutsche Post.The company has ditched the rebates, but the Commission is also looking
into the high price of postal services in Germany and whether Deutsche Post illegally used profits from its monopoly letter service to finance a buying spree of courier companies.

HD     EU fines Deutsche Post for abusing  position in parcel delivery

BRUSSELS, March 20 (AFP) - The European authorities said on Tuesday they had slapped a  fine of 24 million euros (22 million dollars) on  Deutsche Post AG for abusing its position in the parcel delivery market.

The fine, which followed an anti-trust investigation launched in October 2000, was the first to be imposed in the postal sector under a provision prohibiting abuses of a dominant market position.

TD
Deutsche Post had abused its position "by granting fidelity rebates and engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services", said a European  Commission statement.

The European  Commission decided to impose a  fine over Deutsche Post's long-standing scheme of providing fidelity rebates in mail order parcel deliveries.

The investigation found that it gave substantial discounts to its large mail order customers from 1974 to the end of 1999 on the condition that they sent a large slice of their mail-order parcel business via Deutsche Post.

"In light of the fact that fidelity rebates given by an undertaking in a dominant position have repeatedly been condemned by the Community courts, and given the long duration of the scheme in the case at issue, the  commission considers that a  fine of 24 million euros is appropriate for this abuse," the statement said.

The investigation also found that Deutsche Post had failed to cover the extra costs of providing the mail-order delivery service, the European Commission said.

But it imposed no  fine for this infringement because "the economic cost concepts used to identify predation were not sufficiently developed at the time the abuse occurred", it said.

From 1990 to the end of 1999, Deutsche Post had a stable volume- based share of the mail-order parcel market exceeding 85 percent, the European Commission statement noted.

"Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of cross- subsidies that postal monopolies which are also engaged in activities open to competition must respect," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"The winner clearly is the public at large: pricing below cost must be paid by somebody and that somebody usually is the monopoly's customers," he said in the statement.

"Moreover, pricing below cost forecloses market entry by efficient competitors and therefore prevents a wider offer at better prices and service conditions."

As a result of the investigation, Deutsche Post had decided to create a separate legal entity for business parcel services, the European Commission said.

The envisaged system of transparent and market-based pricing between  Deutsche Post and the new entity would prevent  Deutsche Post using its revenue from letters to finance business parcel deliveries, it said.

FRANKFURT, March 20 (AFP) - Shares in Deutsche Post fell more than five percent on the stock exchange here on Tuesday after the European Commission in Brussels slapped a  fine of 24 million
euros (22 million dollars) on the semi-public company for abusing its position in the parcel delivery market.

Deutsche Post shares hit an intraday low of 20.67 euros, down 1.22 euros or 5.6 percent from the closing price on Monday. It subsequently came back off its lows to show a loss of 3.56 percent at 21.11 euros.

FRANKFURT, March 20 (AFP) -  Deutsche Post put a brave face on the decision by the EU  Commission
on Tuesday to slap a  fine of 24 million euros (22 million dollars) on the semi-public company for abusing
its position in the parcel delivery market.

Deutsche Post said in a statement that it was happy that the investigations were now over so that it could get on with its job.

TD
And it said that the  fine would not eat into group earnings.

"We expressly welcome the fact that the EU Commssion decision has finally brought the cartel investigation, underway since 1994, to a close," said chairman Klaus Zumwinkel in a statement.

The size of the  fine was more or less in line with what the company had been expecting, the chairman said.

"We regard the outcome and the resulting planning security which it offers our customers and the capital markets as positive," Zumwinkel said.
Furthermore, the  fine would not have a big impact on the group's sales or earnings as  Deutsche Post
had made provisions for around that amount, the company added.
However, the  fine angered investors and shares in  Deutsche Post fell more than five percent on the
Frankfurt stock exchange as a result.

Deutsche Post shares hit an intraday low of 20.67 euros, down 1.22 euros or 5.6 percent from Monday's closing price, and a record low since the shares were floated in November.
It was also the first time that the shares, which entered the blue- chip DAX 30 index for the first time on
Monday, had fallen below their November issue price of 21 euros.
Later on Tuesday, the shares came off their lows to show a loss of 3.56 percent at 21.11 euros.

The EU fine was the first to be imposed in the postal sector under a provision prohibiting abuses of a dominant market position.

Deutsche Post had abused its position "by granting fidelity rebates and engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services", the European  Commission said in statement in Brussels.

HD     Euro stocks  fight back before US rate decision by Daniel Rook ATTENTION - UPDATES after Wall
Street opening  ///

LONDON, March 20 (AFP) - European share markets fought back on Tuesday as investors eagerly anticipated an aggressive interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.
Share prices were boosted by strong gains overnight on Wall Street and a sprightly opening on Tuesday.

TD
But many investors were sidelined, preferring to wait until US monetary policymakers had announced their rate cut before wading back into treacherous waters.

In London, the FTSE 100 index, which had fallen Monday to its lowest level in two and a quarter years, rose 1.3 percent to 5,626.1 points.
Frankfurt's DAX index gained 1.9 percent to 5,762.62 points, while in Paris, the CAC 40 index advanced
1.3 percent to 5,115.04 points.

The picture was similarly optimistic across the euro-zone, where the Stoxx 50 barometer of leading shares notched up a 1.5-percent gain, while the euro itself held firm at 0.9034 dollars.
The positive mood emanated from Wall Street.

After a solid performance the previous day, the US tech-rich Nasdaq index resumed its upward trend after the opening bell Tuesday, gaining 0.7 percent. The Dow industrials firmed 0.2 percent.

Not every market place was basking in new-found confidence though. Hong Kong share prices fell 1.7 percent on Tuesday, while the Tokyo markets were closed for a holiday.

"Markets are a bit better on the back of Wall Street bouncing up, but Hong Kong was down so it is not totally there yet," said Teather and Greenwood analyst David Butler.

He said investors were eagerly anticipating the Fed's rate decision, amid hopes that the US central bank could slash rates by another half a percentage point -- or even three-quarters of a point (75 basis points).

"People are waiting in anticipation that it is going to be good news," Butler said. "I don't think it would make much difference if they cut by 50 or 75 basis points.

"Some people would say if you cut by 75 points it would be panicking and bailing out equity investors," he said.

Investors have watched a drip-drip sell-off in recent months turn into a veritable torrent of selling over the past two weeks, as market players turn nervous over an inauspicious combination of economic slowdown and corporate profit warnings.

Analysts have warned that only aggressive interest rate cuts, particularly in the labouring US economy, would enable businesses to pick up activity again, rescuing share prices.
Some market watchers predicted that when sidelined investors returned to the market after the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision, it could be to sell rather than to buy.

"Once we have the FOMC decision and investors come back into the market we are likely to see some of these gains coming off," said a Paris-based dealer.

Technology and telecoms stocks were the biggest gainers from Tuesday's flicker of optimism. In London, components outfit Bookham led the charge, up 9.4 percent at 357.5 pence.

Cable outfit Telewest advanced 8.8 percent to 126.25 pence, a day after securing a new loan to ease its financial worries.
Telecoms giant Ericsson recouped 5.2 percent to 61 kronor after heavy losses last week.
"The market feels that it is worth taking the risk with Ericsson," said one Stockholm-based broker. "If the
Nasdaq turns upwards, Ericsson is one company to be in."

Telecoms equipment maker Marconi rise 6.7 percent to 388.5 pence in London, while French rival Alcatel gained 4.6 percent to 38.48 euros.

In Frankfurt, components maker Epcos rallied 7.4 percent to 66.80 euros after unveiling a cost-cutting programme aimed at increasing sales by 20 percent this year.

Software group SAP firmed 7.4 percent to 137.5 euros, chip-maker Infineon climbed 4.8 percent to 40.90 euros, while Deutsche Telekom rose 4.3 percent to 26.39 percent.

But Deutsche Post fell over five percent after the European  Commission fined it 24 million euros (22 million dollars) for abusing its position in the parcel delivery market. It later pared losses to 3.6 percent at
21.11 euros.

BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post said on Tuesday it would not contest a 24 million euro fine imposed by the European Commission for abusing its dominance to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.
Companies hit by Commission fines for antitrust violations may ask the European Court of First
Instance to reduce or overturn them, but  Deutsche Post said it had no plans to do so.

TD
"We've been very cooperative during the proceeding so we won't go against the decision," a
Deutsche Post spokesman said, adding that the company had no plans to start legal proceedings.

Deutsche Post said in a statement.

BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - The European  Commission is set to announce a  fine against German post office  Deutsche Post AG later on Tuesday for breaking competition law, EU sources said.

The fine follows a finding by the European Union's antitrust watchdog that  Deutsche Post abused its dominance in Germany to squeeze other firms out of the domestic parcels market.

TD
Commission officials have declined to say how big the  fine will be, but an EU source indicated last week that the  fine would not be that great, saying "there won't be tears" about its size.

The Commission had accused Deutsche Post of allowing large mail order traders substantial discounts if they agreed to send all their parcels through  Deutsche Post.

Deutsche Post has already halted the practices the  Commission has taken aim at.

In a separate state aid probe, the  Commission is looking into whether  Deutsche Post illegally used profits from its monopoly letter service to finance a buying spree of courier companies. It is also looking into the high price of postal services in Germany.

FRANKFURT, March 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post slumped on Tuesday - its second day of trading on Germany's blue-chip DAX - as the European Commission announced it would  fine the German post office some 24 million euros for breaking competition law.

At 1051, GMT  Deutsche Post shares were down 3.56 percent at 21.11 euros, having hit an all-time low of 20.67 euros earlier as investors braced for the ruling. The stock is now trading just above its issue price of 21 euros, having listed on the mid-cap index on November 20 last year.

TD
The European  Commission was investigating  Deutsche Post contracts with mailorder customers that offered loyalty rebates making it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold.

It also looked into the high price of postal services in Germany and whether  Deutsche Post used profits from its monopoly letter service to purchase courier firms.

"It could be investors were too optimistic on the DAX inclusion and some may take it negatively that the company could be fined," said Bernd Janssen, analyst at UBS Warburg in Frankfurt.

Janssen, who rates  Deutsche Post a "hold" said he felt the share fall was unjustified because the Post has made provisions of 50 million euros for the  fine.

HD         UPDATE 4-EU fines Deutsche Post 24 mln euros. BY         By David Lawsky
WC        828 words

BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - The European  Commission said on Tuesday it had  fined German post office  Deutsche Post AG 24 million euros ($21.7 million) for abusing its dominant position to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.

The Commission said Deutsche Post gave rebates to companies that agreed to use its service exclusively and also used profits from its monopoly letter-carrying service to subsidise its parcel service, which was able to charge far less than competitors.

TD
The relatively modest  fine was set once Deutsche Post agreed to create a separate parcel company. Once the new company starts up on January 1, 2002 Deutsche Post will sell services to United Parcel Service, to the new company and to others on the same terms.

Although the fine settled this case, the German postal service faces two other continuing investigations by the Commission.

In Tuesday's ruling the European Union's competition watchdog said it imposed a  fine because Deutsche Post had granted large mail-order traders substantial discounts if they agreed to send all their parcels through  Deutsche Post.

Deutsche Post "abused its dominant position by granting fidelity rebates and engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services," the  Commission said in a statement.

Deutsche Post said the fine would not affect future profits as the group had already set aside 50 million euros for such a contingency. A company spokesman said the  fine, which he noted was less than half the amount set aside by  Deutsche Post, would not be contested at the European Court of First Instance.

"The EU  fine of 24 million euros is within the published profits that were retained for this purpose," the firm said in a statement.

The firm could in theory have been fined up to 10 percent of its annual revenue, although no firm ever has been fined that much. A Commission spokesman said the fine was in fact less than one percent of Deutsche Post's annual turnover.

The spokesman said the  Commission felt restricted by the size of  fines it had imposed on other businesses for similar transgressions, even though they were in different sectors.

The fine is not among the top dozen  fines imposed by the Commission for anti-competitive practices. The largest was against Volkswagen in 1998 for 102 million euros, later reduced in court to 90 million euros.

Shares in the postal company, which listed in November last year, were at 20.95 euros at 16:15 GMT, after falling as low as 20.67 euros. At bottom, the company had its lowest share price since it was listed.
MARKET COMPETITOR

Page 46 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
United Parcel Service had complained to the  Commission in 1994 alleging that  Deutsche Post had practised predatory pricing by using revenues from its monopoly in the delivery of letters to finance below-cost sales of business parcel services, the  Commission said.

Now Deutsche Post will establish its parcel business as a stand-alone entity that will compete like UPS or any other firm. The  Commission said that will be ensured by the new company's open financial relationship to the German postal service and its market-based pricing.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti applauded the "forward looking result" of the case that creates an even playing field for parcel firms.

He said a competitive parcel delivery system was important to the development of electronic commerce, where goods ordered over the Internet are delivered by parcel shipping companies.

Until the case, the  Commission said, the public suffered from higher rates on stamps needed to subsidise the parcel service.

"Pricing below cost must be paid by somebody, and that somebody usually is the monopoly's customers," Monti said.

The German trade association of express and courier services, BIEK, which counts UPS among its members, welcomed the decision as a "milestone." It said it expected letter prices would "be reduced to a realistic level following the financial separation and operation of postal services at market prices."

Deutsche Post is a target of two other  Commission investigations.

The Commission is investigating whether the German government gave state aid to  Deutsche Post by setting prices too high in its monopoly letter-delivery branch.

The spokesman said that state aid, if it existed, may be a thing of the past given the changes undertaken by the company. But he said that even if any past problem has been corrected, the Commission would continue the investigation because it can be retrospective.

The company said it believed it could win such a case because of a recent European Court of Justice case that narrowed the definition of state aid.
In addition, the company faces an investigation into the practice of "remailing."

In some cases large German companies have made mailings to Germany from Britain because rates were cheaper than domestic postage.  Deutsche Post intercepted some of those mailings and added a surcharge. Britain's Post Office complained.

I'm Mark Haines. You're watching CNBC's SQUAWK BOX. Hello to those of you who join us right now, ex the United States. Places like the Middle East, Europe, South Africa, Asia, Australia, everywhere, Greenland, Iceland, Antarctica. All eyes around the world. Yes, all five billion plus--now, folks, see--hello. Memo to the staff. If there are 5 billion people, there are 10 billion eyes.

They'll be watching Alan Greenspan today. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his band of merry monetary policy men. I know some people only have one but Joe makes up for that by having three. The Fed will meet today--to cut rates today. Wall Street wants to know by how much. We'll have the Briefcase Indicator to tell us. Then a panel of Fed watchers to explain what it could mean for you.
We'll take a trip and see how the bond market is opening this morning ahead of the Fed decision. Rick
Santelli is already limbering up, getting ready to tell us what's going on. In the studio thinking about things
is guest analyst Liz Ann Sonders from Campbell, Cowperthwait US Trust. And Bob Sellers is also strapped
in and ready to go with the business headlines. Bob.
BOB SELLERS reporting: Thanks, Mark. Good morning.
Topping our business headlines, of course, the focus on Alan Greenspan today. Wall Street's attention will be centered on Washington as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meets to decide what to do about interest rates. The central bank cut rates twice in January in response to a slowing economy, and most expect that the Fed will slash its key federal funds rate by either half a point or 3/4 of a point. Now we'll know the outcome of today's meeting. A lot of people look at 2:15 this afternoon, but that's not true. You really don't have to wait till then. Thirty minutes from now the Briefcase Indicator on SQUAWK BOX will answer the question.

Meantime, the slowing economy continues to take its toll on the tech sector. Solectron plans to cut its work force, despite beating profit expectations. The world's largest contract electronics manufacturer earned 30 cents a share in the second quarter. That was a penny above estimates. Revenues increased 85 percent from a year ago. Solectron says it's laying off 10 percent of its workers, though, as economic weakness continues to hit customers. The company also expects to miss this year's sales targets.

Medical device-maker Medtronic is expected to announce today it has completed successful testing of a new electronic device aimed at treating those suffering from congestive heart failure. The Wall Street Journal reports the surgically-implanted device, called InSync, dramatically improved the condition of patients suffering from weakened pumping capacity. Medtronic says upwards of three-quarters of a million Americans are candidates for the device, with millions more internationally.
And that's a latest look at our business headlines. Mark.
HAINES: OK. Thank you very much, Bob. Let's quickly go to Joe and find out what's going on there. Joe. JOE KERNEN reporting:
Yeah. Yeah. We talked about that Medtronic story last week, actually, but I guess it's in the Journal today because the--we asked, you know, what did Medtronic and InSync have in common. And what they have in common is that they have a device called InSync. You know, they're best known, David--Medtronic, for

both defibrillators and pacemakers. This would be a whole new thing, an implantable device that uses some type of pacing for congestive heart failure, which would really expand...
HAINES: Oh, I thought this one would sing to you. DAVID FABER reporting:
Yeah. Well, pacing is off of the rhythm of... KERNEN: Of "Bye, Bye, Bye" or just one of those... FABER: ...'N Sync or--right. Right.
SELLERS: It was originally named Backstreet Boys, that's why. FABER: Yeah.
KERNEN: Yeah. Bob, did you tell people about your recommended list? You know, top buy. SELLERS: VMI?
FABER: Oh, Bob's got a rec list?
KERNEN: Recommended list. Top buy: Vulcan Materials. FABER: That's what I said to him yesterday.
KERNEN: As a Vulcan...
SELLERS: He thinks I look like a Vulcan. Everything's Vulcan with him.

KERNEN: What was the other name? Oh, All Eyes. You know, the--the--Mark, the national news, they have no--they don't--no on ever told them not use that because oh, last night--my word, All Eyes were on everything on the national news.
HAINES: We--we have lost this battle, Joe, OK? We will continue to fight it. KERNEN: Yeah. People are going to--people are going to use All Eyes. HAINES: But we have lost it and we have lost the `tech-heavy NASDAQ' battle. KERNEN: The--we've lost both of them.
HAINES: No matter how much we vilify and ridicule, they continue in every major publication to say
`tech-heavy NASDAQ.'
FABER: And we've also the `upside-downside' battle... KERNEN: Yeah.
FABER: ...which I have heard creeping into the lexicon. KERNEN: Or trading on the upside and trading on the downside. FABER: Yeah.
HAINES: But I think we've...
KERNEN: We sound so much smarter.
HAINES: I think we have won the `going forward' battle.
KERNEN: No, I--the vi--you're always talking about visibility going forward... HAINES: Are they?
KERNEN: ...because you know that visibility going backwards...
FABER: Also...



Page 49 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KERNEN: ...is also--you've to deci--oh, and the outlook going forward, which is important to distinguish from, you know, when you're looking at the outlook going backwards.

FABER: Well, as we know from earlier, visibility remains non-existent. What was the other one I had? I had some good ones.
KERNEN: It remained--it's disintegrated. No... FABER: Yes, det--no, de...
KERNEN: ...deteriorated.
FABER: ...deteriorated but there was another one that was even better. I'll find it. KERNEN: Here some.
FABER: Thank you. Extinguished. KERNEN: Extinguished.
HAINES: Right. Yeah.
FABER: Visibility extinguished.

KERNEN: Here's some other companies that warned and then we'll--we'll summarize the ones that we mentioned at 7. Wabash National sees fourth-quarter earnings between 3 cents and 10 cents a share. That is below expectations. Harte Hanks says 2001 earnings-per-share growth is now seen at the lower end of the 10-percent to 15-percent range. Yesterday Knight-Ridder became the latest huge newspaper chain to...
FABER: To warn? KERNEN: Yeah.
FABER: We had New York Times a couple of weeks back. KERNEN: Dow Jones.
FABER: The Dow Jones. KERNEN: About everybody. FABER: Big surprise there, too.
KERNEN: Yeah. Air Products sees the March quarter at 53 cents a share. That below expectations at APD. Those are the ones that we had not mentioned at--this this month. Weakening US economy cited. And then the ones--you heard Bob talk about Solectron. And that's--you've seen penguins get at least a couple of downgrades, right?

FABER: At least a couple. I'll have to check in to see if we've got penguins for 8:30. We may. We may have them. It--it appears that the magnitude of the...
KERNEN: That's what we keep hearing, isn't it?
FABER: The magnitude of the cuts in estimates from the company itself is surprising. KERNEN: That's the way that everyone says, `Well, you know...'
FABER: That's how they justify being sh--being shocked.

KERNEN: Yeah. That's how they know--that's how they justify being shocked. `Yeah, we knew things were weak but we just can't believe that.' So I just wish they'd start thinking, `Wow, I think that the estimate revisions are going to be worse than we thought.' And then they won't be so surprised by it.
FABER: When are they--I know.
KERNEN: But they're still surprised by the depth of the... FABER: When are they going to finally just--you know... KERNEN: I don't know.

Page 50 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
FABER: ...just crush their estimates completely?
KERNEN: Right.
FABER: And then start building the other way?
KERNEN: Right. And then we could be surprised on the upside. FABER: On the upside.
KERNEN: On the upside. I love that. KLA-Tencor late yesterday was one of the companies that, again, shocked.
FABER: Yes. And we've got a couple of shocking downgrades there as well... KERNEN: ...(Unintelligible).
FABER: ...as we all expect.

KERNEN: We mentioned Plantronics. If you weren't watching, that company warned late yesterday. Also, Parker Hannifin. Totally different area. Insight, not InSync, but Insight Enterprises warned. And then we talked about Potlatch, which is the forest products concern also. And many of those have made some negative comments.
FABER: A lot of--a lot of different areas seem to be slowing down, Joe. KERNEN: Yeah. Yesterday the...
FABER: I hear the Fed is meeting today. I'm not sure about this, but I got a call.

KERNEN: All Eyes, David. Just don't forget it. And, you know, yesterday part of that Terra Lycos story--the one that Steve Frank...
FABER: Broke and unbroke?
KERNEN: ...stole your--your Lame-O Award?
FABER: Is he really going to use the Lame-O Award? KERNEN: They--they played the music.
FABER: That's just terrible.

KERNEN: They played the music. But in the meantime, be--between when Goldman downgraded Terra Lycos, then word came that--that Terra Lycos had signed to Anna Kournikova to a--some type of advertising arrangement. And then they pulled the--then they pulled the downgrade, which shows you just...
FABER: So Anna will be making the rounds with analysts. So why wouldn't she?
KERNEN: I didn't ask for this music to be played. Cut. Yeah. But you can play the, `Yeah, baby, yeah,' the
"Austin Powers" one. When I say Anna Kournikova, you can play that. But...
"AUSTIN POWERS": Yeah, baby.

KERNEN: Thank you. All right, let's get it a little bit--as low as we possibly can on the sophomoric scale of humor. That's it, Mark. For David I have to do things like that.
FABER: Thank you.
KERNEN: I have to get it--take it to the lowest common denominator... FABER: Always.
KERNEN: ...to make you feel right at home.
FABER: Yes. Make America feel right at home. Yeah. KERNEN: We've never had governance issues, have we? FABER: No, never.
Page 51 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KERNEN: We're always  fine, always fine. Yeah.
FABER: Never. As long as you let me be CEO.

HAINES: All righty. Let's--let's raise the denominator a little bit here. We'll go to Maria at the Big Board. Maria, ho--good morning. How things look?
MARIA BARTIROMO reporting:

Good morning, Mark. Thanks very much. It is looking like a positive market at this point for the opening of trading. A lot of optimism about that cut in interest rates possibly being a little more aggressive than the consensus 50-basis-points cut.

The key is, though, if the market will sustain the gains that we're expecting at the opening of trading. You know, we have seen outflows of this market. In fact, TrimTabs.com today out with a report saying that we've seen outflows in four out of the last five days. There's more expected, given the fact that the M&A environment has really dried out. In other words, there aren't a lot of cash takeovers, which puts cash into the pockets of shareholders which often goes right into the--into the hands of--of shareholders. Plus, the IPO market has all but slowed down as well. So we have definitely seen our challenges in this market and the outflows are there and TrimTabs.com expects that to continue. So we'll see if that has a big impact today. Having said that, we are looking at strength in the broader market at the open.

Solectron, Flextronics, Jabil Circuit all part of the EMS sector, which is taking a hit and has taken a hit over the last couple of weeks. You know, this has really been a group that was the last man standing, if you will. A lot of these stocks held up pretty well, up until the last two months or so. Solectron is now at 19.40. The company did report earnings yesterday. They were in line but it warned for the next quarter, as we told you. Today a number of analysts are taking earnings estimates down on Solectron. And CSFB is talking about the entire group. Basically, the company came in with 30-cents-a-share earnings that exceeded the consensus by a penny, but did say that the third quarter is showing poor visibility and also will probably
miss estimates.

Flextronics the next one in the sector to take a look at. Today a couple of analysts talked about this company, basically saying that it is seeing a real slowdown. In fact, one analyst saying this is the worst environment for these companies in 30 years. That was what one analyst said about this whole group. The analyst at CSFB, Mark Kasenberg, who's been extremely positive on this sector for some time and has been for some time very active in the group, he says, `We have never seen a slowdown of such speed and breadth in over 30 years of watching this group.'

On Flextronics, he is saying that he believes the realization that product transition is required to rekindle demand has accelerated the development of new products, further weakening demand for existing ones. Now he is saying that he's remaining positive on Flextronics. His basic investment theme here is, `Look, this is a tough environment, but the stock has come down so much that you have to be buying in at $22 because it's just too good of a valuation, too attractive.'

He says that he's--the 32-percent gain in revenues and the 47-percent increase in net pro--profits is what he's looking for. But that is in an extremely difficult environment for these customers. He lowers his estimates and he's taking his target price down on Flextronics today to 42 from 48. By the way, that $42 target is still about 80 percent away from current levels. So definitely still bullish on the group, but acknowledging that this has been a real slowdown within that sector.

Merrill Lynch today is talking about Micron Technology. The stock has been very volatile recently. But just over the last three months, it's seen a nice move up. In fact, in three months, Micron is showing a gain of about 15 percent. Now the company is going to be reporting this week, earnings. And ahead of the earnings, Merrill Lynch gets in front of the number. Says that they are visiting Samsung and Hyundai in Asia. They're on a trip in Asia Pacific and what they have learned is that they're seeing less spending as far as capacity is concerned. Capacity was the major issue in the semiconductor area. And because of so
much capacity and so much product, prices have come down over the last six months or so.

But recently, there was a couple of people who are noticing that prices have stabilized. They're not going up, they're just stabilizing and they're not dropping anymore. This is what Merrill is pushing Micron about today. They think that the st--the--the stabilization of pricing will continue. And as a result, they're pretty positive there.

In the financial area--of course an area that should move today, given the fact that we are looking at interest rates coming down--UBS Warburg is lowering estimates on American Express. They come out. They take their target price down and they take their estimates down for the quarter as well as for the year. And they say, `We're reducing the estimates, based on a very difficult environment for Amex.' They're also reducing 2002 estimates. And they take their target price down to $51 from $60, translating to 20 times
Page 52 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
revised 2002 estimates. They say they're maintaining their buy because the longer-term situation is intact. But near term, tough environment, tough market conditions for a number of financials, in particular American Express.
Quick break on SQUAWK. We'll be back in two minutes with a lot more premarket action. (Announcements)
HAINES: We're back and Garrett Glaser's here with the news update. Garrett. GARRETT GLASER reporting:
Good morning, Mark. And good morning to you.

Power officials say more supplies and cooler temps should curb the threat of more rolling blackouts in California today. More than a million customers were left in the dark yesterday. The outages closed businesses, trapped people in elevators, and they're also being blamed for car accidents at intersections.

President Bush turns his attention to the Mideast peace later this morning. He'll meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the White House. Sharon is appealing for more cooperation in the fight against terrorism. He also wants a greater role in US missile defense planning.

There's word this morning that a fractured track may have caused Saturday's Amtrak train derailment in Iowa. A federal investigator says the track is the prime suspect and human error has been all but ruled out. The Washington Post reports the train derailed where a temporary patch was installed after a rail defect was found. One passenger was killed, 96 others were injured.

And finally, a list you don't want your car to be on. According to an insurance industry survey just out, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord top last year's list of most stolen vehicles in this country. In fact, 17 of the top 25 most stolen were various models of the Camry and Accord. The reason? They're drivable for hundreds of thousands of miles and so there is a tremendous demand for spare parts. The 1989, '90 and
'91 Camrys round out the top three spots on the Most Stolen Cars list.
HAINES: Wow.
GLASER: Yeah, it's something.
HAINES: The old ones are the ones that get stolen more. GLASER: Yeah, because you can't get parts.
HAINES: For the parts, yeah.
GLASER: Yeah. And Joe Witte is here with weather. HAINES: Speaking of old parts.
JOE WITTE reporting:
Oh, yeah. Hey. I beg your pardon, please. GLASER: Hey.
WITTE: I do remember songs like "Rock On," so yeah, perhaps I qualify there. Hey, airport delays. Flying
to Atlanta? Airport delays of one to two hours right now. Very strong, gusty winds and very stormy weather.
Compare that to Southern California, where yesterday there was 87 degrees. We ought to have a touch of
winter. Mountain snows in the Carolinas could add up to over a foot. But that's in the higher elevation
passes.

Meanwhile, nice sunny day here in New England and also New York City. Phoenix going up to high today of 92 degrees. Things will cool down tomorrow in Los Angeles by about 10 degrees, into the low 70s. And we'll find ourselves tomorrow with a very stormy situation along the East Coast as this southeast storm comes right up to Cape Hatteras and blasts the mid and--New England coastal areas. Some very powerful winds. And, meanwhile, the extended outlook for the power, folks. It looks like it could be a hot July, August, September for the California area and also for the Georgia state area. That wraps it up. Mark, you young fellow you.
HAINES: I'm going to be--have be more careful with my '89 Volvo. I didn't--you know, I was... WITTE: If you--darn right. How many miles does it have on it now?
Page 53 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HAINES: Two hundred and forty-four.
WITTE: Yeah. You're going to need some parts pretty soon, aren't you?
HAINES: No, no. Wrong. I--I have a guy who takes real good care of it for me. Let's get an update from
CNBC Europe. Simon Hobbs is standing by live in London. Simon.
SIMON HOBBS reporting:

Mark, we've got a great story over British Telecom. The former state monopoly has canceled the shareholders' meeting that should have gone tonight amid fever-pitch speculation as to future of the guys at the helm. So Peter Bonfield, the CEO, and Iain Vallance both are under pressure to quit from key shareholders who've just seen their stock go down and down and down in value, big problem for BT. It's got somewhere in the region of $43 billion of debt that it needs to reduce. This is a result of this disastrous
3G auction. Very expensive, particularly in the UK and Germany. Moody's has put it on negative watch.

And some--some good news we thought earlier wrong from that nice Socialist European  commission. It did appear that they were going to try and pressure governments to ask people to delay the payments, but the commission's now denied that it ever said that in first place.

Story over Deutsche Post as well. This one, which owns DHL--you'll know this one. It's the main shareholder in DHL. It says it's not going to contest a 24-million-euro  fine imposed by the commission for abusing its dominance in the Germany postal market. Be aware UPS and FedEx trying to shoot down its US operations for fear of what they might do going forward. The Borse is still looking reasonably good, waiting for Greenspan. Techs and telecoms, as I told you an hour ago, doing reasonably well.

And one more, the Prudential. Still, I'm afraid, the shares on that big UK insurer languishing. This is the one, of course, trying to get its hands on American General in that $21.8 billion deal. And newspapers reporting here in the United Kingdom--and bear in mind that the shares fell 14 percent last Monday when they announced this one going through. Apparently, Bob Devlin, the chief executive, could receive $150 million by cashing in his shares and options if the deal goes through. Mark, back to you.
HAINES: All right. Thank you very much, Simon Hobbs.

When we come back, we'll go live to the trading pits at the Chicago Board of Trade for an early look at how the bond market is opening. Started trading a little less than two minutes ago. They're trying to figure out the FOMC meeting today. We got the Briefcase. It's in the house. We'll get to it in a few minutes. You're watching CNBC's SQUAWK BOX.
(Announcements)
HAINES: OK, let's see how those bond futures traders feel about the upcoming Fed meeting. Rick. RICK SANTELLI reporting:
Well, we're looking at some of the lightest volume, especially if you look at the electronic trade overnight, that we've experienced for the year 2001 so far. Treasuries are basically unchanged, short maturities down a little, long maturities up a little. Traders say the Fed funds futures contract's going to be right no matter what. If your hypothesis is no intermeeting rate cut, you look to the April. That's pointing towards a 75, 56 percent. If you look towards the March and you assume there could be an intermeeting cut between now and the end of April, it's looking as though there's a 50. Traders are just surprised that it's in the public consciousness at such a great extent at the moment. Trade deficit comes out in about five minutes, but
right now volume light; Treasuries basically unchanged. Mark, back to you.
HAINES: OK. Thank you very much, Rick Santelli. Kathleen Hays is here. KATHLEEN HAYS reporting:
Sure am. Bond market waiting for the Fed move, stock market--everybody's waiting for the Fed move and let's take...
HAINES: All eyes... HAYS: All eyes.
HAINES: ...on the all-important.
HAYS: All 9,999,73...


Page 54 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HAINES: Whatever.

HAYS: Anyway, here's the prices, folks. The two-year note was up a little bit and it still is up a little bit. 4.32 is the yield. The 10-year benchmark down fractionally. The yield around 4.82, solidly below 5 percent as people wait for a cut. The 30-year bond treading water a bit as well. Down fractionally, 5.29.

Again, we're waiting for the Briefcase Indicator coming up shortly. Just before that, we're going to get a look at the trade deficit for the month of January. Expected to stabilize at a fairly wide level. Fed's rate
decision--and they tell us what we will find out in just a few minutes. They'll tell us around 2:15 what they've done.

The trade deficit, what is it? It gives us the difference between how much we buy from overseas, import, vs. what we sell to overseas, exports. Exports have been a little bit of a problem lately because global economies are slowing down. Our imports have been huge but maybe not so huge now because our consumers slowing down a bit, too. Let's take a look at the forecast, $32.99 billion from $33 billion. So not much of a difference. But again, maybe starting to stabilize.

I want to take a look at a couple of quick charts, 'cause there's a lot of talk about the Fed. Should they cut? How much? The state of the stock market. A lot of people say forget the stock market. What they have to save, if anything, is the economy. But how bad is it? Retail sales, if you look at them on a year-over-year basis, are they at recession level? No. The problem with a lot of charts I could show you, but I'm only going to show you two, is they are heading down.

On a year-over-year basis, there's been a sharp decline. Will they stabilize? Will they stop going down or will they get worse? Industrial production: year-over-year basis. Maybe it doesn't look quite like recession, but it is falling and that's a problem.

So again, how low will they go? If you're looking for the 75-basis-point cut, people say that's because the economy is near recession. That's why you need it. Why would they only cut 50? It's a consensus-driven Fed. Greenspan won't get the group to sign on for 75. And what if they cut 75 and a couple of days later the stock market keeps sliding? Well, couldn't you see every headline? `Panic. Crisis. The Fed Can't Even
Stop It.' That's why Fed futures funds traders, among other reasons, are looking for that 22-percent chance of a 75-basis-point cut. Looking for the half-hour.
HAINES: All right. Don't go anywhere. The Briefcase tape is in the house. We'll figure it out next. (Announcements)

HD            Canada Post a target after ruling  in Germany: UPS victimized by predatory pricing

LP
In a decision sure to be closely scrutinized in Canada, the German post service was ordered yesterday to pay a  fine of US$21.7-million for using profit from its mail monopoly to price competitors out of the parcel-delivery market.

The predatory pricing ruling was prompted by a complaint by United Parcel Service Inc., which is mounting a similar challenge against the federal government in connection with Canada Post.

TD
The U.S. courier has filed suit under the North American Free Trade Agreement claiming that Canada Post, which operates Purolator, Priority Courier and Xpresspost, unfairly cross-subsidizes its courier services with revenue generated from selling stamps. UPS is asking for US$160-million in compensation.

Tad Segal, a spokesman for UPS, said yesterday's ruling by the European  Commission should send a clear message to Canada.

"We've seen a ruling here that  Deutsche Post was cross-subsidizing, was abusing its dominant position and was acting to prevent fair competition," Mr. Segal said from Washington. "We, of course, maintain that this is occurring in Canada with regard to preferential treatment being given to Canada Post.

"I think there is a level of similarity between the two cases to the extent that these are two government monopolies doing two similar things."

Canada Post, which is contesting UPS's allegations, says it has been reviewed twice by the federal Competition Bureau and had its books audited to see whether there is any cross-subsidization. The investigations have uncovered no inappropriate funding of competitive services with profits from letter mail.

"My translation is that UPS would like to see the competition that Canada Post represents to them out of the way so they could have a greater share of the Canadian marketplace -- which is what they are doing throughout Europe ," Ida Irwin, a spokesman for Canada Post, said from Ottawa. "That is the gist of it.

"Canada Post has been delivering mail and parcels for 150 years, long before UPS was ever created. So, I suppose if there is any competition, it is UPS that is moving into areas Canada Post has been servicing forever ."
Ms. Irwin said the NAFTA tribunal is expected to start hearing the case within the next two months.




Page 56 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Yesterday's ruling, which found  Deutsche Post created an unfair and uneven competitive playing field, will result in a separation of the German postal service's monopoly letter mail services and its competitive parcel business, which competes directly with the private sector.

Mike Eskew, United Parcel's vice-chairman, said he hopes the ruling will reverberate around the world.

"We sincerely hope the European  Commission's ruling will be fully enforced and will serve as the starting point for other governments around the world," Mr. Eskew said in a statement. "Other postal monopolies like the U.S. Postal Service and Canada Post that are engaging in similar activities should take note that this type of behavior is unacceptable."

There were predictions following the ruling that rival delivery services will seek to use it to wedge open Europe's US$55-billion postal services market to competition.

Technology, media and telecom sectors bounced back from lows ahead of the US Fed decision on interest rates. Telecom stocks also gained from a call by the European  Commission for governments to be more lenient over next generation mobile phone licences, possibly allowing companies to delay payments or share infrastructure.

The telecom industry has already invested about Euros 140bn on licences, pushing debt to equity levels close to 50 per cent at operators such as BT, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.

TD
France Telecom, which has annual results tomorrow, rose 2.8 per cent to Euros 61.90, Deutsche
Telecom rose 5.2 per cent to Euros 26.63 and Telecom Italia rose 1.5 per cent to Euros 11.19.
Telecom equipment makers were buoyant as the CeBIT technology fair opened in Germany. Alcatel was
6.9 per cent ahead at Euros 39.30, Nokia up 5.3 per cent at Euros 30, and Ericsson up 6.8 per cent at
Euros 62.50.

Software maker SAP rose 7.5 per cent to Euros 137.62 in late trading. Kevin Ashton at Deutsche Bank said that although it was a big rise for the stock, "its share price has been hammered recently. I honestly see nothing unusual. All the software stocks we follow are up sharply today, with investors looking forward to the US rate cut".

But Philips Electronics fell 1.8 per cent to a 14-month low of Euros 31.95 after it guided the market down on first quarter earnings. Its results are due out on April 17.

Philips, Europe's third biggest producer of semiconductors, said operating profits for this side of the business would fall by 10 per cent. But it said it expected to outperform the chip market by 5 per cent over the full year because of its lower exposure to the PC industry.
Merck Finck earnings cut

Several brokerage downgrades resulted, including German bank Merck Finck which cut its earnings per share forecast for 2001 from Euros 2.24 to Euros 1.91 and Deutsche Bank which cut its estimate for first quarter earnings by 15-20 per cent.

Other chip sector stocks were firmer, with ASM Lithography up 3.2 per cent to Euros 23.63, STMicroelectronics up 3.4 per cent to Euros 38.75 and Infineon up 4.1 per cent to Euros 40.60.

The Swedish engineering company Atlas Copco fell 16 per cent to SKr169 after forecasting that first quarter results were likely to be flat, or only marginally higher than the same period last year. The shares have lost about 25 per cent in the last two weeks. The Rental Service unit, which accounts for 30 per
cent of revenues, was forecast to have a weak first quarter. The company said: "The slowdown in the construction and manufacturing industry activity has affected us more than anticipated." Regular world markets updates at  www.ft.com/markets.

Other Swedish engineering companies fell on the news. The Swiss-Swedish engineer ABB fell 3.7 per cent to SFr124.25 and the tool maker Sandvik fell 5.2 per cent to SKr198. ABB's chief executive Joergen Centerman said the group still expected higher earnings in 2001.

German graphite maker SGL Carbon dropped 12.7 per cent to Euros 33.98 as it said a fourth quarter slump in the US steel sector had prompted it to cut its operating profits forecast for 2001. However, the group undertook to continue heavy investment in its new technology fields of fuel cell materials and carbon fibre brake discs. It is also seeking closer co-operation with Porsche and Volkswagen and a new US partner for aerospace applications.

Clariant slipped 3.2 per cent to close at SFr511, after an early 4.4 per cent tumble, as the Swiss speciality chemicals company warned of a weak start to 2001 and reported a 14 per cent drop in net profits for 2000.
'Difficult situation'

Clariant blamed "the difficult situation in the motor industry", but said it expected its markets to pick up momentum as the year went on. It believed raw materials costs could start to ease from the second quarter.

Drugs group Sanofi-Synthelabo had a second good day, rising 4.9 per cent to Euros 60, as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded the stock and set a Euros 75 target price. Sanofi rose 7.1 per cent on Monday after an international study said its Plavix drug reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with heart problems.

Finnish pharmaceuticals group Orion dropped 10 per cent to Euros 21.70 after the company said international sales of its Orion Pharma division were slower than expected. As recently as February, Orion said Pharma's international operations would show continued growth in 2001 but operating profit would fall because of marketing, research and development costs.

French drinks group Remy Cointreau soared 9 per cent to Euros 32.59 after Sweden's Vin &Spirit, which owns Absolut Vodka, confirmed it had agreed to buy a 25 per cent stake in Maxxium, a distribution venture that includes Remy, Fortune Brands and Highland Distillers.

Deutsche Post lost 4.4 per cent to Euros 20.93 on its second day of trading as a constituent of
Germany's blue chip Dax index. The tumble came as the European  Commission announced a Euros
24m fine for the German post office for breaking competition laws.

Among financials, Deutsche Bank had a good day, rising 4.1 per cent to Euros 81.58 as foreign investors covered short positions, tracking gains in US peers overnight.

Zurich Financial spurted sharply higher as the group announced its US-based Farmers Insurance arm had struck a deal with Bank of America to offer banking and insurance services. Zurich, which announces full year earnings figures tomorrow, closed with a gain of 4.4 per cent at SFr705.

Swedish mutual funds and insurance group Skandia shot 8.1 per cent higher to Euros 98.50 as the company flatly dismissed a newspaper report that it was in talks to acquire Spanish telecoms operator Auna's 49 per cent stake in digital pay-TV company Quiero TV.

Deutsche Post, the German postal company, is to pay a Euros 24m ( #15m)  fine and restructure its operations after the European  Commission ruled yesterday that it had illegally cross-subsidised services.

In a decision that could have important consequences for Europe's postal liberalisation, the Commission said Deutsche Post broke European treaties by abusing its dominant position. The case was initiated in a complaint by United Parcel Services in 1994.

TD
Deutsche Post will now spin off its business parcel services into a separate subsidiary. The subsidiary and the rest of the company will have to charge each other market rates.

"Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of cross-subsidies that postal monopolies must respect," said Mario Monti, competition commissioner.

Deutsche Post expressed relief that the investigation had ended. "We consider the result, which offers our clients and the capital markets a basis for future planning, in every way positive," said  Deutsche     Post.

The pending investigations have overshadowed  Deutsche Post's share price since the government floated about 25 per cent of the state-owned enterprise in November. After hovering around its Euros 21 listing price yesterday, the stock closed 4.93 per cent lower at Euros 20.83. On Monday,  Deutsche Post became a member of the Dax-30 index of Germany's 30 blue chips.

The Commission found that, between 1990 and 1995, the rates charged by the company's business parcel services did not cover the cost of operations - let alone the use of the rest of  Deutsche Post's infrastructure - making competition difficult. It said the company had "foreclosed competition" with a scheme from 1974 to 2000 that gave big discounts to heavy users of its mail order parcel services.

UPS called the decision a "step in the right direction to stop the distortion of competition caused by a state-owned monopoly". Most importantly, UPS said, it hoped other postal monopolies in the EU would take note of the ruling.  www.ft.com/retail.

HD    POSTAL SERVICES - DEUTSCHE POST FINED EURO 24 MILLION BY THE COMMISSION. WC   493 words

The European  Commission has fined Deutsche Post AG Euro 24 million, March 20, for abusing its dominant position within the German postal sector and has made it offer to operate its business services as a separate company. The company missed out on a further  fine on a legal technicality. The
Commission came to these conclusions after an investigation that found the German postal company was using its monopoly in the letter market to fund its business division. This is the first formal decision taken in the postal sector under Article 82 of the Amsterdam Treaty that prohibits abuses of dominant position in a marketplace.

TD
"Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of 'cross-subsidies' which must be respected by postal monopolies that are also engaged in activities open to competition," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "The winner is clearly the public at large: pricing below cost must be paid by somebody - and that 'somebody' is usually the monopoly's customers. Moreover, pricing below cost forecloses market entry by efficient competitors and therefore prevents a wider offer at better prices and service conditions. I am particularly pleased that in this case we have not simply sanctioned anti-competitive practices, but
achieved a forward-looking result, in the form of  Deutsche Post's commitments in the parcel delivery market which are of great importance to the development of electronic commerce."In 1994 United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) lodged a complaint with the  Commission, that  Deutsche Post was subsidising its business parcel services through its letter-mail monopoly. Without this assistance UPS claimed that Deutsche Post would not have been able to offer below-cost deliveries of business post.

The Commission's decision sets a standard for measuring "cross-subsidies" between a monopoly in one sector and competitive or predatory pricing in another in the postal market. The EU institution considers that any cost coverage below this level is predatory pricing, which falls foul of Article 82. The investigation
discovered that  Deutsche Post had not been charging enough to cover the costs of the mail-order delivery service. A service that is cheaper for a postal company to run because it uses less transportation in the delivery process. The company was not  fined for this because at the time the definition of predatory operations had not been sufficiently developed.The new company that  Deutsche Post has offered to set
up will have to operate at market rate and pay Deutsche the market price for any services that it contracts in.

The findings also condemn Deutsche's long-standing scheme of fidelity rebates that were given to companies using its mail order parcel delivery system. The  Commission found that substantial discounts were given to customers for over 25 years between 1974 and 2000. The scheme throttled any competition and between 1990 and 1999 it was noted that  Deutsche Post had 85% of the market.

Deutsche Post, the German postal company, is to pay a E24m ($21.7m)  fine and restructure its operations after the European  Commission ruled on Tuesday that it had illegally cross-subsidised services.

In a decision that could have important consequences for Europe's postal liberalisation, the Commission said Deutsche Post broke European treaties by abusing its dominant position. The case was initiated in a complaint by United Parcel Services in 1994.

TD
Deutsche Post will now spin off its business parcel services into a separate subsidiary to prevent further cross-subsidies from its basic services. The subsidiary and the rest of the company will have to charge each other market rates.

"Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of cross-subsidies that postal monopolies who are also engaged in activities open to competition must respect," said Mario Monti, competition commissioner.

Deutsche Post expressed relief that the investigation had ended. "We consider the result, which offers our clients and the capital markets a basis for future planning, in every way positive,"  Deutsche Post said on Tuesday.

The company's shares have fallen 15 per cent ahead of the  Commission's decision and a subdued outlook for its 2000 earnings due this week.

The pending investigations have overshadowed the share price since the government floated about 25 per cent of the state-owned enterprise in November. After hovering around its E21.00 listing price during large parts of the day, the stock closed 4.93 per cent lower at E20.83. On Monday  Deutsche Post became a member of the Dax-30 index of Germany's 30 blue chips.

The European  Commission found that, between 1990 and 1995, the rates charged by the company's business parcel services did not cover the cost of operations, making competition difficult.
The Commission also ruled that the company had "foreclosed competition" with a scheme from 1974 to
2000 that gave big discounts to heavy users of its mail order parcel services.

Brussels is still looking at whether the high postal rates set by the German government constitute state aid, and also at a complaint by the British Post Office about surcharges on business bulk mailings into Germany.

UPS called the decision a "step in the right direction to stop the distortion of competition". Most importantly, UPS said, it hoped other postal monopolies in the EU would take note of the ruling.

FRANKFURT, March 19 -- In a victory for United Parcel Service, the European  Commission ruled today that the German postal service illegally used profits from its monopoly in delivering letters to subsidize its prices for business parcels and other packages.

Seven years after U.P.S. first complained about the company, Deutsche Post A.G., the Europeans' top antitrust regulator announced that  Deutsche Post had agreed to pay a fine of 24 million euros, or
$21.8 million, and to separate its monopoly business in letters from its competitive businesses in package delivery.

TD
The decision represents the first time regulators have attacked cross-subsidies by European postal services, most of which are still government-controlled but have expanded to compete against the likes of U.P.S., FedEx and, increasingly, each other.

U.P.S. executives said that they were pleased with today's verdict, but that the proof would come in the results. They acknowledged that the  fine on Deutsche Post was small by comparison with what it has spent buying stakes in courier services like DHL Worldwide Express, which it controls. ''Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of cross-subsidization,'' said Anton van der Lande, a
spokesman for U.P.S. in Brussels. ''In theory, it is satisfactory. But we have to ensure that it is executed properly.''

In Washington, U.P.S. reiterated demands that the Transportation Department revoke DHL's license to forward international freight because of  Deutsche Post's control.
A government-owned agency until a few years ago,  Deutsche Post has transformed itself into a
for-profit company, going public in November. In trading here today, its stock fell 5.2 percent, to 20.75
euros, or $18.84.

Both Deutsche Post and many investors had anticipated today's ruling by the European Commission, the day-to-day executive agency of the European Union. Klaus Zumwinkel, Deutsche Post's chief executive, said that the decision was ''within our expectations'' and that he was happy that the
European Commission had resolved most of the questions raised against the company.

U.P.S. argues that  Deutsche Post stifled competition in delivering packages by subsidizing its low prices in that business with its high profit from the delivery of letters -- where it still has a monopoly. German postal rates for domestic mail run about 51 cents a letter.

Mario Monti, the European commissioner for competition, said in a statement that  Deutsche Post had improperly subsidized package services from 1995 until last October. In a statement Mr. Monti said,
''The investigation revealed that  Deutsche Post, for a period of five years, did not cover the incremental cost of providing the mail-order delivery business.''
Regulators criticized the German company for offering special loyalty discounts to big customers.

The ruling could have effects on practices in other European countries, where monopoly postal services have similar ambitions to compete in international-parcel delivery. Indeed,  Deutsche Post's biggest competitors in Germany are companies controlled by the French and British postal services.

Fed Cuts Rates a Half-Point But Disappoints Investors

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates a half percentage point, continuing its effort to resuscitate the faltering economy but disappointing investors who had hoped for more.

TD
The Fed said it saw ''substantial risks'' that the economy could remain weak for an extended period and made clear that it was open to lowering rates again before its next meeting on May 15. But investors were still disappointed that the rate cut was not bigger and sent financial markets down sharply. [Page A1.]

Profit Falls 13% at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs said that its net income fell 13 percent in its first quarter, but the decline was less than Wall Street analysts had been expecting given the difficult operating climate. The results helped to lift Goldman's stock price during early trading, but the shares slumped along with the overall market and closed at $87.06, down $3.88. [C6.]

DEUTSCHE POST, Europe's largest post office, was yesterday humbled by Brussels and ordered to pay a fine of 24 million ( #15 million) for offering loyal business customers unfair and anti-competitive discounts over a 26-year period.

The German group has also been forced to set up an entirely new company to supply business parcel services after it was found to have cross-subsidised this part of its business using profits from its domestic mail monopoly, undercutting rivals and effectively keeping them out of the market.

TD
Deutsche Post, which went public last November, is the subject of a further two inquiries by the European Commission, which have caused embarrassment in Berlin and have been seized upon to highlight an apparent discrepancy between its commitment to EU postal reform and the state of the German market. Brussels is investigating the price of postal services in Germany and whether Deutsche Post illegally used profits from its monopoly to finance the purchase of courier companies.

The Commission said Deutsche Post had "abused its dominant position by granting fidelity rebates and engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services". Mario Monti, the Competition Commissioner, said: "Today's decision establishes clear rules on the issue of
cross-subsidies that postal monopolies must respect. The winner is the public at large."
The Commission's investigation, which was sparked by a complaint from America's United Parcel
Service in 1994, found that the German firm offered "substantial discounts" between 1974 and October
2000 on condition that "the customer sent its entire mail order parcel business or at least a sizeable
proportion thereof via  Deutsche Post".

CONDEMNED FOR ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION,  DEUTSCHE POST SEE ITSELF FORCED TO SEPARATE ITS PARCEL SERVICES FROM ITS LETTER MONOPOLY.

Brussels, 20/03/2001 (Agence Europe) - The European  Commission concluded the investigation opened against Deutsche Post AG (DPAG) by deciding that the German postal operator had abused its dominant position by granting fidelity discounts and by engaging in predatory pricing in the market for business parcel services (for details, see EUROPE of 5 October, p.11). Following this decision, DPAG saw itself inflicted
with a fine of EUR 24 million and forced to create a separate company for these services.

TD
The Commission investigation is based on the complaint put forward in 1994 by United Parcel Service asserting that Deutsche Post used profits from its letter-mail monopoly to finance a predatory pricing strategy in the parcel sector open, it, to competition. The  Commission agreed that this system of crossed subsidies constituted an abuse of dominant position as it had as a consequence to prevent the arrival of effective competitors in the market, with better prices and a better service. In order to make the market more transparent, DPAG has undertaken to create a separate company to provide business parcel services. This new company will be free to procure the "inputs" necessary for its services (for example parcel sorting, transport and distribution) from DPAG or third parties or even produce them itself. In case the company chooses to buy them from DPAG, the latter will have to provide it with all of the good and services concerned at the market price. Moreover, DPAG has undertaken that all inputs, which it will provide to the new company will be equally provided to its competitors, at the same price and with the same conditions. Due to this, DPAG will not be incited to invoice the new company as prices below that of
the market. The decision, adopted today by the  Commission, is important as it is the first decision formally adopted in the postal sector under Article 82 of the Treaty, which bans the abuse of dominant positions.

FRANKFURT, March 21 (Reuters) -  Deutsche Post sank to new lows on Wednesday on concern about full-year results due at the end of the week and about ongoing investigations by the European Commission after it  fined Germany's post office on Tuesday.
By 1104 GMT  Deutsche Post was down 1.49 percent at 20.44 euros, after earlier sinking as low as
19.92, some five percent below its issue price.

TD
The stock was listed at 21 euros on November 20 and joined the blue-chip DAX on Monday.

"I think it's a little fear before Friday. People are convinced that the numbers won't be that good. And they're worried by the fact there are still more investigations," said Juergen Pieper, analyst at Bankhaus Metzler.

The European  Commission said on Tuesday it had  fined Deutsche Post 24 million euros ($21.6 million) for abusing its dominant position to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.

The Commission is still investigating the company on pricing by its letter-delivery branch and on the practice of "remailing," or intercepting mail from other countries to Germany and adding a surcharge.

Pieper, who rates  Deutsche Post a "sell," said a lack of profit momentum in 2001 and 2002 kept him negative on the stock.

"A comparison with a benchmark like UPS leads us to believe that the Post isn't as strong as the impression they made at their listing," he said.
Post shares have lost 17.5 percent of their worth since hitting an all-time high of 24.78 euros on
February 2.

WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The European  Commission's decision to  fine Deutsche Post World Net 24 million euros ($21.7 million) for abusing its dominant market position gives added urgency to demands that the U.S. strip DHL Worldwide Express of its U.S. operating licence, UPS said.

Deutsche Post, the German government-controlled postal corporation, is the largest single shareholder in the DHL Worldwide network.

TD
Since late January, UPS and FedEx have been waging a campaign to have DHL Worldwide's U.S. operating authority stripped on the grounds that foreign freight forwarder status should not be accorded to an entity controlled by a foreign government postal monopoly which has engaged in predatory practices.

"Allowing DHL to retain this license effectively imports the unfair competitive practices of  Deutsche      Post from Europe," UPS vice chairman Mike Eskew said in a statement.

As a foreign controlled company, DHL Worldwide Express must have a foreign freight forwarder licence to operate within the U.S. in support of the DHL global network.

While the European ruling will result in a separation of Deutsche Post's letter monopoly in Germany from its competititve parcel businesses, that still gives Deutsche Post a chance to cross subsidize DHL operations in the U.S. until then, said UPS.
"Clearly it is not in the best interests of the U.S. to allow  Deutsche Post to do here what it has done in
Europe," said Eskew.

UPS said the EC-mandated split-up of Deutsche Post won't occur for at least the remainder of this year, "leaving plenty of time for Deutsche Post to funnel monopoly profits into DHL for its U.S. operations."

UPS also said the European ruling should serve as a warning to government postal agencies like the United States Postal Service and Canada Post against subsidizing competitive services with profits from letter mail monopolies.

The European ruling affirmed a formal suit filed by UPS in 1994 charging  Deutsche Post with setting predatory prices to drive out competition in competitive services and with cross-subsidizing its commercial products with revenue from its monopoly services.

HD         Regulatory woes cloud Deutsche Post outlook. BY          By Marijn van der Pas

FRANKFURT, March 22 (Reuters) - Regulatory concerns dogging  Deutsche Post will overshadow a healthy rise in net profits the recently floated German post operator is set to reveal on Friday, analysts say.

Deutsche Post stock has been hammered in recent weeks and hit a fresh low on Thursday. It is trading some six percent below its issue price of 21 euros in a public offering last November.

TD
The latest slide has been triggered by a European  Commission decision on Tuesday to  fine the German post operator 24 million euros ($21.33 million) for abusing its former monopolist power to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.

"Although the EU  fine was moderate, it made investors aware of the investigation risks that still surround the Post," said Juergen Pieper, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler.

Deutsche Post faces two other investigations by the  Commission, in a sign that its past as a government monopoly will continue to haunt the company.

The competition watchdog is investigating whether the German government gave banned aid to the group by setting prices too high in its monopoly letter-delivery business.

Deutsche Post's surcharges on handling mail sent by large German companies from Britain because
British postage rates were lower than domestic ones are also under scrutiny.

In addition, the company faces a regulatory threat in the key U.S. market, where rivals to its express delivery service, recently boosted by taking control of DHL, have taken action against the former state monopoly.

U.S. rivals United Parcel Service and FedEx want the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to suspend DHL Worldwide Express' foreign freight forwarder licence on the grounds it remains a government-controlled company. The state still owns 71 percent of  Deutsche Post.

Also, FedEx has petitioned the DOT to remove the operating licence of DHL Airways, which carries most DHL traffic within the United States, arguing it was not a U.S.-controlled carrier and therefore not eligible to fly domestic U.S. routes.

UPS' complaint filed to the European  Commission in 1994 is responsible for the  fine the Post received earlier this week.
RECORD LOW

Shares in Deutsche Post hit a fresh all-time low of 19.40 euros on Thursday before regaining some ground. By 1245 GMT, the stock was down 0.20 percent at 19.91 euros. The stock has still outperformed the blue-chip DAX by 12 percent since the November flotation.



Page 86 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Six analysts polled by Reuters this week expected Post to report a 36 percent surge in net profit to 1.52 billion euros ($1.35 billion). The company said in October it was comfortable with earlier analyst predictions for a 1.5 billion profit.

Sales are forecast to come in at 31.96 billion against 22.36 billion in 1999. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) are seen at 2.21 billion euros versus 939 million euros after writedowns.

Bernd Janssen, analyst at USB Warburg, one of  Deutsche Post's lead underwriters, said he was confident the Post would not give the market any negative surprises.

"We are really confident that the Post will not disappoint with its results," he said, adding that despite its recent weakness the stock had outperformed the broad market, which is in retreat due to fears of economic slowdown.

Janssen said he also hoped Deutsche Post would give encouraging details on the integration of a number of acquisitions it has made in recent years as it strives to widen its offer.

"The important question is how the integration of its European express divisions is proceeding and how its logistics networks are being integrated," he said.

Deutsche Post is diversifying itself into parcels deliveries and logistics services in order to soften the blow of the liberalisation of the European postal market, which is slowly eating away its monopoly for letters in Germany.

Germany's postal watchdog RegTP said at the beginning of this month it wants  Deutsche Post's mail monopoly in Germany to end in 2003 as originally planned and not be extended to 2007 as the government had proposed.

London - Germany's  Deutsche Post World Net reported record revenues and profits for 2000 Friday and said it is on track to become the globe's top logistics provider. The mail, express and logistics giant lifted corporate revenue by 46% to 32.7 billion ($28.8 billion), mainly as a result of acquisitions, while
net profits jumped 48% to 1.53 billion ($1.35 billion).

Earnings before interest, tax and amortization rose 158% to 2.38 billion ($2.1billion), in line with market expectations.

TD
The record figures provided a much-needed tonic after the European  Commission ordered the company earlier in the week to pay a 24 million ($21.1 million)  fine and split off its parcels operations, saying it was guilty of predatory pricing and anti-competitive practices.

"The corporate figures speak of the group's extraordinarily dynamic development into a global player," said Klaus Zumwinkel, chairman of the board of management. The record figures and the increase in foreign revenue to 29% last year from 2% in 1998, he said, "show that we are on track to becoming the Number One global player in the logistics industry."

Despite its rapid expansion into parcels, logistics and financial services, the company continues to generate the bulk of its earnings from mail, where it has a monopoly in Germany. The mail division boosted revenues slightly to 11.7 billion while Ebitda doubled, to 2 billion from 1.01 billion in 1999.

While the traditional mail activities still dominate earnings, their contribution to revenues is falling sharply, dipping to 34% last year from 50% in 1999.The contribution to overall profits is also lessening, falling to 74% last year compared with over 90% in 1999.

The express division reported a 26% gain in revenues to 6.02 billion and profit were 27% higher at 76 million.

The logistics business, which groups Danzas, the Swiss freight forwarder, and AEI, the biggest U.S. air freight forwarder, increased revenues 86% to 8.3 billion and booked profits of 113 million.

Deutsche Post expressed relief over the  commission ruling after a seven-year investigation of a complaint by United Parcel Service, as a "generally positive result" that offers its customers and capital markets "planning security."

The company will now spin off its business parcels unit into a separate operation, but it said it does not expect this will have a negative impact on its revenues and profits.

HANOVER, Germany, March 23 (AFP) - The German post office,  Deutsche Post, achieved a 48-percent rise in net profit last year to 1.53 billion euros (1.4 billion dollars), the semi-public company said on Friday.

Operating profit soared 158 percent to 2.38 billion euros and sales also rose strongly, climbing 46 percent to 32.71 billion euros,  Deutsche Post said in a statement released at the CeBIT computer and information technology trade fair here.

TD
Chairman Klaus Zumwinkel said that the figures "show our extremely rapid transformation into a global player". He said: "We achieved a quantum leap in sales and more than doubled our profit. These record figures, and an increase in the proportion of overseas revenue, show that we're on the right road to becoming the world's leading player in logistics."

Deutsche Post generated 11.7 billion euros in revenues and 2.0 billion euros of its operating profit from letter delivery, for which it currently holds a monopoly in Germany.

Sales in its Express parcel delivery division rose by 26 percent to 6.02 billion euros and profit rose by 27 percent to 76 million euros.
The logistics division swung to a profit of 113 million euros from a loss of 30 million euros in 1999 on an
86-percent rise in revenue to 8.3 billion euros.

But the most successful division was financial services where, as a result of the first-time consolidation of DSL-Bank, profits increased more than eightfold, or 771 percent, to 505 million euros on a 178-percent rise in sales to eight billion euros.
The positive figures were welcomed by investors and shares in  Deutsche Post were showing a gain of
0.71 euros or 3.71 percent at 19.84 euros on the Frankfurt stock exchange.

The shares had fallen heavily earlier in the week following the decision by the EU  Commission on Tuesday to slap a  fine of 24 million euros on the semi-public company for abusing its position in the parcel delivery market.

Chairman Zumwinkel said that  Deutsche Post planned to float its majority-owned US unit, DHL International, in two years or more.

Deutsche Post recently increased its stake in DHL to 51 percent from 25 percent previously and expects to increase it to 75 percent at a later date.

By contrast,  Deutsche Post had no intention of listing its own shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Zumwinkel added.

HANOVER, Germany, March 23 (Reuters) - German post office  Deutsche Post reported a 48 percent surge in 2000 net profit on Friday but its shares fell to new lows amid worries it remains too reliant on its traditional letter-delivery business.

The company said net profit rose to 1.53 billion euros ($1.36 billion) last year - in line with market expectations, with six analysts polled by Reuters this week forecasting on average a result of 1.52 billion euros.

TD
Deutsche Post shares initially rose after Chief Executive Klaus Zumwinkel said the first two months of
2001 had gone as the company had expected and that sales and profits in the full year should also
develop as planned.

But the stock later fell to a fresh all-time low of 18.75 euros as market players raised concerns that the company had failed to expand fast enough beyond its traditional letter delivery business.

Post is diversifying into parcel deliveries and logistics services in order to soften the blow of the liberalisation of the European postal market, which is slowly eating away its monopoly on delivering letters in Germany.
Group earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) grew 158 percent to 2.38 billion euros,
2.0 billion of which came from the key letter division.

"The figures are very close to market expectations. What doesn't please us, however, is that Express and Logistics come up so short. There is still a strong dependence on the letter division," said Juergen Pieper, analyst at Bankhaus Metzler.

By 1540 GMT, Post shares were down 0.94 percent at 18.95 euros. Germany's blue-chip DAX index, on which Post has been trading since Monday, was up 2.5 percent. Post shares were issued at 21 euros in a public offering last November.

The share price fall came despite Zumwinkel saying signs of slowing economic growth in some parts of the world were not affecting earnings, though he declined to put a figure on earnings expectations for the rest of the year.
"We have  fine, solid figures," he told a news conference at the CeBIT technology trade fair in Hanover. "There is no reason at all for us to revise our earnings expectations...It's more likely the other way. I'd
be more inclined to be a touch optimistic after our first two months."
EU STRIFE
A recent slide in Post's shares was triggered by a European  Commission decision on Tuesday to  fine
the company 24 million euros ($21.33 million) for abusing its former monopolist power to undercut
rivals in the German parcels market.


Page 92 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Zumwinkel stressed that the EU  Commission's decision to impose the  fine related only to cut rates on some parcel delivery services.

He said the Commission had not ruled that  Deutsche Post had been cross-subsidising less profitable parts of its business and said the  fine would not endanger financial results. "We are relaxed," he said.

Deutsche Post faces two other investigations by the  Commission - a sign that its past as a government monopoly will continue to haunt the company.
But Zumwinkel stressed  Deutsche Post could count on fixed charges for its letter delivery services
until the end of 2002 and played down suggestions that the government would enforce a price cut after
the expiry of the current tariff agreement.
"I am assuming that we will not have to cut letter delivery prices," he said.

Zumwinkel did not rule out an acquisition in the United States, the home of  Deutsche Post's major competitors, UPS and FedEx but gave no concrete indications of any plans.
"It would have to be a good opportunity. We wouldn't let a good opportunity go," he said.

SUPPORTERS OF LIBERALISATION OF TRANSPORT AND POSTAL SERVICES CALL ON COMMISSION TO DRAW LESSON FROM "DEUTSCHE POST" PRECEDENT ON CROSSED SUBSIDIES.

Brussels, 23/03/2001 (Agence Europe) - The association representing private providers of postal services and their users, the "Free and Fair Post Initiative" (FFPI), as well as the International Road Transport Union (IRTU), this week welcomed the decision by the European  Commission, which condemns Deutsche Post to a fine of EUR 24 million and the obligation to separate its parcel and letter services, in order to avoid crossed subsidies (see EUROPE of 21 March, p.12).

TD
For the Free and Fair Post Initiative, this decision awaited since 1994 constitutes a significant step towards the establishment of a fair playing field for the postal sector in Europe. The  Commission decision will set the line between what is allowed and what is not in the postal sector, however the FFPI is convinced that Germany is not the only Member State where similar cases are being examined and should be corrected. According to the British daily The Financial Times, the case of the Belgian Post office will also be in the line of fire. However the FFPI feels that an improvement in postal sertvices through decisions on a case by
case basis, such as those adopted by the  Commission (for Deutsche Post) is insufficient. We must set a deadline for the total liberalisation of postal services, assures the President of the Association, Philippe Bodson.

In agreement, the International Road Transport Union welcomed this decision on crossed subsidies that creates a significant precedent in favour of European competition. It called on the  Commission to presently form a strong and harmonised position by clearly explaining that, supporting loss making companies with receipts from profitable operations is incompatible with the efficient functioning of any market. For the new head of the IRTU representative to the Union, Hubert Linssen, including the categorical rejection of the principal of crossed subsidies in the future White Paper on European transport policy could be a good starting point.

EU/POST - DEUTSCHE POST AG FAVOURABLY WELCOMES END OF INVESTIGATION OPENED BY
COMMISSION FOR ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION.

Brussels, 23/03/2001 (Agence Europe) - In a press release, Deutsche Post AG (DPAG) favourably welcomed the conclusions of the investigation opened against it by the Commission, investigation which concluded that the German postal operators abused its dominant position by granting fidelity discounts and predatory pricing policies on the market for business parcel services and forcing it to separate its "parcel" and "letter" activities in order to avoid crossed subsidies (see article below). DPAG underlined that the ending of this procedure reassured its customers and capital markets. As for the  fine of EUR 24 million imposed by the Commission, DPAG indicates that it corresponds to reserves already made in the company's accounts.

EU Fines Deutsche Post: The European  Commission fined Germany's  Deutsche Post World Net 24 million euros ($21.6 million) for abusing its dominant position in domestic delivery of business parcels. The commission also ordered DP to create a separate business parcels division to ensure that the parent company doesn't subsidize its activities. It was the  commission's first antitrust decision in the EU's $75 billion-a-year postal market. Barring appeals, it closes a case that originated in 1994 when United Parcel Service charged that  Deutsche Post was subsidizing its money-losing parcel unit from its monopoly
postal operations. Arzoon Acquires From2: Arzoon, a supplier of software for supply-chain management, has acquired From2, a provider of web-based trade compliance services. Terms weren't disclosed. Arzoon, based in San Mateo, Calif., provides data such as shipping schedules and other tools to aid online transactions.

TD
From2, a privately held company with offices in Miami and Washington, specializes in global trade software and consulting services.

Hub Sticks With IT Investment: Hub Group's chief executive, David Yeager, says that although investment in information technology hurt Hub's earnings last year, the company is committed to automation. "Information technology is what's going to separate the men from the boys in this business," Yeager said
at an ING Barings transportation and logistics conference. He said Hub's information technology spending will remain about $10 million a year.

FedEx Says Market Has 'Deteriorated': FedEx Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 5%. The company warned that "market conditions have deteriorated" more than was expected a few months ago. The express carrier said net income totaled $109 million on revenue of $4.8 billion. Alan B. Graf Jr., FedEx's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said there are signs the economy is worsening.

Customs Advisory Group To Be Launched: The Trade Automation Policy Forum is being formed to provide an industry sounding board for technical development of Customs' Automated Commercial Environment. Michael Eads, executive director of the new forum, said it intends to work with Customs and the ACE prime contractor to offer industry views on technical aspects of the new computer system. The group is a reorganization of the International Electronic Trade Steering Committee, formed in 1998 to promote customs automation ideas in the U.S. and abroad.

Shenzhen Plans $1.9 Billion Expansion: China plans to spend $1.9 billion over the next five years to expand the southern port of Shenzhen. The city, adjacent to Hong Kong, plans 13 port construction projects, including Yantian and Shekou. The program aims to boost Shenzhen's combined
container-handling capacity to 6.5 million TEUs by 2005 and 10 million by 2010. Container volume at
Shenzhen reached 3.99 million TEUs last year, but facilities were operating at 970f designed capacity.

Long Beach Terminals Blacked Out: The Port of Long Beach fell victim last week to California's rolling electrical blackouts. Power was interrupted to at least three container terminals on Monday. The neighboring port of Los Angeles is not part of the state's electricity grid, and port officials say they don't expect any power shutdowns. Although cargo-handling operations at Long Beach were interrupted, there were no reports of injuries or accidents. The Port of Oakland experienced blackouts in January but was not affected last week.

Australia Plans Hoof-And-Mouth Precautions: Carriers are warning that the broadening hoof-and-mouth disease outbreak could slow the movement of cargo in Australia, but apparently the restrictions aren't as
Page 96 of 102 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
severe as had been feared. Carriers said that after discovery of the disease in Europe, South America and the Middle East, the Australian Quarantine & Inspection Service had decided to inspect all inbound containers and clean and disinfect dirty ones or boxes from areas where the disease had been found. But Australia New Zealand Direct Line says inspectors aren't requiring the removal of containers from chassis for inspection, so cargo delays have been minimal.

P&O Nedlloyd, MOL Upgrade Asia-ECSA Service: P&O Nedlloyd and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines will upgrade their Asia-east coast of South America service to weekly in April. Each carrier will provide five ships with capacities ranging from 2,100 to 2,800 TEUs. The port rotation will be Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe, Pusan, Keelung, Hong Kong, Singapore, Santos, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Rio Grande, San Francisco do Sul, Paranagua, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, Hong Kong and Yokohama. The Brazilian ports of Vitoria and Salvador will be served by feeder through Santos.

Tellier Proposes Incentives: Paul Tellier, chief executive of Canadian National, urged Canada's federal and provincial governments to forgo railroad fuel tax revenue and offer tax credits to shippers who switch from trucks to rail. Tellier proposed the incentives to encourage shippers to take freight off the highways. The federal and provincial taxes amount to the equivalent of about US$100 million a year. Tellier said the cost of his proposal would be offset by savings on highway construction and maintenance.

* Deutsche Post World Net (DP) will have to change its structure under the terms of a European Commission ruling issued late last month. In response to a suit brought by United Parcel Service (UPS) in 1994, which charged that DP was using revenues from its postal monopoly to unfairly subsidize its parcel-express business, the  commission ruled that DP must create a separate parcels division. That division would have to purchase services at market rates from the parent company to prevent the postal
arm from subsidizing express services. The  commission also fined DP more than $21 million for offering loyalty contracts to mail-order customers, a practice that was designed to keep smaller competitors out of the market.

Deutsche Post posted record results in 2000, despite a  fine and censure from the European Commission for illegal rebates and predatory pricing. The company reported $32.7 billion euros in sales, up 46% over 1999. It earned 29% of t h at amount outside of Germany. Profits jumped 158% to 2.38 billion euros. The sales growth was due largely to acquisitions. The firm went on a $6-billion buying binge in the late 1990s that netted global freight forwarder danzas and AEI in the US.

FRANKFURT, April 11 (Reuters) - Shares in German post office  Deutsche Post slumped three percent on Wednesday on investor fears that looming  fines from several European  Commission antitrust cases could hit its earnings hard this year, traders said.

Deutsche Post denied, however, an article in Handelsblatt on Wednesday that had fuelled some of the jitters.

TD
Citing unnamed sources at the European  Commission, the German business daily said the EU
watchdog was investigating whether the German government had given Post illegal subsidies.

"There cannot be  fines in the investigation of illegal subsidies. If at all, the Post could have to repay the money to the federal government,"  Deutsche Post spokesman Martin Dopychai told Reuters.

By 1414 GMT,  Deutsche Post shares had regained some ground to trade down 2.93 percent at 18.56 euros, leading blue-chip decliners on the DAX, which gained 0.9 percent.

"There are rumours on the floor that Post has to pay another, higher  fine," one Frankfurt-based trader said.

Deutsche Post was fined 24 million euros ($21.35 million) in March for abusing its former monopolist power to undercut rivals in the German parcels market. The group faces two other investigations by the European Commission.

Deutsche Post shares, which were listed in Frankfurt in November and joined the blue-chip segment in March, are trading 11.3 percent below their 21 euros issue price. (Additional reporting by Gill

FRANKFURT, April 11 (Reuters) - Shares in German post office Deutsche Post slumped three percent on Wednesday on fears that looming  fines from several European Commission antitrust cases could batter its earnings this year, traders said.

Deutsche Post, however, dismissed an article in Handelsblatt on Wednesday that had fuelled some of the jitters.

Citing unnamed sources at the European  Commission, the German business daily said the EU
watchdog was investigating whether the German government had given Post illegal subsidies.

"There cannot be  fines in the investigation of illegal subsidies. If at all, the Post could have to repay the money to the federal government,"  Deutsche Post spokesman Martin Dopychai told Reuters.
By 1539 GMT,  Deutsche Post shares were down 3.24 percent at 18.50 euros, the loss leader on the
DAX, which was up 0.78 percent.

"There are rumours on the floor that Post has to pay another, higher  fine," one Frankfurt-based trader said.

State-controlled  Deutsche Post was fined 24 million euros ($21.35 million) in March for abusing its former monopolist power to undercut rivals in the German parcels market.
The group faces two other investigations by the European  Commission. TWO CASES LINGER
One Brussels-based lawyer specialising in competition law said the  Commission has handled the most obvious of the cases.

The remaining charges will, however, "be much more difficult for the commisson to prove," he said. "It's certainly not a couple of months after the initial  fine that they will impose another one."

The competition watchdog is investigating whether the German government gave aid to the group by setting prices too high in its monopoly letter-delivery business.

Deutsche Post's surcharges on handling mail sent by large German companies from Britain, because
British postage rates were lower than domestic ones, are also under scrutiny.

A second Brussels competition lawyer was even more dismissive of Wednesday's market rumours: "This is just flying a kite. It's not even a story worthy of comment."

Deutsche Post shares, which made their debut in Frankfurt in November and joined the blue-chip segment in March, are trading 11.5 percent below their 21-euro issue price.
