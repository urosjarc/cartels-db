Under EU legislation, the  fine could be the equivalent of up to 10 per cent of the sales of the company in question in the markets affected.

The European Commission on Wednesday handed out a 183m ($258.2m)  fine to four companies that fixed the price of bitumen  in Spain over a 12-year period.

BP, the UK energy group, escaped a 66.4m penalty after blowing the whistle on the  cartel in 2002. Europe's antitrust regulator  fined Repsol and Cepsa of Spain 80.5m and 83.9m respectively. It hit smaller operators Nynas of Sweden and Galp of Portugal for 10.6m and 8.7m.

TD
"Bitumen  suppliers in Spain cheated customers, public authorities and tax payers by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst themselves," Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said. The material is used to make asphalt for road surfaces.

"I would like to underline once again that the  Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle their clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders," Ms Kroes said.
The market was worth 286m in 2001 and the  cartel ran from 1991-2002, she said.
Ms Kroes added that the  Commission had dropped an investigation into the bitumen  market in
Belgium. She defended the leniency code, which allows informants to escape fines.

She said BP had delivered substantial information, while Repsol and Cepsa had their  fines reduced for co-operating. All three remain vulnerable to civil suits brought by anyone who was a victim of the high prices.

Repsol and Cepsa said they would challenge the ruling in the Court of First Instance, with the latter describing the 83.8m  fine as "unjustified and disproportionate".

Repsol, Spain's largest oil and gas group was also swift to point out that the market-fixing practices ceased in 2002, since when most of its top executives and managers have left.

"The current management of the company is completely committed to complying with EU competition rules," it said. It had made provisions to cover the  fine in its 2005 and 2006 accounts.

Staffan Lennstrom, president of Nynas, said the Swedish company had allowed itself to be lured into nefarious practices.

"I regret that our systems then in place had deficiencies that allowed us to get involved in the business culture that then prevailed in the Spanish  bitumen  market," he said.

(Adds Repsol comment, background)

MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission has fined oil groups Repsol and Cepsa and the Spanish unit of Portugal's Galp Energia for fixing the price of bitumen,  a source familiar with the case said on Wednesday.

TD
The source said Repsol had been  fined 80.5 million euros ($114.1 million), Cepsa 83.9 million euros and Galp Espana 8.7 million euros. BP was not  fined.

The fines come about a year after the European Competition  Commission fined 14 companies a total of 266.7 million euros for fixing prices of  bitumen,  used to surface roads, in the Netherlands.

At that stage EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said the  commission was also investigating suspected bitumen  cartels in Belgium and Spain.

"We collaborated fully with the European  Commission and the fine has been cut to about half of its original level," a spokesman for Repsol said.

"The case dates back to practices that were stopped in 2002 and now companies act in full competition," he said.
Cepsa was not immediately available to comment.

BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission said on Wednesday it was fining four companies, including Spain's Repsol and Cepsa , a total of 183.6 million euros ($260.2 million) for operating a cartel in Spain. Repsol and Cepsa must pay  fines of 80.5 million and 83.9 million euros respectively, the Commission said in a statement.

Nynas of Sweden and Galp of Portugal were hit with smaller  fines of 10.6 million and 8.7 million euros respectively.

Britain's BP was let off a  fine because it came forward first with information about the  cartel, the
Commission statement said.

MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission said on Wednesday it was fining four companies, including Spanish energy groups Cepsa and Repsol , a total of 183.6 million euros ($260.2 million) for operating a  cartel in Spain.

TD
The companies shared the market for  bitumen,  used for road construction, and coordinated  bitumen
prices between 1991 and 2002, the European Union executive said in a statement.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and taxpayers in Spain for almost 12 years by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst them," European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"The Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders," she said in the statement.

Cepsa and Repsol must pay  fines of 83.9 million and 80.5 million euros respectively, the  Commission said, confirming an earlier report by Reuters in Madrid based on comments by a source familiar with the situation.

Nynas of Sweden and Galp Energia of Portugal were hit with smaller  fines of 10.6 million and 8.7 million euros. Britain's BP was let off a  fine because it came forward first with information about the  cartel, the statement said.
EU cartel law offers immunity to whistleblowers.

Repsol said it would appeal the fine but noted it had already received a 40 percent reduction based on its cooperation with the European Commission over the matter.
The company said it had made provisions in its 2005 and 2006 financial years for the possibility of a  fine. Cepsa also said it would appeal calling the  fine "unjustified and disproportionate, as did Galp Energia.

Bitumen  is a by-product of oil distillation and is used mainly to make asphalt for road building.

Last year the  Commission fined 14 companies a total of 266.7 million euros ($338.4 million), including a 108 million-euro penalty for Shell , for fixing prices of road surface material  bitumen  in the Netherlands.

It said at the time it was still investigating suspected  bitumen  cartels in Spain and Belgium. There was no word of a decision on Belgium in Wednesday's announcement.

MADRID, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Spanish oil company Cepsa said on Wednesday it would appeal against a fine the European  Commission levied on four companies for operating a  cartel and coordinating bitumen  prices in Spain.
Earlier, the  Commission said it was fining Cepsa 83.9 million euros ($119 million) for its role in the
cartel.

" Cepsa will appeal the  Commission's decision in the court of first instance as it is not responsible for the infractions it has been charged with and considers the sanctions to be unjustified and disproportionate," Cepsa said in a statement.

The Commissioner was holding a news conference to discuss in part a 183.6 million-euro ($260.2 million) fine imposed on a bitumen  cartel operating in Spain. It imposed heavier  fines for a similar cartel in the Netherlands last year.

LISBON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Portugal's Galp Energia said on Wednesday it would appeal against a
European Commission fine for playing a role in a  cartel and coordinating  bitumen  prices in Spain.
The Commission fined Galp 8.7 million euros ($12.33 million) on Wednesday for playing a role in the
cartel, along with three other companies.

TD
"Galp Energia considers this  fine totally disproportionate and awaits the text with the complete decision to appeal it," Galp said.
The Commission's fines amount to a total of 183.6 million euros ($260.2 million) and also includes
fines to Spanish energy groups Cepsa , Repsol and Nynas of Sweden.
Cepsa said earlier it would also appeal against the  Commission's fine.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined four companies a total of
EUR183.7 million for fixing Spanish prices for bitumen,  a key material in road construction.

Spanish petroleum company Cepsa SA (CEP.MC) received the largest fine, amounting to EUR83.9 million. The country's oil and gas giant Repsol YPF SA (REP) received a fine of EUR80.5 million. The commission noted that both of these  fines would have been higher if the companies hadn't cooperated with its investigation.

TD
Swedish oil company Nynas AB, jointly owned by Petroleos de Venezuela SA and Finland's Neste Oil OYJ (NES1V.HE), was  fined EUR10.6 million. Portugal's Galp Energia SGPS S/A (GALP.LB) had a fine of EUR8.7 million.

The commission said BP PLC (BP), which also participated in the  cartel, blew the whistle on the other companies. That tip-off led the  commission to raid several offices in October 2002. Because of the firm's cooperation, BP was granted immunity from  fines, the commission added.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined four companies a total of
EUR183.7 million for fixing Spanish prices for bitumen,  a key material in road construction.

TD
Spanish petroleum company Cepsa SA (CEP.MC) received the largest  fine, EUR83.9 million. The country's oil and gas giant Repsol YPF SA (REP) was  fined EUR80.5 million. The  commission noted that both of these  fines would have been higher if the companies hadn't cooperated with its investigation.

Swedish oil company Nynas AB, jointly owned by Petroleos de Venezuela SA and Finland's Neste Oil OYJ (NES1V.HE), was  fined EUR10.6 million. Portugal's Galp Energia SGPS S/A (GALP.LB) received a fine of EUR8.7 million.

The commission said BP PLC (BP), which also participated in the  cartel, blew the whistle on the other companies. That tip-off led the commission to raid several offices in October 2002. Because of its cooperation, BP was granted immunity from fines.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and taxpayers in Spain...by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen,"  the  commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

Between 1991 and 2002, the companies exchanged sensitive market information, allocated sales and agreed on variations in  bitumen  prices. Annual meetings were held around a so-called "asphalt table," with a final agreement code-named after a Spanish television show for children.

Bitumen  is a byproduct of oil distillation. It is a main ingredient in asphalt, where it acts as an adhesive to bind stones together. In Spain, which has had a booming construction sector over the past several years, the market for  bitumen  was worth about EUR286 million in 2001, according to the
commission.
A similar cartel in the Netherlands prompted the  commission to fine 14 companies a total of
EUR226.7 million last year. BP was granted full immunity in that case, too.

A Repsol spokesman said the company's  fine "refers to deals conducted before 2002. Today, we're fully committed to the E.U. measures to boost fair competition." A spokesman for Cepsa wasn't available for comment.

The fines underscore the commission's increasingly aggressive pursuit of price-fixers. So far this year, the commission has fined companies involved in cartels over EUR2.5 billion. In 2005, by contrast, fines totaled slightly less than EUR700 million.

The companies involved in the Spanish  bitumen  cartel were fined under the commission's old penalty guidelines, since this standard was still in effect when they were first accused. Last year the commission revised its rules to encourage heftier penalties for rich, multinational companies. Under these guidelines, the companies involved in the  bitumen  cartel would have received stiffer penalties.

HD        EU fines bitumen  suppliers 183 million euros for illegal  cartel

BRUSSELS, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- The European  Commission handed down Wednesday  fines totaling over 183 million euros on four companies for running an illegal  cartel for bitumen  in Spain.

According to the  commission, these companies shared the Spanish market for  bitumen,  a material used for road construction, and coordinated  bitumen  prices between 1991 and 2002.

TD
Spanish companies Repsol and Cepsa, which led the  cartel, were hit with the heaviest  fines of 80.5 million euros and nearly 83.9 million euros respectively. Nynas of Sweden was  fined 10.6 million euros and Galp of Portugal 8.7 million euros.

British energy giant BP, a fifth accomplice in the cartel, escaped a fine of 66 million euros because it blew the whistle in 2002 and triggered the commission's investigation.

The European Union's antitrust watchdog found that from at least 1991 to 2002, the five companies established market quotas, allocated sales volumes and customers between them, manipulated market prices and monitored the implementation of the market sharing agreements by exchanging sensitive market information.

It was revealed that discussions on market sharing and price variations were held around a so-called "asphalt table" where  cartel members participated on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Meetings were held at hotels or the companies' premises.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and tax payers in Spain for almost 12 years by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  among them," the EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Bitumen  is a by-product produced during the distillation of oil. It is mainly used for the production of asphalt, where it serves as an adhesive to bind stones together. The case concerns a market valued at
286 million euros in 2001.

The European  Commission yesterday announced that it had imposed a 183.65m-euro  fine on four companies - Spain's Repsol and Cepsa, Sweden's Nynas and Portugal's Galp - for setting up a  cartel for bitumen  in the Spanish market between 1991 and 2002.  Bitumen  is a mixture of organic liquids used in asphalt production. Meanwhile, UK group BP, which according to the decision was also a member of the cartel, has had its  fine reduced to zero for its full compliance with the investigation undertaken by the EU competition authorities.

TD
Repsol and Cepsa have also seen their  fines reduced by 40 and 25 per cent respectively for cooperating with the investigation. Repsol and Cepsa have been  fined 80.49m and 83.85m euros respectively, while Nynas' fine stands at 10.64m euros and Galp's, at 8.66m euros. Any companies affected by the  cartel's operations will be able to file a complaint with the competition courts in their respective countries to request compensation. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes has stated that it is inadmissible that these companies have deceived both consumer and the Spanish authorities for such a long period of time.

BRUSSELS, Oct 3, 2007 (AFP) -
The European Commission on Wednesday hit a group of  bitumen  suppliers with a 183-million-euro
(259-million-dollar) fine for running an illegal  cartel in Spain.

TD
The groups Repsol, Cepsa, Nynas and Galp were  fined a total of 183,651,000 euros for breaching the EU's restrictive business practices, the EU's executive arm and top competition regulator said in a statement.

British energy giant BP, while involved in the matter, escaped a  fine by helping the EU authorities to break the cartel.

"BP was the first company to come forward with information about the  cartel," thereby receiving immunity from fines, the Commission said in a statement.

Between 1991 and 2002, the companies involved shared the Spanish market for  bitumen,  used for road construction, and coordinated  bitumen  prices, the  Commission said.

HD     EU fines 4 companies almost €200 million for price fixing  cartel in Spanish road works sector

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union  fined four companies involved in Spanish road works a total of €183 million (US$259 million) on Wednesday, ruling that they had run a  cartel for more than a decade to fix the price of a key asphalt ingredient.

Spanish companies Repsol YPF and Compania Espanola de Petroleos SA, or Cepsa, which the EU Commission pinpointed as the leaders of the  cartel, have to pay the heaviest  fines, more than €80 million (US$110 million) each. AB Nynas Petroleum of Sweden and Galp Energia of Portugal were  fined up to €10 million (US$14 million).

TD
BP PLC was the first company to come forward with information on the  cartel and received immunity.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and taxpayers in Spain for almost 12 years by carving up the market," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"The Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders," Kroes said.
The EU antitrust chief has made the fight against market-distorting cartels a cornerstone of her tenure. Galp proclaimed its innocence and said it planned to appeal the  fine to the EU courts. The company said
it "categorically denied its participation in any meetings or decisions made by the  cartel" and was granted
its market share by the  cartel after meetings which it did not attend.
Others were contrite and eager to prove that their lawbreaking days were behind them.

Repsol said "the  fine refers to deals conducted before 2002. Today, we're fully committed to the EU measures to boost fair competition. We collaborated with the  Commission, and thus got a reduction on the fine."
Nynas President Staffan Lennstrom said he was sorry the company's Spanish arm had got involved in
"the business culture that then prevailed in the Spanish  bitumen  market."

The company has taken action to make sure all workers steered clear of  price-fixing and market-sharing in future, he said.

The European  Commission said the Spanish  cartel fixed prices, sales volumes and market quotas from at least 1991 to 2002. The market in Spain was worth up to €286 million (US$405 million) at the time.

Regulators had established higher  fines for the companies but then reduced them according to the level at which the companies had cooperated with the investigation.

BP won full immunity and did not have to pay its €66.42 million (US$94.1 million) fine; Repsol had its  fine reduced by 40 percent to €80.496 million (US$114 million); and Cepsa had its fine reduced by 25 percent to €83.85 million (US$118.8 million).

Page 31 of 59 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said the companies met secretly at hotels or the headquarters of companies each year and fixed the market there.

At the end, each participant received a document named after the local children's program "Petete" with the details for the next year.

Last year, the EU  fined 14 companies involved in Dutch road works a total of €267 million (US$378 million) for similar infractions. It said it had dropped another probe involving Belgium.

BRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission has dropped its investigation into a suspected bitumen  cartel in Belgium, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said on Wednesday.

"Yes, we dropped Belgium," Kroes told a news conference in answer to a question about a long-running probe there.

TD
The Commissioner was holding a news conference to discuss in part a 183.6 million-euro ($260.2 million) fine imposed on a bitumen  cartel operating in Spain. It imposed heavier  fines for a similar cartel in the Netherlands last year.

Swedish Nynas has been  fined SEK 100mn (US$ 15.28mn EUR 10.85mn) by the European Commission for market sharing with several other firms on the  bitumen  market in Spain. The  cartel was in place between 1991 and 2002.

A set of companies who shared the market for  bitumen  used in road construction (known as penetration bitumen')  and coordinated its price on the Spanish market for approximately twelve years has been  fined a total of €183.7 million. This  cartel, thumbing its nose at EU competition rules, involved Repsol and Cepsa (Spain), Nynäs (Sweden), Galp (Portugal) and BP (UK). BP was exempt from paying a  fine for divulging information on the  cartel.

From at least 1991 to 2002,  cartel members established market quotas, allocated sales volumes and customers between them, monitored the implementation of the market sharing agreements by
exchanging sensitive market information, compensated each other for deviations from the market sharing agreements and agreed on the variation of  bitumen  prices and the moment from which the new prices would apply.

TD
The Commission investigation started with surprise inspections in October 2002, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by BP under the 2002 leniency programme.

Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes stressed that "the  Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders". And, the commissioner said, it is thanks to the leniency programme that the  Commission was able to intervene more effectively: it levied  fines totalling €1.8 billion in 2006 and €2.52 billion so far this year, "which would not have been possible without this programme," she affirmed.

In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the size of the Spanish market for penetration bitumen  (worth approximately €286 million). The Commission increased the fines by 30% for Repsol and Proas (a subsidiary of Cepsa) for being leaders of the cartel. Repsol and Cepsa were granted a reduction of their  fines of 40% and 25% respectively for their cooperation under the  Commission's leniency programme.

The fines in this case are based on the 1998 guidelines on  fines, in force at the time the statement of objections was notified.
The fines levied by the Commission are as follows:
- BP: 0
- Repsol: €80,496,000
- Cepsa: €83,850,000
- Nynäs: €10,642,500
- Galp: €8,662,500

The Commission also reiterates that any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal.

The European  Commission yesterday handed out a Euros 183m (Dollars 258.2m)  fine to four companies that fixed the price of  bitumen  in Spain over a 12-year period.
BP, the UK energy group, escaped a Euros 66.4m penalty after blowing the whistle on the  cartel in
2002. Europe's antitrust regulator  fined Repsol and Cepsa of Spain Euros 80.5m and Euros 83.9m
respectively. It hit smaller operators Nynas of Sweden and Galp of Portugal for Euros 10.6m and Euros
8.7m.

TD
"Bitumen  suppliers in Spain cheated customers, public authorities and tax payers by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst themselves," Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said. The material is used to make asphalt for road surfaces.

"I would like to underline once again that the  Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle their clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders," Ms Kroes said.
The market was worth Euros 286m in 2001 and the  cartel ran from 1991-2002, she said.
Ms Kroes added that the  Commission had dropped an investigation into the bitumen  market in
Belgium. She defended the leniency code, which allows informants to escape fines.

She said BP had delivered substantial information, while Repsol and Cepsa had their  fines reduced for co-operating. All three remain vulnerable to civil suits brought by anyone who was a victim of the high prices.

Repsol and Cepsa said they would challenge the ruling in the Court of First Instance, with the latter describing the Euros 83.8m  fine as "unjustified and disproportionate".

Repsol, Spain's largest oil and gas group was also swift to point out that the market-fixing practices ceased in 2002, since when most of its top executives and managers have left.

"The current management of the company is completely committed to complying with EU competition rules," it said. It had made provisions to cover the  fine in its 2005 and 2006 accounts.

Staffan Lennstrom, president of Nynas, said the Swedish company had allowed itself to be lured into nefarious practices.

"I regret that our systems then in place had deficiencies that allowed us to get involved in the business culture that then prevailed in the Spanish  bitumen  market," he said.

Visa, owned by its member banks, said it would appeal against the penalty.


Page 43 of 59 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, said that although Visa had since admitted the US investment bank, its blackballing for six years had impeded competition in the credit card market. "The problem the Commission found was that Visa had applied its rules on excluding competitors from its network in an unjustified and discriminatory manner."

Ms Kroes said the bank's exclusion was "unjustified because Morgan Stanley was not a competitor in Europe - and discriminatory because Visa had previously admitted as members of their network other card network operators, such as Citigroup (owner of the Diners Club network) and the shareholders of the JCB card."

Ms Kroes also said Morgan Stanley could have brought lower prices and better service to the market dominated by Visa and MasterCard.

Visa said: "We do not be-lieve Visa Europe infringed EU competition law. There is no value as a precedent to this decision."

commission said BP PLC, which participated in the  cartel, blew the whistle on the other companies
and was granted immunity. Repsol, Galp and Cepsa all said they would appeal the  fine. Repsol said its
fine "refers to deals conducted before 2002. Today, we're fully committed to the EU measures to boost
fair competition." Galp said it didn't participate in a  cartel and that the  fine was "totally disproportionate."

The European  Commission has finedRepsol YPF, Cepsa and two other refiners almost €183.7 million ($260 million) for operating a bitumen  supply cartel in Spain, but let BP off after it blew the whistle on the others.

The European Union's Brussels-based executive said Wednesday that between 1991 and 2002, the five carved up the Spanish market for  bitumen  -- a by-product of oil refining used in road-building -- and rigged prices. It said meetings were held at hotels or on company premises, and a hefty secret document -- code-named "Petete" or "PTT" after a Spanish children's television program -- was drawn up, allocating annual volumes and customers to each participant. The ringleaders were Repsol and Proas, a subsidiary of Cepsa.

TD
The cartel came to light when BP came forward with information under the  commission's 2002 "Leniency Notice" and received immunity from  fines.

In setting the  fines, Brussels said it took account of the size of the Spanish  bitumen  market -- which it reckoned was worth roughly €286 million (then $256 million) in 2001, the last full year of the scam -- the duration of the  cartel, and the size of those involved.

Repsol was fined €80.5 million and Cepsa €83.85 million after both had their original  fines reduced for cooperating with the  commission. Swedish refiner Nynas was  fined €10.6 million and Portugal's Galp
€8.7 million.

Had BP not acted as whistle-blower, it would have been  fined €66.4 million. It also escaped a  fine a year ago when details it gave to the  commission led to 14 road bitumen  firms in the Netherlands, including Nynas, being  fined a total of €266.7 million (IOD Sep.14 '06,p8).

In the United States, however, BP is the subject of ongoing  price-fixing investigations by the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC). These focus on allegations that BP manipulated not only unleaded gasoline futures prices in October 2002 but also the price of propane in the US Northeast in February 2004, and that it allegedly tried to manipulate propane prices in April 2003 (IOD Dec.15,p3).

Brussels, 03/10/2007 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 3 October, the European Commission decided to impose fines totalling €183,651,000 on European companies participating in an illegal cartel to divide up the bitumen  market in Spain for over a decade. Spanish companies Repsol and Cepsa are considered the leaders of the market fixing and have received the heaviest fines, €80.5 million and €83.8 million
respectively. The other companies involved are Nynäs (Sweden, fined €10.6 m) and Galp (Portugal,  fined
€8.6 m). British company BP is not being  fined because it was the first company to come forward with
information about the  cartel.

TD
From 1991-2002, the above companies shared the market for  bitumen,  used for road construction, and coordinated bitumen  prices. EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes commented: “It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and tax payers in Spain for almost 12 years
by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst them. The  Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders”. The  Commission explains that  bitumen  is a by-product produced during the distillation of oil.
It is mainly used for the production of asphalt, where it serves as an adhesive to bind stones together. The value of the Spanish market for penetration bitumen  in 2001, the last full year of the almost 12-year infringement, was approximately €286 million. The Commission investigation started with surprise inspections in October 2002. (lc)

The European  Commission on Wednesday slapped a €183 million  fine on Spanish oil firms Repsol and Cepsa, Portugal's Galp Energia, and two other companies, for running a  cartel in Spain to fix the price of bitumen,  which is used to make asphalt for surfacing roads.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and tax payers in Spain for almost 12 years by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst them," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement .

TD
"The Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders," he said.
Repsol was fined €80.5 billion, Cepsa €
83.8 billion, Galp €8.6 billion, and Sweden's Nynäs

€10.6 billion. BP, the fifth member of the  cartel, had its fine fully waived after tipping off inspectors about the existence of the  price-fixing system.

Repsol and Cepsa were given the biggest  fines for being the ringleaders of the cartel, but received reductions of 40 and 25 percent respectively for cooperating with the Commission in its investigation.

Repsol said it would appeal the fine at the European Court of First Instance. Galp also plans to appeal, and denied involvement in the cartel. "Galp Energia never took part in the  cartel and has always maintained an independent marketing strategy," the Portuguese firm said in a statement.

The Commission said that the  cartel was in existence from at least 1991 to 2002, with meetings in hotels and company premises held annually to set prices and market quotas and allocate sales volumes and customers among themselves. "These practices are very serious infringements of the competition rules of the EC Treaty," the  Commission said.

The European  Commission has imposed major fines totaling more than Eur183 million ($260 million) on Spanish companies Repsol YPF and Cepsa, Sweden's Nynas and Portugal's Galp for taking part in a price-fixing cartel for bitumen  in Spain, the  Commission said October 3.

Cepsa received the biggest  fine, of Eur83.85 million, while Repsol was not far behind with Eur80.5 million. Nynas was  fined Eur10.6 million and Galp Eur8.66 million.

TD
The fifth member of the  cartel, BP, originally was handed a  fine of Eur66.42 million, but this was reduced to zero as the company was the first to come forward and provide information about the  cartel.

The fines for Repsol and Cepsa were increased by 30% "for being leaders of the cartel," although these were later reduced by 40% and 25%, respectively, for cooperating with the Commission's investigation.

Both Cepsa and Repsol said they planned to appeal the fines. "Although [the company] will study the decision in detail, we expect that Cepsa will appeal the Commission's decision before the court of first instance," Cepsa said in a statement.
Repsol said it would appeal to the same court, adding its board was committed to complying with
European competition rules.
The EC's investigation into the  cartel started with surprise inspections of the companies' offices in
October 2002, prompted by BP's application for immunity.

The Commission said the cartel had operated from at least 1991 to 2002, during which time the five companies "established market quotas, allocated sales volumes and customers between them, monitored the implementation of the market sharing agreements by exchanging sensitive market information, compensated each other for deviations from the market sharing agreements and agreed on the variation of  bitumen  prices and the moment from which the new prices would apply."

"Market sharing discussions were held annually to estimate and distribute the market for the following year," it added.

"It is unacceptable that these companies cheated customers, public authorities and taxpayers in Spain for almost 12 years by carving up the market for road-building  bitumen  amongst them," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

Repsol YPF has said it will appeal against the European  Commission's decision to  fine it for its role in a 12-year Spanish  bitumen  cartel. Fellow Spanish refiner Cepsa and Portugal's Galp also said they plan to appeal. The three said appeals would be made to the EU Court of First Instance. It could be 2008 before the court hands down a ruling.

Cepsa has been fined €83.85 million ($118 million), Repsol €80.5 million and Galp €8.7 million (IOD Oct.4,p7). Repsol said it had made provisions for the  fine in its 2005 and 2006 accounts. Cepsa and Galp called their  fines "disproportionate."

Sweden's Nynas expressed "regret" for its involvement in the scam. Communications Director Hans Ostlin told International Oil Daily Thursday it will decide whether or not to appeal its €10.6 million  fine after seeing the full  commission text, due in a couple of weeks.

A set of companies who shared the market for  bitumen  used in road construction (known as penetration bitumen')  and coordinated its price on the Spanish market for approximately twelve years has been  fined a total of €183.7 million. This  cartel, thumbing its nose at EU competition rules, involved Repsol and Cepsa (Spain), Nynäs (Sweden), Galp (Portugal) and BP (UK). BP was exempt from paying a  fine for divulging information on the  cartel.

From at least 1991 to 2002,  cartel members established market quotas, allocated sales volumes and customers between them, monitored the implementation of the market sharing agreements by
exchanging sensitive market information, compensated each other for deviations from the market sharing agreements and agreed on the variation of  bitumen  prices and the moment from which the new prices would apply.

TD
The Commission investigation started with surprise inspections in October 2002, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by BP under the 2002 leniency programme.

Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes stressed that "the  Commission will not tolerate such illegal activity by companies to swindle clients and we will continue to impose stiff penalties on offenders". And, the commissioner said, it is thanks to the leniency programme that the  Commission was able to intervene more effectively: it levied  fines totalling €1.8 billion in 2006 and €2.52 billion so far this year, "which would not have been possible without this programme," she affirmed.

In setting the  fines, the Commission took into account the size of the Spanish market for penetration bitumen  (worth approximately €286 million). The Commission increased the fines by 30% for Repsol and Proas (a subsidiary of Cepsa) for being leaders of the cartel. Repsol and Cepsa were granted a reduction of their  fines of 40% and 25% respectively for their cooperation under the  Commission's leniency programme.

The fines in this case are based on the 1998 guidelines on  fines, in force at the time the statement of objections was notified.
The fines levied by the Commission are as follows:
- BP: 0
- Repsol: €80,496,000
- Cepsa: €83,850,000
- Nynäs: €10,642,500
- Galp: €8,662,500

The Commission also reiterates that any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal.

The European  Commission fined Spain's Repsol YPF and Cepsa, Swedish refiner Nynas and Portugal's Galp almost €184 million ($260 million) for operating an 11-year  bitumen  supply cartel in Spain. BP, which was also part of the  price-fixing ring, was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the others.

Repsol was fined €80.5 million and Cepsa €83.85 million after both had their original  fines reduced for cooperating with the  commission. Nynas was fined €10.6 million and Galp €8.7 million. If BP had not acted as whistle-blower it would have been fined €66.4 million.

TD
The commission said that between 1991 and 2002, the five companies carved up the Spanish  bitumen
market and rigged bitumen  prices. The ringleaders were Repsol and Proas, a subsidiary of Cepsa.

The cartel came to light when BP came forward with information under the  commission's 2002 "Leniency Notice."

In setting the  fines, the commission said it took account of the duration of the  cartel, the size of the companies involved, and the size of the Spanish  bitumen  market -- which it calculated was worth roughly
€286 million (then $256 million) in 2001.

Spain will no longer have to rely on the EU to fight its competition battles - a new act has brought it bang up to date in the fight against cartels. By Jaime Perez-Bustamante

On 3 October the European  Commission imposed fines totalling e183m (£127.65m) on four companies that had operated a  cartel on the Spanish  bitumen  market for 12 years. In a press release, EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes explained how the  cartel had "cheated customers, public authorities and taxpayers in Spain".

TD
It is revealing that it was the  Commission and not the Spanish competition authorities that stepped in to defend the interests of Spanish consumers and taxpayers. However, on 1 September, a new
Competition Act (Ley de Defensa de la Competencia) came into force in Spain.

The new act follows in the footsteps of the recent modernisation of EU competition law and reforms the legal and institutional framework, equips the enforcer with better tools of investigation and should make Spain less reliant on the  Commission for the detection and persecution of cartels.
Streamlining the system

The most important change in the act is the transition from a system of exemptions granted by the competition authority to a system of self- assessment of agreements that may restrict competition.

Under the previous system, companies were required to seek so-called 'individual exemptions' from the competition authorities for agreements the lawfulness of which is based on weighing potentially restrictive effects against efficiency-enhancing effects. Under the new act the exemption provision is directly applicable and companies themselves must analyse whether their business practices meet the requirements for exemption.

An important side-effect of this change is that the competition authorities can reallocate resources from dealing with applications for individual exemptions to investigating the most serious competition law infringements.

The new act has also changed the institutional framework. A key part of the modernisation programme is the merger of the two public authorities previously responsible for competition law enforcement, the Competition Defence Service and the Competition Tribunal, into a single organisation - the National Competition  Commission (Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia).

The new institution, the independence of which has been reinforced, will however maintain a clear divide between the body responsible for the investigation of a case (the Directorate of Investigation) and the body in charge of the final decision-making (the Governing Council). The Governing Council is the governing body of the new authority and is composed of six members who will be appointed for
non-renewable mandates of six years.

The institutional reform has allowed for a streamlining of the administrative proceedings and will enable the authority to use its resources in a more efficient manner.

The act also sharpens the investigative tools available to the new authority. In particular, it introduces a leniency system that enables the National Competition  Commission to grant immunity from  fines or to


Page 57 of 59 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
reduce significantly the  fines for companies that are the first to collaborate with the authority by providing new and substantial evidence of a  cartel.

The system is modelled on the  Commission's successful leniency notice from 2006 and benefits from the lessons learnt at EU level over the last 11 years - indeed, the  bitumen  cartel was detected as a result of a leniency application from BP.

Nevertheless, the success of a leniency system depends on the perceived risk of detection and, given the scarcity of  cartel cases in which the Spanish competition authorities have imposed high  fines, it will probably take some years for the system to reach its full effectiveness.

In addition, the act allows the National Competition  Commission to seek a search warrant from a court, allowing the authority to enter not only business premises, but also the private residences of company executives who are suspected of hiding evidence of  cartel activities.

The new act does not increase the maximum level of sanctions that can be imposed on companies for competition law infringements (as in EU law, it is maintained at a staggering 10 per cent of consolidated annual turnover), but it does clarify the guiding principles for the calculation of the  fine and this is likely in practice to increase the amount of  fines imposed.
Merger control

The change of the merger control regime is less far-reaching and falls short of the expectations raised when the programme for the reform was launched in 2005. In particular, the new act fails to eliminate the market-share threshold for the notifications of mergers, in spite of harsh criticism from the legal community and the International Competition Network (ICN), the worldwide network of competition authorities.

The threshold is raised from 25 to 30 per cent, but it still - for reasons difficult to understand - applies to the acquisition of a company with a market share of 30 per cent or more in Spain, even if the relevant market for the goods or services in question is clearly limited to Spain and the acquirer has no activities whatsoever in the country.

Mergers not caught by the market share threshold can be caught by the turnover threshold. The latter is virtually unchanged, with a combined turnover in Spain of e240m (£167.4m) or more and an individual turnover in Spain for at least two of the parties of e60m (£41.85m) or more.

On a positive note, the new act provides for the Spanish government to adopt a regulation on a simplified short-form notification for mergers in which there is no, or insignificant, overlap between the parties to the transaction. Moreover, the new act reduces the maximum sanction that may be imposed on companies that execute a merger in violation of the act from 10 to 5 per cent of the annual turnover and shortens the statute of limitations for such infringements from four to two years.

Another welcome development is that the new merger control regime, at least on paper, limits the government's involvement in the proceedings. In some high-profile cases, the Spanish government has been criticised for being guided by political considerations rather than the welfare of the Spanish consumers. Under the new act the Government will be able to intervene only when the National Competition  Commission has initiated the in-depth 'Phase 2' investigation and when the authority suggests prohibiting or clearing the transaction subject to conditions.
Private enforcement

Lastly, it is expected that the new act will increase the amount of competition law litigation in Spain. Under the previous act it was not possible to bring a civil action invoking national competition law until the infringement in question had first been demonstrated in a final decision by the competition authority (strangely enough, this was possible if the plaintiff could invoke European competition law). The new act removes this requirement and allows the possibility of immediately bringing an action before the mercantile courts. It is unknown whether this will create a race to the courthouse.

There are still important obstacles to private actions, in particular the difficulty in obtaining evidence to prove an infringement given the lack of a pre-trial discovery system. However, Spanish companies are becoming increasingly litigious (the no-holds-barred takeover battle for Endesa being the foremost example of this) and the improved position for plaintiffs under the new act is not likely to go unnoticed. -
