BRUSSELS (AFX) - The  European Commission said it has decided to  fine Yamaha Corp 2.56 mln eur for restricting trade within the EU and fixing resale prices of pianos, guitars and oboes in some member states.

The commission said that although the restrictions were serious, they seemed to be limited to certain dealers, products and countries rather than the result of a deliberate strategy, and did not appear to have been fully implemented.

TD
The commission said the company took steps to end the restrictions and to redesign its European distribution system as soon as it intervened.

The countries concerned included Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Iceland.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission fined Japanese musical instruments manufacturer  Yamaha Corp. euro2.56 million (US$2.85 million) on Wednesday for fixing prices for pianos, guitars and oboes.
The European Union's executive office said  Yamaha's business practices in the 15-nation bloc violated EU
competition rules.

TD
It said Yamaha's practices of dividing the European market and fixing resale prices also included obliging dealers to purchase and sell  Yamaha products exclusively.  Yamaha also forced dealers to seek prior approval before selling its instruments on the Internet, the commission said.
The countries where the unlawful practices applied included Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, The
Netherlands, Denmark and Iceland.

While the infringement was deemed "serious," the commission said the restrictions applied only to a limited number of dealers and products and were not implemented in full.

A company found in breach of EU rules can be fined up to 10 percent of its global annual turnover. But the fine imposed was relatively small because Yamaha took steps to end the restrictions and redesign its distribution system in Europe "as soon as the commission intervened," the statement said.

Yamaha produces traditional and electronic musical instruments such as pianos, electronic organs, guitars, saxophones and violins. It reported a fiscal year 2002-2003 net profit of 17.95 billion yen (US$151.6
million) on sales of 524.76 billion yen (US$4.43 billion).

Brussels, July 16 (Jiji Press) - The  European Commission, the European Union's executive body, Wednesday ordered major Japanese musical instrument maker  Yamaha Corp. to pay 2.56 million euros in fines over its anticompetitive marketing practices.

According to the commission,  Yamaha, which has the top market share for many musical instruments in Europe, obliged dealers to sell its pianos, violins, guitars, electronic organs and other instruments only to end-users.

TD
Yamaha also obliged dealers to consult with the company before concluding Internet-based export contracts, the commission said. In addition, the firm fixed resale prices, it said.

Such practices, in violation of the EU's competition promotion law, were detected in eight countries, including Germany and France, the commission said.

Yamaha halted its questionable practices immediately after the commission's investigations, it said.

The body that is more at home helping out cross-border car sales and cracking down on vitamin cartels has a new goal in its sights: making life affordable for Europe's instrumentalists.

Today the  European Commission is set to announce a small  fine for Yamaha, the Japanese company that traces its history back to its manufacture of a reed organ over a hundred years ago.

TD
The figure is unlikely to greatly exceed the minimum level of Euros 1m ( $1.12m).
The Commission has found fault with the group for "restraints on parallel imports".

Parallel, or "grey market", importers take advantage of cheaper prices overseas and sell identical products for less than the manufacturer does through traditional outlets.  Yamaha declined to comment on today's development, but the Commission is thought to appreciate the company's co-operative attitudeand believes that it has changed its behaviour.

Yamaha-made instruments range from pianos and wind instruments to state-of-the-art synthesisers.

The late, great classical pianist Sviatoslav Richter once hailed  Yamaha for "an incredible blend of emotion, responsiveness and technical brilliance". The Commission is unlikely to be quite so effusive.

Brussels, 16/07/2003 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR 2.56 million on musical instruments manufacturer Yamaha for violating European Union competition rules. Yamaha sells under a selective distribution system a whole range of traditional and electronic musical instruments and equipment in Europe, such as pianos, electronic organs, guitars, saxophones and violins. The company is the European market leader for most musical instruments. The Commission concluded that Yamaha entered into agreements or concerted practices aimed at partitioning the market and fixing resale prices in certain Member States: in Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark and Iceland. The restrictions took different forms at different times and in different countries.

TD
They included, for example, fixing of resale prices and obligations on official dealers to sell only to final customers; obligations on official dealers to purchase exclusively from the  Yamaha subsidiaries; obligations on official dealers to contact  Yamaha before exporting via the Internet. Although the Commission qualified the infringement as serious, some of the contractual provisions were applied to only a limited number of dealers and products, were not systematically included in all Yamaha agreements throughout the EEA and have not been simultaneously implemented. The fact that Yamaha swiftly terminated most of the restrictions and took steps to redesign its distribution system helped the company. At the end of the 2002-2003 tax year  Yamaha obtained net profits of Y 17.95 bio out of a turnover of Y
524.7 bio.

TOKYO (AFX-ASIA) - Share prices closed the morning lower, hit by continued selling of technology shares after further falls on Wall Street overnight following a downbeat outlook from Motorola, dealers said.

Motorola said it does not expect much improvement in the second half of the year, after posting a 10 pct fall in sales in the second quarter.

TD
Dealers said Japanese technology firms such as NEC and Fujitsu also came under pressure following a 2 pct fall in IBM in after-hours trade in the US.

IBM fell despite reporting earnings per share from continuing operations of 98 cents for the second quarter, meeting the consensus expectation of analysts polled by Thomson First Call.

Meanwhile, news of gunfire exchange between North and South Korean border troops also pressured the broader market, reviving concerns over geopolitical risks, dealers said.
The Nikkei 225 index, which has dropped for four of the past five trading days, closed the morning down
189.31 points or 1.91 pct at 9,549.66. The Topix index of all first-section shares was down 13.92 points or
1.47 pct at 935.35.
The Nikkei September futures index was down 160 at 9,550 on the Osaka Securities Exchange, and the
Nikkei 300 index was off 2.86 points at 180.06.
Decliners outnumbered gainers by a wide margin - 1,058 to 348-with 114 stocks unchanged.
Volume totaled an estimated 530 mln shares, up slightly from 521 mln shares the previous morning. Motoyoshi Uchida, strategist at Mizuho Investors Securities, said that with doubts emerging about the
sustainability of the rally in global technology shares following Intel and IBM's falls after the release of
their quarterly results, investors are hurriedly trying to adjust positions in their Japanese counterparts.

"Foreign investors, in particular, are increasingly unwinding long positions on these shares ahead of the release of quarterly results by Japanese technology firms," he said.

But Uchida added that "the recent retreat is something participants had wanted to see following the prolonged and steep rise, and it does not suggest the Japanese market will fall back into a serious falling trend."
Yahoo Japan will report its results later today, with Sony doing so next week.
Yahoo Japan fell 60,000 yen or 3.05 pct to finish the morning at 1.91 mln yen, while major stakeholder

Honda faced some selling after Goldman Sachs lowered its recommendation from "outperform" to "inline," falling 110 or 2.26 pct to 4,750.

Dwango, the provider of game content for mobile-phone based internet services and a new comer to the Mothers market for start-ups, ended the morning with buy indication only at 2.69 mln yen, compared to the IPO price of 1.70 mln yen.

Yamamaru Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Chip and chip manufacturing equipment makers fell sharply after Motorola, the world's second-largest cellphone maker, reported a 10 pct drop in second-quarter sales, adding it does not expect much improvement in the second half of the year.
Among chipmakers, Hitachi tumbled 5.71 pct or 33 yen to 545, Fujitsu fell 5.28 pct or 30 yen to 538 and

Nissan Motor fell 1.9 pct or 22 yen to 1,135 and Mazda shed 4.04 pct or 12 yen to 285, despite news

LARS-Hendrick Röller, a top German economics professor, was yesterday (16 July) appointed chief competition economist at the  European Commission. He is expected to take up the post on 1
September for a non-renewable period of three years.
DESPITE fears of French opposition, member states yesterday unanimously agreed to a

TD
dopt global accounting standards set by the International Accounting Standards Board, which all listed companies will have to adopt from 2005.

ALSO yesterday, the Commission cracked down on Wanadoo, an internet subsidiary of France Telecom, imposing a l10.35 million  fine for "predatory pricing" in ADSL-based internet access services up until October 2002, which it ruled an abuse of dominant position.
JAPANESE musical instrument manufacturer  Yamaha suffered a similar fate. It will be fi

ned EUR 2.56 million for restricting trade and fixing resale prices in the EU for products including pianos, guitars and oboes.  Yamaha has already taken steps to redress the problem.
EU FINANCE ministers formally nominated Jean-Claude Trichet as the next president of the European
Central Bank, a decision the European Parliament is set to consider in September. He is set to
succeed Wim Duisenberg, who is retiring three years before his term should officially have ended in
2006.
EUROPEAN

Investment Bank President Philippe Maystadt on Tuesday (15 July) revealed l50 billion in direct loans has already been agreed as part of an Italian EU presidency plan to pump more funds into transport networks and research projects. A blueprint will be drawn up in October and the Ecofin Council of EU finance ministers hopes to see an official draft in November.

THE Commission referred 11 member states - France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Austria

and Finland - to the European Court of Justice for failing to adopt an EU law on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.

THE Commission on Monday (14 July), ahead of a meeting of EU finance ministers, ruled out changes to the Stability and Growth Pact rules underpinning the euro in face of calls from French President Jacques Chirac for a respite from their rigour.

The European Commission yesterday announced  fines for Wanadoo, France Telecom's internet arm, and Yamaha, the Japanese instrument maker, while approving a third-generation mobile phone agreement in Germany.

The Commission fined Wanadoo Euros 10.35m ( $11.6m) for "predatory pricing" that undercut rivals in the French retail market for high-speed internet access.

TD
It also fined Yamaha Euros 2.56m for restraining trade and imposing prices on products such as pianos, guitars and oboes in Germany, Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Iceland.
The Commission accepts that both companies have changed their behaviour.

Separately, the Commission gave the go-ahead for T-Mobile and O2 to share their networks in Germany to help roll out 3G coverage. It said the two companies would be able to use each other's networks for "roaming" - but only until the end of 2008. Daniel Dombey, Brussels

Yamaha Corp. said Thursday it will consult experts and decide how to respond to a  fine of 2.56 million euro (about 340 million yen) that the  European Commission (EC) ordered it to pay for allegedly price-fixing its musical instruments.

In response to the EC's decision, the major Japanese manufacturer of musical instruments said that while provisions in some past contracts violated competition rules, these had been unintentional and had no actual effect on the market.

TD
On Wednesday, the European Union's executive body said in a statement that  Yamaha's system of dividing the European market by country and fixing resale prices "violated EU competition rules."

Yamaha's practices included obliging dealers to sell only to final customers, buy exclusively from
Yamaha subsidiaries and seek authorization before selling over the Internet, according to the EC.
The countries involved include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy and the
Netherlands.

In an era of globalisation, it is essential for EU trustbusters to forge close working relationships with their counterparts around the world. In the latest such move, the EU and Japan have signed an agreement to strengthen co-operation between the  European Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission.

As with the existing bilateral accords with the US (dating from 1991) and Canada (1999), the aim is to enable the respective competition authorities to exchange information on merger and antitrust cases, and to co-ordinate their investigations to the extent possible under domestic rules. Each may request the other to take enforcement actions on its behalf. The agreement also provides for regular contacts in order to discuss policy issues and enforcement efforts. But it does not permit the exchange of confidential information unless a waiver is granted by the companies involved, as is often the case in merger reviews.

TD
The agreement was a long time in the making. EU competition commissioner Mario Monti first raised the idea during a visit to Japan in October 1999, and the following summer it was announced at an EU-Japan summit in Tokyo that the two sides had reached an understanding on substantial elements of their envisaged agreement (BE Aug 23rd 2000). But it was not until June last year that a draft agreement was initialled, whose subsequent approval by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as well as the relevant Japanese authorities, cleared the way for signing earlier this month.

Mr Monti hailed the agreement as &#8220;an important milestone&#8221; in co-operation with Japan. As if to mark the occasion, the Commission last week imposed a  fine of (Euro)2.6m on  Yamaha, the Japanese manufacturer that is the European market leader for musical instruments, for conspiring with its distributors in eight countries to partition the EU market and fix resale prices.
