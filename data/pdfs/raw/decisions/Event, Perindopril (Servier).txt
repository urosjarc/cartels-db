* Total fine unlikely to exceed 300 million euros
* European Commission declines to comment

TD
By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, June 19 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to  fine French drugmaker Servier, Israel's Teva and several of their peers next month for blocking cheaper generic medicine, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.

The sanctions will be the third action by the  European Commission against so-called pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry, where brand-name companies pay generics firms to refrain from putting rival medicines on the market.

A damning 2009 report by the European Union competition watchdog said such deals could jack up the cost of drugs by as much as 20 percent for consumers.

The regulators' decision, in a more than 900-page document, will likely be given to the companies next month, the sources said. They said the total  fine was not likely to exceed 300 million euros ($407 million) and could be much less.

Companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can be  fined up to 10 percent of their global turnover. Servier made 4.2 billion euros in sales last year.
Drugmakers say pay-for-delay deals stave off costly litigation battles.

Commission spokesman for competition policy Antoine Colombani and Teva declined to comment. The other companies involved were not immediately available.

The Commission in July 2012 charged Servier, France's second-largest drugmaker, with making illegal agreements  with world No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Unichem and its subsidiary Niche, as well as Matrix, which is now known as Mylan Laboratories, Krka and Lupin.

The watchdog said the deals could have maintained Servier's control of  perindopril, a blood pressure medicine, which was set to lose its patent protection.

Denmark's Lundbeck, Germany's Merck KGaA and its former subsidiary Generics UK, which is now owned by Mylan, India's No. 1 pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy and several others were hit with a total fine of 146 million euros in June last year for pay-for-delay deals.

Six months later, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis were penalised 16.3 million euros for their anti-competitive  agreements.

The EU is expected to inflict a heavy  fine in the coming days on French drugs giant Servier for colluding to delay a cheaper version of a popular blood-pressure treatment, sources close to the matter told AFP on Tuesday.

The European Commission will decide on the  fine before the end of the month, the sources said. Israeli generic giant Teva and three other companies are also involved in the case.

TD
Servier is suspected of trying to delay the generic version of  perindopril, a cardio-vascular medicine. The allegation is the result of a broad EU probe into the pharmaceutical industry launched in 2008.

Generic products are far cheaper than brand medicines -- on average generics cost 40 percent less two years after they enter the market -- and are a huge savings to patients and health care providers while remaining just as effective.

In so-called pay-for-delay deals, drug makers pay generic rivals to thwart the introduction of cheaper versions of blockbuster drugs for an agreed time.

If Servier is found guilty in the collusion it faces heavy  fines of up to 10 percent of the group's total annual sales.
A year ago, Danish drugmaker Lundbeck was  fined 93.8 million euros by the Commission for striking a
2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its popular anti-depressant, citalopram.

By Tom Fairless

BRUSSELS--European Union antitrust regulators handed down  fines totaling 427.7 million euros ($581.8 million) to French pharmaceutical company Servier and five generic drug producers, including Israel's Teva on Wednesday for colluding to delay a cheaper version of a popular blood-pressure medicine.

The decision is the third and by far the largest set of  fines handed down by EU regulators for so-called pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry, where drug makers pay generic rivals to thwart the introduction of cheaper versions of popular drugs.

The European Commission, which acts as the region's central antitrust authority, said Servier had sought to delay the generic version of perindopril, a popular cardiovascular medicine, through "a technology acquisition and a series of patent settlements with generic rivals."

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," the EU's antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
"Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers," Mr. Almunia said. The other generic producers involved are Niche/Unichem, Matrix, Krka and Lupin.
Generic drugs are far cheaper than brand medicines, and offer large savings to patients and health care providers. A 2009 report by the commission found that pay-for-delay deals could increase the cost of drugs by as much as 20% for consumers.
The commission can fine firms up to 10% of total annual sales for collusion.

Last year, the commission slapped  fines totaling EUR146 million on Danish drug-maker Lundbeck and several generic drug companies over a 2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its antidepressant drug citalopram. It subsequently finedJohnson & Johnson and Novartis EUR16 million for delaying the market entry of a cheaper version of the pain-killer fentanyl.

However, pharmaceutical companies and antitrust experts warned that the commission's decision would discourage pharmaceutical companies from settling patent disputes with generic drug companies and could increase legal uncertainty for the industry.

LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), July 9 (SeeNews) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday Slovenian blue-chip drug maker Krka [LJE:KRKG] is among five generic companies that have been fined alongside French pharmaceutical firm Servier for curbing the market entry of cheaper versions of a cardiovascular medicine.
Krka's penalty amounts to 10 million euro ($13.6 million) with the total  fine tally at 427.7 million euro, a
Commission statement indicated.

TD
The other  fined companies are Niche/Unichem, Matrix, Teva, and Lupin.

The Commission said the  fines were imposed for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine,  perindopril, from price competition by generics in the EU.

"Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules," the statement said.

Servier's  perindopril patent expired, for the most part, in 2003 but generic producers continued to face related secondary patents and later decided to seek legal remedy.

"However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent," the Commission said.

Each of the settlements between Servier and its generic competitors has been deemed a prohibited anticompetitive agreement.

New Delhi, Jul 9 (PTI) Indian drug firms Lupin and Unichem Laboratories are among six global drug makers on which the European regulator has imposed a collective fine of 427.7 million euros for striking deals to prevent entry of cheaper version of blood pressure drug Perindopril in the EU.

As per the  European Commission Anti-trust ruling, Lupin has been  fined 40 million euros (nearly Rs 325 crore), while Unichem Laboratories 13.96 million euros (over Rs 110 crore).

TD
The companies have been pulled up for striking a series of deals with French firm Servier, which used to sell patented  perindopril drug, so that cheaper copies of the drug are not launched in the EU.
Besides Servier, the other drug makers on whom the  European Commission has imposed fines totaling
427.7 million euros are Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva and Krka.

"Through technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules,"  European Commission said in a statement.

Commenting on the ruling,  European Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive."
Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these
agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements, he added.

"Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers. Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients," Almunia said.

Perindopril is a blockbuster blood pressure control medicine and used to be Servier's best-selling product.

Servier's patent for the  perindopril molecule expired in 2003 but generic competitors continued to face a number of so-called "secondary" patents,  European Commission said.

Between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge.

"This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent. This happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007," Commission noted.

Leading domestic drug makers Lupin and Unichem along with Matrix Laboratories (now part of Mylan) have come under the scanner of the European Commission for curbing entry of low cost generic version of cardiovascular medicine Perindopril in the European Union (EU). The anti-trust wing of the Commission has slapped a hefty fine of euro 427.7 million (around Rs 3,458.7 crore) on five generic drug manufacturers and a French pharmaceutical company Servier, which held patent protection for blockbuster drug Perindopril.

Of the total fine, Lupin has to pay euro 40 million (around Rs 324 crore), whereas Unichem and Matrix have been fined euro 13.96 million (around Rs 113 crore) and euro 17 million (Rs 138 crore), respectively.

TD
According to the Commission, Servier and the five generic drug producers concluded a series of deals all aimed at protecting the innovator company's bestselling blood pressure medicine from price competition by generics in the European Union. "Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and
delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of
EU antitrust rules," the Commission said in a statement of Wednesday.
Drug maker Lupin had sold certain patent applications and other related intellectual property on
Perindopril to the French company in 2007 for around euro 20 million.

"We are very disappointed with the  European Commission’s findings. We are still awaiting official copy of the decision. We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal the decision," a Lupin spokesperson said.
Apart from the Indian drug makers, the European watchdog has penalized Israel's Teva and
Slovenia-based Krka for their alleged anti-competitive move.

In 2003, most of the Servier's patent for the  perindopril molecule expired, though some of the secondary patents related to processes and forms continued, the competition regulator said.

According to the regulator at that time generic drug makers of  perindopril were 'intensively preparing' their market entry and sought access to patent-free products or challenged Servier's patents that were blocking them. "There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004 Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and therefore delaying their entry," the Commission explained in its statement.

With this way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier's patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. "This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent," the regulator said.

Citing examples of such  settlements, which according to the Commission happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007, the EU regulator said Servier offered a generic company a licence for seven

national markets; in return, the generic drug maker agreed to 'sacrifice' all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its  perindopril there.
"In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros," the
Commission said.

Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive. Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these  agreements  are in the form of patent settlements. Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers".

While the European watchdog has imposed a  fine of ?331 million on Servier, the remaining  fine of about euro 100 million is split between the five producers of generic medicines depending on the extent of their involvement.

HD        UPDATE 1 - Slovenian  drug maker Krka says to appeal EU fine

LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), July 9 (SeeNews) - Slovenian blue-chip drug maker Krka [LJE:KRKG] said on Wednesday it will file an appeal against a fine imposed by the European Commission over alleged distortion of the EU market for perindopril, a cardiovascular medicine.

Earlier in the day, the Commission said Krka was among five generic companies that have been  fined alongside French pharmaceutical firm Servier for curbing the market entry of cheaper versions of a cardiovascular medicine.

TD
Krka's penalty amounts to 10 million euro ($13.6 million) with the total  fine tally at 427.7 million euro.
The other  fined companies are Niche/Unichem, Matrix, Teva, and Lupin.
Krka said in a statement it believes that its actions did not cause a distortion or delay in launching of
perindopril on the EU markets and did not breach competition rules.

Nevertheless, Krka will pay the imposed  fine within the timeframe set by the Commission which is three months after the notification of the decision.

"A decision to reverse the provision in the amount of 37,500,000 euro, this is the amount of the provision after payment of the  fine, will be adopted at the end of the business year when more circumstances will be known," Krka said.

The Commission said the  fines were imposed for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine,  perindopril, from price competition by generics in the EU.

"Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules," the statement said.

Servier's  perindopril patent expired, for the most part, in 2003 but generic producers continued to face related secondary patents and later decided to seek legal remedy.

"However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent," the Commission said.

Each of the settlements between Servier and its generic competitors has been deemed a prohibited anticompetitive agreement.

Brussels, 09 July (STA) - Slovenia's Krka is among the six pharma companies

rules. Krka will need to pay EUR 10m, while the bulk of the EUR 427.7m
penalty in total goes to French company Servier, which was  fined EUR 331m. The Commission imposed the  fines on Servier and five producers of generic medicines - Niche/Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka and Lupin
- "for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine,  perindopril, from price competition by generics in the EU".
Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules, the Commission wrote.

Krka insisted in its response today it had not distorted or delayed the entry of perindopril on EU markets and had not violated anti-trust legislation.
While the company plans an appeal at the General Court of the EU in
Luxembourg, it said it would nonetheless pay the  fine within the three-month deadline.
Krka had formed EUR 37.5m in provisions in expectation of the ruling and

BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined French drugmaker Servier, Israel's Teva and four others a total of 428 million euros ($583 million) on Wednesday, as they crack down on deals which block cheaper generic medicine.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have frowned on such  agreements,  saying they jack up the cost of drugs by as much as 20 percent for consumers.

The pharmaceutical industry says so-called pay-for-delay deals, where brand-name drugmakers pay cheaper non-brand generics firms to hold back from launching rival medicines, help to avert lengthy and costly litigation.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The European Commission said Servier's deals with the generics rivals between 2005 and 2007 were aimed at protecting its best-selling blood pressure medicine  perindopril from competition in the
28-country bloc.

Servier, France's second-largest drugmaker, was hit with the biggest  fine at 331 million euros, while world No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva's penalty came to 15.57 million euros.
Servier said it would challenge the EU ruling in court.

"Patients have not been deprived of  perindopril at any time. Moreover, generic entry has not been delayed. Servier has acted in a transparent and legitimate way to defend its patents," said spokeswoman Lucy Vincent.

The other penalised companies were Unichem and its subsidiary Niche, as well as Matrix, which is now known as Mylan Laboratories, Slovenian peer Krka and Lupin.

The sanctions are the third by the Commission against pay-for-delay deals following  fines in the past year against Denmark's Lundbeck, Merck KGaA, Indian No. 1 drugmaker Ranbaxy, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.

It is examining a similar deal between Teva and U.S. peer Cephalon, which is now part of the Israeli company, related to a pill for sleeping disorder. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Potter and Elaine Hardcastle)

HD     EU fines Lupin, Unichem for delaying  perindopril generic's entry

Mumbai, July 9 -- Indian generic drug makers Lupin Ltd. and Unichem Laboratories Ltd. were among six pharmaceutical companies  fined by the European Union's (EU) anti-trust body for alleged deals with French drug maker Les Laboratoires Servier to delay the launch of cheaper versions of the latter's hypertension drug perindopril. Servier was  fined 331 million by the EU competition watchdog, while the Indian companies were fined a combined 54 million.Other drug makers who were  fined include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. of Israel, Mylan Inc. of the US and Krka Group d.d of Slovenia. These companies were fined 15.6 million, 17.2 million and 10 million, respectively.

TD
In its statement of objection in June, EU had alleged that Servier forced these companies into settlements to protect the exclusivity of  perindopril. It is a general practice that patent holders file suits against generic applicants to protect patents and prevent them from getting regulatory approval for copy versions. But as part of  settlement of these suits, the patent owners often pay generic firms to keep their products off the market. As a result, the companies making branded drugs, taking advantage of the absence of competition, will continue maintaining the market monopoly and sell the products at the original price.

A Lupin spokesperson said on Wednesday that the company is yet to receive any official communication. Unichem executives could not be contacted immediately for comments.

"We are very disappointed with the  European Commission's findings and still awaiting official copy of the decision. We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal the decision," said a Lupin spokesperson.

HD     LEAD French drug company  Servier rebukes EU for fine on blocking generics  By Helen Maguire, dpa

Brussels (dpa) - French pharmaceuticals company Servier lashed out Wednesday at a 331-million-euro (450-million-dollar) fine imposed by the European Commission for paying off rivals to protect one of its drugs against cheaper generics.

The European Union's executive body also issued penalties totalling 96.7 million euros for five generic drug manufacturers involved in the scheme.

TD
Servier expressed "complete disagreement" with the commission's conclusions and said it would challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice.

The case centred on  perindopril, a medicine to control blood pressure. It was one of Servier's best-selling products, according to the commission.

Several generics companies were preparing to bring rival products to market when Servier's patent for the drug expired in 2003, but they were blocked when the French company bought a key technology needed to produce the medicine in 2004, the commission said.

Servier then paid the companies "several tens of millions of euros" in out-of-court  settlements in patent cases, it said, adding, "Generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's [profits]."

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

"Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers," he said. "Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."

Servier spokeswoman Lucy Vincent said the decision created a "regrettable precedent" for industries reliant on intellectual property and was a "bad sign" for companies choosing to innovate in Europe.

The market abuse occurred from 2005 to 2007, the commission said. After that, prices of generic perindopril dropped by 90 per cent in Britain, where a competitor achieved a legal breakthrough on one of Servier's key patents.

"At no time were patients deprived of  perindopril," Vincent argued, "and the entry of generics was not delayed."

"This type of sanction risks challenging laboratories' engagement in research to the detriment of patients," she said.

Servier was previously involved in a scandal over its slimming product Mediator, which was banned across the EU in 2009 after hundreds of people were thought to have died of harmful side effects on the heart and circulation.

Last year, the commission also  finedNovartis, Johnson & Johnson and Lundbeck for paying generics manufacturers to delay bringing cheaper rival products to market.

HD      EU hits French drugmaker Servier with huge fine over generics

LP
The EU on Wednesday hit French drugs giant Servier with a huge 331 million euro  fine for colluding to delay a cheaper generic version of  perindopril, a popular blood pressure treatment.
In a statement, the  European Commission said total  fines in the case amounted to 427.7 million euros
($582 million), with Israeli generic giant Teva and four other companies also subject to penalties.

TD
Servier is accused of trying to delay the introduction of a generic version of  perindopril, a cardio-vascular medicine. The allegation is the result of a broad EU probe into the pharmaceutical industry launched in
2008.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.
"Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive," he added.

In a statement, Servier expressed its "total disagreement with the novel arguments made in the decision" and said it would fight the decision at the European Court of Justice.

Generic products are far cheaper than brand medicines -- on average generics cost 40 percent less two years after they enter the market -- and are a huge savings to patients and health care providers while remaining just as effective.

But in so-called pay-for-delay deals, drug makers secretly compensate generic rivals to thwart the introduction of cheaper versions of blockbuster drugs for an agreed time.

Drug makers argue that the arrangement allows them sufficient time to recoup expensive research and marketing costs incurred to bring their products to the market.

In the EU statement, one generic company told investigators it was "bought out of  perindopril" for a "pile of cash".
In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to "several tens of millions of euros", the EU
said.
The generic companies  fined in the Servier case are Teva, Indian companies Unichem and Lupin, US
company Mylan and Slovenia's Krka.

The companies are accused of accepting out-of-court  settlements in patent disputes with Servier in return for delaying the sale of the drug in key markets.

The EU said that between 2005 and 2007, "virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge."

The fine inflicted on Servier is close to the maximum possible of up to 10 percent of the group's total annual sales. In 2013, Servier posted sales of 4.2 billion euros, with a net profit of 325 millions euros.

A year ago, Danish drugmaker Lundbeck was  fined 93.8 million euros by the Commission for striking a
2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its popular anti-depressant, citalopram.

Also last year, the Commission  finedJohnson & Johnson and Novartis 16.3 million euros for delaying the market entry of generic fentanyl, a strong painkiller, in the Netherlands.
Federal authorities in the United States last month opened their own probes into pay-to-delay deals.

In 2013, the US Supreme Court reversed a court decision that effectively gave pharmaceuticals free reign to strike the controversial deals with generic drug makers.
The decision, while finding the payments anti-competitive, did not go so far as to find the practice illegal. But the justices said litigants could challenge the individual deals in court on a case-by-case basis.
The US government had argued before the court that pay-to-delay was tantamount to big drug manufacturers buying off competitors.

European Union antitrust regulators  fined French drugmaker Servier, Israel's Teva and four others a total of 428 million euros today, as they crack down on deals which block cheaper generic medicine.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have frowned on such  agreements,  saying they jack up the cost of drugs by as much as 20 percent for consumers.

TD
The pharmaceutical industry says so-called pay-for-delay deals, where brand-name drugmakers pay cheaper non-brand generics firms to hold back from launching rival medicines, help to avert lengthy and costly litigation.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. The  European Commission said Servier's deals with the generics rivals between 2005 and 2007 were aimed at protecting its best-selling blood pressure medicine perindopril from competition in the 28-country bloc. Servier, France's second-largest
drugmaker, was hit with the biggest  fine at 331 million euros, while world No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva's penalty came to 15.57 million euros. Servier said it would challenge the EU ruling in court. "Patients have not been deprived of  perindopril at any time. Moreover, generic entry has not been delayed. Servier has acted in a transparent and legitimate way to defend its patents," said spokeswoman Lucy Vincent. The other penalised companies were Unichem and its subsidiary Niche, as well as Matrix, which is now
known as Mylan Laboratories, Slovenian peer Krka and Lupin. The sanctions are the third by the Commission against pay-for-delay deals following  fines in the past year against Denmark's Lundbeck, Merck KGaA, Indian No. 1 drugmaker Ranbaxy, Johnson and Johnson and Novartis. It is examining a similar deal between Teva and U.S. peer Cephalon, which is now part of the Israeli company, related to a pill for sleeping disorder. (Reuters)

HD         Roundup: EU fines drug makers 428 mln euros for delaying  cheaper medicine

BRUSSELS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission (EC) has imposed a fine of 428 million euros (580 U.S. dollars) on French pharmaceutical company Servier and five producers of generic medicines for delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicine.

The commission said Servier and the other five companies, namely Niche/ Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka and Lupin, are involved in a series of deals aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine perindopril from price competition in the EU.

TD
The strategy used by Servier is implemented through a technology acquisition and a series of patent
settlements with generic rivals.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market,"  European Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, the commission's competition policy chief, said in a statement. "Such behavior is clearly anti-competitive and abusive."

Perindopril is a blockbuster blood pressure control medicine and used to be Servier's best-selling product.

Almunia said competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements. "Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers," he said.

He urged pharmaceutical companies to focus their efforts on innovating and competing "rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, he said Servier kept competitors off the market thanks to secondary patents -- that is to say, patents which did not protect the molecule itself but other aspects such as the manufacturing processes of the medicine.

To overcome the obstacle, generic companies relied on a new technology that would allow them to avoid Servier's secondary patents altogether.

"However, in 2004, Servier acquired this technology. Not to use it but only to prevent competitors from entering. As a result, a number of projects by generic makers were abandoned and market entry was delayed," said Almunia.

Every time a generic company came close to the market, Servier managed to enter into a deal, for example, by paying the generic companies to make sure that it would stay outside the market, according to the  European Commission.
Right after the patent was annulled, prices of generic  perindopril dropped by as much as 90 percent. "For four years, patients and national health systems were deprived of the benefits of competition,
meaning earlier access to a cheaper version of the medicine," Almunia said.
He said that patent  settlements should not be misused.

"Engaging in an exclusionary strategy to foreclose important competing technologies and buying one close competitor after another is blatantly abusive," he added.
Of the 428 million euros  fine, some 330 million will be paid by Servier. Enditem

HD        EU Fines Drug Producers for Delays

European Union regulators handed down  fines totaling EUR427.7 million ($582.1 million) to French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Servier SA and five generic drug producers on Wednesday for colluding to delay a cheaper version of a blood-pressure medicine.

The decision is the third and by far the largest set of  fines imposed by EU antitrust authorities for so-called pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry, in which drug makers are accused of paying generic rivals to delay the introduction of cheaper versions of popular drugs.

TD
Antitrust experts said the move was controversial because of the restrictive way in which EU regulators had defined the market and their approach to still-valid patent rights. They said the decision might discourage pharmaceutical companies from settling patent disputes with generic drug companies, thereby increasing legal uncertainty for the industry.

Servier, which was given a EUR331 million  fine, hit back swiftly at the decision, saying it would launch an appeal at the EU's top court.

"This kind of sanction jeopardizes the pharmaceutical companies' commitment to research, and this is thus detrimental to patients," said Lucy Vincent, a spokeswoman for Servier.
The dispute centers on efforts to create a generic version of Servier's popular cardiovascular medicine,
perindopril, whose patent expired for the most part in 2003.

The European Commission, which acts as the region's central antitrust authority, said Servier had sought to delay the production of cheaper alternatives by buying a technology aimed at stopping generic firms from producing the drug, and by reaching a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.
It said cash payments from Servier to the five generic firms--Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd., U.S.-based Mylan Inc.'s Matrix Laboratories, Slovenia's Krka D.D., and Indian drug firms Lupin Ltd.
and a division of Unichem Laboratories Ltd.--amounted to "several tens of millions of euros".

A spokesman for Teva said the company didn't think it had engaged in anticompetitive behavior, and would consider whether to appeal the EU's decision. A spokesman for Mylan said the company disagreed with the decision and would be submitting an appeal. And a spokeswoman for Krka said the company didn't think it had breached EU antitrust rules, and would appeal the EU's decision.

Of the two Indian firms, a spokesman for Lupin said the company was very disappointed with the decision and planned to appeal it, while Unichem didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Almunia said: "Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers."



Page 30 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Generic drugs are far cheaper than brand medicines, and offer large savings to patients and health care providers. A 2009 report by the commission found that pay-for-delay deals could increase the cost of drugs by as much as 20% for consumers.
Servier argued that its actions hadn't delayed production of the cheaper drug, and said the  settlements
were a legitimate means of ending costly and uncertain legal disputes.

The EU's decision "sends a very bad signal" to innovative companies and sets "a regrettable precedent for industries that rely on intellectual property," said Ms. Vincent.

Servier also said it was "absurd" to limit the definition of the market in which it was dominant to a single molecule, and argued there were at least a dozen competing products. It said the commission hadn't shown that its acquisition of a competing technology had had concrete negative effects.
However, the commission said one generic company had acknowledged that it was being "bought out of
perindopril", and another had said that any  settlement would have to be for a "pile of cash."
The commission can fine firms up to 10% of total annual sales if it finds them guilty of collusion.

Last year, the commission slapped  fines totaling EUR146 million on Danish drug maker Lundbeck and several generic drug companies over a 2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its antidepressant drug citalopram. It subsequently finedJohnson & Johnson and Novartis AG EUR16 million for delaying the market entry of a cheaper version of the painkiller fentanyl.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," the EU's antitrust chief Joaqu&#237;n Almunia said in a statement.

It said cash payments from Servier to the five generic firms--Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., U.S.-based Mylan Inc.'s Matrix Laboratories, Slovenia's Krka D.D., and Indian drug firms Lupin Ltd. and
a division of Unichem Laboratories Ltd.--amounted to "several tens of millions of euros".

A spokesman for Teva said the company didn't think it had engaged in anticompetitive behavior, and would consider whether to appeal the EU's decision. A spokesman for Mylan said the company disagreed with the decision and would be submitting an appeal. And a spokeswoman for Krka said the company didn't think it had breached EU antitrust rules, and would appeal the EU's decision.

Of the two Indian firms, a spokesman for Lupin said the company was very disappointed with the decision and planned to appeal it, while Unichem didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Almunia said: "Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers."

Generic drugs are far cheaper than brand medicines, and offer large savings to patients and health care providers. A 2009 report by the commission found that pay-for-delay deals could increase the cost of drugs by as much as 20% for consumers.
Servier argued that its actions hadn't delayed production of the cheaper drug, and said the  settlements
were a legitimate means of ending costly and uncertain legal disputes.

The EU's decision "sends a very bad signal" to innovative companies and sets "a regrettable precedent for industries that rely on intellectual property," said Ms. Vincent.

Servier also said it was "absurd" to limit the definition of the market in which it was dominant to a single molecule, and argued there were at least a dozen competing products. It said the commission hadn't shown that its acquisition of a competing technology had had concrete negative effects.
However, the commission said one generic company had acknowledged that it was being "bought out of
perindopril", and another had said that any  settlement would have to be for a "pile of cash."
The commission can fine firms up to 10% of total annual sales if it finds them guilty of collusion.

Last year, the commission slapped  fines totaling EUR146 million on Danish drug maker Lundbeck and several generic drug companies over a 2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its antidepressant drug citalopram. It subsequently fined Johnson & Johnson and Novartis AG EUR16 million for delaying the market entry of a cheaper version of the painkiller fentanyl.

HD           EU Fines Drug Producers for Delaying Cheaper Medicine;  Servier, Teva Among Six Hit By EU Regulators

BRUSSELS—European Union regulators handed down  fines totaling €427.7 million ($582.1 million) to French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Servier SA and five generic drug producers on Wednesday for colluding to delay a cheaper version of a blood-pressure medicine.

The decision is the third and by far the largest set of  fines imposed by EU antitrust authorities for so-called pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry, in which drug makers are accused of paying generic rivals to delay the introduction of cheaper versions of popular drugs.

TD
Antitrust experts said the move was controversial because of the restrictive way in which EU
regulators had defined the market and their approach to still-valid patent rights. They said the decision
might discourage pharmaceutical companies from settling patent disputes with generic drug
companies, thereby increasing legal uncertainty for the industry.

Servier was given a €331 million  fine, representing 7.9% of its annual revenue, according to a commission spokesman. The company hit back swiftly at the decision, saying it would launch an appeal at the EU's top court.

"This kind of sanction jeopardizes the pharmaceutical companies' commitment to research, and this is thus detrimental to patients," said Lucy Vincent, a spokeswoman for Servier.

The dispute centers on efforts to create a generic version of Servier's popular cardiovascular medicine, perindopril, whose patent expired for the most part in 2003.

The European Commission, which acts as the region's central antitrust authority, said Servier had sought to delay the production of cheaper alternatives by buying a technology aimed at stopping generic firms from producing the drug, and by reaching a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," the EU's antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement.

It said cash payments from Servier to the five generic firms—Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., U.S.-based Mylan Inc.'s Matrix Laboratories, Slovenia's Krka D.D., and Indian drug firms Lupin Ltd. and a division of Unichem Laboratories Ltd.--amounted to "several tens of millions of euros".

HD      EU fines Servier, generics  for blocking cheap blood pressure  drugs

LP
Brussels (dpa) - The  European Commission slapped a 427.7-million-euro (582-million-dollar)  fine on the French pharmaceutical company Servier and five generics companies on Wednesday for protecting a blood pressure drug from cheaper competition.

The case centres on  perindopril, once "Servier's best-selling product," the European Union's executive wrote.

TD
Several generics companies were preparing to bring rival products to market when Servier's patent for the drug expired in 2003, but they were blocked when the French company bought a key technology needed to produce the medicine in 2004, the commission said.

Servier then paid the companies "several tens of millions of euros" in out-of-court  settlements for patent cases brought, it said, adding, "Generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's [profits]."

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

"Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers," he said. "Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."

The bulk of the  fine, almost 331 million euros, goes to Sevier. The remainder is divided among the generics manufacturers, Niche/Unichem, Matrix, Teva, Krka and Lupin. Matrix has since been bought by Mylan.

Last year, the commission  fined companies in two other cases relating to the anti-depressant citalopram and the painkiller fentanyl as part of an investigation into the pharmaceutical sector.

Indian drug firms Lupin and Unichem Labs are among six global drugmakers on which the European regulator has imposed a collective  fine of 427.7 million euros for striking deals to prevent entry of the cheaper version of blood pressure drug  Perindopril in the EU.

According to the  European Commission’s Anti-trust ruling, Lupin has been  fined 40 million euros (nearly R325 crore), while Unichem Labs has been  fined 13.96 million euros (over R110 crore). The companies have been pulled up for striking a series of deals with French firm Servier, which used to sell patented  perindopril drug, so that cheaper copies of the drug are not launched in the EU.

TD
Besides Servier, the other drug makers on whom the  European Commission has imposed fines totaling 427.7 million euros are Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva and Krka. "Through technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules,"  European Commission said in a statement.

Commenting on the ruling,  European Commission vice-president Joaquin Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive."
Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these
agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements, he added.

HD         EU slaps ~324-cr fine on Lupin for blocking hypertension generic

Leading domestic drug makers Lupin, Unichem and Matrix Labs (now part of Mylan) have come under the scanner of the European Commission for curbing entry of the low-cost generic version of cardiovascular medicine Perindopril in the European Union (EU).
The anti-trust wing of the Commission has slapped a hefty  fine of ^427.7 million (around ~3,458.7
crore) on five generic drug manufacturers, besides Servier, a French pharmaceutical company that held
patent protection for blockbuster  Perindopril.

TD
Of the total  fine, Lupin has to pay ^40 million (around ~324 crore), while Unichem and Matrix have been fined for ^13.96 million (around ~113 crore) and ^17 million (~138 crore), respectively.
According to the Commission, Servier and the five generic drug producers concluded a series of deals
— all aimed at protecting the innovator company’s bestselling blood-pressure medicine from price
competition from generics in the European Union.

“Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicines to the detriment of public budgets and patients, in breach of the EU anti-trust rules,” the Commission said in a statement on Wednesday.
Drug maker Lupin had sold certain patent applications and other related intellectual property on
Perindopril to the French company in 2007 for around ^20 million.

“We are very disappointed with the  European Commission’s findings. We are still awaiting an official copy of the decision. We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal against the decision,” a spokesperson for Lupin said.
Apart from the Indian drug makers, the European watchdog also penalised Israel’s Teva and
Slovenia-based Krka for their alleged anti-competitive actions.

In 2003, most of Servier’s patents for the  perindopril molecule expired, though some of the secondary patents related to processes and forms continued, the competition regulator said.

According to the regulator, at that time, generic drug makers of  perindopril were “intensively preparing” their market entry and sought access to patent-free products or challenged the Servier patents blocking them. “There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004, Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and, therefore, delaying their entry,” the Commission explained in the statement.

With their way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier’s patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge.

“This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decided to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier’s rent,” the regulator said.

Citing examples of such  settlements, which according to the Commission happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007, the EU regulator said Servier offered a generic company a licence for seven national markets; in return, the generic drug maker agreed to “sacrifice” all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its  perindopril there.
“In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros,” the
Commission said.

Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of the competition policy, said: “Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive. Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these agreements  are in the form of patent settlements. Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers.”

While the European watchdog has imposed a  fine of ^331 million on Servier, the remaining  fine of about ^100 million is split among the five producers of generic medicines on the basis of the extent of their involvement.

BRUSSELS, July 10 -- The  European Commission (EC) on Wednesday imposed  fines totaling 428 million euros (USD 582 million) on the French pharmaceutical company Servier and five producers of generic medicines for implementing a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine.

New Delhi, Jul 10 (PTI) Unichem Laboratories today said it will appeal against the  European                    Commission's decision in the European Union courts, denying any wrong doing by it or its subsidiary Niche Generics.

"Unichem will vigourously appeal the  European Commission decision to the EU courts and seek to attain the correct result in this matter, a result which is in the best interests of the consumer," Unichem Laboratories said in a filing to the BSE.

TD
The company vehemently denies any wrong doing on the part of either itself or Niche, it added.

"Moreover, Unichem was not involved in the  agreement to settle the litigation with Servier back in 2005 as it only took full ownership of Niche late in 2006," Unichem said.

The company cannot in anyway see how it can be held accountable for what was in any event a pre-competitive act on part of its then only part-owned subsidiary Niche, it added.

Yesterday, the European regulator had imposed a collective  fine of 427.7 million euros on six global drug makers including Indian drug firms Unichem Laboratories and Lupin for striking deals to prevent entry of cheaper version of blood pressure drug  Perindopril in the EU.

As per the  European Commission Anti-trust ruling, Lupin has been  fined 40 million euros (nearly Rs 325 crore), while Unichem Laboratories was  fined 13.96 million euros (over Rs 110 crore).

The companies have been pulled up for striking a series of deals with French firm Servier, which used to sell patented  perindopril drug, so that cheaper copies of the drug were not launched in the EU.
Besides Servier, the other drug makers on whom the  European Commission has imposed fines totaling

Commenting on the ruling,  European Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, in charge of competition policy, had said: "Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive."
Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these
agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements, he added.

"Such behaviour violates EU antitrust rules that prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position," Commission had said.

HD      The European Commission limits  the legitimate exercise of intellectual property rights  and thus weakens the competitiveness of European industry

Suresnes, Servier received today the  European Commission’s decision censuring (1) settlement          agreements  putting an end to patent disputes with five manufacturers of generics in relation to perindopril, a Servier medicine, and (2) the acquisition of a technology from a European small and medium sized enterprise.

TD
The decision imposes a  fine of EUR 331 million on Servier and a total amount of EUR 96,7 million on the manufacturers of competing generics.

Lucy Vincent, Servier’s spokesperson, emphasises that ‘patients have not been deprived of  perindopril at any time. Moreover, generic entry has not been delayed. Servier has acted in a transparent and legitimate way to defend its patents, which are essential if we are to continue the development of innovative medicines for the benefit of patients.’

Since the beginning of this investigation and the statement of objections received in July 2012, Servier has fully cooperated with the  European Commission. However, Servier strongly disagrees with the unprecedented theory developed in the decision.

As Servier proved to the Commission, the  settlement agreements  between Servier and the generics manufacturers have not in any way delayed the entry of generics to the market, which became available as soon as the patent was revoked. These  agreements  were a legitimate means to put an end to long, costly, and uncertain disputes. The patent under investigation had been validated by the European Patent Office.

‘The Commission’s decision sets a regrettable precedent for industries that rely on intellectual property. By condemning patent  settlement agreements  responding to legitimate commercial concerns, the Commission makes patent disputes more risky and more costly’.

Furthermore, the  European Commission’s allegation of Servier’s abuse of dominant position is based on a market definition limiting the relevant market to the single molecule of  perindopril, whereas treatments for hypertension include at least a dozen competing products within the therapeutic class to which perindopril belongs (ACE Inhibitors).

‘Medically or economically, limiting the relevant market to a single molecule of such a crowded therapeutic class is absurd’.

Moreover, the  European Commission considers that the acquisition of a technology from a small and medium sized enterprise by Servier was abusive, whereas the  European Commission has not been able to show any concrete actual negative effects on competition.

Servier has developed a unique model of governance, in the form of a foundation, with a long term vision of investment. Servier does not distribute dividends and, in 2013, invested more than 27% of its turnover in R&D.

‘The European Commission’s decision against our intellectual property rights sends a very bad signal to companies of all sizes which make the choice to innovate in Europe. This kind of sanction jeopardises the pharmaceutical companies’ commitment to research, and this is thus detrimental to patients.’

Considering the novelty of the unfounded theory put forward, Servier will file an appeal before the
European Union Court of Justice.

HD     Pay-for-Delay  Lands Drugmakers Nearly $600 Million  in EU Fines

French drugmaker Servier and five generics firms are facing roughly $580 million in  fines from European antitrust regulators over an alleged pay-for-delay scheme.

According to the  European Commission, Servier used technology acquisitions and patent  settlements with the other manufacturers to keep generic versions of its blockbuster cardiovascular drug Coveram (perindopril) off the market in what amounted to payoffs that violated European antitrust law.

TD
Regulators first announced an investigation into the patent  settlements last December (DID, Jan. 16). Along with Servier, the case involves Teva, Mylan subsidiary Matrix Laboratories, Niche/Unichem, Krka and Lupin. Each faces tens of millions in  fines.

Reached for comment, both Mylan and Lupin denied the allegations and vowed to appeal. Mylan noted that its subsidiary's alleged deal occurred in 2005, about two years before it acquired Matrix.

European regulators minced no words in their accusations, arguing that Servier paid the generics companies tens of millions to keep their products off the market.

Servier managed to maintain market exclusivity over the product until about 2007, four years after the drug's main patent expired in 2003, according to the Commission. To do so, regulators say Servier acquired additional technology patents to make it harder for generics makers to pursue their own versions. When competitors did propose their own version, Servier sued and later settled with payouts in exchange for a market delay.

The Commission emphasized that the case was not an isolated incident, but rather the latest in a concerted effort to scrutinize patent  settlements that may be anticompetitive. The overall frequency of such deals has declined, the Commission said. -- Bryan Koenig

HD     Generic drug makers to challenge  EU anti-trust fine

Mumbai, July 10 -- Three generic drug makers, including India's Lupin Ltd and Unichem Laboratories Ltd, said on Thursday they will appeal a  fine imposed by the European Union's (EU's) market competition watchdog which found them guilty of an alleged settlement agreement with French drug maker Les Laboratorie Servier to delay the launch of a copy of hypertension drug Perindopril.The EU's Competition Commission had on Wednesday imposed a total  fine of 94 million euro on five generic companies-Lupin, Niche Generics Ltd, a European subsidiary of Unichem, and foreign generic drug makers Mylan Inc.,
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Krka Group d.d.
Servier was asked to pay a  fine of 331 million euro.

TD
The EU decision was based on a patent  settlement between Servier and the generic companies in 2005. Unichem and Mylan were involved in the matter after they acquired their respective subsidiaries Niche
and Matrix Laboratories Ltd, which were party to the  settlement, after 2005.

"The European Commission decided to impose a wholly unjustified  fine on Niche contending that it had acted in breach of EU antitrust rules," Unichem Lab said in a note on Thursday.

"Unichem vehemently denies any wrongdoing on the part of either itself or Niche, and will vigorously appeal the European Commission decision to the EU courts and seek to attain the correct result in this matter a result which is in the best interests of the consumer," it said.

A Lupin spokesperson had on Wednesday said that the company is disappointed with the EU order and plans to appeal it.

"Matrix and Mylan disagree with the decision and continue to believe that the  settlement agreement was legal, and we will be submitting an appeal of the decision to the General Court of the European Union,"
US generic drug maker Mylan said in a statement on Thursday.

Mint reported on Wednesday that the EU had  fined these company over allegations that Servier had forced them into  settlements to protect the exclusivity of  perindopril.

It is general practice for patent holders to file suits against generic applicants to protect patents and prevent them from getting regulatory approval for copies.

But as part of  settlement of these suits, patent owners often pay generic firms money to keep their products off the market. As a result, companies making branded drugs, taking advantage of the absence of competition, will continue maintaining the market monopoly and sell the products at the original price, Mint reported.

TD
Brussels, 09/07/2014 (Agence Europe) - On 9 July, the  European Commission imposed fines totalling
€427.7 million on the French pharmaceutical company Servier and five producers of generic medicines,
namely Niche/Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka and Lupin, for signing a series of deals
aimed at protecting Servier's best-selling blood pressure medicine,  Perindopril, from price competition by
generics in the EU.

“Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules”, explains the Commission.

“Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market”, said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. He announced  fines of nearly €331 for Servier. The  fines on generic producers deemed to be complicit bring the total amount of  fines to
€427.7 million, of which nearly €14 million is levied on Niche/Unichem, €17 million on Matrix, €15.5 million on Teva, €10 million on Krka and €40 million on Lupin. Servier's patent for the  perindopril molecule expired in 2003.

In order to enter the market and overcome the remaining obstacles, generic companies sought access to patent-free products or challenged Servier's patents that they believed were unduly blocking them. There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004 Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and therefore delaying their entry. Servier recognised that this acquisition merely sought to “strengthen the defence mechanism” and the technology was never put to use. With this way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier's patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually every time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim out of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent. This happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007 and cost Servier several million euro.

In 2007, prices of generic  perindopril dropped on average by 90% compared to Servier's previous price level in the UK. This occurred when the only remaining legal challenger in the UK obtained the annulment of Servier's then most important patent.

News of the decision leaked in the French media and EFPIA (the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations) expressed concern: “Given the economic and welfare interests at stake, competition authorities should be circumspect in assessing the lawfulness of patent  settlements and promoting litigation”.

The European Commission's antitrust authorities have slapped a  fine of €427.7 million on a group of pharmaceutical companies including India's Lupin, Unichem Laboratories and the local unit of Mylan, accusing them of working together to block the generic entry of a blockbuster blood-pressure drug. French drug maker Servier, the patent holder for  Perindopril, along with five generic drug makers through a series of deals made sure that cheaper generic versions of the drug weren't available to patients, said a news release from the antitrust body that started investigating the matter in 2009. Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Slovenian Krka are the other lowed by Mylan at €17 million and Unichem, nearly €14 million.

TD
Lupin said it was "very disappointed" with the findings. "We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal the decision," a spokesperson said. Mylan Laboratories -the Indian unit of Mylan that was previously called Matrix Laboratories -didn't respond to an email seeking comment, while Unichem could not be reached. The patent for  Perindopril expired in 2003. But through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the market, the news release said."Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," commission vice-president Joaquín Almunia, who is in charge of competition policy , was
quoted as saying in the release. "Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers.

Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients." "One generic company acknowledged that it was being
`bought out of  Perindopril'. Another insisted that `any  settlement will have to be for significant sums', to which it also referred as a `pile of cash'. In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros," the release said. In one of the cases, it said, Servier offered a generic company a licence for seven markets in return for it agreeing to "sacrifice" the launch of the drug in other EU countries.
On Wednesday, Lupin's shares closed 2% down at ` . 1,035.25 on the BSE, while Unichem ended 1%
lower at `. 217.45. The benchmark Sensex closed 0.5% down.

French drug maker Servier, the patent holder for  Perindopril, along with five generic drug makers through a series of deals made sure that cheap er generic versions of the drug weren't available to patients, said a news release from the antitrust body that started investigating the matter in 2009.
Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Slovenian Krka are the other two companies named by the antitrust authorities. A large part of the  fine will be borne by Servier.

Lupin is fined 40 million euros, followed by Mylan at 17 million euros and Unichem, nearly 14 million euros. Lupin said it was "very disappointed" with the findings. "We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal the decision," a spokesperson said. Mylan Laboratories the Indian unit of Mylan that was previously called Matrix Laboratories didn't respond to an email seeking comment, while Unichem could not be reached.

The patent for  Perindopril expired in 2003. But through a technology acquisition and a series of patent settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the market, the news release said.

European regulators have  fined Servier of France and several other drugmakers €428m for blocking the introduction of cheaper generic competition to an expensive branded medicine.

The fine is the latest blow by European and US authorities against so-called " pay-for-delay " deals under which generic drugmakers hold back from launching rival products in return for compensation from brand-name manufacturers.

TD
"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," said Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner. "Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive."

Teva of Israel, the world's biggest generic drugmaker by revenues, was among five companies found by the European Commission to have struck unlawful deals with Servier between 2005 and 2007 to protect the French company's blood pressure medicine,  perindopril.

The ruling follows  fines by the EU antitrust watchdog last year against Johnson & Johnson of the US, Novartis of Switzerland and Lundbeck of Denmark for similar  agreements  .

Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission has also stepped up scrutiny of pay-for-delay deals after a US Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 backed the regulator's right to challenge such deals.

Mr Almunia said agreements  that postponed the entry of cheaper medicines to the -market "directly harm patients, national health systems and -taxpayers". He said: "Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."
Drug companies argue that pay-for-delay is a misnomer, preferring to describe the deals as "patent
settlements" that help avert protracted litigation.
Generic manufacturers often challenge patents on branded drugs years before their expiry.

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling 427.7 million on the French pharmaceutical company Servier and five producers of generic medicines namely, Niche/Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka and Lupin for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine,  perindopril, from price competition by generics in the EU. Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicines to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules. Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive.

Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements. Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers. Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."  Perindopril is a blockbuster blood pressure control medicine and used to be Servier's best-selling product. Servier held significant market power in the market for the  perindopril molecule as no antihypertensive medicines other than the generic versions of perindopril were able to meaningfully constrain Servier's sales and prices. Servier's patent for the perindopril molecule expired, for the most part, in 2003. Generic competitors continued to face a number of so-called "secondary" patents relating to processes and form but these provided a more limited protection to what Servier described as its "dairy cow". Producers of cheaper, generic versions of perindopril were intensively preparing their market entry. In order to enter the market and overcome the remaining obstacles, generic companies sought access to patent-free products or challenged Servier's patents that they believed were unduly blocking them. There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004 Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and therefore delaying their entry. Servier recognised that this acquisition merely sought to "strengthen
the defence mechanism" and the technology was never put to use. With this way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier's patents before courts. However, between 2005 and
2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge.

HD        EU slaps ~324-cr fine on Lupin for blocking hypertension generic

Two other Indian firms, Unichem & Matrix, asked to pay ~113 cr and 138 cr, respectively

Leading domestic drug makers Lupin, Unichem and Matrix Labs (now part of Mylan) have come under the scanner of the European Commission for curbing entry of the low-cost generic version of cardiovascular medicine Perindopril in the European Union (EU). The anti-trust wing of the Commission has slapped a hefty fine of ^427.7 million (around ~3,458.7 crore) on five generic drug manufacturers, besides Servier, a French pharmaceutical company that held patent protection for blockbuster Perindopril.

TD
Of the total  fine, Lupin has to pay ^40 million (around ~324 crore), while Unichem and Matrix have been
fined for ^13.96 million (around ~113 crore) and ^17 million (~138 crore), respectively.
According to the Commission, Servier and the five generic drug producers concluded a series of deals
— all aimed at protecting the innovator company’s bestselling blood-pressure medicine from price
competition from generics in the European Union. “Through a technology acquisition and a series of
patent  settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and
delay the entry of cheaper generic medicines to the detriment of public budgets and patients, in breach
of the EU anti-trust rules,” the Commission said in a statement on Wednesday.
Drug maker Lupin had sold certain patent applications and other related intellectual property on
Perindopril to the French company in 2007 for around ^20 million.

“We are very disappointed with the  European Commission’s findings. We are still awaiting an official copy of the decision. We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal against the decision,” a spokesperson for Lupin said.
Apart from the Indian drug makers, the European watchdog also penalised Israel’s Teva and
Slovenia-based Krka for their alleged anti-competitive actions.

In 2003, most of Servier’s patents for the  perindopril molecule expired, though some of the secondary patents related to processes and forms continued, the competition regulator said.

According to the regulator, at that time, generic drug makers of  perindopril were “intensively preparing” their market entry and sought access to patent-free products or challenged the Servier patents blocking them. “There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004, Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and, therefore, delaying their entry,” the Commission explained in the statement.

With their way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier’s patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. “This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decided to settle a patent claim outside of court to save on time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier’s rent,” the regulator said.

Citing examples of such  settlements, which according to the Commission happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007, the EU regulator said Servier offered a generic company a licence for seven national markets; in return, the generic drug maker agreed to “sacrifice” all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its  perindopril there.
“In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros,” the
Commission said.

Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of the competition policy, said: “Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure they stayed out of the market. Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive. Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these  agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements. Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers.”

While the European watchdog has imposed a  fine of ^331 million on Servier, the remaining  fine of about ^100 million is split among the five producers of generic medicines on the basis of the extent of their involvement.

HD          Drug Makers Fined In Generics Dispute

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators handed down  fines totaling nearly 430 million euros ($585 million) to French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Servier SA and five generic drug producers on Wednesday for colluding to delay a less-costly version of a blood-pressure medicine.

The decision is the third and by far the largest set of  fines imposed by EU antitrust authorities for so-called pay-for-delay deals in the pharmaceutical industry, in which drug makers are accused of paying generic rivals to delay the introduction of less-expensive versions of popular drugs.

TD
Antitrust experts said the move was controversial because of the restrictive way in which EU regulators had defined the market and their approach to still-valid patent rights. They said the decision might discourage pharmaceutical companies from settling patent disputes with generic-drug companies, thereby increasing legal uncertainty for the industry.

Servier received a 331 million euro  fine, representing 7.9% of its annual revenue, according to a commission spokesman. The company hit back swiftly at the decision, saying it would launch an appeal at the EU's top court.

"This kind of sanction jeopardizes the pharmaceutical companies' commitment to research, and this is thus detrimental to patients," said Lucy Vincent, a spokeswoman for Servier.
The dispute centers on efforts to create a generic version of Servier's popular cardiovascular medicine,
perindopril, whose patent expired for the most part in 2003.

The European Commission, which acts as the region's central antitrust authority, said Servier had sought to delay the production of less-costly alternatives by buying a technology aimed at stopping generic companies from producing the drug, and by reaching a series of patent  settlements with generic rivals.

"Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market," EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said in a written statement.

The commission said cash payments from Servier to the five generic-drug makers -- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. of Israel, the Matrix Laboratories unit of U.S.-based Mylan Inc., Krka D.D. of Slovenia, and Indian companies Lupin Ltd. and Unichem Laboratories Ltd. -- amounted to "several tens of millions of euros."

A spokesman for Teva said the company didn't think it had engaged in anticompetitive behavior, and would consider whether to appeal the EU's decision. A spokesman for Mylan said the company disagreed with the decision and would be submitting an appeal. A spokeswoman for Krka said the company didn't think it had breached EU antitrust rules and would appeal the decision.

A spokesman for Lupin said the company was disappointed with the decision and planned to appeal it. Unichem didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Almunia said: "Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers."

Page 65 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Generic drugs are far less expensive than brand medicines, and offer large savings to patients and health-care providers. A 2009 report by the commission found that pay-for-delay deals could increase the cost of drugs by as much as 20% for consumers.
Servier argued that its actions hadn't delayed production of the less-costly drug, and said the
settlements were a legitimate means of ending costly and uncertain legal disputes.

The EU's decision "sends a very bad signal" to innovative companies and sets "a regrettable precedent for industries that rely on intellectual property," Ms. Vincent said.

Servier also said it was "absurd" to limit the definition of the market in which it was dominant to a single molecule, and argued there were at least a dozen competing products. It said the commission hadn't shown that its acquisition of a competing technology had caused concrete negative effects.

However, the commission said one generic company had acknowledged that it was being "bought out of perindopril," and another had said that any  settlement would have to be for a "pile of cash."

The commission can fine companies as much as 10% of total annual sales if it finds them guilty of collusion.

Last year, the commission slapped  fines totaling 146 million euros on Danish drug maker Lundbeck and several generic-drug companies over a 2002 agreement to delay the generic version of its antidepressant drug citalopram. It subsequently finedJohnson & Johnson and Novartis AG 16 million euros for delaying the market entry of a less-costly version of the painkiller fentanyl.

EUROPEAN Union antitrust regulators  fined French drugmaker Servier, Israel’s Teva and four others a total of 428 million euros (US$583 million) yesterday, as they crack down on deals which block cheaper generic medicine.

Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have frowned on such  agreements,  saying they jack up the cost of drugs by as much as 20 percent for consumers.

TD
The pharmaceutical industry says so-called pay-for-delay deals, where brand-name drugmakers pay cheaper non-brand generics firms to hold back from launching rival medicines, help to avert lengthy and costly litigation.

“Servier had a strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market. Such behavior is clearly anti-competitive and abusive,” European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

The European Commission said Servier’s deals with the generics rivals between 2005 and 2007 were aimed at protecting its best-selling blood pressure medicine  perindopril in the 28-country bloc.

Servier, France’s second-largest drugmaker, was hit with the biggest  fine at 331 million euros, while world No. 1 generic drugmaker Teva’s penalty came to 15.57 million euros.

Servier said it would challenge the EU ruling in court. “Patients have not been deprived of  perindopril at any time. Moreover, generic entry has not been delayed. Servier has acted in a transparent and legitimate way to defend its patents,” said spokeswoman Lucy Vincent.

The other penalized companies were Unichem and its subsidiary Niche, as well as Matrix, which is now known as Mylan Laboratories, Slovenian peer Krka and Lupin.

The sanctions are the third by the Commission against pay-for-delay deals following  fines in the past year against Denmark’s Lundbeck, Merck KGaA, Indian No. 1 drugmaker Ranbaxy, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis.
It is examining a similar deal between Teva and US peer Cephalon related to a sleeping disorder pill.

MUMBAI: The  European Commission's antitrust authorities have slapped a  fine of 427.7 million euros on a group of pharmaceutical companies including India's Lupin, Unichem Laboratories and the local unit of Mylan, accusing them of working together to block the generic entry of a blockbuster blood-pressure drug.

French drug maker Servier, the patent holder for  Perindopril, along with five generic drug makers through a series of deals made sure that cheaper generic versions of the drug weren't available to patients, said a news release from the antitrust body that started investigating the matter in 2009.

Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Slovenian Krka are the other two companies named by the antitrust authorities. A large part of the  fine will be borne by Servier. Lupin is  fined 40 million euros, followed by Mylan at 17 million euros and Unichem, nearly 14 million euros.

Lupin said it was "very disappointed" with the findings. "We remain confident of our position and intend to appeal the decision," a spokesperson said. Mylan Laboratories – the Indian unit of Mylan that was previously called Matrix Laboratories – didn't respond to an email seeking comment, while Unichem could not be reached.

The patent for Perindopril expired in 2003. But through a technology acquisition and a series of patent settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicine to the market, the news release said.

Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients."

Perindopril is a blockbuster blood pressure control medicine and used to be Servier's best-selling product. Servier held significant market power in the market for the perindopril molecule as no anti hypertensive medicines other than the generic versions of perindopril were able to meaningfully constrain Servier's sales and prices. Servier's patent for the perindopril molecule expired, for the most part, in 2003. Generic competitors continued to face a number of so-called "secondary" patents relating
to processes and form but these provided a more limited protection to what Servier described as its "dairy cow". Producers of cheaper, generic versions of  perindopril were intensively preparing their market
entry.

In order to enter the market and overcome the remaining obstacles, generic companies sought access to patent-free products or challenged Servier's patents that they believed were unduly blocking them. There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004 Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and therefore delaying their entry. Servier recognised that
this acquisition merely sought to "strengthen the defence mechanism" and the technology was never put to use.

With this way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier's patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent. This happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007. One generic company acknowledged that it was being "bought out of  perindopril". Another insisted that "any  settlement will have to be for significant sums", to which it also referred as a "pile of cash". In total, cash payments from Servier to
generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros. In one case, Servier offered a generic company a licence for 7 national markets; in return, the generic company agreed to "sacrifice" all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its  perindopril there. Servier thus gained the certainty that the generic producers would stay out of the national markets and refrain from legal challenges for the duration of the agreements.

It is legitimate - and desirable - to apply for patents, including so-called 'process' patents, to enforce them, to transfer technologies and to settle litigation. However, Servier misused such legitimate tools by shutting out a competing technology and buying out a number of competitors that had developed cheaper medicines, to avoid competing on their own merits. Such behaviour violates EU antitrust rules that
prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - TFEU). Each of the  settlements between Servier and its generic competitors was also an anti-competitive  agreement prohibited by Article 101 TFEU.

Experience shows that effective generic competition drives prices down significantly. The market entry of generic medicines reduces dramatically the prices of the medicine concerned and brings large benefits to patients and public budgets. In 2007, prices of generic  perindopril dropped on average by 90% compared to Servier's previous price level in the UK. This occurred when the only remaining legal challenger in the UK obtained the annulment of Servier's then most important patent. In internal documents, Servier however commented proudly on their "great success = 4 years won", referring to the expiry of the  perindopril molecule patent back in 2003.
The Commission based its  fines on its 2006 Guidelines on  fines. In setting the level of the  fines, the
Commission took into account the duration of each infringement and its gravity.

HD             Mylan to appeal against EC anti-trust findings on Matrix

Decision relates to  settlement pact for BP drug Drug-maker Mylan will appeal against the  European Commission’s recent anti-trust findings and a  fine it imposed on the company’s subsidiary, the erstwhile Matrix Laboratories.

“The decision relates to a settlement agreement entered into by Matrix with Les Laboratoires Servier in 2005 regarding the product perindopril, approximately two years before Mylan acquired its interest in Matrix,” Mylan said.

TD
“Matrix and Mylan disagree with the decision and continue to believe that the  settlement agreement was legal, and we will be submitting an appeal against the decision to the General Court of the European Union.”
The EC has imposed a  fine of €17.16 million ( Rs. 140 crore) on Matrix/Mylan.

Earlier this week, the EC had imposed a  fine on five companies, including Indian drug-makers Lupin and Unichem subsidiary Niche, alleging that they had entered into deals with France’s Servier on its blood pressure drug perindopril, resulting in the delayed launch of their lower priced generic versions of the same drug.
Lupin had been fined €40 million and Unichem about €14 million. More appeals
Lupin and Unichem had denied the findings and said they would appeal against the EC decision. Explaining its situation, Unichem said the EC’s decision referred to Niche’s  settlement on a “financially crippling patent litigation” with Servier in early 2005.

Unichem took complete ownership of Niche in 2006, and so was not involved with the decision to settle, it said. Nevertheless, it would appeal against the decision, the company added.

Incidentally, about the same time last year, Ranbaxy Laboratories was one of nine companies slapped with a fine by the EC for delaying the launch of its low-priced generic version of depression drug citalopram made by Danish company Lundbeck.
Pay to delay
For the settlement forged with Lundbeck in 2002, Ranbaxy was  fined about Rs. 80 crore. The company’s top-brass has said they would appeal against the decision.
Even in the US,  settlements between innovator companies and generic drug-maker are closely watched, precisely for the same reason – that they could delay the entry of cheaper drugs in the market.

Settlements happen for various reasons, explain industry insiders. Innovative companies sometimes settle with a generic, as the latter could have a strong case in marketing a less expensive version of the innovative drug (and this could erode the innovative drug’s market share).

And since litigation is expensive, generic drug companies sometimes enter into settlements agreeing to delay a launch as a survival strategy to prevent a hole in their pocket. Some settlement deals could also throw in other sourcing opportunities for the generic drug-maker.

They could provide the drug ingredients or even manufacture the drug for the innovator, after the patent exclusivity on the innovator drug has lapsed, say experts, explaining why  settlements are closely watched by authorities for anti-competitive practices that could go against consumers.

Landslide victory for Miro Cerar party (SMC)

TD
The main event last week was parliamentary elections that took place on Sunday 13.7.2014. Turnout was just over 50% which was the lowest turnout on record. The newly established party SMC under leadership of Miro Cerar achieved a landslide victory, capturing 34.6% of votes which translates to 36 seats. The second most powerful party is SDS which received 20.7% of votes or 21 seats. DeSUS came in third, receiving 10 seats. Newly established extreme left party, ZL, surprised as they received 6 seats. SD and NSi both received 5 seats while party of outgoing Prime Minister Alenka Bratušek received 4 seats. Surprisingly SLS failed to reach the threshold of 4% by just 200 votes. This might still change when all the votes from abroad are received. Given this results we expect to see formation of left coalition. We do not expect that privatization will be stopped but certain sale procedures like sale of Telekom Slovenija could
be halted. At the same time we believe that the chance of selling banks and insurance companies will increase.

SLOVENIA - EQUITY
Business and Economic News:

Under the direction of  EU Commission Krka will have to pay EUR 10m of  fine because it has allegedly violated competition law and delayed sale of the generic  perindopril. Given the amount of provisions formed (EUR 47.5m) and the actual amount of  fine, it can be expected that Krka will release some provisions in this year, which will consequently improve its profitability. Krka still believes that it has not violated the rules and shall file an appeal against the  EU Commission decision to the Court of Justice of the EU.

Gorenje signed an  agreement on a long-term syndicated loan approved by a syndicate of six banks. NLB, SID Banka, Banka Koper, Nova KBM, Abanka Vipa and Gorenjska banka granted to Gorenje a long-term loan of EUR 55m. The maturity of the loan is seven years.

Datalab successfully issued 250,000 shares in total amount of EUR 1.06m. New number of outstanding shares is now 2.12m.
Due to cancelation of treasury shares, share of Slovenski dražvni holding in Krka increased from 14.99%
to 16.2% and share of KAD increased from 9.86% to 10.652%.

French drugmaker Servier and five generics firms are facing roughly $580 million in  fines from European antitrust regulators over an alleged pay-for-delay scheme.

According to the  European Commission, Servier used technology acquisitions and patent  settlements with the other manufacturers to keep generic versions of its blockbuster cardiovascular drug Coveram (perindopril) off the market in what amounted to payoffs that violated European antitrust law.

TD
Regulators first announced an investigation into the patent  settlements last December. Along with Servier, the case involves Teva, Mylan subsidiary Matrix Laboratories, Niche/Unichem, Krka and Lupin. Each faces tens of millions in  fines.

Reached for comment, both Mylan and Lupin denied the allegations and vowed to appeal. Mylan noted that its subsidiary's alleged deal occurred in 2005, about two years before it acquired Matrix.

European regulators minced no words in their accusations, arguing that Servier paid the generics companies tens of millions to keep their products off the market.

Servier managed to maintain market exclusivity over the product until about 2007, four years after the drug's main patent expired in 2003, according to the Commission. To do so, regulators say Servier acquired additional technology patents to make it harder for generics makers to pursue their own versions. When competitors did propose their own version, Servier sued and later settled with payouts in exchange for a market delay.

The Commission emphasized that the case was not an isolated incident, but rather the latest in a concerted effort to scrutinize patent  settlements that may be anticompetitive. The overall frequency of such deals has declined, the Commission said. -- Bryan Koenig

HD     European Union: Antitrust - Commission fines Servier and five generic companies for curbing entry of cheaper versions of cardiovascular medicine

Section: General News - The  European Commission has imposed fines totalling 427.7 million on the French pharmaceutical company Servier and five producers of generic medicines - namely, Niche/Unichem, Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka and Lupin - for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's bestselling blood pressure medicine, perindopril, from price competition by generics in the EU. Through a technology acquisition and a series of patent settlements with generic rivals, Servier implemented a strategy to exclude competitors and delay the entry of cheaper generic medicines to the detriment of public budgets and patients in breach of EU antitrust rules.

TD
Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Servier had a
strategy to systematically buy out any competitive threats to make sure that they stayed out of the market.
Such behaviour is clearly anti-competitive and abusive. Competitors cannot agree to share markets or
market rents instead of competing, even when these  agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements.
Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers. Pharmaceutical companies
should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from
patients."

Perindopril is a blockbuster blood pressure control medicine and used to be Servier's best-selling product. Servier held significant market power in the market for the perindopril molecule as no antihypertensive medicines other than the generic versions of perindopril were able to meaningfully constrain Servier's sales and prices. Servier's patent for the perindopril molecule expired, for the most part, in 2003. Generic competitors continued to face a number of so-called "secondary" patents relating to processes and form but these provided a more limited protection to what Servier described as its "dairy cow". Producers of cheaper, generic versions of  perindopril were intensively preparing their market entry.

In order to enter the market and overcome the remaining obstacles, generic companies sought access to patent-free products or challenged Servier's patents that they believed were unduly blocking them. There were very few sources of non-protected technology. In 2004 Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic projects to stop and therefore delaying their entry. Servier recognised that this acquisition merely sought to "strengthen the defence mechanism" and the technology was never put to use.

With this way to the market cut off, generic producers decided to challenge Servier's patents before courts. However, between 2005 and 2007, virtually each time a generic company came close to entering the market, Servier and the company in question settled the challenge. This was not an ordinary transaction where two parties decide to settle a patent claim outside of court to save time and costs. Here, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for a share of Servier's rent. This happened at least five times between 2005 and 2007. One generic company acknowledged that it was being "bought out of  perindopril". Another insisted that "any  settlement will have to be for significant sums", to which it also referred as a "pile of cash". In total, cash payments from Servier to generics amounted to several tens of millions of euros. In one case, Servier offered a generic company a licence
for 7 national markets; in return, the generic company agreed to "sacrifice" all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its  perindopril there. Servier thus gained the certainty that the generic producers would stay out of the national markets and refrain from legal challenges for the duration of the  agreements.

It is legitimate - and desirable - to apply for patents, including so-called 'process' patents, to enforce them, to transfer technologies and to settle litigation. However, Servier misused such legitimate tools by shutting out a competing technology and buying out a number of competitors that had developed cheaper medicines, to avoid competing on their own merits. Such behaviour violates EU antitrust rules that prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - TFEU). Each of the settlements between Servier and its generic competitors was also an
anti-competitive agreement prohibited by Article 101 TFEU.

Experience shows that effective generic competition drives prices down significantly. The market entry of generic medicines reduces dramatically the prices of the medicine concerned and brings large benefits to patients and public budgets. In 2007, prices of generic  perindopril dropped on average by 90% compared to Servier's previous price level in the UK. This occurred when the only remaining legal challenger in the UK obtained the annulment of Servier's then most important patent. In internal documents, Servier however commented proudly on their "great success = 4 years won", referring to the expiry of the  perindopril molecule patent back in 2003.

The Commission based its fines on its 2006 Guidelines on  fines (see IP/06/857 and MEMO/06/256). In setting the level of the fines, the Commission took into account the duration of each infringement and its gravity.

Decision in Servier case

TD
Press conference
Brussels, 9 July 2014

Today the  European Commission has imposed fines totalling 427 million euros on Servier and several other pharmaceutical companies because they have breached EU antitrust rules.

Our investigation has shown that Servier committed an abuse by pursuing an anti-competitive strategy to delay the entry of cheaper generic versions of its drug  Perindopril. As part of this strategy, Servier entered into anti-competitive  agreements  with generic makers.
Let me first explain the facts.

Perindopril is a medicine developed by Servier to treat high blood pressure. It was by far its bestselling medicine. Yet, as of 2001, Servier faced increasing competitive pressure. The protection for the Perindopril molecule was gradually expiring across Europe, thus threatening the privileged position of Servier in the market. Generic makers were making progress towards market entry.

Servier tried to keep competitors off the market thanks to secondary patents - that is to say, patents which did not protect the molecule itself but other aspects such as the manufacturing processes of the medicine. To overcome this, generic companies relied on a new technology that would allow them to avoid Servier's secondary patents altogether. However, in 2004, Servier acquired this technology. Not to use it but only to prevent competitors from entering. As a result, a number of projects by generic makers were abandoned and market entry was delayed.
Some generic makers continued in their efforts to launch a generic version of  Perindopril by challenging
Servier's patents in court and preparing their own products. However, every time a generic company
came close to the market, Servier managed to enter into a deal to make sure that it would stay outside the
market.

Through these deals, Servier made payments to the generic companies against the certainty that they would not enter the market and refrain from legal challenges for the duration of the  agreement. In one case, the settlement was not based on cash payments but on a market-sharing arrangement with the generic company: Servier offered a licence for 7 national markets; in return, the generic company agreed to "sacrifice" all other EU markets.

The generic companies involved in these deals were: Niche-Unichem and Matrix (now part of Mylan), Teva, Krka, and Lupin. All these companies accepted to settle with Servier between 2005 and 2007. They were literally - to quote an internal document from one of these companies -"bought out of the market".

When, after five patent  settlements, litigation finally led to a first court judgment, the relevant patent was annulled. But Servier commented that this was still a "great success, as four years were won". Right after the patent was annulled, prices of generic  perindopril dropped by as much as 90%.

So for four years, patients and national health systems were deprived of the benefits of competition, meaning earlier access to a cheaper version of the medicine. The taxpayer throughout the EU largely financed Servier's monopolistic rents, which were partially shared with its generic competitors.

This is a serious breach of EU antitrust rules, and the companies have been sanctioned accordingly - with total fines of 427 million euros, 330 million of which should be paid by Servier.

These sanctions are proportionate to the infringement committed. They take into account, in particular, the gravity and duration of the infringement. And they also aim to deter other companies from engaging into the same type of anticompetitive practices in the future.

Throughout this term, the Commission has fought the joint attempts by certain originator companies and their generic competitors to share rents instead of focussing on competing and innovating. In June 2013 we have imposed sanctions on Lundbeck and other pharmaceutical companies for delaying the market entry of a generic antidepressant. In December last year we also imposed sanctions on Johnson & Johnson and Novartis for also delaying the entry in the Netherlands of a generic version of Fentanyl, a major painkiller.

As I said then and I repeat it now, these so-called "pay for delay"  agreements  are not acceptable. Today's decision draws a clear line on the ground, which will give the entire sector even more guidance on what antitrust rules do not allow.

It is of course entirely legitimate to apply for patents, enforce them, transfer technologies and settle litigation. But patent  settlements should not be misused. Engaging in an exclusionary strategy to foreclose important competing technologies and buying one close competitor after another is blatantly abusive.

Indeed, the patent system is designed to reward the efforts made by pharmaceutical companies to innovate and develop new and improved therapies. The benefits their laboratories bring to society are undeniable.

But the same applies to generic companies. They make sure that, once the patent exclusivity is over, less money is spent on older treatments and more resources can be steered towards new medicines. Indeed, both competition and intellectual property drive innovation.

Generics also give citizens access to more affordable healthcare, and they also help Member States to preserve inclusive and sustainable health systems.

This balance is disrupted when companies don't play by the book. In today's case, a company tried hard to unduly prolong its exclusivity. And it managed to do so not through innovation or the strength of its patents, but thanks to its deep pockets and in complicity with its generic rivals.

Such behaviour is prohibited in the European Union. When companies break these rules, they will be pursued and penalised accordingly. Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients and taxpayers.

A group of pharmaceutical firms has been  fined EUR 427.7 M by the antitrust authorities from the European Commission (EC) for hindering the market entry of the generic version of the blood-pressure drug Perindopril. The companies included in the decision are India-based Lupin, Unichem Laboratories' subsidiary Niche and Mylan's local unit, along with Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Slovenian Krka and Perindopril's French patent owner Servier. The drug's patent expired in 2003 but Servier allegedly paid settlements to generic competitors to delay the entry of cheaper generic versions
to the market. Majority of the fine shall be covered by Servier. Lupin was  fined EUR 40 M, Mylan EUR 17
M and Unichem almost EUR 14 M. The concerned companies intend to appeal the authorities' decision.

Click hereThe ECJ has dismissed Telefónica's appeal against the General Court's judgment that upheld the European Commission's 2007 decision finding that Telefónica had engaged in an abuse of a dominant position through the imposition of an unlawful margin squeeze. The ECJ confirmed that the Commission is entitled to apply Article 102 in regulated markets without it being necessary to demonstrate the actual anti-competitive effects of a margin squeeze. Further, the ECJ held that Telefónica could reasonably foresee that its conduct was abusive and the  fine did not breach the principles of equal treatment or proportionality. . .

Click hereThe European Commission has finedLes Laboratoires Servier (Servier) and five generic competitors nearly €427.7 million for practices that breached Article 101 and Article 102 by delaying the generic entry of the cardio-vascular drug  perindopril. The Commission found that patent  settlement       agreements  had been concluded between Servier and the generic companies which prevented or delayed entry of cheap generic versions of  perindopril contrary to Article 101. The Commission also considered that Servier held significant market power in the market for the perindopril molecule and had abused its dominant position contrary to Article 102 by inducing such settlement agreements  and by acquiring scarce competing technologies, which made generic entry more difficult. .

HD      The perils of pay-for-delay

In July, the  European Commission imposed fines of ^427.7 million on Servier of France and five producers of generic medicine – Niche/Unichem, Matrix (it is now a part of Mylan) and Lupin of India, Teva of Israel, and Krka of Slovenia – for “concluding a series of deals aimed at protecting Servier’s bestselling blood pressure medicine,  perindopril, from price competition by generics in the European Union”. The commission said that Servier, through an acquisition and a series of patent  settlements, was able to delay the entry of generic  perindopril “to the detriment of public budgets and patients” in breach of European Union competition rules.

TD
“Competitors cannot agree to share markets or market rents instead of competing, even when these agreements  are in the form of patent  settlements,” commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia said in a press release. “Such practices directly harm patients, national health systems and taxpayers.

Pharmaceutical companies should focus their efforts on innovating and competing rather than attempting to extract extra rents from patients.”

Lupin, which has been  fined ^40 million, and Unichem (^13.97 million) have said that they will contest the order in a European Union court. The ramifications of the verdict are wider. Patent  settlement is an emerging – and perfectly acceptable – source of revenue for Indian generic companies. A large number
of them have made successful patent challenges in the last few years. Some may be tempted to settle with the patent holder, rather than go through the process of launching the product, given the numerous instances of manufacturing lapses that have come to light in recent times.

The European Commission order shows that public sentiment is turning decisively against such settlements. Governments all over the world want to bring down the cost of healthcare. Generic medicine was supposed to be the way out: typically, the entry of a generic alternative brings the price of
the drug crashing down by 85 to 90 per cent. Some countries have allowed chemists to switch expensive medicine prescribed by the doctor with a generic variant if it is available. Patent-holding innovator companies were the villains in that narrative. Now, even the generic companies are getting tarred with the same brush. The portents are ominous for Indian generic companies.

This isn’t the first time that the European Commission has taken a negative view of the matter. In December 2013, it had imposed a fine of ^16 million on Johnson & Johnson of the United States and Novartis of Switzerland for concluding “an anti-competitive  agreement to delay the market entry of a cheaper generic version of the painkiller fentanyl in the Netherlands”. And in June 2013, it had  fined Danish drug maker Lundbeck ^93.8 million and a handful of generic companies another ^52.2 million for agreements  that led to delays in the market entry of cheaper generic versions of citalopram, Lundbeck’s blockbuster anti-depressant. One of the generic companies found guilty by the commission was
Ranbaxy, which was  fined ^10.32 million.

In the perindopril case, the commission has gone into some detail of how it works. Servier’s patent for the molecule expired, for the most part, in 2003. It ring-fenced the drug with some secondary patents but these provided limited protection to what Servier called its “dairy cow”, the July release said, and generic companies started preparing to enter the market. They had two options: use a non-patented technology to make generic perindopril or challenge some of the patents. “There were very few sources of
non-patented technology. In 2004, Servier acquired the most advanced one, forcing a number of generic
Page 87 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
projects to stop,” said the release. “Servier recognised that this acquisition merely sought to ‘strengthen the defence mechanism’ and the technology was never put to use.” In addition, Servier, between 2005 and 2007, said the commission, did at least five  settlements with generic companies that wanted to enter the market. One generic company acknowledged that it was being “bought out of  perindopril”, while another said that any  settlement will have to be for “significant sums”. Another generic company
was given the licence to sell in seven countries by Servier; in return, the company agreed to “sacrifice” all other European Union markets.
The generic version of  perindopril was launched finally in 2007. In the United Kingdom, the price fell by
90 per cent. According to the commission, Servier’s internal documents showed that it commented
proudly on its “great success = 4 years won”, referring to the expiry of the patent in 2003.

Even the United States Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has taken a dim view of such  settlements. It has challenged a number of patent  settlements in court on the ground that these are anti-competitive
and violate the United States antitrust laws. According to it, pay-for-delay deals, which postpone the entry of inexpensive generics, cost Americans $3.5 billion annually. An FTC study found that “patent settlements that include a payment delay generic entry by 17 months longer, on average, than those
that do not include some form of payment”. A January 2013 FTC release said that drug companies made
40 potential pay-for-delay deals in FY2012 (October 1, 2011, to September 30 2012), up from 28 in
FY2011. This was the highest ever since FTC started collecting such data in 2003. “More and more
brand and generic drug companies are engaging in these sweetheart deals,” the release quoted then
FTC chairman Jon Leibowitz as saying. “Unless this issue is resolved, we will all suffer the consequences
of delayed generic entry — higher prices for consumers, businesses and the US taxpayer.”
It’s time for Indian generic companies to rethink their strategies.

HD     CCI to scan drug patent settlements

Mumbai, Aug. 3 -- The country's competition regulator may examine details of patent  settlements being negotiated between foreign branded medicine companies and local generic drug makers as these agreements  may restrict the access of cheaper drugs to the sick.The cases which the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is likely to review include the patent deal between Swiss drug maker F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Cipla Ltd on lung cancer drug erlotinib, and the one between US-drug multinational Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp. (MSD) and India's Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd on a new diabetes drug called sitagliptin.

The antitrust agency will also investigate the market impact of ex parte injunctions secured by Swiss drug firm Novartis AG and MSD against a dozen local drug makers, blocking them from launching copies of diabetes drugs vildagliptin and sitagliptin, according to two people familiar with the development who declined to be named.

TD
CCI's decision to review these  settlements follows increased regulatory scrutiny of patent  settlements between brand owners and generic companies in Western countries. Antitrust laws in those markets are stringent and heavy penalties are being imposed on violators.

To prevent generic drug makers from getting regulatory approval for copies, branded medicine companies often pay generic firms to keep their medicines off the market. Drug companies can generate billions of dollars as long as a drug is under patent protection. Sales of those products fall sharply as soon as
generic drug makers introduce copies of the drug. While the  settlements may benefit the drug companies involved, patients suffer as access to cheaper medicine is restricted.

In the latest instance of punitive action against drug makers that had entered such  agreements,  the antitrust arm of the  European Commission in July fined French drug maker Les Laboratories Servier and five generic companies including the European subsidiaries of Lupin Ltd and Unichem Laboratories Ltd a total of 425 million, alleging that a patent  settlement among them delayed the launch of a copy of hypertension drug  perindopril.

There are more companies resorting to patent mediation in India now, although the trend is new to the country, Mint reported on 29 July.
Patent  settlements are not illegal. Courts can ask the parties involved to reach a mutual  settlement
instead of getting stifled in a prolonged judicial process.

The mediation between Cipla and Roche was actually prompted by a decision of the Delhi high court, which has been hearing the patent infringement case filed by Roche after Cipla launched a cheaper copy of the former's patented cancer drug Tarceva (erlotinib) in the domestic market in 2008. The
MSD-Glenmark talks to settle the patent infringement matter on diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet (sitagliptin brands of MSD) were initiated by the US firm. Glenmark launched generic versions of these brands in India in 2013.

These companies have been fighting their respective patent infringement cases in the Indian courts. An
out-of-court  settlement could give both sides some respite from the prolonged judicial process involved in
patent litigation. It may also impair access to affordable medicines, say legal and industry experts.

Page 89 of 93 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"They need to be examined on a case-to-case basis and the terms of the  settlement need to be made public. This is because the factors such as an unusually high payout to the generic drug maker in question to stay away from the market may tip the scales in favour of a funding of anti-competitive behaviour," said Shamnad Basheer, a patent law expert and former intellectual property chair at the National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata.
Such settlements should also be subject to competition law scrutiny, he added.

"The settlements between patent holders and generic companies generally involves mutually beneficial terms leaving the market and the consumer at a disadvantage," said a partner with a patent law firm in Mumbai.

In this context, CCI's intervention is important and should ensure that patient access to critical drugs is not compromised, said this consultant, who didn't want to be identified.

The other critical issue involved in the patent  settlements between the companies is the continued lack of clarity on the validity of patents, which were under dispute.

"Given that our patent jurisprudence is only developing now, it is critical that courts adjudicate these cases and outline clear legal propositions on patent validity and infringement," said Basheer.

Check Those Merger Control Obligations; Marine HarvestFined for Gun-Jumping

On 23 July 2014, the  European Commission (EC) imposed a fine of €20 million on salmon farmer and processor Marine Harvest ASA for acquiring its rival Morpol ASA, both of Norway, without having received prior clearance under the EU Merger Regulation.

TD
Marine Harvest had acquired only a 48.5% stake in Morpol. Nevertheless, based on established precedent, the EC considered that under EU merger control law this de facto gave rise to sole control over Morpol since, following the transaction, Marine Harvest enjoyed a stable majority at the shareholders' meetings.

Most merger control regimes around the world include a similar requirement for prior clearance. Further, EU merger control is far from unique in catching minority acquisitions. This case therefore serves as another reminder that companies must carefully investigate their merger control obligations worldwide before entering into a joint venture, merger or acquisition of shares or assets. This includes situations in which the acquisition is of only a minority interest.
Second Patent  Settlement Fine in the EU
The EC constantly flags the pharmaceutical sector as being high on its competition law target list. The
EC wants to ensure that EU consumers benefit from generic pharmaceutical products entering the
market and it is particularly focused on activities which restrict this. Other sectors should take heed, since
the EC's analysis of such activities has general application.

In its latest pharmaceutical case, on 9 July 2014 the EC imposed  fines totalling €427.7 million on Servier and five producers of generic medicines for concluding a series of deals all aimed at protecting Servier's perindopril product from price competition by generics in the EU. This followed the expiry of Servier's principal patent for the  perindopril molecule in 2003. Certain secondary patents had remained in force.

The particular actions condemned by the EC were a technology acquisition by Servier (designed to stop access by generic competitors to non-patented alternatives to the secondary patents) and a series of patent settlements with these generic rivals, which followed challenges to the secondary patents. Under these settlements, the generic companies agreed to abstain from competing in exchange for payments from Servier.

The EC sees such patent  settlements as being a type of  cartel. Making this point, the EC indicated that one of the generic companies acknowledged that it was being "bought out of  perindopril". In addition, according to the EC, Servier offered one of the generic companies a licence for seven national markets; in return, the generic company agreed to "sacrifice" all other EU markets and stop efforts to launch its perindopril there.

Although this was a pharmaceutical sector case, similar issues would apply in any other sector. Companies are of course able to apply for patents, to enforce them, to transfer technologies and to settle litigation. However, competition law concerns may arise where such tools are misused. The EC stated that "engaging in an exclusionary strategy to foreclose important competing technologies and buying [a] close competitor ... is blatantly abusive."

Compliance Warning; Commission's Wide Dawn Raid Powers Confirmed

The EU's highest court (the Court of Justice (ECJ)) has confirmed the EC's wide competition law dawn raid powers. Similar principles will generally apply to raids by national competition authorities in the EU. Companies need to be aware of these powers and to train staff appropriately since significant  fines can be imposed for failure to cooperate with dawn raids.

In a judgment of 25 June 2014, the ECJ confirmed that, when undertaking a dawn raid, the EC is obliged to indicate as precisely as possible the evidence sought and the matters to which the investigation relates. However, it is not required to define precisely the relevant market, to set out the exact legal nature of the presumed infringements or to indicate the period during which those infringements were committed.

This is justified by the fact that, since dawn raids take place at the beginning of an investigation, the EC by definition lacks precise information allowing it to make a specific legal assessment of the potential competition law infringement. It must first verify the accuracy of its suspicions and the scope of the incidents which have taken place. The aim of the inspection is specifically to gather evidence relating to a suspected infringement.
European Court Confirms Treatment of Margin Squeeze by Dominant Companies

The ECJ confirmed on 10 July 2014 the method established by the EC in a July 2007 decision for analyzing margin squeeze. Margin squeeze can arise when the price charged for an upstream input by a dominant company that is also active downstream using that input does not allow its downstream competitors sufficient scope to run a profitable business.

The case concerned Spanish incumbent telecoms operator Telefónica. The court confirmed that the EC had correctly demonstrated the existence of a margin squeeze with potential anticompetitive effects. In particular, the conduct of Telefónica was likely to reinforce the barriers for entry or expansion of competitors in the retail broadband market in Spain, which was downstream of certain markets in which the company was dominant. The court also confirmed the position that national legislation concerning telecommunications does not release dominant firms from their obligation to respect EU competition law.

The case is important for dominant companies that supply competitors downstream and for these competitors when dealing with such dominant companies, whatever the sector.
