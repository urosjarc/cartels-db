BRUSSELS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to fine a number of companies as early as Wednesday as it has concluded they took part in a power transformer cartel, sources close to the matter told Reuters.
A European Commission spokesman said the EU's executive could not confirm.

TD
Swiss engineering group ABB and Japan's Toshiba Corp among others, earlier confirmed they had received a statement of objections from the Commission.
Other companies that have received notices from the Commission included German industrial group
Siemens , Areva , Alstom , Hitachi , Fuji Electric .

"The Commission will very likely decide tomorrow about the  cartel fines", said the person familiar with the situation. Another source, also close to the proceedings, confirmed the plans.

Last year, the competition watchdog of the 27-nation European Union, said it had suspected a number of companies for alleged participation in a  cartel.

The Commission sent members of the group a statement of objections, known as a charge sheet, but did not publicly identify them.
The source would not give details on the amount of the  fines. (Reporting by Bate Felix and Illona

HD      EU hits power giants with swingeing fines for 'swanky' cartel

The EU has  fined seven big companies nearly a 100 million dollars for running a carve-up in the power generation industry through a "gentleman's"  cartel in "swanky hotels," Brussels said on Wednesday.
Penalties totalling almost 68 million euros (98 million dollars) were spread out between seven companies
-- ABB, Areva T&D, Alstom, Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba -- the  European Commission said.

TD
The worst offendor, ABB, saw its  fine increased by 50 percent to 33.75 million euros because it had previously taken part in a similar infringement, a statement explained.

Alstom and Areva must pay 16.5 million euros, with Japan's Toshiba hit with 13.2 million, Hitachi ordered to pay 2.46 million euros and Fuji Electrics told to shell out 1.734 million euros.
"The European companies agreed not to sell in Japan and the Japanese companies agreed not to sell in
Europe," said a statement. "The  cartel was organised through an oral 'gentlemen's agreement.'

"These self-appointed 'gentlemen' met in swanky hotels throughout Asia and Europe, from Singapore to Barcelona, Zurich to Tokyo, and Vienna to Lisbon, to carve up the European and Japanese markets between themselves."

Siemens also participated but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel in question to the commission.

Power transformers are used to control the voltage in electricity transmission networks.
"Customers and taxpayers all over Europe suffered from this  cartel for a number of years," said EU
competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.
"The commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'gentlemen.'

"The commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay."

The 'seven dwarves' was a term originally used to refer to tobacco companies in the United States that denied evidence that smoking was harmful to health.

BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union  fined three European and three Japanese makers of  power       transformers a total of euro67.6 million Wednesday for agreeing not to sell their products in each other's markets.
EU antitrust chief Neelie Kroes said their "gentlemen's agreement" artificially hiked prices.

TD
"Customers and tax payers all over Europe suffered from this  cartel for a number of years," she said. "The (European) Commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'gentlemen'."

Power transformers modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks.
The EU fined three European companies -- ABB of Switzerland and Alstom SA and Areva T&D SA of
France -- and three Asian -- Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba.
A seventh company -- Siemens AG of Germany -- escaped a  fine. While it took part in the
European-Japanese  cartel it revealed its existence to the EU executive, said Kroes.

She said between 1999 and 2003, the Japanese and European makers power transformers operated on a "gentlemen's agreement" under which the Japanese companies would not sell power transformers in Europe and the European companies returned the favor by not selling theirs in Japan.

The EU antitrust investigation found that each year executives of the seven companies met once or more often in chic hotels in Asia and Europe to reaffirm their  cartel deal.

"The cartelists went to great lengths to try to hide their illegal behavior," the  European Commission said in a statement. "They concluded the  market sharing  agreement orally and used code names for their companies to avoid detection."

Siemens (SI.N) is equipping two new submarines of the U212A type with fuel cell modules for
air-independent propulsion. The systems are ordered by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft GmbH (HDW).
Delivery of the two submarines to the Italian navy is planned for 2015 and 2016. This will increase to 30
the number of submarines plying the seas worldwide with a Siemens fuel cell technology. The order has a
volume of around 29 million euros. The submarines are being built at the Italian Fincantieri Cantieri Navali
Italiani S.p.A shipyard. By order of HDW, Siemens is delivering two PEM (polymer-electrolyte-membrane)
fuel cells each as core components of the air-independent propulsion as well as the associated
automation and control systems. The solutions and systems used are part of the Sinavy SUB solution
platform developed specially for submarines.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday fined six companies for colluding in the power transformers market.

Swiss ABB Ltd. (ABB), France's Areva SA (CEI.FR) and Alstom SA (ALO.FR) and Japan's Fuji Electrics Co Ltd. (9883.TO), Hitachi Ltd. (HIT) and Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) were all found guilty and fined for having put in place an oral  market sharing  agreement, where the European and Japanese power transformer makers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

TD
Germany's Siemens AG (SIE.XE) also participated in the agreement, but wasn't  fined as it had revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks.

The highest  fine was given to Swiss engineering company ABB at EUR33.4 million, because the company had participated in a similar  cartel before.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined six companies a total of
EUR67.6 million for colluding in the power transformers market.

Swiss ABB Ltd. (ABB), France's Areva SA (CEI.FR) and Alstom SA (ALO.FR) and Japan's Fuji Electrics Co Ltd. (9883.TO), Hitachi Ltd. (HIT) and Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) were all found guilty and fined for having put in place an oral  market-sharing agreement, where the European and Japanese power transformer makers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

Germany's Siemens AG (SIE.XE) also participated in the agreement, but wasn't  fined as it had revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks. They are mainly employed by electricity suppliers in their grids for the distribution of electricity to customers.

The highest  fine was given to Swiss engineering company ABB at EUR33.4 million, because the company had participated in a similar  cartel before.

"The commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay," said Neelie Kroes, the commission's competition commissioner.

Company representatives met twice a year between 1999 to 2003, usually in "high-class hotels" in places such as Singapore, Barcelona and Tokyo to reaffirm their agreement. The agreement was always oral and the companies used code names for each other to avoid detection, the commission said.

Areva's fine was reduced by 18%, to EUR13.5 million, for cooperating with the investigation. Alstom faces a EUR2.9 million  fine. Of the Japanese companies, Toshiba faces the highest  fine at EUR13.2 million. Fuji Electrics and Hitachi both received reductions for cooperation, paying EUR1.7 million and EUR2.5 million in  fines respectively, the commission said.

The European Commission imposed a fine of EUR16.5 million on Alstom, of which EUR13.5 million is on a joint basis with Areva T&D, a unit of French nuclear group Areva SA (CEI.FR), the spokesman said.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: U.S. stocks are expected to open on a positive note, as investors gear up for the start of the third quarter earnings season, said David Morrison, strategist at GFT. "There is no doubt that investors are not yet ready to cash in on the seven month equity rally to any degree," said Morrison. On the earnings front, eyes will be on Alcoa after the close.

At 1046 GMT, S&P 500 futures were up 2.05 points at 1050.65, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 3.5 points at 1704.25 and Dow industrial futures were up 15.50 points at 9672.50.

EUROPEAN MARKETS: European markets are lower midday, paring gains as oil and gas stocks weigh heavily. BP is down 1.8% after Royal Bank of Scotland downgrades the stock to hold. Additionally, basic resources stocks are turning lower as the temptation to take profits is too strong. Simon Denham at Capital Spreads added that in the absence of any meaningful economic data there is also a degree of apprehension ahead of the U.S. earnings season that gets underway today with Alcoa reporting first as usual.

London's FTSE 100 is down 0.2% at 5127.40, unable to push out of its narrow range as a lack of U.K. economic and U.S. economic data leave the index struggling for direction. Also, weakness in the
banking sector on profit taking dragged the index lower, with Lloyds Banking Group down 0.6%. Still, the index gets some help from perky U.S. futures and a healthy mining sector after gold hits new 2009
highs; Kazakhmys up 0.7% and BHP Billiton up 0.7%.

With the "FTSE continuing to trade above the 5000 mark, it seems that investors are willing to let this latest bout of recovery continue," said Anthony Grech, strategist at IG Index.

In Frankfurt the DAX is up 0.2% at 5666.63, with gains on Wall Street and hopes for a positive earnings season balancing out moves to consolidate gains, traders say. Metro down 2.5% on the back of a stake placement by major shareholder Otto Beisheim. Bilfinger Berger down 2.7%, holding up well in light of the rights issue, traders said.
In Paris the CAC 40 is up 0.2% at 3777.07

Bunds and gilts move higher. At 1025 GMT, September bunds were up 0.05 at 122.48, while September gilts were flat at 120.30.
At 1025 GMT, the dollar was down at Y88.07, the euro was up at $1.1.4725 and the pound was down at
$1.5890.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Several companies facing  European Commission antitrust  fines over a
power transformer cartel said Wednesday they are considering appealing the decision.

Swiss ABB Ltd. (ABB), France's Areva SA (CEI.FR) and Alstom SA (ALO.FR) and Japan's Fuji Electrics Co Ltd. (9883.TO), Hitachi Ltd. (HIT) and Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) face a total of EUR67.6 million in fines for an oral market-sharing agreement, where the European and Japanese  power transformer makers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

TD
ABB, which faces the highest  fine, said once it has the full decision from the commission it will consider its options for "appropriate next steps."

French industrial giant Alstom said it may appeal the decision once it has studied the commission's reasoning carefully.

A Toshiba spokesman said the company has cooperated fully in the commission's investigation, and maintains there was no infringement of European Union competition law. "Toshiba believes that the European Commission's conclusions are unfounded, and is currently considering appealing the decision," the spokesman added.

A Hitachi spokesman said it is reviewing the commission's judgment and it will consider whether to pay the fine or appeal it. Germany's Siemens AG (SIE.XE), which wasn't  fined because it had alerted the commission to the  cartel, said it had suspended the employees in its former power transmission group following the commission's 2007  cartel charges.
Areva declined to comment on the decision, while Fuji Electrics couldn't be reached for comment.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French nuclear group Areva SA (CEI.FR) said Wednesday it may appeal a  fine
for colluding in the  power transformers market, which European Union antitrust regulators announced
earlier in the day.

"Areva and its subsidiary T&D will assess the opportunity of appealing this decision," according to a company position received by e-mail.

TD
The European Commission imposed a joint fine of EUR13.5 million on Areva and Alstom SA (ALO.FR), which used to own the T&D unit.

Areva said that the practices being investigated by the  European Commission happened, and had ended, before Areva's acquisition of the unit in 2004.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

TD
BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined six companies a total of
EUR67.6 million for colluding in the power transformers market.

Swiss ABB Ltd. (ABB), France's Areva SA (CEI.FR) and Alstom SA (ALO.FR) and Japan's Fuji Electrics Co Ltd. (9883.TO), Hitachi Ltd. (HIT) and Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) were all found guilty and fined for having put in place an oral  market-sharing agreement, where the European and Japanese power transformer makers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

Germany's Siemens AG (SIE.XE) also participated in the agreement, but wasn't  fined as it had revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks. They are mainly employed by electricity suppliers in their grids for the distribution of electricity to customers.

The highest  fine was given to Swiss engineering company ABB at EUR33.8 million, because the company had participated in a similar  cartel before.

"The commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay," said Neelie Kroes, the commission's competition commissioner.

Company representatives met twice a year between 1999 to 2003, usually in "high-class hotels" in places such as Singapore, Barcelona and Tokyo to reaffirm their agreement. The agreement was always oral and the companies used code names for each other to avoid detection, the commission said.

The companies' agreements to divide the market "artificially hiked prices," causing suffering to their customers and to European taxpayers for a number of years, Kroes said.

Areva's  fine was reduced by 18%, to EUR13.5 million, for cooperating with the investigation. Alstom faces a EUR2.9 million  fine. Of the Japanese companies, Toshiba faces the highest  fine at EUR13.2 million. Fuji Electrics and Hitachi both received reductions for cooperation, paying EUR1.7 million and EUR2.5 million in  fines respectively, the commission said.

ABB said once it has the full decision from the commission it will consider its options for "appropriate next steps."

French industrial giant Alstom said it may appeal the decision once it has studied the commission's reasoning carefully.

(ADPnews) – Oct 7, 2009 – The European Commission (EC) has fined Swiss engineering group ABB (VTX:ABBN) EUR 34 million (USD 49.9 m) for running a cartel on the power transformer market.

ABB along with French nuclear group Areva (EPA:CEI), French heavy engineering group Alstom (EPA:ALO), Japanese electronics giant Toshiba Corp (TYO:6502) and Fuji Electric Group (TYO: 6504) will share the combined  fine of EUR 67.6 million.

TD
The EC said ABB’s  fine was doubled because it had previously been involved in similar wrongdoing.

The five companies were found guilty of having agreed to stay away from each others markets. German Siemens (ETR:SIE) also took part in the alliance but the EC did not impose  fines on it because it had helped uncover the  cartel.
ABB will look closely into EC’s decision before deciding to takes any counter measures, it said. (EUR 1.0= USD 1.468)

The European Commission is preparing to impose hefty  fines on household names such as Siemens, Toshiba and Alstom on the grounds that they participated in an illegal  power transformer cartel.

The decision could be taken today at the Commission's weekly meeting, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The size of the  fine will reflect the seriousness, duration and repercussions of
the alleged breach of the EU's strict antitrust rules.

TD
Regulators said last year that they suspected several companies of abusing the rules. Subsequent investigations are understood to have focused on Toshiba, Siemens, Areva, Alstom, Hitachi, Fuji Electric and ABB, the Swiss engineering group.

The Commission also confirmed last night that it had raided several pharmaceutical companies yesterday. It believes that they are preventing rival medicines from coming on to the market and are forcing patients and health services to pay artificially high prices for their products.

Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, gave strong hints last month that, after her department's recent investigation into the sector, she would be taking further action against the companies concerned.

Economics

The economy: The latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that GDP was flat during the third quarter, compared with the previous three months.

TD
Manufacturing output: The Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production had dropped unexpectedly during August, falling by 1.9 per cent on the figure for July, as factories shut down for the summer break and oil and gas plants closed for annual maintenance. Most economists had expected a rise of up to 0.3 per cent. The figures sent sterling tumbling to a one-week low against the euro.

Employment: The Recruitment and Employment Confederation and KPMG Report on Jobs said that the number of staff employed during September had increased for the second consecutive month.

House prices: Figures from Halifax showed that house prices rose during September for the third consecutive month, increasing by 1.6 per cent to an average of £163,533, spurred by increasing demand and a lack of properties for sale. Page 51

FTSE 100: London's blue-chip shares index rose by more than 100 points, closing 2.3 per cent higher, and gold hit a record high of $1,045, up by 2.7 per cent. Pages 49, 59

Australian interest rates: The country's central bank raised the cost of borrowing to 3.25 per cent, from 3 per cent, raising expectations that other leading economies would follow suit.
Banking & finance

Société Générale: The French bank has launched a ¤4.8 billion (£4.5 billion) rights issue to repay state support and fund takeovers, a week after BNP Paribas, its rival, made a similar move to tap its investors for ¤4.3 billion.

Jupiter Asset Management: Philip Gibbs, the group's fund manager, has increased his holdings in banks to their highest level in almost two years, reversing a bearish approach that brought in money despite the financial crisis.

Financial Services Authority: Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that Europe must co-operate in the creation of a common rule book if it wanted to make a success of regulatory change.

Aviva: The insurance group has called on the Government to abolish higher rate tax relief on pension contributions. The company, which has 2.25 million pension customers, believes the existing system of relief is too complex and does not encourage people to save for retirement. Page 54
Construction & property

Colliers CRE: The AIM-listed property company has raised £18.4 million from shareholders to ease its debt burden and ensure the company's survival, helping to secure 700 jobs. Panmure Gordon, the

adviser, said that the equity would help the commercial property consultancy to withstand the challenging conditions. The group's first-half pre-tax loss widened to £11.84 million, from £4.49 million a year ago.
Balfour Beatty: The Londonlisted construction group said that it had been named preferred bidder for a
£450 million Private Public Partnership under the Building Schools for the Future programme. It will build
and renovate schools in Blackburn, Darwen and Bolton in Lancashire.

Grainger: The property group and residential landlord, based in Newcastle, forecast that its fullyear sales would be up by about 22 per cent on last year. The company a\dded that trading profits would be below last year because of falls in house prices.

Hercules Unit Trust: The property fund, which is run by British Land and Schroders, has secured the approval of bondholders to restructure a £1 billion mortgagebacked security. The concession will allow Hercules, which invests in shopping centres, to refinance its assets in stages until the loan matures in
2012.
Consumer goods
Northern Foods: The maker of Goodfellas pizza and Fox's biscuits reported a 2.9 per cent increase in
first-half underlying sales, a slowdown from the 5.5 per cent growth seen in the first quarter and reflecting
a 7.5 per cent decline in sales of its frozen products. The biggest maker of Christmas puddings in the
country will launch a Christmas advertising campaign for its puddings for the first time this year as it faces
increasing competition from other brands.
Engineering

Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders: The industry body said that car sales had risen by 11.4 per cent in September, boosted by new registration plates and the Government's scrappage scheme. Page
49

Boeing: The American aircraft maker announced further production problems for its new generation of high-capacity 747-8 jumbo jets, as it said that it would assume a $1 billion (£628 million) charge against its third-quarter earnings because of design delays and mounting costs. Page 55

Vauxhall: Pat McFadden, the Business Minister, will meet executives of Magna International, the Canadian car parts maker, and Tony Woodley, the union leader, to try to force the new owner of Vauxhall to back down on plans to cut jobs. Page 50

Toyota: American trade officials said that they would investigate whether the Japanese carmaker had violated patents held by Bonita Springs, a US hybrid technology company, in the third-generation Prius and Lexus marques.

Economics

The economy: The latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that GDP was flat during the third quarter, compared with the previous three months.

TD
Manufacturing output: The Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production had dropped unexpectedly during August, falling by 1.9 per cent on the figure for July, as factories shut down for the summer break and oil and gas plants closed for annual maintenance. Most economists had expected a rise of up to 0.3 per cent. The figures sent sterling tumbling to a one-week low against the euro.

Employment: The Recruitment and Employment Confederation and KPMG Report on Jobs said that the number of staff employed during September had increased for the second consecutive month.

House prices: Figures from Halifax showed that house prices rose during September for the third consecutive month, increasing by 1.6 per cent to an average of £163,533, spurred by increasing demand and a lack of properties for sale.

FTSE 100: London's blue-chip shares index rose by more than 100 points, closing 2.3 per cent higher, and gold hit a record high of $1,045, up by 2.7 per cent.

Australian interest rates: The country's central bank raised the cost of borrowing to 3.25 per cent, from 3 per cent, raising expectations that other leading economies would follow suit.
Banking & finance

Société Générale: The French bank has launched a ¤4.8 billion (£4.5 billion) rights issue to repay state support and fund takeovers, a week after BNP Paribas, its rival, made a similar move to tap its investors for ¤4.3 billion.

Jupiter Asset Management: Philip Gibbs, the group's fund manager, has increased his holdings in banks to their highest level in almost two years, reversing a bearish approach that brought in money despite the financial crisis.

Financial Services Authority: Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said that Europe must co-operate in the creation of a common rule book if it wanted to make a success of regulatory change.

Aviva: The insurance group has called on the Government to abolish higher rate tax relief on pension contributions. The company, which has 2.25 million pension customers, believes the existing system of relief is too complex and does not encourage people to save for retirement.
Construction & property

Colliers CRE: The AIM-listed property company has raised £18.4 million from shareholders to ease its debt burden and ensure the company's survival, helping to secure 700 jobs. Panmure Gordon, the

adviser, said that the equity would help the commercial property consultancy to withstand the challenging conditions. The group's first-half pre-tax loss widened to £11.84 million, from £4.49 million a year ago.
Balfour Beatty: The Londonlisted construction group said that it had been named preferred bidder for a
£450 million Private Public Partnership under the Building Schools for the Future programme.
It will build and renovate schools in Blackburn, Darwen and Bolton in Lancashire.

Grainger: The property group and residential landlord, based in Newcastle, forecast that its fullyear sales would be up by about 22 per cent on last year. The company a\dded that trading profits would be below last year because of falls in house prices.

Hercules Unit Trust: The property fund, which is run by British Land and Schroders, has secured the approval of bondholders to restructure a £1 billion mortgagebacked security. The concession will allow Hercules, which invests in shopping centres, to refinance its assets in stages until the loan matures in
2012.
Consumer goods
Northern Foods: The maker of Goodfellas pizza and Fox's biscuits reported a 2.9 per cent increase in
first-half underlying sales, a slowdown from the 5.5 per cent growth seen in the first quarter and reflecting
a 7.5 per cent decline in sales of its frozen products. The biggest maker of Christmas puddings in the
country will launch a Christmas advertising campaign for its puddings for the first time this year as it faces
increasing competition from other brands.
Engineering

Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders: The industry body said that car sales had risen by 11.4 per cent in September, boosted by new registration plates and the Government's scrappage scheme.

Boeing: The American aircraft maker announced further production problems for its new generation of high-capacity 747-8 jumbo jets, as it said that it would assume a $1 billion (£628 million) charge against its third-quarter earnings because of design delays and mounting costs.

Vauxhall: Pat McFadden, the Business Minister, will meet executives of Magna International, the Canadian car parts maker, and Tony Woodley, the union leader, to try to force the new owner of Vauxhall to back down on plans to cut jobs.

Toyota: American trade officials said that they would investigate whether the Japanese carmaker had violated patents held by Bonita Springs, a US hybrid technology company, in the third-generation Prius and Lexus marques.
Health

GlaxoSmithKline: The Londonlisted pharmaceuticals group revealed that it had won a further 22 government orders for its H1N1 swine flu vaccine in the past two months, taking the total number of doses ordered to 440 million.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission Wednesday fined six European and Japanese companies a total of €67.64 million ($99.5 million) for colluding in the power-transformers market.

TD
Swiss ABB Ltd., France's Areva SA and Alstom SA, as well as Japan's Fuji Electrics Co Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. were found guilty and  fined for having an oral market-sharing deal in which the makers of  power-transformers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

The companies'agreements to divide the market "artificially hiked prices," causing suffering for customers and toEuropea taxpayers for a number of years, said Neelie Kroes the European Union's competition commissioner.

Company representatives met twice a year between 1999 and 2003, usually in "high-class hotels"in places such as Singapore, Barcelona and Tokyoto reaffirm the deal, said the commission, the EU's executive branch.The agreement was always oral and the companies used code names for each other to avoid detection, it added

Germany's Siemens AG also participatedin the agreemen, but wasn't  fined as it had revealed the existence of thecartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity-transmission networks. They are mainly used by electricity suppliers in their gridsfor distribution to customers.

The highest  fine was given to Swiss engineering companyABB at €33.75 million, because it had participated in a similar cartelbefor.

"The commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay," said Ms. Kroes.

Alstom and Areva were  fined €16.5 million, out of which they are jointly liable for €13.53 million. Alstom faces the remaining €2.97 million. This is because at the time of the collusion, Alstom owned the unit responsible for the infringement, which Areva then bought, the commission said.

Of the Japanese companies,Toshiba faces the highesta  fine of €13.2 million. Fuji Electrics and Hitachi both got reductions for cooperation, paying €1.73 million and €2.46 million respectively, the
commission said.

ABB said once it has the full decision from the commission it will consider its options for "appropriate next steps," while French industrial giantAlstom said it may appealthe decision once it has studied the commission's reasoning carefull.

A Toshiba spokesman said the company has cooperated fullyin the commission's investigation and maintains there was no infringement of EU competition law. "Toshiba believes that the European       

Page 47 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commission's conclusions are unfounded, and is currently considering appealing the decision," the spokesman added.

A Hitachi spokesman said the company is reviewing the commission'sjudgment and will consider whether to pay the  fine or appeal it. Areva said it will "assess the opportunity of appealing this decision." Fuji Electrics couldn't be reached.

Siemens said it had suspended the employees in its former power-transmission groupfollowing the commission's 2007 cartel charge.
Corrections & Amplifications

The European Commission fined ABB €33.75 million. Alstom and Areva were  fined €16.5 million, out of which the companies are jointly liable for €13.53 million, while Alstom faces the remaining €2.97 million alone. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that ABB's  fine was €33.4 million, Areva's fine was €13.5 million, while Alstom faced a €2.9 million  fine.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission said Wednesday it has imposed  fines totaling 67.6 million euros (99.3 million U.S. dollars) on six European and Japanese companies for their role in a market sharing cartel on power transformers.

Between 1999 and 2003, seven Japanese and European producers of  power transformers operated an oral market sharing  agreement, referred to as a "gentlemen's agreement" that the Japanese members would not sell  power transformers in Europe and vice versa.

TD
"Customers and tax payers all over Europe suffered from this  cartel for a number of years. The commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'Gentlemen'," said European Union (EU) Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The commission's investigation started with surprise inspections in February 2007. It found the seven companies _ including Siemens of Germany, ABB of Switzerland and Japan's Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba _ violated an EU ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.
Siemens was exempted from  fines because it revealed the  cartel in question to the commission. Representatives of the seven companies met one or two times per year, in Asia and Europe to reaffirm
their agreement. They concluded the  market sharing  agreement orally and used code names for their
companies to avoid detection.

It was estimated at the time of the infringement, the companies' combined annual sales in Europe was worth around 100 million euros (147 million dollars). Enditem

(ADPnews) - Oct 7, 2009 - Amid the lack of economic catalysts, the blue-chip CAC 40 index of Euronext
Paris closed 0.37% lower at 3,756.41 points today, after growing by 2.59% on Tuesday.

Investors were hesitant in the USA, as the third-quarter earnings season kicked off with agricultural products provider Monsanto (NYSE:MON) and membership-only warehouses operator Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Aluminum giant Alcoa (NYSE:AA) will be the first Dow Jones company to publish its quarterly result after the close of Wall Street.

TD
The CAC 40 opened at 3,764.77, reaching a high of 3,792.03 and a low of 3,748.93. Shares worth EUR
3.73 billion (USD 5.48bn) changed hands during the day.
Media and industrial conglomerate Lagardere (EPA:MMB) was the top blue-chip performer, climbing
5.02% to EUR 33.90.

Franco-US telecoms equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent (EPA:ALU) came second with a rise of 3.78% to EUR 3.186, pursuing its upward move after a rise of over 6% yesterday. Meanwhile, Natixis raised the price target on the stock to EUR 3.20 from EUR 3.

Aerospace group EADS (EPA:EAD) was third on the winners' list, gaining 2.30% to EUR 14.87. Its unit Airbus will soon announce a modification of its A320 aircraft series, with a view to reduce fuel consumption and better resist to competition, according to business daily Les Echos.
Banking stocks were the big losers of the day, with Societe Generale closing in the deepest red, down
5.94% to EUR 50.50.

BNP Paribas (EPA:BNP) was second on the flops side, retreating 1.96% to EUR 52.93. Franco-Belgian Dexia (EBR:DEXB) slipped 1.75% to EUR 6.111 at close. Credit Agricole (EPA:ACA) limited its decline to 0.68% to EUR 14.70. The bank may inject EUR 1 billion in Tier 1 equity in its Greek subsidiary Emporiki under a restructuring plan. The plan is destined to allow Emporiki to return to profit in 2011.

Steel tube maker Vallourec (EPA:VK) came third from the bottom, shedding 1.85% to EUR 113.80. It was followed by water and waste treatment company Suez Environnement (EPA:SEV), which dropped
1.84% to EUR 15.215 after Citigroup reduced its recommendation to "hold" from "buy", while maintaining the share price estimate at EUR 16.50.
Citigroup confirmed its "buy" rating on hotel group Accor (EPA:AC) and raised the share price target to
EUR 51.50 from EUR 45, sending the stock up 0.91% to EUR 37.67.

Luxury goods group PPR (EPA:PP) dived 1.18% to EUR 89.32 after announcing plans to list its subsidiary CFAO on Euronext Paris by the end of the year.

Retailer Carrefour (EPA:CA) inched 0.13% lower following a publication in daily Le Monde, that the group's intentions to sell its units in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia were serious. However, Reuters reported that a source close to the matter denied the information.

Heavy engineering group Alstom (EPA:ALO) lost 0.76% to EUR 49.43. The group was  fined EUR 16.5 million jointly with nuclear group Areva (EPA:CEI) by the  European Commission. The Commission levied seven producers of power transformers, among which the two French groups, with EUR 67.6 million for market sharing  cartel.

(ADPnews) - Oct 7, 2009 - The  European Commission (EC) has refrained from imposing a  fine on Siemens (ETR:SIE) in relation to a case about transformer market agreements, the German conglomerate said today.
Instead, the company was granted a state's witness status for its decisive role in helping expose the
cartel, Siemens added.

TD
EC has found out that agreements existed between 1999 and 2003 for dividing up markets among
European and Japanese producers of so-called high-power transformers.

After allegations were made in February 2007, Siemens launched its own investigations and suspended the employees at its former power transmission group and at an Austrian unit who were involved in the violations.

(ADPnews) - Oct 7, 2009 - German electronics giant Siemens (FRA:SIE) managed to escape a heavy
fine for having run a cartel.
Siemens and six rivals had made a shady agreement to stay away from each other's markets for
electric-power transformers over the 1999-2003 period. The Japanese companies had agreed to steer
clear of the European market, while their European partners promised to not sell any products in Japan.

TD
However, since the Munich-based company admitted everything and helped uncover the  cartel, it will escape a fine. After accusations were raised in 2007, Siemens had made its own investigation and had suspended workers involved in the scheme.

The cartel partners are facing  fines totalling EUR 67.6 million (USD 99.26m), the European Commission said. The highest penalty will be paid by Swiss ABB (VTX:ABBN), which will be fined EUR 33.75 million. Also Areva (EPA:CEI), Hitachi (TYO:6501), Fuji Electric (TYO:6504) and Toshiba (TYO:6502) will have to pay up for their wrongdoings.

Brussels, Oct. 7 (Jiji Press)--The  European Commission said Wednesday it has fined six Japanese and European firms including Toshiba Corp. a total of 67.64 million euros for forming a cartel to fix the prices of power transformers.

Of the three Japanese firms, Toshiba was  fined 13.2 million euros, Hitachi Ltd. 2.46 million euros, and the Fuji Electric Holdings Co. group 1.73 million euros.

TD
Switzerland's ABB Ltd. was  fined 33.75 million euros, while France's Alstom SA and Areva SA were given penalties totaling 16.5 million euros.

Germany's Siemens AG also participated in the  cartel, but it escaped punishment because it cooperated with the probe by the European Union's executive branch.
Between 1999 and 2003, the seven companies had an oral agreement that the Japanese and
European companies would refrain from selling  power transformers in each other's home market.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 7 -- The European Commission said Wednesday it will  fine a group of Japanese and European power transformer companies for violating the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.

The companies are Fuji Electrics Holdings Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. from Japan, Alstom SA and Areva T&D SA from France, and ABB Ltd. from Switzerland. Siemens AG of Germany also participated but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel in question to the Commission.

Between June 1999 and May 2003, the Japanese and European producers of  power transformers operated an oral  market-sharing agreement -- referred to as a ''Gentlemen's Agreement'' -- whereby they agreed that the Japanese members would not sell power transformers in Europe and that the European members would not sell power transformers in Japan, the commission said.
To confirm their agreement, they met one or twice a year, both in Asia and Europe.

The power transformers in question are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks.

''Customers and taxpayers all over Europe suffered from this  cartel for a number of years. The Commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'Gentlemen','' European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes told reporters.

''The Commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay,'' she said.
Fuji will have to pay 1.7 million euros, Hitachi 2.4 million euros and Toshiba 13.2 million euros.

As Fuji and Hitachi were willingly cooperating with the Commission and as they allowed them to use their documents in another case, they received 40 percent and 18 percent reduction on their  fines, respectively.

The fine for ABB was increased by 50 percent because it had previously taken part in a similar infringement and thus amounted to 33.7 million euros.

JAL firms move to cut jobs ahead of group's official restructuring plan

TOKYO - Two group firms of loss-making Japan Airlines Corp. have already carried out job cuts by soliciting early retirements before the airline officially decides on a restructuring plan for the group, sources familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

Japan's top airline submitted a draft restructuring plan to the government in September including the elimination of around 6,800 group employees, or about 14 percent of the overall workforce, over the next three years.

BRUSSELS, Oct. 7 -- The European Commission said Wednesday it will  fine a group of Japanese and European power transformer companies for violating the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.

The companies are Fuji Electrics Holdings Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. from Japan, Alstom SA and Areva T&D SA from France, and ABB Ltd. from Switzerland. Siemens AG of Germany also participated but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel in question to the Commission.

Toshiba said Wednesday in Tokyo that it plans to file a lawsuit with a European court to appeal against the Commission's decision.

Between June 1999 and May 2003, the Japanese and European producers of  power transformers operated an oral  market-sharing agreement -- referred to as a ''Gentlemen's Agreement'' -- whereby they agreed that the Japanese members would not sell power transformers in Europe and that the European members would not sell power transformers in Japan, the commission said.

''The Commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay,'' she said.

As Fuji and Hitachi were willingly cooperating with the Commission and as they allowed them to use their documents in another case, they received 40 percent and 18 percent reduction on their  fines, respectively.

The fine for ABB was increased by 50 percent because it had previously taken part in a similar infringement and thus amounted to 33.7 million euros.

Hitachi said in Tokyo that it will consider how to respond to the matter by examining the contents of the decision.

TOKYO, Oct. 7 -- ----------
EU fines Japanese, European firms in  cartel case

TD
BRUSSELS - The European Commission said Wednesday it will  fine a group of Japanese and European power transformer companies for violating the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices.

The companies are Fuji Electrics Holdings Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. from Japan, Alstom SA and Areva T&D SA from France, and ABB Ltd. from Switzerland. Siemens AG of Germany also participated but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel in question to the Commission.

By Bate Felix (Adds ABB comments, details, background and shares)

BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Six companies including Swiss engineering group ABB and Japan's Toshiba Corp were  fined a total of 67.6 million euros ($99.4 million) by the  European Commission on Wednesday for taking part in a  cartel.

ABB received the highest individual  fine of 33.8 million euros and Toshiba was hit for 13.2 million euros for agreeing not to compete in the  power transformer market in Europe and Japan.
The European Union's antitrust watchdog waived a  fine of 33.6 million euros against Germany's
Siemens because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

The fine for ABB was increased by 50 percent because it had previously taken part in a similar infringement, the Commission said.

A Toshiba spokesman said the Japanese company would appeal against the ruling, describing it as unfounded.

"We believe there was no infringement. We regret the EU did not accept our position," the spokesman said.

ABB said in a statement that it would carefully review the Commission's decision and consider its options.

"In connection with its third-quarter reporting process, ABB will assess what impact this decision and any other recent developments will have on those provisions and on its financial results for the quarter," the Swiss company said.

The firm announced in December last year that it had booked provisions relating to this decision and other compliance, tax, and restructuring matters.
"RIP-OFF"

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks.

The EU executive said that from June 1999 to May 2003, the companies operated a  cartel whereby they agreed to share the market between themselves, meeting one to two times per year in Asia and Europe to reaffirm their agreement.


Page 62 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The Commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'gentlemen'," European
Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

"The Commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay," Kroes said.
The Commission imposed a joint total  fine of 16.5 million euros on French firms Areva and Alstom. It
fined Japan's Hitachi Ltd 2.4 million euros and Fuji Electric 1.7 million for their roles.

Shares in ABB were down 1.45 percent at 1329 GMT and Alstom was down 1.21 percent, underperforming the DJ Industrial and Services index, which was 0.36 percent lower.

Siemens said that since 2007, when allegations about the  cartel were made, it had taken measures to prevent any such problems in the future.

"Siemens immediately launched its own investigations and suspended the employees at Siemens' former Power Transmission and Distribution Group and an Austrian subsidiary who had been involved in the violations," it said in a statement.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Producers of power transformers fined over illegal cartel

Brussels, 07/10/2009 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 7 October, the European Commission handed down total  fines of 67,644,000 euros to seven producers of power transformers for illegal market sharing.  Between 1999 and 2003, the European companies ABB, AREVA T&D and ALSTOM agreed not to sell their transformers in Japan, in exchange for a commitment on the part of their Japanese competitors Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba not to sell their products in Europe. The German producer Siemens was not  fined, even though it took part in the  cartel, as it informed the Commission of the cartel's existence. The  power transformers in question are used to modify the voltage electricity transmission networks, particularly long-distance high voltage networks and 220v networks which deliver power to consumers. ABB's  fine was increased by 50% as it had previously been involved in a similar arrangement.

TD
Action for damages - The Commission adopted an unusual procedure, in stating in its press release, which was published on Wednesday, that "any person or firm affected by anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages". The Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes has been trying for years to encourage European consumers to seek reparation from members of cartels, above and beyond the  fines imposed by the authorities. These damages are easier to demonstrate and to quantify for industrial products, such as in this case, than for consumer goods, as a smaller number of major transactions are involved. Additionally, the Commission has itself set the example by bringing a case against the lift manufacturer Schindler before the Belgian courts, in the hope of recovering the surplus price it is believed to have paid for the
installation of lifts and escalators in its Brussels premises, further to the discovery that Schindler had taken part in a cartel. For consumer goods, it is harder to demonstrate any losses suffered, and less
cost-effective for the individual consumer to take legal action. Ms Kroes hopes to remedy the deficiency in European legislation, by proposing a directive which would guarantee recourse for all citizens of the EU to their respective national jurisdictions. The proposed directive is still at an early stage (EUROPE 9991). (C.D./trans.fl)

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission Wednesday fined six European and Japanese companies a total of 67.64 million euros ($99.5 million) for colluding in the  power-transformers market.

Swiss ABB Ltd., France's Areva SA and Alstom SA, and Japan's Fuji Electrics Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. were found guilty and  fined for having a market-sharing agreement in which the makers of power-transformers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

TD
The deal to divide the market "artificially hiked prices," causing suffering for customers and taxpayers for a number of years, said Neelie Kroes the European Union's competition commissioner.

Company representatives met twice a year between 1999 and 2003 to reaffirm the deal, said the commission, the EU's executive branch. Germany's Siemens AG also participated, but wasn't  fined as it had revealed the  cartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity-transmission networks.
The highest  fine was given to ABB at 33.75 million euros, because it had participated in a similar
cartel.

Alstom and Areva were  fined 16.5 million euros, out of which they are jointly liable for 13.53 million euros. Alstom faces the remaining 2.97 million euros. This is because at the time of the collusion, Alstom owned the unit responsible, which Areva then bought, the commission said.

Toshiba faces a  fine of 13.2 million euros. Fuji Electrics and Hitachi both got reductions for cooperation, paying 1.73 million euros and 2.46 million euros respectively, the commission said.

ABB said once it has the full decision from the commission it will consider its options for "appropriate next steps," while Alstom said it may appeal.

A Toshiba spokesman said the company has cooperated fully and maintains there was no infringement of EU competition law.

A Hitachi spokesman said the company is reviewing the judgment and will consider whether to pay the fine or appeal it. Areva said it will "assess the opportunity of appealing this decision." Fuji Electrics couldn't be reached for comment.
Siemens said it had suspended the employees in its former power-transmission group.

The companies'agreements to divide the market "artificially hiked prices," causing suffering for customers and toEuropean taxpayers for a number of years, said Neelie Kroes the European Union's competition commissioner.

Company representatives met twice a year between 1999 and 2003, usually in "high-class hotels"in places such as Singapore, Barcelona and Tokyoto reaffirm the deal, said the commission, the EU's executive branch.The agreement was always oral and the companies used code names for each other to avoid detection, it added. Germany's Siemens AG also participatedin the agreement, but wasn't fined as it had revealed the existence of thecartel to the commission.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity-transmission networks. They are mainly used by electricity suppliers in their gridsfor distribution to customers.

ABB said once it has the full decision from the commission it will consider its options for "appropriate next steps," while French industrial giantAlstom said it may appealthe decision once it has studied the commission's reasoning carefully.

A Toshiba spokesman said the company has cooperated fullyin the commission's investigation, and maintains there was no infringement of EU competition law. "Toshiba believes that the  European        Commission's conclusions are unfounded, and is currently considering appealing the decision," the spokesman added.

Seven leading manufacturing companies - including the likes of Siemens, Hitachi and Toshiba - were on
Wednesday found to have rigged the international market for  power transformers and fined a total of
€67.6m ($99.7m) by Europe's top competition watchdog.

The European Commission said that, for a four-year period, Japanese and European producers of power transformers operating a "market sharing"  agreement, under which the Japanese companies agreed not to sell in Europe and the European firms agreed to stay out of the market in Japan.

TD
The cartel arrangements ran between 1999 and 2003, and were operated through oral deals hammered out in top-notch hotels across the world, from Lisbon and Vienna to Singapore and Tokyo. Code names were used to hide the companies' identities.

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks, and that the time of the cartel, the seven companies' combined annual sales in Europe were around €100m.

Siemens escaped any  fine because it was the whistle-blower, revealing the  cartel's existence to the commission. By contrast, the highest single  fine was levied on on Switzerland's ABB; it must pay
€33.75m, a sum which was increased 50 per cent because of the company was a "repeat offender" and involved in an earlier pre-insulated pipe  cartel.

Toshiba was fined €13.2m. Japan's Fuji Electrics must pay €1.73m, after also getting a leniency-related reduction of 40 per cent; Japan's Hitachi was  fined €2.46m and Alstom/Areva must pay €16.5m. The Hitachi and Areva  fines were also reduced by 18 per cent for cooperation-related reasons.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, stressed that the commission would not hesitate to increase fines for repeat offenders "until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay".

HD      COMPETITION : HIGH FINE IMPOSED ON POWER TRANSFORMERS CARTEL WC     400 words

The European Commission fined a cartel of seven European and Japanese manufacturers of  power   transformers a total of €67,644, on 7 October. The companies involved observed an oral agreement between 1999 and 2003, whereby the Japanese producers agreed not to sell power transformers in Europe, while European producers agreed not to sell in Japan. Market sharing  agreements of this kind violate the EC Treaty's prohibition on concerted agreements and restrictive commercial practices (Article
81). The Commission also identified the aggravating circumstance that the participants went to considerable lengths to try to hide their unlawful practices.

TD
Power transformers are used by electricity suppliers to change tension levels in electricity grids used for the transmission and distribution of electric power. The agreement therefore adversely affected not only the participants' direct customers but also European electricity consumers, ruled the Commission. At the time of the infringement, the parties' combined annual sales in Europe were estimated to be worth around
€100 million.

The decision to impose the  fines is "confirmation that zero tolerance is still on the agenda," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told the press. "Cartels add up to millions of euro in additional costs every year and reduce consumer choice," she explained, adding that "the Commission will not hesitate to raise the fines on repeat offenders until they understand that cartels do not pay".
The companies concerned are ABB, AREVA T&D, ALSTOM, Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba. Although
Siemens took part in the  cartel, it was not  fined because it blew the whistle, revealing the existence of
the arrangement to the Commission.

In setting the  fines, the Commission factored in the value of sales, the serious nature of the infringement and the geographical scope of the  cartel. It increased the fine for ABB by 50% because this company had already been fined in 1998 for its participation in another cartel. Siemens was given full immunity under the 2002 leniency notice. The Commission also took into account the cooperation of Fuji (40% reduction in the  fine under the leniency notice), AREVA and Hitachi (18% reduction in the  fine for their cooperation outside the leniency notice).

Fines (in euro):
ABB (Switzerland): 33,750,000
ALSTOM SA and AREVA T&D SA (France): 16,500,000
Fuji Electrics (Japan): 1,734,000

HD     Financial  Times Deutschland: Siemens admits forming cartel, escapes penalties

German electronics giant Siemens managed to escape a heavy  fine for having run a cartel.
Siemens and six rivals had made a shady agreement to stay away from each other's markets for
electric-power transformers over the 1999-2003 period. The Japanese companies had agreed to steer
clear of the European market, while their European partners promised to not sell any products in Japan.

TD
However, since the Munich-based company admitted everything and helped uncover the  cartel, it will escape a fine. After accusations were raised in 2007, Siemens had made its own investigation and had suspended workers involved in the scheme.

The cartel partners are facing  fines totalling EUR 67.6 million, the  European Commission said. The highest penalty will be paid by Swiss ABB, which will be  fined EUR 33.75 million. Also Areva, Hitachi, Fuji Electric and Toshiba will have to pay up for their wrongdoings.

HD         Settlement  on Microsoft competition case at hand Software giant's  remedies for browser concerns are likely to suffice,  E.U. says

BRUSSELS-- Recent concessions by Microsoft, including its offer to give European computer users a choice of Web browsers, appear to address European Union antitrust concerns, and cases against the company could be settled this year, the bloc's competition commissioner said Wednesday.

At a briefing in Brussels, the commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said that she had "good grounds for thinking we are moving toward a very satisfactory resolution" of the case concerning the way Microsoft bundles its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system.

TD
As for a second issue - the way other software brands communicate with Microsoft products - she appeared equally positive about reaching an agreement.

Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief lawyer, said in a statement, "Today's decision is a significant step toward closing a decade-long chapter of competition law concerns in Europe."

In recent weeks, European officials have been informally market-testing an unprecedented offer made by Microsoft in July that would give European computer users a choice of Web browsers when setting up the next version of its Windows operating system.

Microsoft has offered to tweak Windows so that users of new and existing Windows-based computers in Europe already loaded with Internet Explorer would get a ballot screen that would let them easily download other browsers and turn off Microsoft's default Explorer.

Users of existing Windows-based computers with Internet Explorer would receive an update prompting them to choose from among competing browsers, European officials said.

The proposal would also address outstanding issues about the way Microsoft systems connect with competing systems. "I am very positive about this initiative," Ms. Kroes said Wednesday.

Ms. Kroes said she would spend the next month conducting formal testing of the Microsoft offer with consumers and clients. She said she aimed to reach a "commitment decision" with the company by the year's end on the browser case that would be enforceable with  fines if Microsoft wavered in its compliance.

The case against Microsoft has resulted in Û1.2 billion, or nearly $1.8 billion, in  fines against the company since Ms. Kroes took office in 2004.

With her term to expire in less than two months, the next few weeks will determine whether Ms. Kroes wins reappointment to the  European Commission for another five-year term.

The chief obstacle facing Ms. Kroes is that her free-market party is no longer part of the governing coalition in the Netherlands.

E.U.  fines energy firms

The European Commission fined six companies a total Û67.6 million on Wednesday after concluding they had taken part in a power transformer cartel, Reuters reported from Brussels.

The E.U. watchdog  fined the Swiss engineering group ABB Û33.8 million and Toshiba of Japan Û13.2 million for taking part in a "gentlemen's agreement" not to compete against each other in Europe and Japan. The  fine was waived for Siemens of Germany because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

"The commission has now put an end to this rip-off by the self-appointed 'gentlemen,"' Ms. Kroes said in a statement. "The commission will not hesitate to increase  fines for repeat offenders until they have learned the lesson that cartels do not pay."

Power transformers are used to modify the voltage in electricity transmission networks.

ABB's  fine was lifted by 50 percent because it had taken part before in a similar infringement, the commission said.

The commission imposed a joint total  fine of Û16.5 million on the French companies Areva and Alstom. It fined Hitachi Û2.4 million and Fuji Electric Û1.7 million, two Japanese companies, for their roles in the cartel.

Toshiba said it would appeal against the ruling. "We believe that there was no infringement," a spokesman for the company said.

Siemens said that since 2007, when allegations about the  cartel were made, it had taken measures to prevent any such problems in the future.

Date Announced: 20091008

Siemens AG announced that in its decision on October 7, 2009, regarding the so-called transformer cartel, the European Commission refrained from imposing a  fine on Siemens AG. For its decisive role in helping expose the cartel, the Company was granted state's witness status. According to the findings of the European Commission, agreements existed between 1999 and 2003 for dividing up markets among European and Japanese producers of so-called high-power transformers. These transformers make it possible to change electrical current in order to transmit power over longer distances. After the allegations were made in February 2007, Siemens immediately launched its own investigations and suspended the employees at Siemens' former Power Transmission and Distribution Group and an Austrian subsidiary who had been involved in the violations.

ZURICH: Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB said Monday it expected to post one billion dollars
(670 million euros) in net profit for the third quarter after a significant cut in its provisions.

The group set aside 850 million dollars in December for likely costs from US and EU probes into alleged cartel activities, a tax dispute and asset writedowns. But it has now reduced the provisions to
380 million dollars.

TD
"ABB s provisions as at the end of the third quarter will be impacted primarily by changes in the provisions relating to alleged anti-competitive practices, including, but not limited to, the  European      Commission s power transformer decision earlier this month," it said in a statement.

The group was fined 33.75 million euros (50 million dollars) by the  European Commission over anti-competitive practices in the  power transformer market.

ABB added that its third-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be announced on October 29, would be hit by an increase in charges incurred by its business in Russia.

"As a result, ABB continues reviewing the situation and assessing its business model in Russia," it added. In July, the group posted net profits of 675 million dollars for the second quarter.

ZURICH -- Power-transmission and automation company ABB Ltd. said Monday that it will report
third-quarter net income of about $1 billion, as it sets aside less money than expected for a European
Union probe into alleged price-fixing.
The predicted earnings would represent a rise of about 7.9% from the $927 million in net profit that
ABB recorded in the year-earlier quarter.

TD
The Switzerland-based company said it will book a $380 million gain related to the reversal of a provision it made after the EU fined six companies, including ABB, a total of €67.6 million ($100.7 million) for alleged colluding in the power-transformers market. ABB received the highest EU  fine,
€33.8 million, because the company had participated in a similar  cartel before, the EU said.

But ABB said it will set aside more money to cover the cost of doing business in Russia. The higher provisions in Russia are linked to a continuing value-added tax dispute, ABB said.

"As a result, ABB continues reviewing the situation and assessing its business model in Russia," the company said in a statement.
A spokesman declined to provide further details about the Russian and the competition provisions. Analysts drew reassurance from ABB's statement, which comes ahead of final quarterly earnings,
scheduled to be reported Oct. 29.

"The announcement removes the uncertainty regarding the provisions related to anti-competitive practices and we see this as evidence of ABB's conservative provisions management," Bank Vontobel analyst Patrick Rafaisz wrote in a note to investors. He rates the stock at hold and put his 20 Swiss franc ($19.63) target under review pending forecast changes to account for the lower provisions.

Analysts said ABB's statement points to a lower-than-expected third-quarter profit from regular business, flattered by reversals on provisions, which analysts said aren't taxed. ABB shares were down 0.7% in midafternoon trading amid a higher broader Swiss market.

In the power-transformers probe, the  European Commission, the EU's executive arm, also  fined France's Areva SA and Alstom SA, as well as Japan's Fuji Electrics Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. The commission said the companies had an oral  market-sharing deal under which the makers of power transformers promised to stay out of each others' markets.

The companies' agreements to divide the market "artificially hiked prices," causing harm to customers and to European taxpayers for a number of years, said Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner.

* Ups provisions for Russian business
* Cuts provisions by $380 million overall, boosting Q3 net

* ABB sees Q3 net profit at around $1 billion
* Shares down, underperform sector
(Recasts, adds details, background, analyst comment, shares) By Katie Reid
ZURICH, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Switzerland's ABB is rethinking its business model in Russia and raising provisions there again as tough trading conditions and a tax dispute weigh.
The world's biggest supplier of transformers for electrical grids however also said on Monday that a
$380 million reduction in overall provisions will help boost its third-quarter net profit to a much larger
than expected $1 billion.

It was too early to say whether ABB would pull out of Russia all together, but the group was looking at all options, a spokesman for the engineering group said on Monday.

"The overall impact of the financial situation in Russia has had a triple-digit-million dollar financial impact on ABB over the past several quarters," the ABB spokesman said.

"Most of this had been provisioned for in previous quarters, but now we have to increase provisions again," he said.

Demand for ABB's products has crumbled in Russia with sales falling 50 percent in the first six months of the year due to a drop in spending on infrastructure in the recession-hit country.
Russia accounted for $1 billion of ABB sales in 2008, while the group posted sales of $35 billion. ABB also said it was having to hold back money to deal with a tax dispute in Russia.
"On the tax issue in Russia, we have been a victim of local circumstances. We have been left exposed to significant VAT and income tax adjustments," he said.

By 1210 GMT, shares in the group were trading 0.9 percent lower at 21.62 Swiss francs, underperforming a 1.6 percent rise in shares of French rival Schneider and a 0.5 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European industrial goods and services index.
Q3 NET GETS ONE-OFF BOOST

ABB said on Monday its bottom line would get a one-time boost in the third quarter as the group was able to cut provisions by $380 million after setting aside $850 million last December for charges linked to compliance, tax and restructuring measures.

The group is now forecasting a net profit of around $1 billion in the third-quarter, compared to analysts' average forecast of $571 million for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S and ahead of the $675 million posted in the previous quarter.
The company posted net profit of $927 million in the third quarter last year.

"This is clearly good news from the company, particularly as we had cautiously estimated that provisions could have to be boosted by a few hundred million dollars rather than lowered," Helvea analyst Alessandro Migliorini said.

"It would therefore appear that ABB is making good progress in cutting costs even though it is still at a relatively early stage of its cost-cutting programme," he said.

Earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Michel Demare told Reuters that ABB's cost-reduction programme could deliver more than the $2 billion in savings it is targeting.

ABB said its provisions had been mainly impacted by changes in the amount it had set aside for alleged anti-competitive practices, including the  European Commission's power transformer decision earlier this month.

The commission fined ABB, which sells power equipment to utilities as well as to oil and gas companies, 33.8 million euros ($50.43 million) for taking part in a  power transformer cartel.

ABB is due to publish third-quarter figures on Oct. 29. ($1=.6702 euros) (Reporting by Katie Reid; Editing by Hans Peters)

The European Commission on October 7  fined seven companies – ABB, Areva T&D, Alstom, Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba – €67.6 million in total for breaking EU rules banning  market sharing. Germany's Siemens was also involved but was not  fined as it was the first company to inform the EC about the illegal  market sharing  agreement.

The EC said that between 1999 and 2003, European and Japanese  power transformer makers had a "gentlemen's agreement" not to sell in each other's regional markets. The EC said it had increased the fine for Switzerland's ABB by 50% to €33.75 million because it was a repeat  cartel offender – the EC fined ABB in 1998 for being in a pre-insulated pipes cartel. The EC  fined Japan's Toshiba €13.2 million, Hitachi €2.46 million and Fuji Electrics €1.734 million. It fined France's Alstom €16.5 million, of which Areva T&D is jointly and severally liable for €13.53 million.

Power companies use transformers to control voltage on the grid, a key part of transmitting and distributing power to final customers. "Through the gentlemen's agreement, the cartelists therefore not only harmed their direct customers but also European electricity customers," said the EC. "At the time of the infringement, the parties' combined annual sales in the European Economic Area were estimated to be worth around €100 million, said the EC.

The European Commission fined a cartel of seven European and Japanese manufacturers of  power   transformers a total of €67,644, on 7 October. The companies involved observed an oral agreement between 1999 and 2003, whereby the Japanese producers agreed not to sell power transformers in Europe, while European producers agreed not to sell in Japan. Market sharing  agreements of this kind violate the EC Treaty's prohibition on concerted agreements and restrictive commercial practices (Article
81). The Commission also identified the aggravating circumstance that the participants went to considerable lengths to try to hide their unlawful practices.

TD
Power transformers are used by electricity suppliers to change tension levels in electricity grids used for the transmission and distribution of electric power. The agreement therefore adversely affected not only the participants' direct customers but also European electricity consumers, ruled the Commission. At the time of the infringement, the parties' combined annual sales in Europe were estimated to be worth around
€100 million.

The decision to impose the  fines is "confirmation that zero tolerance is still on the agenda," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told the press. "Cartels add up to millions of euro in additional costs every year and reduce consumer choice," she explained, adding that "the Commission will not hesitate to raise the fines on repeat offenders until they understand that cartels do not pay".
The companies concerned are ABB, AREVA T&D, ALSTOM, Fuji Electrics, Hitachi and Toshiba. Although
Siemens took part in the  cartel, it was not  fined because it blew the whistle, revealing the existence of
the arrangement to the Commission.

In setting the  fines, the Commission factored in the value of sales, the serious nature of the infringement and the geographical scope of the  cartel. It increased the fine for ABB by 50% because this company had already been fined in 1998 for its participation in another cartel. Siemens was given full immunity under the 2002 leniency notice. The Commission also took into account the cooperation of Fuji (40% reduction in the  fine under the leniency notice), AREVA and Hitachi (18% reduction in the  fine for their cooperation outside the leniency notice).

Fines (in euro):
ABB (Switzerland): 33,750,000
ALSTOM SA and AREVA T&D SA (France): 16,500,000
Fuji Electrics (Japan): 1,734,000
Hitachi (Japan): 2,460,000

Swedish-Swiss engineering group ABB posted a net profit up 12 percent at 1.03 billion dollars (699 million euros) for the third quarter, in line with expectations, it announced Thursday.
The third quarter profit compared with 927 million dollars for the same period last year.

TD
The group set aside 850 million dollars in December for likely costs from US and EU probes into alleged cartel activities, a tax dispute and asset writedowns, it said 10 days ago. But it has now reduced the provisions to 380 million dollars.

The group was fined 33.75 million euros (50 million dollars) by the  European Commission over anti-competitive practices in the  power transformer market.

ABB added that its third-quarter earnings would be hit by an increase in charges incurred by its business in Russia.
"As a result, ABB continues reviewing the situation and assessing its business model in Russia," it said. In July, the group posted net profits of 675 million dollars for the second quarter.

OPERATOR: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Alstom half-year results for the fiscal year 2009 to '10. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct the question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to hand over to today's Chairperson, Patrick Kron, Chairman and CEO. Please begin your meeting, and I will be standing by.

TD
PATRICK KRON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, ALSTOM SA: Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the conference call presenting our first half results for the fiscal year 2009/10; accounts from April 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009.

I would like to remind you that all the published elements, presentation, financial report including [SG&A], and accounts, as well as the press release are available on our website,  www.alstom.com.

I start on slide three, at a glance, and give you a few comments on the figures which were published this morning. Over the first semester, Alstom registered, as expected, a low level of order intake, notably as compared to the first half of last year, which, as you remember, was at an exceptionally high level; record level.

During H1 2009 and '10, the orders amounted to EUR7.1 billion, around half of the record level of the six months 2008 and '09.
The backlog, as you can see, remains high at close to EUR44 billion.
The sales, at EUR9.7 billion, increased by 8% on the back of the strong order intake over the last periods. Profitability also improved with an income from operation at EUR828 million, up close to 20%, and an
operating margin of 8.6%, as compared to the 7.8% recorded one year ago.
The net income, at EUR562 million, grew by 7%.

The free cash flow was slightly positive at EUR77 million, with the expected deterioration of the working capital linked to the low level of orders being more than offset by the sound operational performance.

If you go to slide four on orders, it's clear that the global recession impacted the order intake over the first half of this year.

Although the flow of medium and small sized orders resisted quite well, we experienced a strong decrease in the booking of large contracts. And only 10 projects above EUR100 million of sales were received during the first six months, which is to be compared to more than 20 a year ago. And most of them, as you have noticed, have been included in the first quarter of the current year.

The decisions are, why all this, quite simple. First, in Power Generation customers continue to delay their investment in new power plants, while order intake in Transport has been impacted by the phasing of big tickets.

As you know orders, in Transport are bumpy. As an example, we enjoyed a large order for regional trains in France, which is going to be booked in Q3. I will be very transparent. A few months ago, I was not really able to say whether this would be booked in September/October. And between us, for a project which is going to be executed over a large number of years, it's not highly critical.
Page 90 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But, and that's also important, we see a contrast between the low level of order intake and the tendering activity, which remains active. And, therefore, we expect, after the low point of the first half of the current year, higher level of orders during the second part of the year.

It's my duty to remind you that, by nature, forecasting orders on a limited period of time is difficult because, one, it's difficult to specifically say when it's going to be booked, but I'm expecting this rebound of orders.

Geographically, one can see that Europe has been dominant in terms of orders, with 58% of the total. Notably, with the booking of a [EUR1 billion] contract for a gas turbine power plant in the UK, two hydro orders in Switzerland, as well as the contract for suburban trains in Paris.

In North America, which represented 17% of the total orders, the main contracts registered were for steam and hydro retrofits.
South and Latin and Central America accounting for 7%, including the booking of a geothermal plant in
Mexico, as well as the urban transport contracts in Brazil.

Orders in Asia, representing 14%, include the booking of a number of a signaling systems, as well as air quality control equipment, boilers, and hydro turbines in India, etc.

Finally, Middle East/Africa region had no major order recorded over this semester and this is very different from what happened a year ago. Again, last year we had a concentration of large orders in this area.

If we move to slide five, you can see that despite the book-to-bill ratio well below 1 over the period, the backlog remains healthy. Obviously, slightly declining because of this book-to-bill, below 1. But it gives us
27 months of sales, which is a nice visibility.
Our order book is fully secured and we experienced no cancellation or no deferral from our solid
customers. And as I don't miss any opportunity, repeat, the proper execution of this large and good backlog
remains our top operational priority.

And you can see on slide six that the deliveries were under control, as illustrated by the good progression of both the sales volume and the profitability.

Sales increased by 8% as a result of the strong order intake during the past period and the good execution of the contracts.

And income from operation amounted to EUR828 million, up 19% over the first half of last year, with the operating margin, which as I already mentioned, growing from 7.8% to 8.6%.

Also in line with what was previously announced, in order to adapt to the more challenging market conditions, we have initiated actions to improve our efficiency and control our costs, as explained in slide seven.

The first effects of the short-term measures that we have taken allowed our general expenses, selling, and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of the sales from 7.4% over the first half of last year to 6.9% in September 2009.

On the HR side, instead of recruitment of 11,000 employees last fiscal year, which increased our workforce on the net basis by 4,500 people, we have adjusted the total workforce. And as you can see in this slide, it decreased by 2,000 persons over the first six months of the current year, with 500 by natural attrition, with less starters than leavers, and 1,500 by the non-replacement of employees with fixed-term contracts.

If -- concerning our portfolio development, and more specifically the acquisition of Areva T&D on September 18, which is not a real surprise, Alstom, together with Schneider Electric, made a non-binding offer. The sale process is going on. If successful, the transmission part, which has close links with Alstom's activity in power generation, should be transferred to Alstom, where the distribution part should be combined with Schneider Electric's activities.

As already explained, Alstom can bring to Areva T&D its expertise in automotive systems, its know-how in the management of large projects, and the full benefit of its worldwide network, which is mainly focused on utilities, and utilities being the primary market for high voltage activities.

Even if this is not the must-do acquisition, it could be a positive strategic move for the Group. We, obviously, will make sure that we offer the right price for this business.

Let's now come back to our operational review by sector and review the market and commercial achievements in both Power and Transport.

Page 91 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Let's start with Power on slide 10. I will not detail, but just summarize. Our view, again, the long-term market drivers remain favorable in the emerging markets. The recent downturn had a negative impact on the GDP growth and the electrical consumption, but they are starting to improve, notably, in China and India. And this positive trend, if confirmed, will obviously trigger new needs for short-term investment in Power equipment.

Developed countries, you know also that the ageing fleet would continue to benefit the service retrofit and replacement markets.

In addition, the stringent environmental regulation drive the need for clean power solutions, such as hydro, wind, and nuclear. And the growth of intermittent power, such as wind, necessitates back-up capacities, as well as highly flexible power plants. Again, demand is shifting towards higher technology contents to
ensure a better efficiency of thermal power plants, which is clearly good news for us.

As I previously explained, the -- and we move now to slide 11, the crisis impacted the level of orders in Power new equipments from an average of more than 250 gigawatts per year over the three previous year of 2006 and 2008. The market for 2009 is expected to drop to 170 gigawatts, due to the [non-world] revision of electricity consumption and the postponement of new power plant project by the customers.

However, because of the favorable drivers I just described, I think that the market should come back to a level of 220 gigawatts/240 gigawatts in the medium-term. You can see in the slide 11, I mentioned that
there are strong regional specificities linked to reserves, linked to availabilities, [it's core in] Asia, availability of gas in the Middle East. But overall, one trend which is clear is that the technology mix is increasingly diversifying. And that gives the companies having a large portfolio of technology a clear set for future successes. This is the case of our Company.

As you can see on slide 12, Alstom benefits from strong positioning in all countries and technologies. In gas, we are present in all regions, except in China where demand is extremely low. The future factory of Chatanooga in the US will allow us, as already explained, to remarket our GT24 gas turbines.

In coal, we have a strong market share in developed countries. The acquisition of Wuhan Boilers in China and the partnership with Bharat Forge in India will reinforce our presence in Asia, even if we face competition with local players.

In nuclear, as you know, we participate as a worldwide leader in conventional [islands]. We had successes in China with Dong Fang Electric, and we plan to move in India soon.
Hydro is the main renewable market, and it is where our presence is the most significant.
And in wind, our position is modest. We knew it when we bought Ecotecnia, and we intend to grow. Going to the orders on slide 13, it's clear that the orders were substantially down in the first semester,
particularly as compared to the record level of a year before, which included a large number of big tickets.

On the right side of the slide you have the list of the major successes registered by the three activities covering our Power businesses.

After the booking of a gas power plant in the UK, including five GT26 during the first quarter, Thermal Systems & Products did not record any large project in the second quarter, which led to a decline of its order as a comparison to last year.

Thermal Services enjoyed a nice flow of small and medium sized orders, notably in the US and in Europe for both retrofit and service. The decrease in order intake, as compared to the first six months of last year, was mainly due to the lack of long-term operation and maintenance contracts.

In Renewables, the main, [which is] OEM contracts, represented around [EUR400 million] in H1 of last year. So you see, this more than explains the difference. In Renewables, the main orders booked during the period were for hydro projects in Switzerland, India, and Spain, as well as for wind turbines in Europe.
Moving to the sales on slide 14, they are up in the three activities, driven by the strong backlog. Our [sales]
by geography, Europe accounted for the main part. Sales were mainly fuelled by turnkey projects in the
UK, Netherlands and Germany.

North America contributed as well, close to 15%, main contract traded including boilers in the USA and several contracts for environmental controlled systems.

The sales in South and Central America represented 5%, the main contracts being two hydro power plants in Brazil.

Page 92 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Asia Pacific contributed to 13%, with the major traded projects including a turbine island for a nuclear power plant in China, as well as a turnkey gas plant in Australia.

Finally, sales in Middle East/Africa accounted for 25%. Execution of major contracts in the Gulf, in Algeria, and Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia explaining this strong proportion.

On slide 15 you see the main P&L numbers. And I will not re-visit orders and sales, which were commented in detail in the previous slide, just a word on the backlog, amounting to close to EUR25 billion, and representing close to two years of sales.

Profitability increased by 17% [a year] from EUR581 million to EUR677 million, leading to an operating margin up from 9.2% to 9.8%. This increase is driven by the combination of a healthy backlog, focus on project execution, and proper cost control.

Slide 16 gives you some details about the CapEx, which are slightly up as compared to last year. This increase came from the progress made on several investment programs, which were previously initiated and are ongoing.

The extension of the foundry in Poland which was unveiled last June and which gives us more independence for the casting of our main products. Following the acquisition of one boiler, a new factory was built to relocate the old facilities; its inauguration is planned in the next days.

The construction in the USA of a facility in Chatanooga in order to manufacture gas and steam turbines, both of thermal and nuclear plants, it will be, as announced, operational mid-2010, and will gradually ramp-up, obviously, at a speed in line with the commercial needs.

These investments need to be completed. And obviously, at the same time, the future project will be strictly prioritized.

In terms of R&D, just a focus on a few items which are important. We have 10 prototypes on CO2 capture. One of them will be unveiled, I think it's tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, in the USA. This will be the first one with the storage of CO2 on site.

We recently signed an agreement with Clean Current Power Systems to enter a new renewable market based on ocean current technology. The commercialization of these first tidal projects should start in 2012.
Finally, the marketing of a new Eco100 wind turbines continue with a power output of 3 megawatt. The
[Eco100] is our most powerful onshore wind turbine on the market.

Moving to Transport on slide 17, well, this reminds you that (inaudible), congestion of road and air and increased need for mobility should continue to pledge for environmentally-friendly mass transportation needs, such as metro, tramways, inter-city, regional, and high speed trains.

By geography, demand now goes beyond traditionally open market, where the priority is on the cleaner transportation solutions, and is now extending to emerging countries' requirements; China, India, but also North Africa, a number of South American countries, etc. We, therefore, expect the market to remain sustained. Notably, driven in the short-term by the stimulus packages put in place in a number of countries.

You see on slide 18 that Alstom is well placed to capture growth in all areas thanks to its complete portfolio, which includes all types of rolling stock. Rolling stock is 60% of our Transport sales; signaling,
15% to 20%; services, 15% to 20% as well; and infrastructure, around 5%.

A good positioning in each of the segments; number one in high speed, very high speed; active in metro construction; one of the four tramway ones; one of the [three], etc., etc.; as well as our worldwide presence, which is also a stronger set to benefit from this growth across the board.
Slide 19 details the order intake in Transport, which also decreased over the six months. Then the reason, I
would say, is more arithmetic. If I may say, this is due to the phasing of large tickets.

We had much less such big projects in H1 this year than last year. Just as an illustration, I remind you that H1 of last year included the booking of a EUR2 billion maintenance contract in the UK, which will cover a number of years. But this was a EUR2 billion contract so, obviously we didn't get the equivalent contract over the same period, And this EUR2 billion explains a major part of the difference recorded between this record level of 2008/09 and the level of this year.

During the first semester of this year, the main project registered were for suburban trains in Paris, tramways and metros in South America, regional trains in Europe, as well as various signaling systems. The contract that we just booked for regional trains in France will, obviously, be recorded in Q3.

Looking at the sales in Transport during the first half of 2009 and '10, on slide 20 you see that these sales reached EUR2.8 billion. Up; they are progressively ramping up.

If you look by geographies, Europe represents the bulk of Transport sales at around two-thirds of the total sales. The main contract traded during the first half included the delivery of TGVs in France, metros in France/in Spain, regional trains France and Germany, as well as signaling contracts in Italy.

North America accounted for 14%, with an increased trading of the New York metro contract, and a ramp-up in the supply of the metro system in Mexico.

In South America, 5% of the total sales, progress was achieved on the delivery of metros for the Sao Paulo network.

The main contract traded in Asia Pacific, representing 8% of Transport sales, were the Extrapolis metro in Australia, as well as rolling stocks, signaling -- sorry, locomotives, train locos, and transport -- passenger transportation in China.
Finally, sales in the Middle East/Africa, accounting for 5%, included the progressive delivery of tramways in
Algeria and Turkey, as well as locomotives in Morocco.

If we move to slide 21, I will not go back as well to orders and sales. Just remind you that the backlog remains high at EUR19 billion, which is just a modest 3.5 years of sales; profitability increased by 11%; with an income from operation up from EUR176 million to EUR195 million; leading to an operating margin of 9% (sic - see press release).

On slide 22, you can see that the CapEx in Transport were more or less stable as compared to the first half of last year. Over the period, some upgrades and expansion of the [operating] manufacturing base for very high speed tramways and components were conducted, notably in France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.

R&D in Transport are mainly focused on innovation in rolling stock. Over the summer 2009, the AGV completed a series of tests in the Czech Republic. A final round of trials will take place in Italy for the finalization of the homologation process for the Italian network.

In June 2009, we also unveiled the Prima II locomotive prototype before it transferred to Germany for running tests.

Now I hand over to Henri Poupart-Lafarge for the detailed explanations of the financial results published today. Thank you.

HENRI POUPART-LAFARGE, CFO, ALSTOM SA: Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let's first review the P&L on slide 24.

As you can see, the net income increased from EUR527 million to EUR562 million, a 7% increase over the period. Sales were up 8%, and income from operations up 19%. And this has been commented by Patrick, so I will not come back to it.

Below the income from operations line, you have, first, the increase in restructuring costs, from EUR13 million (sic - see press release) to EUR27 million (sic - see press release), which is obviously related to the optimization of our initial base, both in Power and Transport.

We mentioned in the past that the restructuring level for the full-year was between EUR50 million up to EUR100 million for the full-year. It's fair to recognize that the number will slightly increase in the coming period as we are optimizing our global base to take into account the new economic environment.

Below that, you have the capital gain and others, which is moving from plus EUR2 million to minus EUR19 million. And you have in this number the fine from the European Commission on the power transformer cartel, or the alleged power transformer cartel.
On the EBIT, overall is increasing by 14%, from EUR686 million to EUR782 million.

The financial results turned negative, from EUR19 million to a negative number of EUR12 million. This is despite, I would say, our strong net cash position. But this is on the back of a very low interest rate on our gross cash and a negative impact of our pensions and underfunding.
The tax result is globally in line with our expectations, with an effective tax rate around 26%. Overall, again, our net income was up 7%, from EUR527 million to EUR562 million.
Let's move now to slide 25 for the free cash flow, which stands globally at EUR77 million.

Page 94 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Classical items below the income from operations, restructuring cash-out at EUR38 million, in line with last year's level.

Depreciation increasing to EUR131 million, as CapEx has been higher than depreciation over the recent periods.

Capital expenditure has been up by 8%, as compared to the same period of last year, and this has been commented by Patrick. It's lower than the second half of last year, obviously.

Amortization of intangible had a slight negative impact on our cash flow of EUR23 million as we start to capitalize on the CO2 demo plants.
Pensions; slightly decreasing.
But the main item is obviously the working capital change, which is clearly correlated to the book-to-bill, as
I had numerous occasions to illustrate. And if you look on the graph on the right-hand side, you see that the
book-to-bill, which is during this first half much below 1 at 0.74, explains broadly this working capital
change.

Although, as you know, our cash is bumpy and we cannot predict precisely what will be the level of working capital, broadly, it's correlated to this book-to-bill. And this was the case in the second half of last year, and this is the case in the first half of this year.
Thanks to our tax shield, we have a cash tax-out -- tax cash-out, sorry, which is much lower than our P&L
charge, which stands at just below EUR100 million.
The financial cash-out is more or less at zero, as the pension charges, which I was commenting on the
P&L, are non-cash items.

So, altogether, a cash flow -- free cash flow, which has remained positive at EUR77 million. And we do expect -- we continue to expect a positive free cash flow for the full-year.

Moving on to slide 26, you can see here the evolution of our net cash and our equity. There has been no extraordinary items. And, therefore, I would say, despite a low level of free cash flow of EUR77 million and a dividend payment of EUR323 million, we keep a very strong net cash position at close to EUR1.9 billion, versus EUR2.1 billion at March 31, 2009.

The equity has also increased from EUR2.9 billion to EUR3.1 billion. And this is on the back of the positive net income of EUR562 million, partially offset by the dividend payment of EUR323 million, and a slight negative impact of our pensions underfunding.

Just a word on pensions. The assets have increased in line with a good financial market recovery from end of March to end of September, while the liabilities of DBO has increased as interest rates were going down. These two impacts have offset well each other and, therefore, the net effect is extremely small.

Just to conclude our presentations, I would say that, first, Alstom remains focused on execution of its backlog. It has always been a priority for Alstom and will continue to be the case in the coming period. But
in the meantime, we have started to implement measures to adapt ourselves [on full] costs and develop our flexibility to adapt again to the new economic environment.

After the weak level of order intake during the first half, the current, I would say, active tendering activity should lead to a rebound of orders in the second semester, although, again, even though the timing of these large orders is by definition uncertain.

So, thanks to the strong operational performance achieved in the first half, Alstom -- we confirm our guidance for the full-year that the operating margin of the Group should reach around 9%, with an operating margin for the Power sector between 10% and 11%, and for the Transport sector between 7% and 8%.

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention. The next publication of our accounts -- the next publication are on January 14, 2010. And we are happy now to answer to your questions, Patrick and I. Thank you very much.
Patrick and I, and obviously Emmanuelle; the three of us are at your disposal to answer questions. OPERATOR: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of James
Stettler. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.


Page 95 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JAMES STETTLER, ANALYST, NEW STREET RESEARCH: Thank you and good morning. It's James Stettler from New Street. Two questions, please. We hear from certain utilities they're waiting for prices of power components to come down before ordering. Can you talk a bit about the pricing dynamics and your discussions, and also how the emerging players are behaving in this environment?

And then secondly, your big push into the US market, could you highlight how you're positioning the GT24, and what kind of market share you hope to achieve in the medium-term?

PATRICK KRON: No, James, the two questions which I will not be able to give you the details I like. But I want to say, first of all, on the prices, unfortunately, we have not recorded such a high level of orders to give you a statistical study, unfortunately.

But what we -- that the customers expect price decline is a fact. If I were them I would probably say that I'm expecting price decline. For us, the question is to see where the prices will be versus the level of the supply chain. As you know, we have not on-the-shelf equipment so we need on a case-by-case basis to check whether it meets our targets or not.

So what the competitors have been saying, and I just take that as a fact, is that they consider that the price are holding. So we see, we have no element to say, you know that in the growing trend we had -- where supply chain was the prices -- the costs of the supply chain were increasing, we were able to pass it through.

It's fair to say that when we bid today with lower component prices, we reflect that in the pricing. But it doesn't mean per se that the margins will be pinched. We are going to see. But I have no reason to make a warning today on price declines. It's not because a utility is saying that it hopes or expects that's going to decline, that it will.

On the GT24, you know that we have been focusing on our upgraded machine on the 50 hertz for the simple reason that this was the main market available, and that we had the appropriate industrial base to address it. It was not a good idea to go on the GT24 market without the proper base. Chatanooga gives us this proper base, so coming from a zero market share, you will recognize with [uni] that there is more upside than downside.

This being said, I have not fixed a guidance on the percentage that we want to achieve. We will have opportunities and we'll see where it goes. I cannot give you a kind of early signal on whether we'll be at x or y percent.
Other question?

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of William Mackie. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

WILLIAM MACKIE, ANALYST, MAINFIRST BANK: It's William Mackie from MainFirst Bank. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Two. Firstly, on Power, you talk of the importance of technology mix within the Power portfolio and highlighted some of your weakness in wind, but your intention to grow in that sector. Could you perhaps describe your plans?

Is it sufficient to grow organically with the new product portfolios you have onshore? Or do you think you need to make acquisitive growth to develop both the portfolio and the geographic footprint?

And secondly, on the Transportation and Distribution business of Areva, perhaps you could just highlight some of the thoughts of your preferred methods of funding should your bid be agreed. And how you would see -- following your due diligence in the data room, how you would see the revenues split, or the ownership of revenues split between yourself and Schneider. Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: On the first one, concerning the wind strategy, it's clear that we have a clear position that we have initiated with Ecotecnia, which is a small starting one. So we represent between 1% and 2% of the global market.
It's fair to say that our intention is to grow this business. This business will -- it's difficult coming from 1% to
2% to go into the sky, so we'll see. Our strategy is in wind, as elsewhere, we grow organically. But we will
see if there are opportunities to make step-changes based on this organic -- on the top of this organic
growth. Today, we have no specific plans to announce. If there is an opportunity, we'll talk in due time.

Concerning the T&D offer, look, I am not going to give you any specific clue in relation with the price, neither in relation to the split between T&D -- within T&D between Areva and Alstom.



Page 96 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In terms of profitability, the Transmission business is historically more profitable than the Distribution one. So in terms of split, when you talk of value you have both in value from the Distribution part than its part of the sales. So I would say this is just reflecting the relative profitability of the Transmission versus the Distribution. So beyond that, we'll see.

Concerning the financing, I mentioned that we have substantial firing power through our cash in hand, through the available credit lines. You have seen that we have raised the EUR500 million with good conditions, without any difficulty. And this was massively over subscribed, so we'll see everything in all. But I think it will be recognized that we have substantial firing power, and this gives us some -- we are quite relaxed on this field.
WILLIAM MACKIE: Thank you.
PATRICK KRON: Thank you very much. Next question?

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Carter. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

ANDREW CARTER, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Yes, good morning. Its Andrew Carter calling from Macquarie in London. I had two questions, please. I guess, first of all, on the guidance regarding orders and your suggestion there should be some rebound in the second half, does that confidence relate mostly to Transport? Or are you also seeing some interesting enquiries coming through on the Thermal side as well?

And I guess my second question related to the working capital trends that you've seen. When I look back at the balance sheet item net working capital over the last few years, that has increased as a negative
number up to [EUR6.3 billion] most recently in March, but it was much lower, at something like [EUR4.6 billion], just a couple of years ago.

Does that mean that we could actually see that net working capital, the negative net working capital come down by another EUR1.2 billion over the next several periods? Or is that too simplistic a way of looking at it? Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: Okay, thank you, Andrew. On the rebound, again, let's review the -- let's spend a couple of seconds on that again. You know I am extremely reluctant, and will remain, to give specific guidance on orders which are booked on the period of three or six months, just because it's quite impossible -- it's very difficult and quite impossible, I believe, to know specifically when the projects will come out.

My message is -- and this is just to make it clear, this is true for Power, my message is that when you look at the Power situation, the orders have been low over the period while, by contrast, the commercial activity has been sustained.

In other terms, there have been a lot of enquiries, there have been a lot of tenders in which we are preparing ourselves that we are answering that are under review. It's fair to say that this has been lasting for a while. And that we have seen over the last six months that the pipeline was active but projects were not getting out of the pipeline.

Our sales people are confident that it's boiling a little bit, and we should expect that at last some projects will no more be postponed and will come onstream. So our -- that's the basis of our statement.

Due to this commercial activity, due to this high tendering activity, we expect ideas to turn into projects, and projects into contracts. And again with the disclaimer on the difficulty to make forecasts in this matter by definition volatile, we definitely consider that we'll get a rebound from this low level on Power, as well [as
on] Transport; for Transport it been very different reason.

Again, you know when you look at our history of order intake then, in additional to the normal flow, we have some big tickets. It happened, I gave the example of the maintenance contract last year, that last year we got a lot; this year less. So now the regional trains is stepping in. We expect others to come.

So we expect that in Transport as well there will be a rebound compared to the first half. So we are talking not specifically on Transport, but on both Power and Transport. And again, it's difficult to say will it be in Q3, will it be in Q4. We don't know. I'm not -- it's very difficult to forecast in detail.
Concerning the working capital, Henri, maybe you want to address?

HENRI POUPART-LAFARGE: Concerning the working capital, yes, we had a very strong improvement of our working capital over the last years. And obviously, as you have seen over the last half, this working capital has deteriorated.

Page 97 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As I said, this is in line with the evolution of our order intake and our order backlog. So, the answer to your question is really depending on your view of our activity, which we may not share.

If you believe that our activity will go back to the level where it was two to three years ago, yes, mechanically the working capital will deteriorate back to this kind of level. But this is not at all our assumptions. And, therefore, if the order intake rebounds as I expected and activity does not go down but just plateau and then increase again, the working capital will at least be sustained, and then further improving in the future. This is a general trend.

Then as a, I would say, safe-harbor, I would say that the working is lumpy, as you know, in our activity. So don't come back to me with a variation of EUR100 million or EUR150 million over a period. But the global trend is that it follows a global trend of our activity and our commercial activity in the coming period.

PATRICK KRON: That's clear, and that obviously is important. I would add that over a longer period there has been, in my view, an improvement of our operational performance. And improvement of the operational performance translates into the P&L, but also in the way the flow through our industrial footprint goes. And, obviously, this is something which is not only reflected in the P&L but also the normative level of the
working capital. So we have the impact of the down payments.

But there is a very active actions in order to optimize the working capital; work on the overdues, work on the receivables, discuss -- check the inventories level, etc, etc. So when you compare over a short period, fundamentally down payments over a longer period, you have to take that into account as well.
ANDREW CARTER: Thank you. PATRICK KRON: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Babka. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

SCOTT BABKA, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY: Great. This is Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley. Just two questions. First, just a bit more color on the tendering activity. Could you talk a bit where this may be on a regional basis? We would imagine that in Europe that activity must be pretty low given what we've
seen in terms of capacity additions and consumption electricity still under pressure, so I was just interested to figure out where actually that was happening.

And then also, could you just review to us how long the backlog lasts right now through -- in the Thermal equipment and Renewables business? And if you do see that up-tick, are you pretty comfortable with the engineering capacities and wouldn't need to take down any permanent staff, or on just capacity? Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: Well, the first one, Scott, on the first one, I would not say that the tendering activity in Europe is weak. This is not true. We are active in all regions including in Europe. So I have no reason to believe that will be the black hole in Europe; the other way round. I'm expecting good news in Europe as well, and this is something which makes sense.

If I look at the backlog, which is your second point, the backlog in Power represents more or less 21 months of sale. It's close to EUR25 billion, which is not a detail and it depends obviously in the activities. But in Thermal Systems & Products, the backlog represents -- is a little bit short of 20 months, 19 months. It's 21 in Services.

Obviously service -- backlog in Service is not highly representative because it's a mix of long-term contracts and very short ones. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. And in Renewables, it's above these numbers. It's more than two years.

So the question on the engineering is, obviously, the back-end of our activity is very loaded. And in manufacturing is -- in the engineering, we are still active. It's clear that if we remain with no orders for a long period of time we need to adapt the engineering situation.

But again, concerning adaptation in general, okay, we have in some places some specific issues. We are currently slightly reducing our manpower in our New York factory in Transport. This we'll continue to do. We are adjusting manpower in the Brazilian one as well. So, we do -- when there is a problem somewhere we address it.

But globally, we'll keep the flexibility and [return] the flexibility by the smooth adjustments between the [leavers] and the commercial. And that is what we'll continue to do. And we have aggressively hired engineers over the last two years. We are well positioned if there is a -- if the uncertainty and the slowdown


Page 98 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
continues, we have room to adapt. But again, my view is that I hope the market will show some improvement from the low level that we just talked about.
SCOTT BABKA: Great. Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Willi. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

ANDREAS WILLI, ANALYST, J P MORGAN: Good morning. Andreas Willi, JP Morgan. Two questions, please. The first one, on gross margin development, for the Group overall it was flat year-on-year due to the mix change. But maybe you could give us the gross margin development in the Thermal Systems business to see whether that continued to improve.

And also, R&D was down year-on-year. Should we expect the current R&D level to be sustained, or that to go up again as you invest in new technologies?

And on tendering activity, is tendering activity generally like -- if you look back to past downturns in 2001/2 or even earlier, the tendering activity then collapsed and came back? Or is tendering activity just always on a relatively high level, and it's just a timing of projects? So does this situation now feel different from past downturns, in terms of activity?

PATRICK KRON: Well, the first point on the gross margin, we don't disclose gross margin neither by activity, nor by customer, neither -- nor by projects. So, sorry, but I cannot comment in details. But again, if our performance improved, it's because we have a healthy backlog, we have correct [budgetary diffusion], and we work on the costs.

On the R&D, well, the R&D is at a sustained level. It is slightly down on the P&L but slightly up on cash. And it happens that we have capitalized some pilots which are, obviously, -- which is an appropriate decision to capitalize them. So I would say my view on the R&D level is that it is at a level which is a reasonable level and a sustained one.

When we look at prioritizing our spendings, we prioritize spending everywhere. We are not in the mood that we cut R&D because we want to improve [our P&L] numbers. We will prioritize and make sure that all the projects on which we work are projects which are priorities for us. But the R&D level, as indicated, is more or less in the ballpark where it should be.

Concerning the tendering activity, as you know, any crisis is a one-of-a-kind. So, sorry, I have not get into what was the situation in 2001 or 2002 where then the collapse which happened 2003 and 2004 was, by the way, where the collapse was much different of a different nature at that time. It was the bubble in the gas in the US, which made the life of a few of the players, including ourselves, less nice.

No, again, the view is we have an active tendering activity and a low level of order intake. At one stage, it should -- the two should converge. And we expect that it will converge upwards rather than downwards.
Then, -- so trust me, you'll see. ANDREAS WILLI: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Wilkie. Pease go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

MARTIN WILKIE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES: Good morning. It's Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. First of all, on your balance sheet, you've mentioned that you expect free cash flow to be positive for the year, and obviously if orders pick up then the outflows you saw for pre-payments should presumably stop.

With that in mind, do you have a target leverage level that you'd be comfortable to go to for the Group, either for the Areva transaction or just for M&A in general? Just if you could let us know how you're thinking about a sort of comfortable level of gearing that you'd be willing to use to finance some of this potential M&A?

And then the second question, just going back to the point on margins, and obviously I understand you don't give margins -- gross margins by business or by customer, but generally if you could talk about the margins in the backlog. You've, clearly, been cutting costs and, obviously, we know pricing is coming down. But could you just give us some sort of sense about the margin development beyond the March 2010,
given how much of that business you already have in your existing backlog? Thanks.

PATRICK KRON: First, again, a number of interesting questions, Martin. Coming on the first one, we have no pre-identified leverage target but -- and it's a bit trivial to have it. If you don't have the same leverage if
Page 99 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
you buy the BT business than if you buy a plane for me to visit you or somewhat. It depends on what you use the money for and what the cash flow is triggered by the business you buy. So we have plenty. We have EUR1.8 billion in hand. We have access to credit lines. We have available ones. So we are in a good and strong financial situation.

We don't want to put the Company by any type of stress, and will not do. But we think we have plenty of room to maneuver, so let's not speculate on what will happen. It depends on price we buy T&D, the share that we pay for the global T&D price, etc, etc. So we will try to do as smart things as possible on and understanding the shareholders' concerns.

On the gross margin, well, I think I already answered this question. I don't want to go in details. But what I just want to add is that we are -- we consider that it's nice to get orders, but it's nice to get good orders. And we'll continue, and obviously hope the market will support this policy and let us do it, but we want to keep taking good contracts and not only contracts.

If I just want to give an example, over the first half, the gross margin in the order intake is above the gross margin of the contracts which we [upgraded]. So, fundamentally, the quality of the backlog which was good on the March 31, is good on the September 30.

MARTIN WILKIE: Okay. And is that because of mix? Or that's just that your -- the quality of the projects and your ability to control the costs?

PATRICK KRON: The quality of the projects is definitely included in the picture. But it's fair to say that the mix is also pushing in this direction. And as you know very well the business, I knew that you would make the decision by yourself.
MARTIN WILKIE: Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Olivier Esnou. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company --
PATRICK KRON: Three questions, please.

OPERATOR: Mr. Esnou, please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name and location.
OLIVIER ESNOU, ANALYST, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: Yes, good morning to all of you. PATRICK KRON: Thank you, good morning. The three questions, please.
OLIVIER ESNOU: No, no, just two. Sorry to disappoint you. I just wanted to ask you about Transport. As you start to deliver now the TGV, shouldn't we have a ramp-up of sales into the second half? If you can be a bit more specific about that.

And another question on cost control. As you seem to indicate we're going to have about the same trend in H2 as in H1 for the evolution of the workforce, is that correct? And maybe, Henri, seemed to indicate that restructuring charge could be starting to get above EUR100 million, did I understand well or --?
PATRICK KRON: You didn't.

OLIVIER ESNOU: Okay. So can you be -- can you maybe just reiterate what we could expect for restructuring charge this year?

PATRICK KRON: On Transport, we don't expect some step-change in the profitability, except that would not be a nice step-change if we face a massive problem in the contract execution. But this is not the mode in which we position ourselves.

So, concerning the mix, you are right to say that a growing part of the high speed train is positive for the mix. But this is extremely, I would say, progressive so, again, don't expect step-change on that.

Concerning the workforce, well, we'll see. We adapt. And, obviously, we are -- because of our action on cost, we strictly monitor the inflow of new employees and, therefore, adapt strictly to the needs of the backlog. So I think that the decrease in manpower will continue. What will be the exact magnitude, wait and see. It will not be something crazy, but it's going to evolve and continue to go downwards.
On the restructuring charges, Henri mentioned, if I understood well what he said, but as he's in front of me I
had a competitive advantage against you, he said that we gave the message that restructuring cost could
be within the bracket of EUR50 million to EUR100 million.

Page 100 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We were below this level in the very high tide. I think that we had in the first half EUR27 million. And if you consider that there are two halves in a year, you see that we are already within these brackets. So, that
was the message. And Henri mentioned that it may grow within this bracket. That means it's not impossible that H2 be above H1; this EUR27 million on H1.

OLIVIER ESNOU: But the bracket applies? And for even for sales in Transport there should not be acceleration in H2?

PATRICK KRON: No. Look, it depends. We have -- I would say, we had already this discussion and some so-called disappointment on sales level of Transport one half after the other. And you noticed that the disappointment expressed at one point was erased at the second one. So, it is -- this is the recognition of a number of milestone which may impact the level of sales here and there.

So, no, I don't see fundamental accelerations of the sales on H2 in Transport, Henri, if I'm right? No, he agrees with me. That's good news, for him and for me.
OLIVIER ESNOU: Okay, thank you. PATRICK KRON: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Moore. Please go ahead with your question, announcing you company name.
GERARD MOORE, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: Hi, thank you. Its Gerard Moore calling from
Societe Generale. I have a few more questions on the Transportation businesses as well.
PATRICK KRON: Please?

If we look at slide 17, where you showed the different large opportunities that are available for you, is it fair to say that most of these opportunities could become orders within the next one or two years? And is it also fair to say that I guess you would expect to get your market share of these orders? Or is there any reason
to suggest that you could do better than that?

The second question, more specifically on China. It's one of the opportunities that you mention for very high speed trains. We've seen Bombardier and Siemens announce some larger high speed contracts in China recently. Do you think it would, basically, be a case that your turn is next and that you should also announce a large contract? Or do you need to do something different in China in order to win such contracts?

And the final question is just on the profitability of the Transportation division. If we look on a sequential basis, margins were actually down by 70bps compared to H2 of last year. Is there any reason for that? Is it just a change in mix? Or can you maybe explain why that happened? Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: Well, on the first question, is the question is will we take or is this something that is lost per se for us, the answer is, no. Is it something we have a massive share, it's impossible to say.

The only message which is there is not that we are going to get all these orders and you should pile up these tens of billions which represent the total of these projects. It's just to say that there are stimulus packages in a number of countries, and they all include an infrastructure component. These infrastructure components all include a share for rail transportation. And that we hope we'll be able to participate, period, and I don't know.

Take the high speed lines in the USA. We definitely expect to participate in some of the projects. This being said, high speed lines in the USA are not necessarily very high speed on the TGV or AGV type, maybe a [bundling] type, etc. So it will depend on several corridors, and we are going to explore.

There is a very high speed line in Brazil; we are working on it. There are much (inaudible) projects all over the world; we are working on it. There are projects, new tender to be launched by Sensair; we are interested by it. So we have -- we are active. And there is this high speed line in Saudi Arabia, in which we are working as well.

So, we are active on all these projects. Is it going to turn into contracts? I cannot say. Is this going to come within a matter of year or two? You know on these massive projects it takes time. And then they can very well go in first infrastructure, the CD works, and then we'll see the electro mechanical and the rolling stock. So it's absolutely impossible to say, so it's a long-term projects. So who cares, frankly speaking, if a project comes this year or next year, or what is the end game for (inaudible) France. We hope to participate.

In China, we have not lost; we have not participated. In other terms, the projects that were launched in the hard speed were projects which -- in which the question was do we provide some components for some
Page 101 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
trades. And we were not prepared to move from a train manufacturer towards component manufacturers, so some of our competitors do. I hope they are having the same strategy.

So does it mean that this is the end game and we'll never participate in the high speed projects in China? Well, it's too early to say. We have a Chinese high-ranking delegation visiting our high speed factory in the next future, so that means they have not totally lost interest in what we can do. We need to check what we do in term of technology. How we protect the technology, how we make some attractive and efficient offers. And this will be discussed, and this will take some time.
Concerning the margins, I -- we have a 7% margin. We have a guidance which is in this ballpark and I don't
-- I am not concerned. We gave a guidance for this year between 7% and 8%. We are at 7%. So if we
assume, as you do, that there will be a decline on the second half because there was a decline between
the second half of last year and the first of this year, we have a mathematical problem that I have not find a
way to solve.

So we have 7% on the first half, and we gave the guidance for the full-year, so you conclude what you want.
GERARD MOORE: Thank you. PATRICK KRON: Thank you.
OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Ben Elias. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

BEN ELIAS, ANALYST, STERNE AGEE: Thank you. It's Ben Elias from Sterne Agee. I have a question, sort of big picture. Have you noticed if the debate on climate change is resulting in a change in behavior and tendering activity, especially on the fossil power projects?

PATRICK KRON: That's a big picture. Yes, first, we noticed that there are activities around Copenhagen. We don't only notice, but we participate to this.

To be totally clear, I think it should be good news for us. We are looking for -- you know that. It's clear that power generation, representing 40% of the total CO2 emissions, there is no issue on CO2 without addressing the power generation issue. And you know that we consider that this problem is going to be addressed the following.

There are actions on power efficiency, which are downstream. But when you look at the power generation, it will come by a combination of three factors. The first one is a faster -- there is a need for more capacity.

There is no fatality. It's not written on marble that an Indian, per capita, should have a consumption which is half the Chinese one. So there will be need for new and for addition of capacity. And at the same time, you need to reduce the CO2 emission. So it would come by the combination of the three following factors. One, faster growth of the non-CO2 emitting technologies; namely, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar. And solar in the future, [it's another] combination of nuclear and renewable.

Secondly, in the Thermal area there is a need to improve the efficiency, not only of the future fleet but of the existing one. And this is definitely a massive opportunity for us.

And thirdly, we need to work on the capture and storage issue, which is going to become a very substantial business for us. And it's both the need and the great opportunity, and we are actively spending money. I used to say, as a joke to my teams, that for the time being it's more capturing R&D project -- R&D money and budget than CO2. Today, it's combining the capture of our R&D money and real capture of CO2.

You have seen recently a very substantial project announced with Transalta in Canada. All this will ramp up. But I can guarantee that within a limited number of year we will have a substantial CO2-related business. So these are the areas.

So I hope that meetings, such as the one which is expected in Copenhagen, should give a long-term framework. What is important in this industry for our customers, thus for us, is to get a picture which is a long-term and stable picture, what will be the price of carbon, what will be the mechanism for the evolution of this price, so that the players, state-owned ones and private ones, can adapt to this environment.

And as far as we are concerned, we are contributing to this debate. We are providing the decision-makers information and the state-of-the-art and what we are doing in this field. So, of course, it is impacting tendering activity, but tendering activity impacted on a positive way. Because it means that the customers are, and will look -- are looking and will look for more technology in the power plants.


Page 102 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Coal plants are not going to be barbeque-type of power plants. They are going to have power plants with high efficiency and potentially a system [to pour] clean power, not only on the classical pollutants but also the capture on CO2.

BEN ELIAS: So, you're not observing any pull-back on investment in coal-fired technology? There's no hesitation of skepticism there, whether it's in China or whether it's in the US? Do you think that some of the cancellations, the delays are related to cost inflation, construction cost inflation? Or is there still a worry about this energy tax, from your perspective?

PATRICK KRON: No, no. Look, it's obviously clear that there are some slowdowns in coal-related power plants in a number of countries, and you mentioned the US. This is strictly related to the fact that the rules of the game are not clear enough. And as the rules of the game will clarify, then the players will adapt to these rules and take the decision.

There is no way to escape from coal over a period of time. And there will be new power plant, coal power plants. And the challenge is to make these power plants as efficient as possible in terms of yield, and as clear as possible in term of emissions, including CO2. So, wherever the rules will be clear, clear, and clear the players will play.

Obviously, you know that we talk about the crisis impacting decision. It's fair to say that the current environment is not pushing for very large investments. That's why there has been a delay. But at the same time, there has been -- the main driver, one of the larger drivers for decision-making in new power plants is definitely the rules in which they will operate and, namely, the environmental issues related to these future power plants.

But there is a reality, which is that there is a mix of fuels in the capacity, that this mix may evolve. But we are far from running away from one source towards 100% another one. It will be a basket of technologies.
BEN ELIAS: Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Christel Monot. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

CHRISTEL MONOT, ANALYST, UBS: Yes, hi. Good morning, it's Christel. Good morning to all of you. It's Christel from UBS. Two questions, please, coming back on that area of T&D. The first one, I'm sorry I didn't catch really what you said on the possibility of distribution versus transmission. Can you come back to that
a little bit in order for us to try to have a better visibility on what would be the size of the deal for you?

And the second question is can you help me maybe understand what would make you offering on T&D different to the one of GE, in particular, with regards to how T&D is going to perceive it, when your plan is to split the activity while GE plans to, basically, put more power in the hands of the management by future IPO? Thank you.
PATRICK KRON: Sorry, Christel, I didn't get your second question, can you just summarize it again? CHRISTEL MONOT: The second question is basically what would make Areva go for basically your offer
on T&D? What would be the key factor for them to decide to sell T&D to you guys, given that today,
basically, you are proposing to split the business, while GE, for example, is mainly thinking about putting
more power in the hands of the T&D management by putting headquarters in France, and in the future
doing an IPO? It looks from the outside to be much more interesting from the standpoint of the T&D
management?

PATRICK KRON: Okay, that's -- I'm not sure the decision taken by T&D management. But coming back on your first question, I may have not been clear enough, there will be a split between Areva. If we win there will be a split between Areva T&D; transmission going to us and distribution to Schneider Electric. I said that, and I may have misled you, and sorry, and thank you for the opportunity to clarify.

I am just saying that as I think that the profitability of [TE] is higher than the profitability of GE, there might be a value split, which might be slightly above the sales split. Do you see what I mean?

CHRISTEL MONOT: Yes, I do. I'm just surprised by the statement. When you say you will think, is that some hard data that you've got in the data? Or is just your gut feeling because you still don't have the --?

PATRICK KRON: This is what I want to share with you, and I'm not sure that I'm going to detail our offer. So, we are working on the value of the company and we will discuss with Schneider about the proper split of the values.
The second question is on the criteria for Areva to decide. Fundamentally, it's their decision and not ours.

Page 103 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
I am a little bit surprised by your statement that the idea of coming with private equity forms and float the business is more attractive than the sound industrial offer we are making with Schneider. A very logical, strategic, and industrial offer, with transmission becoming a third development pole within Alstom, alongside Power and Transport, which will fully benefit by our global network, while Schneider Electric will provide the distribution activity we make through this combination, one of the world leaders in medium voltage. That will thus give to the distribution activity of T&D the critical size that I think it has not today.

So I think that the project is win, win, win for Alstom, Schneider Electric, and Areva. So when I look at the industrial logic, I wonder why the number one group -- industrial group in the world needs private equity funds to buy a company of the size of Areva T&D.
And by the way, if combining the T&D activities in one entity is so obvious, why is GE running its T&D
current business into three independent divisions?

The second one is that I don't know what will be the process of the decision-making for Areva. But as when someone buys a company, it is expected to do so to reinforce itself otherwise, no one being [moralistic], I don't see why they will buy the business. Therefore, if GE and Toshiba wants to buy the T&D business of Areva, it means that they want to reinforce themselves.

I just remind you that GE and Toshiba are front competitors of Areva in its core business, which is the business. Or if I were Areva, I would prefer to sell the T&D business to someone which I will reinforce but will not be a front competitor in the nuclear business.
But as far as we are concerned, the decision for to sell will not be ours. And what we will do is make a
sound industrial offer, with a strong strategic logics, and make the right price to -- in this offer. As you know,
we think it's an opportunity, but we clearly are not in do-or-die mode.
CHRISTEL MONOT: Okay. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you very much.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Randall. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

LISA RANDALL, ANALYST, NOMURA: Good morning, everyone. It's Lisa Randall from Nomura. Just to come back, Patrick, onto your comments about delays in Power orders, you said that it's the sales people that are increasingly confident that some of these orders will start to convert. What's the source behind that optimism or that confidence?

Is it to do with the finance easing? Is it to do with the size of the financing funds available? Is it because reserve margins are increasingly looking low on a projective basis? Or any other reason? Then, is it different on a geographical basis? Thank you.
PATRICK KRON: Well, this is nothing economic. And if we had the formula allowing us to turn the
tendering activity into forecast of orders, we would be much more comfortable in making forecasts or giving
guidance on orders. No, it's just the fact that we, obviously, monitor or check the funnel of incoming
demands.

So we have bids which are identified, and projects which are identified, bids which are under preparation, bids which are already ongoing. And when we look at what is happening here, we see that it's active. And we say, okay, for the period of time we have seen this activity coming and coming and coming and, frankly, we have not seen these projects turning into contracts and orders.

So what we believe is that it continues to come, on one hand something will happen. There is this [constipation] will not last. So that's where we are. So it's more nose than -- it's more nose than [numerating] numbers. Our sales people are comfortable that the level will rebound after the slow level of the first half.

And as I indicated early, I don't think that it is a geographical bubble which is going to be created. It's not at all. We believe that there are a number of projects ongoing; a number of tenders; a number of opportunities in all geographies. And, therefore, we expect the markets to rebound. It's, frankly, difficult to say when it will happen, but we expect that over H2 it will.
LISA RANDALL: Okay. Thank you.

OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of William Mackie. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.
WILLIAM MACKIE: It's MainFirst. Thank you very much for the follow-up, it's very quick. With regard to the
Bouygues stake in hydro, can you confirm -- well, can you give some indication of how the outcome of that

Page 104 of 106 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
-- the options on that will complete? Do you expect Bouygues may actually intend to retain its stake in hydro? Or is that a very low probability event? Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: Well, first, I am surprised that this item is bubbling up because it's no surprise. And this is disclosed in all our documents since day one, since Bouygues took over its 50% stake. As you know, Bouygues has the possibility to exercise a put option, through which they are paid either in cash or in shares. And Bouygues, you should ask Bouygues more than myself, but Bouygues has commented on this so-called scoop, or news, that they have not yet taken the decision.

Frankly, between you and me, it's not a matter of pre-module importance. And it will not change the overall profile of our Group.
WILLIAM MACKIE: Okay, thanks.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Schmit.

PATRICK KRON: And this is the last question, ladies and gentlemen. That's another good news in the presentation besides the good numbers.
OPERATOR: Mr. Schmit, please go ahead with your question, announcing your company name.

ARNAUD SCHMIT, ANALYST, NATIXIS SECURITIES: Thank you. Good morning. Arnaud Schmit, Natixis. I had a question on the cash profile. Could you be more precise on the trends within each division, in H1 at least?
HENRI POUPART-LAFARGE: The trends or the trains? ARNAUD SCHMIT: Trends.
HENRI POUPART-LAFARGE: Okay, sorry.

ARNAUD SCHMIT: Could you say in which way the H2 expected upturn would rather be based on Power rather than Transport for structural reason?

Second question, on signaling, its contribution has been -- has remained stable apparently. How will you say your market share has evolved? And could this business grow the same way as then the market organically only? Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: To the first one is we are not going to disclose the free cash flow per activity, neither per sector. The message is we have been slightly positive over the first half. And we consider that will be positive on the second half as well, making the total of the year a positive number, as we already indicated. And this will come by efforts and contribution across the board and in the two sectors.

The second comment on signaling, well, signaling is one area in which we think we have opportunities. We won a number of contracts, interesting ones. It's extremely, Arnaud, difficult to give a market share on such a short period of time. But you know that we expect long-term to grow faster our non-rolling stock business than our rolling stock business. So it is an area of growth for us, of organic growth.

We also indicated that we might make some acquisition there, if there were opportunities. So far there were not, so we didn't do any. But nothing changing under the sky.
ARNAUD SCHMIT: Okay. Thank you.

PATRICK KRON: Thank you very much. So, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our presentation. Thank you for your interest. And thank you for the larger number of questions that you raised.

As far as we are concerned, we will still remain at your disposal to answer additional ones; Emmanuelle, Henri, and myself. Thank you again for your patience and your interest. Goodbye.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.
