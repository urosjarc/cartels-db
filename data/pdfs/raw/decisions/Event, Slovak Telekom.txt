Brussels (dpa) - The European Union is fining Deutsche Telekom and its Slovak subsidiary a combined total of almost 70 million euros (91.6 million dollars) for blocking competitors from Slovakia's internet market, the bloc's executive announced Wednesday.

The European Commission found that the companies had prevented rivals from accessing broadband infrastructure owned exclusively by  Slovak Telekom, Slovakia's telecommunications operator.

TD
"Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumers," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"As the parent company, with decisive influence on its subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom has also been held responsible for the abusive conduct," he added.
The two companies were jointly  fined almost 39 million euros. Deutsche Telekom was hit with an extra
31-million-euro penalty "to ensure sufficient deterrence," after having been  fined for similar activities in
Germany in 2003, the commission wrote.

Specifically, it found that Slovak Telecom was making it difficult and costly for rivals to use the cables connecting customers to their nearest telephone exchange. The company installed these lines when it was still a monopoly, the EU's executive said.

In 2005, Slovakia's telecommunications regulator obliged the company to grant access to these so-called local loops, but the conditions it set were "such as to render the access unacceptable," the commission wrote.

It is very costly to install new cables, especially for newly established companies, as this involves digging trenches to connect each house to the network, it added.

The commission - the EU's competition watchdog - has previously  fined telecoms providers in France, Spain and Poland for similar behaviour.

After an in-depth investigation the  European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR 38.84M on Slovak Telekom a.s. and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, for having pursued during more than five years an abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services, in breach of EU antitrust rules. In particular, the Commission concluded that  Slovak Telekom refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors, and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators. Deutsche Telekom as parent company with decisive influence is also responsible for the conduct of its subsidiary; it is therefore jointly and severally liable for  Slovak Telekom's fine.
Deutsche Telekom also received an additional  fine of EUR 31.07M to ensure sufficient deterrence as well as to sanction its repeated abusive behavior as it had already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany.

* Deutsche Telekom caught a second time for "margin squeeze"
* Orange in Poland and Spain's Telefonica guilty in the past (Adds commissioner's comments, details)

TD
By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom was  fined 69.9 million euros ($88.4 million) by EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday because its Slovak unit squeezed out rivals in Slovakia's broadband market over a five-year period starting from 2005.

The penalty underlines the  European Commission's fight against dominant companies which charge competitors excessive wholesale rates, making it impossible for them to generate a profit from their retail services. Such a tactic is called a margin squeeze.
In addition to a 38.8 million euro joint  fine with Slovak Telekom, German telecoms provider Deutsche
Telekom was hit with a 31.1 million penalty as this was its second margin squeeze offence.

Deutsche Telekom holds a 51-percent stake in  Slovak Telekom, with the Slovak government owning the remainder. Reuters reported on June 24 that the two companies would be penalised by the European Commission.
The EU competition authority said  Slovak Telekom's strategy between August 2005 and December
2010 harmed both consumers and competitors.

"Slovak Telekom did not only refuse to give access to its unbundled local loops under fair conditions. It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss," European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

Orange's Polish unit TPSA was penalised three years ago over similar margin squeeze practices while Spain's Telefonica received a 151 million euro  fine in 2007 for more than five years of unfair prices in the local broadband market.

Deutsche Telekom was  fined 12.6 million euros in 2003 for its anti-competitive tariffs for access to its local networks.

BRUSSELS — The European Commission’s antitrust unit is fining Deutsche Telekom AG and its subsidiary Slovak Telekom a.s. a total of €69.9 million ($88.4 million) for shutting out rivals from the Slovak market for broadband services for more than five years, in breach of EU antitrust rules, the commission said in a statement Wednesday.

The total consists of two  fines: one of €38.8 million on  Slovak Telekom and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom (DTE, DE) , for refusing to give access to the so-called local loop or “last mile,” the final section of the network which joins telecoms cables to subscribers’ homes, and an additional €31 million fine for Deutsche Telekom alone, because it is a repeat offense after similar tactics in 2003 in Germany.

“Slovak Telekom’s strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumer,” Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said. “It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss.”

Slovak Telekom, the incumbent telecom operator in Slovakia, offers, among other things, fixed broadband services over its legacy metallic telephone networks and over fiber networks.

HD     1ST LEAD Deutsche Telekom to challenge  EU fine over Slovak subsidiary By Helen Maguire, dpa

LP
Brussels (dpa) - German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom said Wednesday it would challenge a hefty EU  fine for its alleged role in hindering competition in Slovakia's internet market.

The European Commissionfined the company and its Slovak subsidiary a combined 70 million euros (91.6 million dollars), arguing that they had prevented rivals from accessing broadband infrastructure owned by Slovak Telekom during 2005-10, in breach of EU competition law.

TD
"Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumers," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

"As the parent company, with decisive influence on its subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom has also been held responsible for the abusive conduct," he added.
But the company, a one-time telephone monopoly in Germany, rejected the charge.

"We do not understand the commission's decision, because we, as Deutsche Telekom, have always assumed that  Slovak Telekom acts in a competitive manner," it said in a statement.

Deutsche Telekom said the commission's investigation raised many questions and that it was intervening in a matter that fell under the competence of national regulators.

The company also noted that the European Union's executive had found no current wrongdoings and accused it of speeding up procedures to push through a decision before the commission's new leadership is slated to take over on November 1.

The German and Slovak companies were jointly  fined almost 39 million euros. Deutsche Telekom was hit with an extra 31-million-euro penalty "to ensure sufficient deterrence," after having been  fined for similar activities in Germany in 2003, the commission wrote.

Specifically, it said Slovak Telecom had been making it difficult and costly for rivals to use the cables connecting customers to their nearest telephone exchange. The company installed these lines when it was still a monopoly, according to the commission.

In 2005, Slovakia's telecommunications regulator obliged the company to grant access to these so-called local loops, but the conditions it set were "such as to render the access unacceptable," the commission wrote.

It is very costly to install new cables, especially for newly established companies, as this involves digging trenches to connect each house to the network, it added.
The commission - the EU's competition watchdog - has previously also  fined telecoms providers in
France, Spain and Poland for similar behaviour.

Deutsche Telekom is a majority shareholder of  Slovak Telekom, holding 51% of its shares, and can nominate the majority of the Board of Directors.

BRUSSELS--The European Commission's antitrust unit is fining Deutsche Telekom AG and its subsidiary Slovak Telekom A.S. a total of EUR69.9 million ($88.4 million) for shutting out rivals from the Slovak market for broadband services for more than five years, in breach of EU antitrust rules, the commission said in a statement Wednesday.
The total consists of two  fines: one of EUR38.8 million on  Slovak Telekom A.S. and its parent
company, Deutsche Telekom AG for refusing to give access to the so-called local loop or "last mile," the
final section of the network which joins telecoms cables to subscribers' homes, and an additional
EUR31 million fine for Deutsche Telekom alone because it is a repeat offense after similar tactics in
2003 in Germany.

(RTTNews) - The European Commission said Wednesday that it has imposed a  fine of 38.84 million euros on Slovak Telekom a.s. and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG (DTEGY.PK), for having pursued during more than five years an abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services, in breach of EU antitrust rules.

Deutsche Telekom also received an additional  fine of 31.07 million euros to ensure sufficient deterrence as well as to sanction its repeated abusive behaviour as it had already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany.

TD
The total  fine for which Deutsche Telekom is held liable is 69.91 million euros, which includes 38.84 million euros for which it is held jointly and severally liable with  Slovak Telekom.

The commission concluded that  Slovak Telekom refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors, and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators. Deutsche Telekom as parent company with decisive influence is also responsible for the conduct of its subsidiary; it is therefore jointly and severally liable for  Slovak Telekom's fine.
Deutsche Telekom is a majority shareholder of  Slovak Telekom, holding 51% of its shares.

Deutsche Telekom had already been  fined by the Commission in 2003 for having engaged in a margin squeeze in the market for access to its unbundled local loop in Germany. In view of this repeated abusive behaviour (recidivism) the  fine to be paid by Deutsche Telekom has been increased by 50%. A further increase of 20% was applied in view the size of Deutsche Telekom which had a worldwide turnover of more than 60 billion euros in 2013, to ensure that the  fine has a sufficiently deterrent effect, the Commission said.

(RTTNews) - The European Commission's antitrust unit on Wednesday  finedDeutsche Telekom AG (DTEGY.PK) and its unit Slovak Telekom A.S. 69.9 million euros for eliminating rivals from the Slovak broadband-services market, in breach of EU antitrust rules.

The Commission imposed a  fine of 38.8 million euros  fine on Slovak Telekom and Deutsche Telekom for having pursued during more than five years an abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services.

TD
In particular, the Commission concluded that  Slovak Telekom refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors, and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators. Deutsche Telekom as parent company with decisive influence is also responsible for the conduct of its subsidiary and liable for the fine, the EC said.

Deutsche Telekom was also slapped with an additional  fine of 31 million euros to ensure deterrence as well as to sanction its repeated abusive behavior, having already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany.

According to the Commission, in 2005,  Slovak Telekom set the conditions under which alternative operators could access the local loop-which made it unfeasible. Moreover, Slovak Telecom set prices at such levels that, in order to compete, its rivals would be forced to incur losses.

Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than 5 years, to the detriment of competition and consumers."

"Slovak Telekom did not only refuse to give access to its unbundled local loops under fair conditions. It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss."

Deutsche Telekom is a majority shareholder of  Slovak Telekom, holding 51 percent of its shares, and has a special rights such as the right to nominate the majority of the Board and to be informed about all management matters within  Slovak Telekom.
The Commission opened an in-depth investigation in April 2009 into  Slovak Telekom and in December
2010 into Deutsche Telekom.

The Commission's probe revealed that Deutsche Telekom did indeed exercise decisive influence notably through overlaps in senior management personnel and by influencing the decision-making process at Slovak Telekom.

Slovak Telekom, the incumbent telecom operator in Slovakia, offers, among other things, fixed broadband services over its legacy metallic telephone networks and over fiber networks.

In Germany, Deutsche Telekom stock is trading at 10.52 euros, down 0.28 euros or 2.59%, on a volume of 14.4 million shares.

"It is difficult to even see why extensive resources of the directorate-general were devoted to a case of this nature in the first place," spokesman Andreas Middel said in an email. "This is completely disproportionate to the amount of effort given to other commission proceedings... Specifically,

Commissioner Almunia has devoted the same or even more resources to this case than to the Google case that is running in parallel and being dealt with by the same directorate-general of the  European     Commission."

Last month Mr. Almunia said Google Inc. must improve its proposal to settle European Union concerns over its search practices or face formal antitrust charges; his agency's handling of its investigation of Google has yet to yield results after almost four years and three attempted settlements.

BRATISLAVA, October 15, (SITA) -- The  European Commission has finedSlovak Telekom and its parent company Deutsche Telekom AG 38.84 million euros for abuse of their dominant position on the market for more than five years. As the  European Commission informed, their action was aimed at shutting out competitors from the market for broadband services in Slovakia.

TD
The European Commission concluded that  Slovak Telekom refused to provide unbundled access to local loops to its competitors and applied a policy of margin squeeze toward alternative providers. "Deutsche Telekom as the parent company decisively influenced the conduct of its subsidiary and is therefore jointly liable for the  fine for Slovak Telekom," stated the EC. According to published information, Deutsche Telekom also received an additional fine of 31.1 million euros. According to the  European        Commission, the additional  fine aims to ensure a sufficient deterrent effect and sanction repeated abuse of a dominant position, given that the penalty for squeezing margins on broadband markets in Germany has already been imposed as early as 2003. The overall  fine, for which Deutsche Telekom is responsible, is thus 69.91 million euros, including 38.84 million euros for which Deutsche Telekom and  Slovak             Telekom are jointly liable.

The European Commission today announced it had found that Slovakian incumbent telecom operator Slovak Telecom a.s. and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, had pursued for more than five years an "abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services" in violation of European Union antitrust rules.

The commission imposed a  fine of 38.8 million euros ($49.7 million U.S.) on Slovak Telecom and DT and an additional 31.0 million euro ($39.6 million U.S.)  fine on DT to ensure "sufficient deterrence as well as
to sanction its repeated abusive behavior (recidivism) as it has already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany."

TD
DT holds 51% of  Slovak Telekom's shares and has a number of special rights to nominate the majority of board members and to be informed about all management matters within Slovak Telecom, "allowing it to exercise decisive influence over the company," the commission said. The commission said it found that
DT "did indeed exercise decisive influence notably through overlaps in senior management personnel and by influencing the decision-making process at  Slovak Telekom. Under EU antitrust rules, parent companies exercising such decisive influence are liable for infringements committed by their
subsidiaries."

Specifically, the commission concluded that  Slovak Telekom had refused to provide unbundled access to local loops to competitors and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators by setting rates for inputs above the level that would enable them to compete.

"Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than 5 years, to the detriment of competition and consumers," said Joaquin Almunia,  European               Commission vice president-competition policy. "Slovak Telekom did not only refuse to give access to its unbundled local loops under fair conditions. It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss. As the parent company with decisive influence on its subsidiary Deutsche Telekom has also been held responsible for the abusive conduct." —Brian Hammond, brian.hammond@wolterskluwer.com

BRUSSELS, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Wednesday announced that it is fining Deutsche Telekom and its Slovak subsidiary a combined total of 69.9 million euros (89.3 million U.S. dollars ) for shutting out rivals in Slovakia's broadband market.

The EU competition authority revealed on Tuesday that  Slovak Telekom and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom pursued unfair practices on the Slovak market for more than five years starting in
2005.

TD
Joaquin Almunia, Vice-President of the  European Commission in charge of competition said that the
Slovak Telekom committed two abuses.

"The first one was the foreclosure of competitors. The Slovak Telecom according to our investigation, shut down competitors to avoid them to have access to the broadband. The second abuse was what we call the margin squeeze so they put prices in a way that the profits were not towards other players but towards Slovak Telecom. This is an infringement. It is an abuse of dominance according to the Treaty,"Almunia said.

German provider Deutsche Telekom as parent company holding 51 percent shares was also responsible.

Both companies received a joint  fine worth 38.3 milion euro. On top of that the Commission imposed an extra 31.1 million penalty on Deutsche Telekom for its repeated margin squeeze action.

The EU competition body said the  Slovak Telekom abusive practices harmed both consumers and competitors precluding them from real choice between alternatives.

The EU Commission has slapped a multi-million euro  fine on Germany's Deutsche Telekom. The telephone company was found guilty of exploiting its dominant market position in Slovakia through a local subsidiary.
The European Union's executive Commission announced Wednesday that Deutsche Telekom would be
fined a total of 69.9 million euros ($88.4 million) for violating the bloc's monopoly rules.

TD
The German telecommunications giant had prevented rivals in Slovakia from accessing broadband infrastructure owned exclusively by its local subsidiary  Slovak Telekom, the Commission said.

In recent years, the EU's executive arm has been eager to stop big corporations distorting market prices by exploiting their market dominance. Deutsche Telekom, for example, charged Slovak competitors excessive wholesale rates for using its infrastructure, making it impossible for them to generate a profit from their retail services. This tactic is called a "margin squeeze."

"Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumers," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Noting that Deutsche Telekom was responsible for the "abusive conduct" of its Slovak subsidiary, the EU fined the Germany-based parent 31 million euros on top of a joint  fine of 38.8 million euros for both companies.

Deutsche Telekom, which was already  fined in 2003 for similar violations in Germany, rejected the charge.

"We do not understand the Commission's decision, because we have always assumed that  Slovak        Telekom acts in a competitive manner," the company said in a statement.

Deutsche Telekom's statement also said the  EU Commission's investigation raised many questions and that it was intervening in a matter that fell under the competence of national regulators. Moreover, the company noted that the  EU Commission had found no current wrongdoing, and accused it of speeding up procedures to push through a decision before the Commission's new leadership takes over on November 1.

Slovak Telekom is facing what is one of the highest  fines inSlovakia's history after the  European            Commission has imposeda penalty of 38.8 million on the company, Hospodarske Noviny dailyreports on pages 1 and 5 on Thursday.

The EU's executive body slapped the  fine for the company'sabusing its dominant position on the market for broadband servicesbetween 2005-10. The company was found to have engaged in a marginsqueeze so as to stop competitors from entering the market.

TD
Half of the penalty is to be paid by Deutsche Telekom, whichowns 51 percent of  Slovak Telekom's shares. On top of theaforementioned  fine slapped on its subsidiary, Deutsche Telekom isfacing another fine of 31 million vis-a-vis the matter following theEuropean Commission's probe that took two years.

Igor Mesensky, a partner at TPA Horwath Corporate Finance, saidthat the Germany-based parent company bears responsibility for theconduct of its Slovak subsidiary.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom says that the  fine is based onoutdated regulatory concepts whereby penalties are imposed foralleged past discrimination against competitors while utmost lenienceis shown to new providers of services in the field.

The European Commission (EC) has imposed a fine of almost EUR 70 million on Deutsche Telekom because of its Slovak subsidiary having breached the competition laws.

Slovak Telekom has kept more than five rivals from having access to the local market for broadband services, for which it and the German group will have to pay EUR 38.8 million. The parent company wants to file a complaint against the decision to be  fined. Deutsche Telekom called it a false signal for the digital agenda of the  EU commission.

TD
The German group will also have to pay EUR 31 million because it already was  fined because of its actions in the field of broadband in Germany in 2003. Because of that the EC sees it as a repeat offender.

(RTTNews) - German stocks are tumbling on Thursday, extending the previous session's steep sell-off as renewed fears about slowing global growth sent investors scrambling for the safety of German
government bonds, pulling yields to an all-time low.

Commodities continue to decline and the dollar resumed its uptrend after final data from Eurostat showed that Eurozone inflation fell to 0.3 percent, way below the European Central Bank's target, as initially estimated in September to the lowest since late 2009. It has been below the 2 percent ceiling since February 2013.

TD
The German DAX is currently down 132 points or 1.54 percent at 8,440.18 while France's CAC 40 is losing 2.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 is down 1.8 percent.

Banks are bearing the brunt of the selling, with Commerzbank tumbling 3 percent on a report its settlement with U.S. authorities over alleged sanctions violations has been postponed, possibly until the end of the year.

Deutsche Telekom is losing 2.7 percent. The company and its unit  Slovak Telekom A.S. were  fined 69.9 million euros by the  European Commission's antitrust unit for eliminating rivals from the Slovak broadband-services market, in breach of antitrust rules.

Jenoptik is declining 3 percent as the integrated optoelectronics group trimmed its revenue and profit guidance for the full-year 2014, citing subdued demand as well as project postponements and more stringent export restrictions.

RWE is tumbling percent. Britain's energy minister is not keen on approving a deal for the utility to sell its oil and gas operations to a consortium of Russian investors, the Financial Times reported.
Lufthansa shares are moving down half a percent. Its budget unit Germanwings has reportedly cancelled
100 flights for Thursday after its pilots union called members out on a 12-hour strike in a row over
retirement benefits at the company.

Elsewhere, the Asian markets ended broadly lower as soft U.S. economic data on retail sales, producer prices and manufacturing activity in the New York region added to concerns about faltering global growth.

The U.S. index futures point to a sharply lower open as investors eye another batch of U.S. economic data on weekly jobless claims, industrial production, homebuilder confidence and Philadelphia-area manufacturing activity for further clues on the health of the world's largest economy.

TD
Brussels, 15/10/2014 (Agence Europe) - Following an in-depth investigation which was first opened in
2009, the  European Commission decided on Wednesday 15 October to fineSlovak Telekom nearly €39
million for abuse of dominant position between 2005 and the end of 2010 at least, on the Slovakian
broadband market. As parent company exercising a decisive influence, Deutsche Telekom also comes in
for its share of the  fine as it is deemed to be jointly responsible. It will also have to pay an additional  fine
in the region of €31 million, set high enough to be a deterrent as well as a punishment, as this is not a first
offence for Deutsche Telekom, which came under fire in 2003 for similar behaviour on the broadband
markets in Germany.

Slovak Telekom offers, amongst other things, fixed broadband services on traditional metal cable telephone lines and on fibre-optic networks. In August 2005, following a request by the Slovakian telecommunications regulation authority,  Slovak Telekom published the conditions under which it would allow other operators to access its unbundled local loops. These conditions, the Commission explains, were such as to make this access unacceptable and delayed or prevented other operators from entering the retail broadband services market in Slovakia.

Slovak Telekom also set access prices for its local loops and its retail prices at levels such that they would have caused losses to its competitors if they wished to sell broadband services to retailers at retail prices corresponding to those offered by  Slovak Telekom.

With 51% of the shares of  Slovak Telekom, Deutsche Telekom is its main shareholder and has a number of special rights, such as the right to appoint the majority of the members of the board of directors and to be notified of all management issues. Deutsche Telekom could therefore be held to have a decisive influence, particularly due to the overlaps within management-level staff and the influence on the
decision-making process within  Slovak Telekom. It is therefore jointly liable for the infringement alongside
Slovak Telekom. (EL)

BUDGET: The Cabinet is sending to parliament a draft budget for next year with a general government deficit of 1.98 percent of GDP. Compared to the original draft from August, this draft counts with a deficit lower by almost half a percentage point. This is because the Finance Ministry incorporated into the draft new positive tax projections, as well as changes resulting from the new ESA 2010 methodology. The Cabinet of Robert Fico approved the 2015 draft budget on Wednesday. According to the law on budgetary rules, the Cabinet must deliver the draft budget for next year to parliament no later than later than October
15 of the preceding year. Revenue on a cash basis next year is planned at 14.193 billion euros and expenses are budgeted at 16.635 billion euros. That leaves a budget deficit of 2.442 billion euros. PRAVDA-1,2,3 PLUS-5

have to convene the meeting within seven days. He pointed out that MPs asked for convening the session under Article 88 of the Constitution and therefore he has 30 days after submission of the proposal to summon the session. PRAVDA-7

MINIMUM WAGE: The minimum wage will go up from 352 euros to 380 euros in Slovakia from the beginning of next year. It accounts for an increase of 7.95 percent. The lowest possible gross hourly earnings next year will thus reach 2,184 euros versus the current 2,023 euros. The Cabinet decided on such a strong hike on Wednesday in order to secure that the minimum wage will guarantee a higher net income to an employee than the at-risk-of poverty limit.

SAV: Scientists and staff of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) are protesting against plans to allocate less money for this scientific institution in the state budget for next year. Hundreds of staff members of this institution met on Wednesday in Bratislava to express their disagreement with the Cabinet's draft budget for 2015. It envisages for SAV 50.5 million euros, which is down from this year by
10.3 million. SAV expenses are reduced by 16.9 percent and payroll expenses by 10.2 percent. Education Minister Peter Pellegrini (SMER-SD) announced after Wednesday's meeting of the Cabinet that compared to the original proposal the state budget was hiked by an additional 8 million euros for science. "It is a response to the need to return the missing funds to support science," said Pellegrini. SME-2 PRAVDA-3,4

Slovak Telekom blocked entry of altnets into retail broadband market,  European Commission rules.

Deutsche Telekom and its Slovak subsidiary have together been  fined €69.9 million by the  European  Commission following a lengthy investigation into anti-competitive practices.

TD
The Commission levied a  fine of €38.8 million on  Slovak Telekom and its German parent for refusing to supply unbundled access to local loops and for imposing a margin squeeze on alternative operators. An additional €31.1 million fine was slapped on Deutsche Telekom alone because it was judged to be a repeat offender, having been fined for squeezing broadband margins in its home market in 2003.

"Slovak Telekom's strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumers," said European antitrust commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a statement on Wednesday.

"Slovak Telekom did not only refuse to give access to its unbundled local loops under fair conditions. It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss," he added, explaining that as the
parent company of  Slovak Telekom, Deutsche Telekom is held responsible for its conduct.

The Commission opened its investigation into  Slovak Telekom in April 2009, but the scope of it dates back to mid-2005, when the telco published its LLU conditions for alternative operators. Its conditions "delayed or prevented" the entry of alternative operators into the retail broadband market, and therefore amounted to a refusal to grant access, the Commission said.
Deutsche Telekom holds a 51% stake in  Slovak Telekom.

The European Commission has imposed a fine of EUR 38.838 million on  Slovak Telekom and its parent Deutsche Telekom for having pursued during more than five years an abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services. The conclusion came after an in-depth investigation which started in 2009 for Slovak Telekom and in December 2010 for Deutsche Telekom. In particular, the EC concluded that Slovak Telekom refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors, and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators. Deutsche Telekom as parent company with decisive influence is also responsible for the conduct of its subsidiary; it is therefore jointly and severally liable for  Slovak Telekom's fine.

Deutsche Telekom also received an additional  fine of EUR 31.07 million to ensure sufficient deterrence as well as to sanction its repeated abusive behaviour (recidivism) as it had already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany.

In June 2005, the Slovak telecommunications regulator (TUSR) obliged Slovak Telekom to give access to the local loops within its legacy telephone network. In August 2005, Slovak Telekom published conditions under which it would allow alternative operators to access its unbundled local loops (ULL). These conditions were such as to render the access unacceptable. In particular,  Slovak Telekom unjustifiably withheld network information necessary for the unbundling of the local loops, unilaterally reduced the scope of its regulatory obligation to unbundle and set other unfair terms and conditions in relation to each of the steps needed to obtain access. Furthermore,  Slovak Telekom set the prices for access to its local loops and its retail prices at levels which would force competitors to incur losses if
they wanted to sell broadband services to retail customers at retail prices matching those offered by
Slovak Telekom (a so-called "margin squeeze").

European Commission finds operator did not provide rivals with local loop access

The European Commission’s antitrust unit is fining Deutsche and its subsidiary  Slovak Telekom €69.9 million ($88.4 million) for failing to allow rivals in the Slovak market to use its access network, reports The Wall Street Journal.

TD
Rivals were kept out of the Slovak market for broadband services for more than five years, in breach of
EU antitrust rules, the commission found.

Two fines have been made: one of €38.8 million for  Slovak Telekom and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom for refusing to give access to the local loop and an additional €31 million  fine for Deutsche Telekom alone because it is a repeat offence after similar tactics in 2003 in Germany.

“Slovak Telekom’s strategy has distorted competition in the broadband market in Slovakia during more than five years, to the detriment of competition and consumer,” Commission vice-president Joaquín Almunia, who is in charge of competition policy, said. “It also pursued a margin squeeze policy which made it impossible for alternative operators to use its legacy telephone network infrastructure without incurring a loss.”

Slovak Telekom, the incumbent operator in Slovakia, offers fixed broadband services over its legacy networks and over fibre.

Deutsche Telekom is a majority shareholder of  Slovak Telekom, holding 51% of its shares, and can nominate the majority of the Board of Directors. The Commission said its investigation “revealed that Deutsche Telekom did indeed exercise decisive influence notably through overlaps in senior management personnel,” and is therefore jointly liable for the main  fine.

SOCIAL: Prime Minister Robert Fico along with Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jan Richter
announced on Thursday that two more tasks were completed from the package of fifteen social measures
of the current government. It is the introduction of temporary overlapping of material need allowance and
income from work, and the increase in payroll levy relief for students working based on work performance

GAS PRICE: Next year's prices of natural gas for households will depend on the decision of the Regulatory Office for Network Industries (URSO). The gas utility SPP does not plan to submit a new price proposal to the regulatory authority. Slovakia’s dominant gas supplier thus will wait for the regulator’s decision. "According to the current legislation we are not obliged to provide a price proposal.

CORRUPTION: Whistleblowers and persons reporting other antisocial activities should be protected. This stems from the bill on some measures related to reporting anti-social activities that the Slovak Parliament approved on Thursday. In June, the governing SMER-SD rejected two draft bills to protect whistleblowers
- one prepared by the opposition KDH and the second by the movement Ordinary People and Independent Personalities. The bill adopted now drafted by the Interior Ministry, according to Minister Kalinak, is more complex than previously presented drafts. SME-2 PRAVDA-1,4

It announced as well that the prefix of phone numbers of its customers will be 0950. The operator however has not published yet the exact date of commercial service launch and its offer. "I feel that we are in the middle to final part of the process of
launching the mobile operator. A milestone, without which we will not be able to launch the operator, is the signing of contracts and all technological matters concerning national roaming,” head of the BoD of SWAN Juraj Ondris said on Thursday. HN-7 PRAVDA-12,13

DEFENSE: A private investor was supposed to save it before demise but this plan has been put off for now with no substitute solution. This is the situation at the state-run aircraft maintenance company Letecke Opravovne Trencin, which dived into a more than 4-million-euro loss last year. At that time, the Cabinet assigned a task to Defense Minister Martin Glvac (SMER-SD); he should have found a way to let in a private company and revive the ailing firm. However, the minister has changed the course and
canceled the selection of legal aide that was to fulfill the task. Moreover, he does not plan to re-open it any

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: The Cabinet and the Economy Ministry should unconditionally insist that the fine for Slovak Telekom amounting to almost 39 million euros was exclusively settled by the foreign shareholder - Deutsche Telekom, suggests non-affiliated MP and ex-Economy Minister Juraj Miskov. As he explained, after the privatization the German shareholder has also management control in  Slovak        Telekom apart from a majority 51-percent stake in the company and thus bears full responsibility for
decisions that the  European Commission assessed as a violation of European Union rules protecting the free market. PRAVDA-12

European Commission clears acquisition of Dutch cable TV operator Ziggo by Liberty Global subject to conditions

TD
Following a Phase II investigation, the  European Commission has conditionally approved the proposed acquisition of Dutch cable TV operator Ziggo by Liberty Global. The Commission had concerns that the merger would have hindered competition by removing two close competitors in the Dutch market for the wholesale of premium pay TV film channels and by increasing Liberty Global's buyer power vis-à-vis TV channel broadcasters, allowing it to hinder innovation in the delivery of audio visual content over the Internet. To address these concerns, Liberty Global has committed to sell Film1, its premium pay TV film channel, and to carry the channel on its pay TV network for a period of three years. It has also agreed to terminate clauses in channel carriage agreements that limit broadcasters' ability to offer their channels and content over the Internet, as well as agreeing not to include any similar clauses in future agreements for a period of eight years.

European Commission confirms dawn raids in biofuel sector

The European Commission has confirmed that on 7 October 2014 its officials carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of companies active in the production, distribution and trading of the biofuel ethanol. The inspections took place in two EU Member States and follow previous inspections undertaken by the Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority in May 2013 in the crude oil, refined oil products and biofuel sectors. The Commission is concerned that price benchmarks may have been distorted as a result of anti-competitive conduct contrary to Article 101 and/or Article 102, including possible collusion when submitting price information to a Price Reporting Agency.

European CommissionfinesSlovak Telekom and its parent, Deutsche Telekom, for abusive conduct in the Slovak broadband market

The European Commission has imposed a fine of €38.8 million on  Slovak Telekom and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, for pursuing an abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services, in breach of Article 102. In particular, the Commission found that Slovak Telekom had refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors and imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators. As parent company, Deutsche Telekom received an additional fine of €31 million as it had already been  fined in 2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany. Click here.

The European Commission has found that Slovakian incumbent telecom operator Slovak Telecom a.s. and its parent company, Deutsche Telekom AG, had pursued for more than five years an "abusive strategy to shut out competitors from the Slovak market for broadband services" in violation of European Union antitrust rules. The commission imposed a  fine of 38.8 million euros ($49.7 million U.S.) on Slovak Telecom and DT and an additional 31 million euro ($39.6 million U.S.)  fine on DT to ensure "sufficient
deterrence as well as to sanction its repeated abusive behavior (recidivism) as it has already been  fined in
2003 for a margin squeeze in broadband markets in Germany." DT holds 51% of  Slovak Telekom's
shares and has a number of special rights to nominate the majority of board members and to be informed
about all management matters within Slovak Telecom, "allowing it to exercise decisive influence over the
company," the commission said. The commission said it found that DT "did indeed exercise decisive
influence notably through overlaps in senior management personnel and by influencing the
decision-making process at  Slovak Telekom. Under EU antitrust rules, parent companies exercising such
decisive influence are liable for infringements committed by their subsidiaries."
The Canadian government has announced an initiative to connect 280,000 more homes in rural and
remote regions to high-speed broadband connections. Industry Minister James Moore said eligible Internet
service providers can apply for funding to extend or enhance service in unserved and underserved areas.
ISPs could receive funding to cover as much as 50% of eligible project costs in most areas or as much as
75% of eligible costs in very remote or aboriginal communities. The government will determine the level of
the contribution by assessing how much is needed to complete the proposed project. ISPs receiving
funding will be expected to provide services at speeds of at least 5 megabits per second. The closing date
for applications is Jan. 12, 2015. The first projects are expected to be announced in spring 2015.

Cooperation with a Competitor Can Be Risky

The European Commission recently provided a reminder that cooperation agreements with competitors must be analysed carefully for compliance with competition law in the EU. The closer the arrangements are to the customer, the more significant the concerns will be.

TD
The case, originally opened in December 2011 following a complaint, relates to agreements between Honeywell and DuPont concerning production arrangements and the development of production processes for a new refrigerant (R-1234yf) for use in car air-conditioning systems. R-1234yf is currently the only commercially available refrigerant which complies with EU environmental standards for air conditioning systems in motor vehicles. Honeywell and DuPont are the only two suppliers of the refrigerant to car manufacturers.

The EC announced on 21 October 2014 that it is concerned that the arrangements may have hindered competition on the market for R-1234yf, in particular by limiting the availability of the product on the market and also by limiting its technical development. Original concerns that Honeywell may have engaged in deceptive conduct during the evaluation of 1234yf (a type of "patent ambush") have been dropped.

A key issue in the case, already raised by the parties, will be whether the EC's allegations conflict with its own guidelines and case precedent concerning horizontal cooperation between competitors, particularly given the environmental aspects.
Compliance Warning: Parent and Subsidiary  Fined Heavily for Refusal to Supply, Margin Squeeze and
Recidivism

On 15 October 2014, the EC announced that it had finedSlovak Telekom 39 million euros for abusing a dominant position in the Slovak broadband market. Deutsche Telekom, although not directly involved, was held jointly and severally liable for the abuse on the basis that it controlled the company through its
51 percent shareholding and majority on the board.

Slovak Telekom, the incumbent telecom operator in Slovakia, had refused to supply unbundled access to its local loops to competitors under fair conditions. It also had imposed a margin squeeze on alternative operators which made it impossible for them to use its local loops to offer retail broadband
services in competition with  Slovak Telekom without incurring a loss. The local loop is the metallic cable that connects a customer's premises with the local telephone exchange.

To add insult to injury, Deutsche Telekom was  fined an additional 31 million euros, since back in 2003, it (not Slovak Telekom) had been fined for the same type of abuse of dominance. This was despite the fact that the previous abuse had taken place in the German market.

This case shows once again how essential it is that suitable competition compliance programmes are in place in the EU and that these adequately cover all subsidiaries. Parent companies are liable for the behavior of their subsidiaries, and this can give rise to additional  fines for recidivism, even where the parent was not actively involved in the infringement.


Page 53 of 55 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The case also shows that any company relying on a dominant competitor for supplies or access may be able to use refusal-to-supply or margin-squeeze arguments to improve its competitive position in the EU.
State Aid and Tax: What is Going On?

There has been a lot of media attention recently on the EC's investigation into tax arrangements in certain EU jurisdictions. These include Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Gibraltar. But what exactly is the issue?

State aid is aid from a government body which a private sector entity would not have provided, or would have provided on different terms. It is in principle banned in the EU, although there are numerous exceptions.

State aid is normally visualised as being a grant or a subsidy, but it can take many forms, including alleged "sweetheart" tax deals. The recent high-profile EC announcements concern these types of arrangements − deals between individual companies and national tax authorities where, in the EC's words, the beneficiaries "can put enticing investments and job opportunities on the negotiating table" which "smaller companies" cannot match.

The EC has made it clear that it is not trying to harmonise tax policy across the EU by the back door. EU countries remain free to set their own policies; the EC is simply trying to ensure that, when implementing these, national authorities do not grant selective advantages to a few companies at the expense of all the others present in the same jurisdiction. Big must be treated in the same way as small.

Regardless, what is clear is that companies concerned about favourable tax treatment of competitors will receive a sympathetic ear at the EC. Complaints can be made and ultimately the beneficiaries of illegal aid via tax breaks may have to pay back the advantage received, plus interest. Clearly these sums can
be very large. There is a lot at stake.
