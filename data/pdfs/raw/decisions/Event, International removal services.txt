The Competition  Commission, playing the role of judge in the long-running feud between Britain's supermarkets and their passionate critics, has awarded even marks to both camps in its proposals. Hopes by critics of supermarkets for a forced sell-off of assets and land holdings to bring an end to the Tesco -town phenomenon, in which an entire area is dominated by one supermarket, found no sympathy from the Commission. The critics however convinced the Commission that the planning rules need a shake-up and the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers could be toxic.
PICKFORDS SET TO BE SNAPPED UP BY RIVAL London-based Team Relocations is in the final stages of
acquiring Pickfords, England's largest and oldest
company of removal contractors. The move comes only
days after the American owner of Pickfords said the
company needed a cash injection to stay afloat and
could be wound up unless a buyer was found. It is
thought that Team is negotiating to buy Pickfords for a
nominal sum in return for taking on the company's
mounting debts, a ten million pound pension deficit and
an insurance unit, which is heavily reliant on
inter-company loans. [20080216 031239 GMT]

Shares in Hampson Industries gained one penny to 147 pence after the aerospace company issued strong results. The shares fell after Eclipse, a US composite customer, delayed building its "very light jet". Eclipse is however now ready for full-scale production. Citigroup has reiterated its "buy" recommendation on the stock with a price target of 200 pence.

GLOBAL TRADER PLACED INTO ADMINISTRATION Global Trader  Europe has gone into administration after
the Financial Services Authority launched an
investigation into some of its clients' affairs. Smith & Adamson, the accountancy firm, has been appointed as administrator. GTE got into problems after one client was reportedly unable to meet large margin calls. GTE was bought last year by the South African brokerage group Purple Capital for 36 million  euros.
LACTALIS IS EIGHTH PRICE FIXER [20080216
031244 GMT]

The Office of Fair Trading on Friday said the US-based cheese maker Lactalis McLelland has become the eighth company to admit to taking part in an alleged dairy products price-fixing ring. The eight companies face penalties of up to 120 million pounds, though the amount to be collected by OFT will be lower as the companies qualify for "honesty rebates" after
co-operating with the investigation and accepting a deal. Tesco and Morrison are still under investigation.
Morrison took the issue further by instituting libel proceedings against the OFT.
SWEETER FIGURES GIVE BOOST TO TATE & LYLE Tate & Lyle , the UK sugar group, which issued three
profits warnings last year and was demoted from the
FTSE 100 last month, said its profits in the four months
to the end of January were "marginally ahead of our
expectations." The company said it expected pre-tax
profits in the six months to the end of March to be
"broadly similar" to the 117 million pounds it made in the
first half of its financial year. Its shares rose one penny
to 505.5 pence.

WIRELESS WOE [20080216 031252 GMT]

Anite, the software group, is expected to issue a trading update in March. The group has issued two profit warnings since September primarily because of problems at its wireless unit. Though Altium Securities said it remained cautious on the stock in the short term, it is thought there could be an improvement in the medium term outlook for the company, with a possible sale of the company's public sector division, a share buyback programme, a record January for its travel business and an expected upturn in the fortunes of its wireless business.
BUFFET SEES HEALTHY FUTURE IN DRUGS FIRMS Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company for Warren
Buffet, the billionaire investor, has declared in a filing in
the US on Friday that it had acquired 1.5 million shares
in GlaxoSmithKline in the form of American depository
receipts (ADRs) for 76 million dollars. The group also
acquired 3.6 million ADRs in
Sanofi-Aventis<SASI.PA.L> for 162.5 million dollars.
Though analysts see the latest investments as a
tentative vote of confidence in the pharmaceutical
sector, for GSK the good news was marred by a Food
and Drug Administration review of its rotavirus vaccine.

UK-based customers of British Airways and Virgin
Atlantic who took a long-haul flight between August 11
2004 and March 23 2006 could get a refund of up to 20
pounds per ticket after the airlines settled a class action
lawsuit. Some 5.65 million UK passengers are believed
to be covered by the lawsuit, which was brought by US
litigators after the airlines admitted fixing fuel surcharges
on tickets. BA is paying the lion's share of the
compensation. Both BA and Virgin will also cover the
cost of processing the refund.

BRITON EYES TOP JOB IN GERMANY

John Allan, a Briton, and Deutsche Post's chief financial officer, is widely tipped to takeover as chief executive of the Dax 30 company following the resignation of Klaus Zumwinkel on Friday. Allan joined Deutsche Post in
2005 following the company's takeover of the UK
logistics group Exel where he was chief executive.
Allan's succession is however not assured as he faces a
serious rival in Frank Appel, head of the company's
logistics division.

WATERFORD POSTS THREE PERCENT DROP IN SALES [20080216 031339 GMT]

Shares in Waterford Wedgwood fell 13.6 percent after the Irish crystal and  fine china maker reported a three percent fall in sales in the final three months of 2007 after a delayed cash injection disrupted production over the Christmas period. The company warned it would make a loss in the full year to the end of March, with sales expected to be about 700 million  euros.
HARPIC SALES HELP KEEP RECKITT FLUSH Reckitt Benckiser , the household products group best
known for its Harpic cleaners and Vanish fabric
treatments, reported a two percent rise to 292 million
pounds in profits for the final quarter of 2007 on the back
of a six percent increase in sales. Full year profits were
up 15 percent to 905 million pounds. While Reckitt
remains a highly defensive stock, it will have to stand up
to the supermarkets which will be under pressure to cut
suppliers' prices.

BRUSSELS, March 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined nearly a dozen removal companies operating in Belgium a total of almost 33 million euros ($51 million) for running a price-fixing and market-sharing cartel for 19 years.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.

Trust busters at the  European Union executive began investigating the sector in 2003 and found evidence including the presentation of bogus quotes to clients and companies compensating one another for lost bids.

The European Commission imposed, on 11 March,  fines totalling €32,755,500 on ten international removal companies present in Belgium for fixing prices, sharing the market and manipulating call for tender procedures for almost 19 years in violation of EU anti-trust rules.

The companies in question are Allied Arthur Pierre (€2.6), Compas (€134,000), Coppens (€104,000), Gosselin (€4.5 million), Interdean (€3.2 million), Mozer (€1,500), PuttersTeam (€395,000), Relocations (€3.5 million), Transworld (€246,000) and Ziegler (€9.2 million).

TD
The cartel, which lasted from October 1984 to September 2003, covered international door-to-door' removals to and from Belgium. In addition to sharing markets, the companies rigged bids in calls for tenders in the form of bogus quotes called cover quotes', specifies the  Commission in a press release.

The Commission had opened the investigation on its own initiative in 2003, by searching the premises of Allied Arthur Pierre, Interdean, Transworld and Ziegler. "The  Commission discovered this cartel on its own initiative, demonstrating that the  Commission has independent means to detect cartels and is using them successfully,» said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, who has been a waging war against cartels since her term started in late 2004.

"The inspections proved particularly successful and abundant evidence of  cartel activities was obtained," specifies the  Commission. In particular, it revealed a system of financial compensation for lost bids, called commissions', which the companies billed each other for. The companies then recuperated the
cost on the final bill, without the consumer knowing. They also cooperated in order to submit bogus quotes that made clients falsely believe that they had a choice based on competition.
From the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 1990s, the  cartel operated on the basis of written
price-fixing agreements.
LENIENCY

Allied Arthur Pierre's  fine was reduced by 50% because it cooperated in the investigation under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice. However, Exel Investments, its former parent company, cannot benefit from the leniency granted to Allied Arthur Pierre because Exel Investments could have applied for leniency but chose not to do so. Excel Investments has to settle a  fine of €8.9 million.

Finally, the  Commission sees no grounds for reducing the amounts of the  fines of four undertakings, who claimed their inability to pay. However, it exceptionally took into account the "particular circumstances concerning the individual situation of a fifth undertaking," Interdean, and reduced its  fine by 70%.

Brussels, 12/03/2008 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission imposed fines totalling €32 755
500 on Allied Arthur Pierre, Compas, Coppens, Gosselin, Interdean, Mozer, Putters, Team Relocations,
Transworld and Ziegler on Tuesday 11 March for fixing prices, sharing the market and rigging bids for
international  removal services, in violation of Article 81 of the EC Treaty's ban on cartels. The  cartel
operated for almost 19 years (from October 1984 to September 2003). Its members fixed prices,
presented bogus quotes to clients and compensated each other for lost bids. The  fine imposed on Allied
Arthur Pierre was reduced by 50% because it cooperated with the investigation under the 2002
Commission communication on leniency. The  Commission opened the investigation at its own initiative.

TD
The Commission opened the investigation with surprise inspections at the Belgian premises of Allied Arthur Pierre, Interdean, Transworld and Ziegler in September 2003. These inspections turned up abundant evidence of cartel activities. After the inspections, Allied Arthur Pierre submitted a leniency application. The cartel concerned international door-to-door removals to and from Belgium. The companies concerned agreed on prices, granted  removal contracts by rigging the bidding process using bogus quotes called “cover quotes” and used a system of financial compensation for lost bids, called “commissions”. These commissions were a hidden element of the final price paid by the consumer. Between the mid 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, the  cartel operated on the basis of written
price-fixing agreements. At the same time, arrangements were made concerning “commissions” and “cover quotes”. The  cartel members billed each other for the lost bids. They also collaborated to submit bogus quotes which made clients falsely believe that they had a choice based on competition.

In a press release, the  Commission stresses that these practices are a very serious infringement of the EC Treaty antitrust rules. When setting the  fines, the Commission took account of the duration and seriousness of the infringement. Exel Investments Limited, a former parent-company of Allied Arthur Pierre, cannot benefit from the leniency granted to that company because it did not choose to apply for such leniency itself. The  Commission sees no reason to reduce the amount of the  fines of four companies that claimed an inability to pay. It did, however, exceptionally take account of the inability to pay and special circumstances of a fifth company, Interdean, and reduced its  fine by 70%. The amounts of the fines by company are as follows: €2 600 000 for Allied Arthur Pierre (Belgium), €134 000 for Compas (Belgium), €104 000 for Coppens (Belgium), €8 900 000 for Exel Investments Ltd (UK), €4 500
000 for Gosselin (Belgium), €3 185 000 for Interdean (Belgium), €1 500 for Mozer (Belgium), €395 000 for
Putters (Belgium), €3 490 000 for Team Relocations (Belgium), €246 000 for Transworld (Belgium) and €9
200 000 for Ziegler (Belgium). (O.L.)
