The European Commission on Tuesday accepted commitments by South Korean electronics giant Samsung to allow competitors access to key basic patents, but rapped Google-owned  Motorola  for pursuing a case against Apple.
Samsung's commitment not to seek injunctions in Europe against companies using its Standard Essential
Patents for smartphones and tablet computers will be made legally binding, the Commission said.

TD
The Commission, the EU's executive arm, has been investigating Samsung for abusing its dominant market position in certain technologies after it took out injunctions against fierce rival Apple over use of its SEPs.

If there are any future disputes about the use of such patents, they will be settled under the industry standard of Fair, Reasonable and non-Discriminatory (FRAND) practice.

The Commission said that as a result, any company signing a licence accord with Samsung will now be protected against SEPs injunctions.

Protecting intellectual property is essential, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said, but it should not be "misused to the detriment of healthy competition and, ultimately, of consumers."

Samsung's commitment on SEPs "provides clarity to the industry on an appropriate framework to settle disputes over 'FRAND' terms in line with EU  antitrust rules," Almunia said in a statement.

"I would also encourage other industry players to consider establishing similar dispute resolution mechanisms," he added.

In a related case, the Commission said it had found  Motorola  Mobility at fault for abusing its dominant market position by pursuing a SEP injunction against Apple in a German court.

Motorola  Mobility will now have "to eliminate the negative effects resulting" from the case, it said, without, however, imposing a  fine.

Patent holders should get a fair return but companies seeking to use them should also be able to do so on FRAND terms, Almunia said.

BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Commission, the European Union's  competition watchdog, ruled on Tuesday that Motorola  Mobility broke EU competition rules by seeking an injunction against Apple on the basis of a smartphone patent.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

TD
"While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of inter-operable products," he said.

The Commission ruled that it was abusive for  Motorola  to seek an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of a patent it had committed to license. Apple had agreed to buy a licence and pay royalties.

The Commission did not to impose a  fine on Motorola  because there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality of such injunctions and because national courts have so far reached different conclusions on this. (Reporting By John O'Donnell and Jan Strupczewski)

* EU antitrust chief: Motorola  action against Apple illegal
* Samsung must honour pledge not to seek injunctions

TD
* Almunia: smartphone wars shouldn't be at consumers' expense (Recasts, adds quotes, details)
By John O'Donnell

BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Union's  antitrust enforcer has told two top smartphone makers to stop filing aggressive patent lawsuits against rivals such as Apple, aiming to end a patent war and open the market to freer  competition.

The European Commission reprimanded Motorola  Mobility on Tuesday for taking such action against Apple, hoping the ruling will halt a rising tide of legal disputes among rivals vying for profit in the global smartphone market.

The EU's anti-trust enforcer also said that Samsung Electronics must keep a promise not to seek injunctions against rivals if they sign a licensing agreement.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," said Joaquin
Almunia, the European commissioner in charge of anti-trust enforcement.

The landmark ruling will help draw a line under a long-running feud between smartphone makers and a slew of legal action against rivals by manufacturers who claimed their designs had been copied.

Although no  fine will be imposed on Google Inc's  Motorola,  the Commission ruled that the company had been wrong to seek an injunction against Apple in Germany for copying a 'standard-essential' patent, for which Apple had bought a license.

Such patents, which cover basic mobile technology such as the mechanism to make and end a phone call, have become the scene of bitter legal confrontation.

Phone companies often argue that their technology, such as Apple's slide-to-unlock keypad, should be covered by such legal protection to prevent rivals stealing a lead.
HIGH STAKES

Ever since Apple entered the market with its iPhone, smartphone makers have been seeking to mimic its success.

This has led to a series of claims and counter-claims by inventors that their technology had been stolen, including some of the basic building blocks of a mobile phone.

"The EU is being the voice of reason," said Ben Wood of advisory firm CCS Insight. "Smaller phone makers can no longer afford to get into protracted legal battles over patents. Essential patents, such as making a mobile phone connect to a mobile network, must be available.


Page 6 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We forecast that over 1.2 billion smart phones will be sold worldwide this year and this means the stakes are high."

The Commission ordered  Motorola  to resolve its dispute with Apple in Europe at the negotiating table, not in the courtroom.

"While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology," said Almunia.

The patent wars between tech companies, which also include Microsoft, Nokia and smaller rivals, underscore the fierce battle for market share in the lucrative mobile phone industry.

The world's top smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple, are suing each other in more than 10 countries. (Additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Larry King and Susan Fenton)

Samsung and Google's  Motorola  will not be allowed to ignite new "patent wars" against Apple over the use of essential mobile technology, after Brussels ruled that such legal battles were anti-competitive, stifled innovation and hurt consumers.

The European Commission said on Tuesday that  Motorola  breached EU antitrust rules for abusing its dominant position over a wireless patent that it considers to be vital for the entire mobile industry.

TD
Separately, Brussels said it had reached a deal with Samsung after the South Korean company agreed to stop patent injunctions against its rivals for using technology also deemed essential for the rest of the smartphone technology.

The key rulings will set the standard for future disputes over intellectual property in Europe, which have seen tech groups pitted one against the other in an aggressive battle to win over new customers in an ever more competitive environment.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," Joaquín
Almunia, the EU's  competition watchdog head, said on Tuesday.

"While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products."

Samsung and Motorola,  which Google is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo, will not face any fine but they will have to stop seeking and enforcing existing injunctions that break their commitment to license the technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Such agreement is considered to be vital by Brussels as it argues that it enables the development of industry standards.

Motorola  successfully launched the injunction against Apple in a German court. Brussels deemed the move unfair and uncompetitive as the technology in question was considered to be standard for the industry.

Brussels is concerned that unless it firmly intervenes in the matter the constant threat of injunctions between rivals will give holders of essential technology patents to much power when negotiating royalties.

Samsung, which faced a similar dispute with Apple, agreed not to seek any injunctions of its "standard essential patents" for a period of five years across the EU.

"The settlement implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation," the South Korean group said in an emailed statement.

"Samsung Electronics believes that the agreement with the  European Commission will reduce uncertainties and create greater clarity in the industry. Moreover, it demonstrates Samsung Electronics' commitment to finding solutions which balance the interests of both IP licensors and licensees."

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - The  European Commission said Monday that Google's  Motorola Mobility abused its market position in Europe by refusing to grant crucial technology licences to rival Apple, then suing Apple for patent infringement when the company used them anyway.

Separately, Samsung settled a case where it had tried to use its patents to block Apple from bringing a phone to market.

TD
But neither company was slapped with a  fine.

At a press conference, the Commission's chief  competition authority, Joaquin Almunia, said that's because it can be difficult to determine when a company has the right to protect its patents - which drive innovation - and when a dominant company is wielding the power a patent gives them to stifle competition and harm consumers.
"We are trying to strike the right balance" between patent holder rights and  competition rules,
Almunia said in Brussels, where the Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is based. "The
Motorola  case set up the framework we think should be followed."
Almunia said the dividing line should be when patents have become an industry standard.

In those cases, if someone wanting to use a patent agrees to pay "fair and reasonable terms" to use it, the holder must agree. In  Motorola  and other cases, disagreements about what's fair should be referred to arbitration - not used right away to block someone else from bringing a product to market.

Ultimately, however, companies may still decide to sue each other over patent infringement, as Apple, Samsung and others have been doing in courts around the world for several years.

Samsung agreed Tuesday not to try to seek injunctions against competitors for five years in Europe, and to submit future disagreements to arbitration along the lines Almunia suggested.

BRUSSELS--Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached the European Union's  antitrust rules in its bid to enforce a patent injunction against Apple Inc. in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be  fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola's
actions ultimately harmed consumers, after the company sought court injunctions against Apple over the
use of its patents instead of properly licensing the technology to its rival.

TD
Under EU guidelines, owners of patents that are essential for the implementation of a standard, such as
3G telecommunications, should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," EU  antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement. While patent-holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, users of such standards should be granted fair access to standardized technology, he said.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue but the commission said it decided not to impose a fine due to the lack of case law in EU courts dealing with such cases, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of its standard-essential patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.

The patents in question relate to GPRS, a part of the GSM standard, which is used to make mobile phone calls. Motorola  had said the patents were standard-essential, and therefore would be licensed to Apple on the usual "fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory," or FRAND, terms.

However, in 2011 Motorola  tried to take out and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany based on the patent, even though Apple had said it would pay royalties, as determined by a German court, to use the patented technology.

Motorola,  which makes smartphones that run on Google's Android software, was bought by the Cupertino, Calif., Internet giant in 2012 for $12.4 billion. Google is now selling  Motorola  Mobility's handset manufacturing business to Lenovo for $2.91 billion.

BRUSSELS--Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached European Unionantitrust rules in seeking to use its patents to block sales of Apple Inc. products in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be  fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.

Page 12 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola  had abused its market position and ultimately harmed consumers by seeking German court injunctions against Apple over the use of its patents, rather than properly licensing the technology to its rival.

Motorola  "used the threat of injunction to force Apple into a settlement agreement with very restrictive conditions," EU  antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," he said.

The dispute centers on the use of patents that are necessary for industry-standard products, such as cellphones. Under EU guidelines, the owners of such patents should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

The commission had criticized  Motorola  for creating "hold ups" with its injunctions, as Apple had been a "willing licensee," agreeing to the licensing terms and royalties set by the German court in trying to use patents for GPRS, a technology that is part of the GSM standard used for mobile communications.

Motorola  must now reach a fair licensing agreement with Apple within 12 months, or submit to a court for arbitration, Mr. Almunia said.

But the commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  due to the lack of relevant case law in EU courts, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue for violating the region's
antitrust rules.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola,  said the company had "followed the procedure established by the German courts," and was now "evaluating" the commission's ruling.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of key patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.
A spokesman for Samsung said the settlement "implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung
Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation."

The EU has become a key battleground in the global war over patents, as Mr. Almunia has increasingly flexed his regulatory muscles while Apple, Samsung,  Motorola,  Google, Nokia, Microsoft Corp. and others sued each other in courts across the globe.

The patents in question relate to GPRS, a part of the GSM standard, which is used to make mobile phone calls. Motorola  had said the patents were standard-essential, and therefore would be licensed to Apple on the usual "fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory," or FRAND, terms.

However, in 2011 Motorola  tried to take out and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany based on the patent, even though Apple had said it would pay royalties, as determined by a German court, to use the patented technology.
EU regulators opened an investigation into the case in April 2012 after they received protests from
Apple and Microsoft. The Microsoft investigation is continuing, Mr. Almunia said.

Motorola,  which makes smartphones that run on Google's Android software, was bought by the Cupertino, Calif., Internet giant in 2012 for $12.4 billion. Google is now selling  Motorola  Mobility's handset manufacturing business to Lenovo for $2.91 billion.

BRUSSELS--Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached the European Union's  antitrust rules in its bid to enforce a patent injunction against Apple Inc. in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be  fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola's
actions ultimately harmed consumers, after the company sought court injunctions against Apple over the
use of its patents instead of properly licensing the technology to its rival.

TD
Under EU guidelines, owners of patents that are essential for the implementation of a standard, such as
3G telecommunications, should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," EU  antitrust chief Joaquín Almunia said in a statement. While patent-holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, users of such standards should be granted fair access to standardized technology, he said.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue but the commission said it decided not to impose a fine due to the lack of case law in EU courts dealing with such cases, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of its standard-essential patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.

The patents in question relate to GPRS, a part of the GSM standard, which is used to make mobile phone calls. Motorola  had said the patents were standard-essential, and therefore would be licensed to Apple on the usual "fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory," or FRAND, terms.

However, in 2011 Motorola  tried to take out and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany based on the patent, even though Apple had said it would pay royalties, as determined by a German court, to use the patented technology.

BRUSSELS—Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached European Unionantitrust rules in seeking to use its patents to block sales of Apple Inc. products in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.

The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola  had abused its market position and ultimately harmed consumers by seeking German court injunctions against Apple over the use of its patents, rather than properly licensing the technology to its rival.

TD
Motorola  "used the threat of injunction to force Apple into a settlement agreement with very restrictive conditions," EU  antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," he said.

The dispute centers on the use of patents that are necessary for industry-standard products, such as cellphones. Under EU guidelines, the owners of such patents should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

The commission had criticized  Motorola  for creating "hold ups" with its injunctions, as Apple had been a "willing licensee," agreeing to the licensing terms and royalties set by the German court in trying to use patents for GPRS, a technology that is part of the GSM standard used for mobile communications.

Motorola  must now reach a fair licensing agreement with Apple within 12 months, or submit to a court for arbitration, Mr. Almunia said.

But the commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  due to the lack of relevant case law in EU courts, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue for violating the region's
antitrust rules.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola,  said the company had "followed the procedure established by the German courts," and was now "evaluating" the commission's ruling.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of key patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.
A spokesman for Samsung said the settlement "implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung
Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation."

BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on Tuesday ruled that  Motorola  Mobility (Motorola)  infringed the European Union (EU)'s antitrust rules by abusing its dominant position as a standard essential patent (SEP) holder.

The commission said it was abusive for  Motorola  to both seek and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of an SEP which it had committed to license on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and where Apple had agreed to take a license and be bound by a determination of the FRAND royalties by the relevant German court.

TD
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the competition rules," said Joaquin Almunia, vice President of the European Commission in charge of competition policy.
The Commission has ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from it.

Moreover, the Commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  in view of the fact that there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality of SEP-based injunctions and that national courts have so far reached diverging conclusion on this question.

SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Motorola  launched the injunction against Apple in Germany, while the EU believed the move unfair and uncompetitive for the technology in question was considered to be standard for the industry.

In a separate statement, the EU said it had reached a deal with Samsung after the company agreed to stop patent injunctions against its rivals.

"I welcome Samsung's commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm  competition," Almunia said in a statement.

"Today's decisions reflect the commission's balanced approach with respect to intellectual property rights and competition rules. Both  competition and the protection of intellectual property are essential to innovation and growth," he added.

Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation."

The EU has become a key battleground in the global war over patents, as Mr. Almunia has increasingly flexed his regulatory muscles while Apple, Samsung,  Motorola,  Google, Nokia, Microsoft Corp. and others sued each other in courts across the globe.

However, in 2011 Motorola  tried to take out and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany based on the patent, even though Apple had said it would pay royalties, as determined by a German court, to use the patented technology.

EU regulators opened an investigation into the case in April 2012 after they received protests from Apple and Microsoft. The Microsoft investigation is continuing, Mr. Almunia said.

Motorola,  which makes smartphones that run on Google's Android software, was bought by the Cupertino, Calif., Internet giant in 2012 for $12.4 billion. Google is now selling  Motorola  Mobility's handset manufacturing business to Lenovo for $2.91 billion.

BRUSSELS--Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached European Unionantitrust rules in seeking to use its patents to block sales of Apple Inc. products in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be  fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.

The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola  had abused its market position and ultimately harmed consumers by seeking German court injunctions against Apple over the use of its patents, rather than properly licensing the technology to its rival.

TD
Motorola  "used the threat of injunction to force Apple into a settlement agreement with very restrictive conditions," EU  antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," he said.

The dispute centers on the use of patents that are necessary for industry-standard products, such as cellphones. Under EU guidelines, the owners of such patents should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

The commission had criticized  Motorola  for creating "hold ups" with its injunctions, as Apple had been a "willing licensee," agreeing to the licensing terms and royalties set by the German court in trying to use patents for GPRS, a technology that is part of the GSM standard used for mobile communications.

Motorola  must now reach a fair licensing agreement with Apple within 12 months, or submit to a court for arbitration, Mr. Almunia said.

But the commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  due to the lack of relevant case law in EU courts, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue for violating the region's
antitrust rules.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola,  said the company had "followed the procedure established by the German courts," and was now "evaluating" the commission's ruling.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of key patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.
A spokesman for Samsung said the settlement "implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung

HD     EU finds  Motorola  lawsuit  against Apple in breach of competition laws

LP
Brussels (dpa) - A  Motorola  lawsuit against its competitor Apple in Germany demanding a ban on products that infringe on its mobile phone patents is in breach of European Unioncompetition rules, the bloc's executive ruled Monday.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," said EU
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

TD
At issue are so-called standard essential patents, which firms must license to others in a "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory" way because of their importance to the industry. They cover standards for wireless communication, video compression and wireless networks.

The European Commission found that  Motorola  had violated antitrust rules by enforcing a court injunction against Apple in Germany, even though the technology giant had agreed to pay patent royalties to its rival.

However it did not slap  Motorola  with a fine, arguing that there were no legal precedents at EU level and that national courts had reached divergent rulings on the issue.

As a mobile phone pioneer, US-based  Motorola  had a treasure chest of some 17,000 patents and 6,800 patent applications, according to earlier reports.
Its wireless arm,  Motorola  Mobility, was acquired by Google in 2012, but is in the process of being sold to
Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo.

Also Tuesday, the commission confirmed a deal with South Korean electronics giant Samsung, which has agreed not to seek injunctions in Europe over its standard essential patents, if smartphone and tablet computer manufacturers agree to certain licencing conditions.

The commission's decisions should provide "legal clarity" for future cases, Almunia said, adding that it was important to strike the right balance between the interests of patent holders and companies seeking to abide by common standards.

"It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products," Almunia said.

BRUSSELS--Cellphone maker  Motorola  Mobility breached European Unionantitrust rules in seeking to use its patents to block sales of Apple Inc. products in Germany, but the Google Inc. unit won't be  fined for the violation, EU regulators said Tuesday.

The European Commission, which acts as the EU's central  antitrust authority, said  Motorola  had abused its market position and ultimately harmed consumers by seeking German court injunctions against Apple over the use of its patents, rather than properly licensing the technology to its rival.

TD
Motorola  "used the threat of injunction to force Apple into a settlement agreement with very restrictive conditions," EU  antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," he said.

The dispute centers on the use of patents that are necessary for industry-standard products, such as cellphones. Under EU guidelines, the owners of such patents should license them on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.

The commission had criticized  Motorola  for creating "hold ups" with its injunctions, as Apple had been a "willing licensee," agreeing to the licensing terms and royalties set by the German court in trying to use patents for GPRS, a technology that is part of the GSM standard used for mobile communications.

Motorola  must now reach a fair licensing agreement with Apple within 12 months, or submit to a court for arbitration, Mr. Almunia said.

But the commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  due to the lack of relevant case law in EU courts, and diverging conclusions in national courts.

Motorola  could have been fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue for violating the region's
antitrust rules.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola,  said the company had "followed the procedure established by the German courts," and was now "evaluating" the commission's ruling.

The commission also said it had accepted commitments by Samsung Electronics Co. not to seek injunctions in Europe for five years over the use of key patents. The EU had issued a formal complaint in late 2012 over Samsung's attempts to use injunctions against Apple.
A spokesman for Samsung said the settlement "implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung
Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation."

The EU has become a key battleground in the global war over patents, as Mr. Almunia has increasingly flexed his regulatory muscles while Apple, Samsung,  Motorola,  Google, Nokia, Microsoft Corp. and others sued each other in courts across the globe.

The patents in question relate to GPRS, a part of the GSM standard, which is used to make mobile phone calls. Motorola  had said the patents were standard-essential, and therefore would be licensed to Apple on the usual "fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory," or FRAND, terms.

However, in 2011 Motorola  tried to take out and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany based on the patent, even though Apple had said it would pay royalties, as determined by a German court, to use the patented technology.

EU regulators opened an investigation into the case in April 2012 after they received protests from Apple and Microsoft. The Microsoft investigation is continuing, Mr. Almunia said.

Motorola,  which makes smartphones that run on Google's Android software, was bought by the Cupertino, Calif., Internet giant in 2012 for $12.4 billion. Google is now selling  Motorola  Mobility's handset manufacturing business to Lenovo for $2.91 billion.

Samsung and Google's  Motorola  will not be allowed to ignite new "patent wars" against Apple over the use of essential mobile technology, after Brussels ruled that such legal battles were anti-competitive, stifled innovation and hurt consumers.

The European Commission said on Tuesday that  Motorola  breached EU antitrust rules for abusing its dominant position over a wireless patent that it considers to be vital for the entire mobile industry.

TD
Separately, Brussels said it had reached a deal with Samsung after the South Korean company agreed to stop patent injunctions against its rivals for using technology also deemed essential for the rest of the smartphone technology.

The key rulings will set the standard for future disputes over intellectual property in Europe, which have seen tech groups pitted one against the other in an aggressive battle to win over new customers in an ever more competitive environment.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," Joaquín
Almunia, the EU's  competition watchdog head, said on Tuesday.

"While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products."

Samsung and Motorola,  which Google is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo, will not face any fine but they will have to stop seeking and enforcing existing injunctions that break their commitment to license the technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Such agreement is considered to be vital by Brussels as it argues that it enables the development of industry standards.

Motorola  successfully launched the injunction against Apple in a German court. Brussels deemed the move unfair and uncompetitive as the technology in question was considered to be standard for the industry.

Brussels is concerned that unless it firmly intervenes in the matter the constant threat of injunctions between rivals will give holders of essential technology patents to much power when negotiating royalties.

Samsung, which faced a similar dispute with Apple, agreed not to seek any injunctions of its "standard essential patents" for a period of five years across the EU.

"The settlement implies no wrongdoing on behalf of Samsung Electronics and brings an end to the commission's investigation," the South Korean group said in an emailed statement.

"Samsung Electronics believes that the agreement with the  European Commission will reduce uncertainties and create greater clarity in the industry. Moreover, it demonstrates Samsung Electronics' commitment to finding solutions which balance the interests of both IP licensors and licensees."

TD
Brussels, 29/04/2014 (Agence Europe) - On Tuesday 29 April, the  European Commission rendered commitments offered by Samsung Electronics (Samsung) in September 2013 in response to accusations of abuse of its patent rights legally binding under EU  antitrust rules. According to these commitments, Samsung will not seek injunctions in the European Economic Area on the basis of its standard essential patents (SEPs) for smartphones and tablets against licensees who sign up to a specified licensing framework.

The licensing framework provides for a negotiation period of up to 12 months and if no agreement is reached, a third party determination of FRAND terms by a court if either party chooses, or by an arbitrator if both parties agree on this. An independent monitoring trustee will advise the Commission in overseeing the proper implementation of the commitments. If Samsung fails to abide by its commitments, it may be fined up to 100% of global annual turnover but, at a press conference, Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that only companies involved in price-fixing get fined 100% of turnover, and
anti-trust  fines rarely exceed 1-2% of annual turnover.

Commenting on the Samsung case, Almunia said: “It is essential that intellectual property is not misused to the detriment of healthy  competition and, ultimately, of consumers. In this context, I welcome Samsung's commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm  competition. Together with today's decision in the  Motorola  case, the Commission's decision to accept Samsung's commitments provides clarity to the industry on what
constitutes an appropriate framework to settle disputes over 'FRAND' terms in line with EU  antitrust rules. I would also encourage other industry players to consider establishing similar dispute resolution mechanisms”.

Samsung owns SEPs related to various mobile telecommunications standards and committed in 1998 to license these SEPs on FRAND terms. In April 2011, however, Samsung started to seek injunctions against Apple on the basis of its SEPs. The Samsung SEPs in question relate to the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute's (ETSI) 3G UMTS standard, a key industry standard for
mobile and wireless communications. The Commission opened an investigation in January 2012, outlining its legal concerns to Samsung in December 2012. (EL)

Brussels, 29/04/2014 (Agence Europe) - On Tuesday 29 April, the  European Commission ruled that Motorola  Mobility's (Motorola)  seeking and enforcement of an injunction against Apple before a German court on the basis of a smartphone standard essential patent (SEP) constitutes an  abuse of a dominant position prohibited by EU  antitrust rules in view of the particular circumstances in which the injunction was used. The Commission has ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from the
injunction but has not  fined the company given the absence of a legal framework and the fact that national court rulings on similar SEP injunctions vary widely.

TD
SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents. This may give companies owning SEPs significant market power. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (so-called “FRAND”) terms. Seeking injunctions before courts is generally a legitimate remedy for patent holders in case of patent infringements. However, the seeking of an injunction based on SEPs may constitute an  abuse of a dominant position if a SEP holder has given a voluntary commitment to license its SEPs on FRAND terms and where the company against which an injunction is sought is willing to enter into a licence agreement on such FRAND terms.

Motorola  took Apple to court over some of its SEPs for the GPRS standard (part of the GSM standard), which is vital for mobile and wireless communications. The Commission has ruled that the injunction against Apple infringed the FRAND terms.

The Commission says that  Motorola  persisted in using the threat of an injunction to force Apple into a settlement agreement with very restrictive conditions.

“While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products”, said  Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, adding: '”Our decision on Motorola  (…) provides legal clarity on the circumstances in which injunctions to enforce standard essential patents can be anti-competitive. This will also contribute to ensuring the proper functioning of standard-setting in Europe”. (EL)

HD           Almunia  brokers  truce in patent wars

Two rulings by the  European Commission may signal an end to a series of long-running disputes –
labelled “patent wars” – between technology giants.

Google’s Motorola  broke European Unioncompetition rules by trying to remove from the German market Apple iPhones and iPads, which used certain Motorola  patents without a licence, the Commission ruled yesterday (29 April). It also announced a settlement with Samsung, which had sought similar injunctions against Apple products.

TD
The two cases provide landmark guidance on how technology companies can license patents included in an industry standard.  Motorola  escaped a fine because of the novelty of the case. The cases relate to the 3G and GSM standards for mobile phones, to which both Samsung and  Motorola patented technology.

Since these standards are fundamental for mobile phones to work, the main patents included are called standard essential patents (SEPs) and must be licensed out in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.

In 2011, Apple complained to the Commission that rivals Samsung and  Motorola  were taking advantage of their patents’ inclusion in the standards to demand extortionate royalties from Apple. The companies responded that Apple, which made nearly €5 billion profit in the final quarter of 2011 alone, was refusing to negotiate a reasonable fee.

Abuse of power

A number of other technology companies have filed complaints with the Commission accusing SEP owners of abusing their market power, in a series of global disputes known as the patent wars. The Commission is still investigating a similar complaint against  Motorola  by Microsoft.

The settlement with Samsung sets out a framework for licensors to follow to ensure that they do not breach EU competition rules. Under the settlement, if after 12 months of negotiations no compromise has been reached on the royalty rate, the parties must allow a court or an arbitrator to fix the price for them.

The decision against  Motorola  also held that licensors cannot, as is sometimes the case now, prevent their licensees from challenging the validity of their patents in court – an important principle since 50% of challenges succeed.

“Intellectual property rights should not be abused to the detriment of  competition and consumers,” Joaquín Almunia, the European commissioner for  competition, said yesterday.

US mobile phone manufacturer  Motorola  has abused its patent power against sector player Apple, the European Commission (EC) decided after almost a two-year examination of the patent war in the mobile industry.
The investigation into  Motorola  was opened after Apple and Microsoft had filed complaints.

TD
According to the European Union's central  antitrust authority, the way in which  Motorola  used an injunction against Apple in Germany violated the European regulation.
However, the EC will not impose a  fine on Motorola.

The European Commission moved yesterday to stem aggressive patent lawsuits by smartphone and tablet makers against rivals, ruling that  Motorola  Mobility had broken EU law by taking such action against Apple.

TD
In a dual ruling, the commission said that it had also accepted a pledge by Samsung Electronics not to seek injunctions against rivals if they had signed up to a licensing agreement for smartphones or tablets. The landmark ruling will help draw a line under a long-running feud between smartphone makers and a slew of legal action against rivals by manufacturers who claimed they had copied their designs. No  fine will be imposed on Motorola,  now owned by Google. Case law on the point was unclear. The commission ruled nonetheless that it was abusive for  Motorola  to seek an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of a ‘standard-essential’ patent it had committed to license. Apple had agreed to buy a licence and pay royalties. It ordered  Motorola  to resolve its dispute with Apple through arbitration. "The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," said EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms." The patent wars underscore the battle for market share in the lucrative mobile phone industry. The world’s top smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple, are suing each other in more than 10 countries.

HD           Europe’s  Antitrust Chief Censures Google’s  Motorola  Mobility Over Key Patents

BRUSSELS —  Motorola  Mobility broke European Union law by trying to wield unfair control over its basic patents for communications technologies used in smartphones and tablet computers, Europe’s antitrust chief said on Tuesday. But the commissioner did not  fine the company, which is owned by Google.
The decision by Joaquín Almunia, the European Unioncompetition commissioner, is aimed at
quelling the patent wars involving technology titans like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. In the
case at issue,  Motorola  brandished a court injunction it won against Apple in a patent dispute in
Germany to unfairly impede  competition, Mr. Almunia’s office concluded.

TD
Tuesday’s ruling is an attempt to create more uniform rules of engagement for mobile technology patent disputes in the European Union. At stake are so-called standard essential patents in mobile communications that are used by Apple and other technology companies to make compatible products and help devices like iPhones, iPads and other types of smartphones and tablets communicate.

The European ruling is the strongest statement to date that  antitrust authorities object to companies’ using patents deemed vital for communications and data-handling in devices as weapons to stymie rivals. But the decision is very much in line with the rulings and guidelines issued by the  antitrust agencies in the United States.

On both sides of the Atlantic,  antitrust experts say, regulators’ goal is to make patent disputes a matter of price negotiations rather than trade barriers. The picture in American courts is mixed, however.

Senior regulators around the world have grown increasingly concerned that it has become too easy for companies to win injunctions in national courts that could force manufacturers to withdraw popular products from the market. Mr. Almunia’s ruling would make it more difficult for companies to go
court-shopping among member states in Europe in a way that can impede  competition.

“The Motorola  case set up the framework that we think should be followed in all the cases where the holder of standard essential patents can  abuse their market power,” Mr. Almunia said at a news conference. “The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers,” he said. “This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules.”

The case has its origins in a disagreement between Apple and  Motorola  over the licensing of mobile communications patents, and over Apple’s right to challenge the validity of  Motorola’s  patents. By late
2011, as the dispute escalated,  Motorola  succeeded in winning an injunction from a German court in Mannheim that allowed the company to seek a ban on the distribution of Apple’s flagship products in Germany.

In February 2012, when  Motorola  sought to enforce the injunction, Apple reluctantly agreed not to challenge the wide variety of telecommunications patents held by  Motorola.  Those patents are vital for communicating over network systems including 2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi.

At about the same time Apple complained to the  antitrust authorities in Brussels. Mr. Almunia began
a formal investigation of Motorola  in April 2012 after complaints by Apple and also by Microsoft, which
wanted to ensure access to video and wireless patents for products like the Xbox.

On Tuesday, Mr. Almunia decided that  Motorola  must now revise the agreement with Apple, removing the restrictions on its ability to challenge the validity of  Motorola’s  patents.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola  Mobility, said in an email message that her company agreed “that injunctions should only be sought against unwilling licensees” but that, “in this case, Motorola  Mobility followed the procedure established by the German courts.” Ms. Dove added, “We are now evaluating” the decision. She declined to respond to a follow-up message about whether Motorola  would appeal.

Google announced in August 2011 that it would acquire  Motorola  Mobility for $12.5 billion. The deal was mainly to acquire patents, including many related to wireless devices, to bolster Google’s Android software operating system, which has become the global leader in smartphone operating systems. When Mr. Almunia  gave European regulatory approval for the deal in early 2012, he warned that he would not exonerate any past wrongdoing by  Motorola.

The acquisition received United States approval in January 2013 from the Federal Trade Commission. The F.T.C. cleared the deal only after Google pledged to license essential communications and data software patents on “fair and reasonable” terms.

That same month, the F.T.C. and the Department of Justice, joined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, issued guidelines to the International Trade Commission, which often reviews trade-related patent cases. The agencies instructed the trade commission not to halt the shipment of goods into the United States based on patent claims, as long as the two sides were willing to negotiate.

In the European case, Mr. Almunia’s office signaled in February that  Motorola  might face a rebuke. The previous month, Google had said it planned to sell  Motorola  to Lenovo, but would still keep a valuable portfolio of patents. That sale is awaiting regulatory approval.

Despite the lack of a  fine in Tuesday’s European ruling, the decision should give valuable guidance to the technology industry, said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law, in New Jersey.

The “decision confirms that patent holders cannot obtain injunctions against willing licensees,” Mr. Carrier said. “But the complexity of the issue likely convinced the E.C. not to issue a  fine against Motorola,”  he said, referring to the  European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union.

The commission has leeway to charge as much as 10 percent of a company’s most recent global annual sales for antitrust abuses. Google, as the parent company of Motorola,  could have faced a large fine. Google’s Android operating system is still the subject of a separate antitrust inquiry by Mr. Almunia, who is questioning whether the company has used any unfair tactics to secure its
world-leading position.

Mr. Almunia said he regarded some attempts by companies like  Motorola  to assert their claims to patents as valid. But he warned that holders of certain so-called standard-essential patents who had already consented to license them had to meet certain standards before resorting to court action.

“While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardized technology on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms,” Mr. Almunia said. “It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products,” he said.

In a separate decision, Mr. Almunia approved a settlement with Samsung in a similar case after the South Korean company agreed not to take rivals to court over patent disputes concerning patents and tablets.

In that case, Apple had complained about Samsung’s use of designs and packaging from the iPhone and iPad, while Samsung had accused Apple of infringing upon its wireless telecommunications patents.

“I welcome Samsung’s commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm  competition,” Mr. Almunia said.

Samsung and Apple are still engaged in a smartphone patent dispute in federal court in San
Francisco, where closing arguments were taking place on Tuesday.

In the United States, there have been federal court rulings limiting the use of essential patents to hinder a competitor. But those have been in specific cases. Just last week, the federal appeals court that oversees patent cases reversed parts of an emphatic ruling in 2012 that sought to curb the use of such patents as weapons. In that widely followed case, Judge Richard A. Posner tossed out the case, finding the claims of both Apple and Google’s  Motorola  lacking.

Last week, the federal circuit court said Judge Posner went too far in suggesting that essential patents could not be used for injunctions to stop the shipments of a competitor’s product. But the majority opinion, by Judge Jimmie V. Reyna, also found that the  Motorola  patents in the case did not warrant an injunction. There were dissenting opinions from other judges.
“The courts are in a state of disarray on this issue,” said Arti K. Rai, a professor at the Duke University
School of Law and a former senior official in the patent office.

Case ruling comes on the same day as Samsung decision

Motorola  has avoided a fine from the European Commission (EC), despite being found to have misused standard essential patents (SEPs) to wage a patent war against Apple.

TD
The case related to  a legal challenge that Motorola   had brought against Apple in Germany over a key patent relating to General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, used for data connections in smartphones.  Motorola  had previously agreed to provide the ability to license this patent, as part of the wider European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute GPRS standard.

However, the EC said  Motorola  had then abused this by trying to claim an injunction against Apple based on this patent, despite Apple having agreed to pay the necessary licence fee for its use.

Competition vice president for the EC Joaquín Almunia said the case underlined the importance of avoiding patent spats by ensuring firms with key SEPs did not see this as a chance to harm rivals, and ultimately consumers.

"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules. Our decision on  Motorola  provides legal clarity on the circumstances in which injunctions to enforce standard essential patents can be anti-competitive,” he said.

“This will also contribute to ensuring the proper functioning of standard-setting in Europe. While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.”

V3 contacted  Motorola  for any comment in response to the ruling but had received no reply at the time of publication. Apple had also not responded to a request for comment.

Motorola  avoided a fine because the EC ruled there was not enough prior case law to determine what, if any, sort of penalty should be handed down, as numerous national courts have given divided responses to such situations.

(MENAFN - Arab News) Brussels: the  european commission has accepted commitments by south korean electronics giant samsung to allow competitors access to key basic patents but rapped google-owned motorola for pursuing a case against apple.

samsung's commitment not to seek injunctions in europe against companies using its standard essential patents for smartphones and tablet computers will be made legally binding the commission said.

TD
the commission the eu's executive arm has been investigating samsung for abusing its dominant market position in certain technologies after it took out injunctions against fierce rival apple over use of its seps.

if there are any future disputes about the use of such patents they will be settled under the industry standard of fair reasonable and non-discriminatory (frand) practice.

thecommission said that as a result any company signing a licence accord with samsung will now be protected against seps injunctions.

protecting intellectual property is essential eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said but it should not be 'misused to the detriment of healthy competition and ultimately of consumers."

samsung's commitment on seps 'provides clarity to the industry on an appropriate framework to settle disputes over 'frand' terms in line with eu  antitrust rules" almunia said in a statement.

'i would also encourage other industry players to consider establishing similar dispute resolution mechanisms" he added.

in a related case the commission said it had found  motorola mobility at fault for abusing its dominant market position by pursuing a sep injunction against apple in a german court.

motorola mobility will now have 'to eliminate the negative effects resulting" from the case it said without however imposing a  fine.

patent holders should get a fair return but companies seeking to use them should also be able to do so on frand terms almunia said.

Samsung and Google's  Motorola  will not be allowed to ignite new "patent wars" against Apple over the use of essential mobile technology after Brussels ruled that such legal battles were anticompetitive, stifled innovation and hurt consumers.

The European Commission said yesterday that  Motorola  had breached EU antitrust rules by abusing its dominant position over a wireless patent that it considers to be vital for the entire mobile industry.

TD
Separately, Brussels said it had reached a deal with Samsung after the South Korean company agreed to stop patent injunctions against rivals for using technology also deemed essential for the rest of the smartphone technology.

The key rulings will set the standard for future disputes over intellectual property in Europe, which have seen tech groups pitted against each other in an aggressive battle to win customers in an ever more competitive environment.
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers," Joaquín
Almunia, the EU's  competition watchdog head, said yesterday.

Samsung and Motorola,  which Google is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo, will not face any fine but they will have to stop seeking and enforcing existing injunctions that break their commitment to license the technology on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms. Such agreement is considered to be vital by Brussels, as it argues that it enables the development of industry standards.

The European Commission said on 29 April 2014 that  Motorola  infringed European Unionantitrust rules for abusing its dominant position as a standard essential patent holder. The commission said it was abusive for Motorola  to both enforce and seek an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of an SEP, which it had committed to license on FRAND terms and where Apple had agreed to take a licence and be bound by a determination of the FRAND royalties by the relevant German court. Joaquin Almunia, Vice President of the  European Commission responsible for competition policy said, "The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules. .

The commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola.

Motorola  launched the injunction against Apple in Germany, while the EU thought the move was uncompetitive and unfair for the technology in question was thought to be standard for the industry. In a separate statement, the EU said it reached a deal with Samsung after the company agreed to stop patent injunctions against its rivals. Almunia said in a statement, "I welcome Samsung's commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm competition. Today's decisions reflect the commission's balanced approach with respect to intellectual property rights and  competition rules. Both  competition and the protection of intellectual property are essential to innovation and growth.

BRUSSELS, April 30 -- The European Commission on Tuesday ruled that  Motorola  Mobility (Motorola) infringed the European Union (EU)'s antitrust rules by abusing its dominant position as a standard essential patent (SEP) holder.
The commission said it was abusive for  Motorola  to both seek and enforce an injunction against Apple in
Germany on the basis of an SEP which it had committed to license on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and where Apple had agreed to take a license and be bound by a
determination of the FRAND royalties by the relevant German court.

TD
"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the competition rules," said Joaquin Almunia, vice President of the European Commission in charge of competition policy.
The Commission has ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from it.

Moreover, the Commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  in view of the fact that there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality of SEP-based injunctions and that national courts have so far reached diverging conclusion on this question.

SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on FRAND terms. (PNA/Xinhua)

Motorola  Mobility broke European Union law by trying to wield unfair control over its basic patents for communications technologies used in smartphones and tablet computers, Europe’s  antitrust chief said on Tuesday. But the commissioner did not  fine the company, which is owned by Google.

The decision by Joaquín Almunia, the union’s  competition commissioner, is aimed at quelling the patent wars involving technology titans like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. In the case at issue, Motorola  brandished a court injunction it won against Apple in a patent dispute in Germany to unfairly impede competition, Mr. Almunia’s office concluded.

TD
Tuesday’s ruling is an attempt to create more uniform rules of engagement for mobile technology patent disputes in the union. At stake are so-called standard essential patents in mobile communications that are used by Apple and other technology companies to make compatible products and help devices like iPhones, iPads and other types of smartphones and tablets communicate.

The European ruling is the strongest statement to date that  antitrust authorities object to companies’ using patents deemed vital for communications and data-handling in smartphones and other devices as weapons to stymie rivals. But the decision is very much in line with the rulings and guidelines issued by the antitrust agencies in the United States. On both sides of the Atlantic,  antitrust experts say, regulators’ goal is to make patent disputes a matter of price negotiations rather than trade barriers. The picture in American courts is mixed, however.

Senior regulators around the world have grown increasingly concerned that it has become too easy for companies to win injunctions in national courts that could force manufacturers to withdraw popular products from the market. Mr. Almunia’s ruling would make it more difficult for companies to go
court-shopping among member states in Europe in a way that can impede  competition.

‘‘The Motorola  case set up the framework that we think should be followed in all the cases where the holder of standard essential patents can  abuse their market power,’’ Mr. Almunia said during a news conference. ‘‘The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers,’’ he said. ‘‘This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules.’’

The case has its origins in a disagreement between Apple and  Motorola  over the licensing of mobile communications patents, and over Apple’s right to challenge the validity of  Motorola’s  patents. By late
2011, as the dispute escalated,  Motorola  succeeded in winning an injunction from a German court in Mannheim that allowed the company to seek a ban on the distribution of Apple’s flagship products in Germany.

In February 2012, when  Motorola  sought to enforce the injunction, Apple reluctantly agreed not to challenge the wide variety of telecommunications patents held by  Motorola.  Those patents are vital for communicating over network systems including 2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi.

Now, Mr. Almunia has decided that  Motorola  must now revise the agreement with Apple, removing the restrictions on its ability to challenge the validity of  Motorola’s  patents.

oversees patent cases reversed parts of an emphatic ruling in 2012 that sought to curb the use of such patents as weapons. In that widely followed case, Judge Richard A. Posner tossed out the case, finding the claims of both Apple and Google’s  Motorola  lacking.

Last week, the federal circuit court said Judge Posner went too in suggesting that essential patents could not be used for injunctions to stop the shipments of a competitor’s product. But the majority opinion, by Judge Jimmie V. Reyna, also found that the  Motorola  patents in the case did not warrant an injunction. There were dissenting opinions from other judges.
‘‘The courts are in a state of disarray on this issue,’’ said Arti K. Rai, a professor at the Duke University
School of Law, in North Carolina, and a former senior official in the United States patent office.

BRUSSELS --  Motorola  Mobility broke European Union law by trying to wield unfair control over its basic patents for communications technologies used in smartphones and tablet computers, Europe's antitrust chief said on Tuesday. But the commissioner did not  fine the company, which is owned by Google.

TD
The decision by Joaquín Almunia, the European Unioncompetition commissioner, is aimed at
quelling the patent wars involving technology titans like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. In the
case at issue,  Motorola  brandished a court injunction it won against Apple in a patent dispute in
Germany to unfairly impede  competition, Mr. Almunia's office concluded.

Tuesday's ruling is an attempt to create more uniform rules of engagement for mobile technology patent disputes in the European Union. At stake are so-called standard essential patents in mobile communications that are used by Apple and other technology companies to make compatible products and help devices like iPhones, iPads and other types of smartphones and tablets communicate.

The European ruling is the strongest statement to date that  antitrust authorities object to companies' using patents deemed vital for communications and data-handling in devices as weapons to stymie rivals. But the decision is very much in line with the rulings and guidelines issued by the  antitrust agencies in the United States.

On both sides of the Atlantic,  antitrust experts say, regulators' goal is to make patent disputes a matter of price negotiations rather than trade barriers. The picture in American courts is mixed, however.

Senior regulators around the world have grown increasingly concerned that it has become too easy for companies to win injunctions in national courts that could force manufacturers to withdraw popular products from the market. Mr. Almunia's ruling would make it more difficult for companies to go
court-shopping among member states in Europe in a way that can impede  competition.

''The  Motorola  case set up the framework that we think should be followed in all the cases where the holder of standard essential patents can  abuse their market power,'' Mr. Almunia said at a news conference. ''The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers,'' he said. ''This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules.''

The case has its origins in a disagreement between Apple and  Motorola  over the licensing of mobile communications patents, and over Apple's right to challenge the validity of  Motorola's  patents. By late
2011, as the dispute escalated,  Motorola  succeeded in winning an injunction from a German court in Mannheim that allowed the company to seek a ban on the distribution of Apple's flagship products in Germany.



Page 58 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In February 2012, when  Motorola  sought to enforce the injunction, Apple reluctantly agreed not to challenge the wide variety of telecommunications patents held by  Motorola.  Those patents are vital for communicating over network systems including 2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi.
At about the same time Apple complained to the  antitrust authorities in Brussels. Mr. Almunia began
a formal investigation of  Motorola  in April 2012 after complaints by Apple and also by Microsoft, which
wanted to ensure access to video and wireless patents for products like the Xbox.

On Tuesday, Mr. Almunia decided that  Motorola  must now revise the agreement with Apple, removing the restrictions on its ability to challenge the validity of  Motorola's  patents.

Katie Dove, a spokeswoman for  Motorola  Mobility, said in an email message that her company agreed ''that injunctions should only be sought against unwilling licensees'' but that, ''in this case, Motorola  Mobility followed the procedure established by the German courts.'' Ms. Dove added, ''We are now evaluating'' the decision. She declined to respond to a follow-up message about whether Motorola  would appeal.

Google announced in August 2011 that it would acquire  Motorola  Mobility for $12.5 billion. The deal was mainly to acquire patents, including many related to wireless devices, to bolster Google's Android software operating system, which has become the global leader in smartphone operating systems. When Mr. Almunia gave European regulatory approval for the deal in early 2012, he warned that he would not exonerate any past wrongdoing by  Motorola.

The acquisition received United States approval in January 2013 from the Federal Trade Commission. The F.T.C. cleared the deal only after Google pledged to license essential communications and data software patents on ''fair and reasonable'' terms.

That same month, the F.T.C. and the Department of Justice, joined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, issued guidelines to the International Trade Commission, which often reviews trade-related patent cases. The agencies instructed the trade commission not to halt the shipment of goods into the United States based on patent claims, as long as the two sides were willing to negotiate.

In the European case, Mr. Almunia's office signaled in February that  Motorola  might face a rebuke. The previous month, Google had said it planned to sell  Motorola  to Lenovo, but would still keep a valuable portfolio of patents. That sale is seeking regulatory approval.

Despite the lack of a  fine in Tuesday's European ruling, the decision should give valuable guidance to the technology industry, said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law, in New Jersey.

The ''decision confirms that patent holders cannot obtain injunctions against willing licensees,'' Mr. Carrier said. ''But the complexity of the issue likely convinced the E.C. not to issue a  fine against Motorola,''  he said, referring to the  European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union.

The commission has leeway to charge as much as 10 percent of a company's most recent global annual sales for antitrust abuses. Google, as the parent company of Motorola,  could have faced a large fine. Google's Android operating system is still the subject of a separate antitrust inquiry by Mr. Almunia, who is questioning whether the company has used any unfair tactics to secure its
world-leading position.

Mr. Almunia said he regarded some attempts by companies like  Motorola  to assert their claims to patents as valid. But he warned that holders of certain so-called standard-essential patents who had already consented to license them had to meet certain standards before resorting to court action.

''While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardized technology on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms,'' Mr. Almunia said. ''It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products,'' he said.

In a separate decision, Mr. Almunia approved a settlement with Samsung in a similar case after the South Korean company agreed not to take rivals to court over patent disputes concerning patents and tablets.

In that case, Apple had complained about Samsung's use of designs and packaging from the iPhone and iPad, while Samsung had accused Apple of infringing upon its wireless telecommunications patents.

''I welcome Samsung's commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm  competition,'' Mr. Almunia said.
Samsung and Apple are still engaged in a smartphone patent dispute in federal court in San
Francisco, where closing arguments were taking place on Tuesday.

In the United States, there have been federal court rulings limiting the use of essential patents to hinder a competitor. But those have been in specific cases.

Section: Business News - The European Commission on Tuesday ruled that  Motorola  Mobility (Motorola)  infringed the European Union (EU)'s antitrust rules by abusing its dominant position as a standard essential patent (SEP) holder.
The commission said it was abusive for  Motorola  to both seek and enforce an injunction against Apple in
Germany on the basis of an SEP which it had committed to license on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and where Apple had agreed to take a license and be bound by a
determination of the FRAND royalties by the relevant German court.

"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the competition rules," said Joaquin Almunia, vice President of the European Commission in charge of competition policy.
The Commission has ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from it.

Moreover, the Commission said it decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  in view of the fact that there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality of SEP-based injunctions and that national courts have so far reached diverging conclusion on this question.

SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on FRAND terms. - PNA

The European Commission on April 29 ruled that  Motorola  Mobility Holdings Inc. violated European Unionantitrust rules by seeking and enforcing an injunction against Apple Inc. in a German court and ordered Motorola  to "eliminate the negative effects" resulting from the injunction.

TD
"Seeking of an injunction based on [standard essential patents] may constitute an  abuse of a dominant position if a SEP holder has given a voluntary commitment to license its SEPs on [fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory] terms and where the company against which an injunction is sought is willing to enter into a licence agreement on such FRAND terms," the commission wrote in its ruling. The EC added that such SEP-based injunctions against willing licensees can lead to anticompetitive outcomes that could be harmful to consumers and detrimental to innovation.

The commission said it would not impose a  fine on Motorola  because there is no case by-law in EU courts dealing with the legality and because national courts have expressed opposing views on the matter.

In a separate ruling the same day, the EC said it accepted Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.'s legally binding commitments on SEPs. Samsung has agreed not to seek injunctions in Europe on the basis of SEPs. Any disagreements over FRAND terms will be determined in court or by an arbitrator.

"The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules. Our decision on  Motorola,  together with today's decision to accept Samsung's commitments, provides legal clarity on the circumstances in which injunctions to enforce standard essential patents can be anti-competitive," Joaquín Almunia, commission vice president in charge of  competition policy, said in a news release.

SEPs are patents essential to the implementation of specific industry standards. The standards are overseen by industry groups such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute.

In January, Google Inc. agreed to sell  Motorola  Mobility to Lenovo for about $2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.

HD       European Commission Takes Action  To Limit Injunctions For SEPs

BY      Jay Jurata WC     864 words PD      2 May 2014
SN      Mondaq Business Briefing
SC      BBPUB
LA      English

LP
On April 29, 2014, the European Commission ("Commission") adopted a decision against  Motorola Mobility LLC ("Motorola"),  a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc., and entered into a settlement agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung").

These actions resolve allegations that  Motorola  and Samsung abused their market power by refusing to license their standard-essential patents (SEPs) to a competitor who implemented the standard. A SEP is a patent for a technical standard adopted by a formal standard-setting organization (SSO). In return for being included in the technical standard, SSOs generally require companies to promise to license their SEPs on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

TD
Background of the Disputes

The Motorola  and Samsung SEPs in question relate to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI's) GPRS standard, part of the GSM standard, which is a key industry standard for mobile and wireless communications. When this standard was adopted,  Motorola  and Samsung declared some of their patents as being essential to the standard, and subsequently gave commitments that they would license their SEPs to implementers of the standard on FRAND terms.

The Commission opened investigations against Samsung and  Motorola  in 2012. The Commission objected to the companies' actions, after promising to license their SEPs on FRAND terms, in seeking injunctions against Apple. In doing so, the Commission believed  Motorola  and Samsung tried to  abuse the market power they gained through the standard-setting process to block Apple's competing products in downstream product markets. One purpose of FRAND commitments is to avoid the risk of patent
hold-up by a SEP owner. Allowing a SEP owner to renege on its FRAND commitment could distort licensing negotiations, decrease  competition in downstream product markets, and, ultimately, increase consumer prices.
Samsung Settlement

The settlement agreed on by the Commission restricts Samsung from seeking injunctions in the European Economic Area (EEA) on the basis of any of its SEPs related to mobile telecommunications standards, for five years (see press release). To receive this "safe harbour" protection, a potential licensee must agree to a detailed licensing framework for the relevant SEPs. This framework provides for
(1) a negotiation period of up to 12 months and (2) if no agreement is reached, a third-party determination of FRAND terms by a court, or by an arbitrator if both parties agree. An independent "monitoring trustee" will advise the Commission in overseeing the implementation of Samsung's commitments.

Motorola  Decision

Separately, the Commission found that Motorola  wrongfully sought injunctive relief against Apple in a German court (see press release). Motorola's  conduct was objectionable because it had committed to license the relevant SEP on FRAND terms, and Apple had agreed to take a license on FRAND terms to be determined by the relevant German court. In addition, the Commission found it anticompetitive that Motorola  used the threat of injunctive relief to dissuade Apple from challenging the validity or
non-infringement of  Motorola's  SEPs. Because the Commission believes that implementers of standards should not be required to take a license for invalid or non-infringed SEPs, it concluded that implementers should be allowed to determine the validity of patents and contest alleged infringements without fear that
Page 63 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
doing so would subject them to potential injunctions. The Commission ordered  Motorola  to eliminate any negative effects resulting from its conduct, opting not to impose a  fine.
Implications for SEP Owners and Potential Licensees

The Commission's actions bring some additional clarity to the emerging legal position regarding FRAND-encumbered SEPs and injunctions. However, uncertainty continues, as important questions remain unanswered. The broad implications for owners of FRAND-encumbered SEPs and for potential licensees include:

SEP owners who previously committed to license SEPs on FRAND terms are prohibited from seeking injunctions in the EEA against companies that qualify as "willing licensees."

Although the actions provide for a potential "safe harbour" for implementers of the standard to avoid the risk of injunctions for FRAND-encumbered SEPs, that safe harbour applies only if implementers qualify as "willing licensees." But "[w]hether a company can be considered a 'willing licensee' needs to be
determined on a case by case basis taking into account the specific facts."

An implementer should qualify as a "willing licensee" if it follows the negotiation procedures set forth by the Commission's decisions. But the Commission takes no position on what other conduct may or may not satisfy that designation.

Potential licensees are not prohibited from challenging the validity, essentiality, claim of infringement, or value of the patents at issue. Accordingly, a potential licensee making these challenges will not be deemed "unwilling."
Injunctive relief likely remains available for companies determined to be unwilling licensees.

HD     European Union: Antitrust - Commission finds that Motorola  Mobility infringed EU competition rules by misusing standard  essential  patents
WC    866 words

Section: General News - The European Commission today adopted a decision which finds that Motorola Mobility's (Motorola)  seeking and enforcement of an injunction against Apple before a German court on the basis of a smartphone standard essential patent (SEP) constitutes an  abuse of a dominant position prohibited by EU  antitrust rules in view of the particular circumstances in which the injunction was used (see also MEMO/14/322). The Commission has ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from it. The Commission has also taken a commitment decision in a separate investigation concerning Samsung (see IP/14/490).

TD
Commission Vice President in charge of  competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The so-called smartphone patent wars should not occur at the expense of consumers. This is why all industry players must comply with the  competition rules. Our decision on  Motorola,  together with today's decision to accept Samsung's commitments, provides legal clarity on the circumstances in which injunctions to
enforce standard essential patents can be anti-competitive. This will also contribute to ensuring the proper functioning of standard-setting in Europe. While patent holders should be fairly remunerated for the use of their intellectual property, implementers of such standards should also get access to standardised technology on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. It is by preserving this balance that consumers will continue to have access to a wide choice of interoperable products".

SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents. This may give companies owning SEPs significant market power. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (so-called "FRAND") terms. This commitment is designed to ensure effective access to a standard for all market players and to prevent "hold-up" by a single SEP holder. Such access on FRAND terms allows a wide choice of interoperable products for consumers while ensuring that SEP holders are adequately remunerated for their intellectual property.

Seeking injunctions before courts is generally a legitimate remedy for patent holders in case of patent infringements. However, the seeking of an injunction based on SEPs may constitute an  abuse of a dominant position if a SEP holder has given a voluntary commitment to license its SEPs on FRAND terms and where the company against which an injunction is sought is willing to enter into a licence agreement
on such FRAND terms. Since injunctions generally involve a prohibition of the product infringing the patent being sold, seeking SEP-based injunctions against a willing licensee could risk excluding products from
the market. Such a threat can therefore distort licensing negotiations and lead to anticompetitive licensing terms that the licensee of the SEP would not have accepted absent the seeking of the injunction. Such an anticompetitive outcome would be detrimental to innovation and could harm consumers.

The Motorola  Mobility SEPs in question relate to the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute's (ETSI) GPRS standard, part of the GSM standard, which is a key industry standard for mobile and wireless communications. When this standard was adopted in Europe,  Motorola  Mobility declared some of its patents as being essential and gave a commitment that it would license the patents which it had declared essential to the standard on FRAND terms.

In today's decision, the Commission found that it was abusive for  Motorola  to both seek and enforce an injunction against Apple in Germany on the basis of an SEP which it had committed to license on FRAND

Page 66 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
terms and where Apple had agreed to take a licence and be bound by a determination of the FRAND
royalties by the relevant German court.

The Commission also found it anticompetitive that  Motorola  insisted, under the threat of the enforcement of an injunction, that Apple give up its rights to challenge the validity or infringement by Apple's mobile devices of Motorola  SEPs. Implementers of standards and ultimately consumers should not have to pay for invalid or non-infringed patents. Implementers should therefore be able to ascertain the validity of patents and contest alleged infringements.

The Commission decided not to impose a  fine on Motorola  in view of the fact that there is no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality under Article 102 TFEU of SEP-based injunctions and that national courts have so far reached diverging conclusions on this question.
More information can be found at MEMO/14/322. Background
Article 102 TFEU prohibits the  abuse of a dominant position which may affect trade and prevent or restrict competition. The implementation of this provision is defined in the  Antitrust Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003) which can be applied by the Commission and by national  competition authorities of EU Member States.

The Commission opened the investigation in April 2012 after having received a complaint by Apple. The Commission's decision follows a Statement of Objections sent in May 2013 (see IP/13/406 and MEMO/13/403).

Section: General News - The  European Commission has today rendered commitments offered by Samsung Electronics (Samsung) legally binding under EU  antitrust rules. According to these commitments, Samsung will not seek injunctions in Europe on the basis of its standard essential patents (SEPs) for smartphones and tablets against licensees who sign up to a specified licensing framework. Under this framework, any dispute over what are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (so-called "FRAND") terms for the SEPs in question will be determined by a court, or if both parties agree, by an arbitrator. The commitments therefore provide a "safe harbour" for all potential licensees of the relevant Samsung SEPs. Indeed, potential licensees that sign up to the licensing framework will be protected against SEP-based injunctions by Samsung (see also MEMO/14/322). The Commission has also taken a prohibition decision in a separate investigation concerning  Motorola  (see IP/14/489).

Commission Vice President in charge of  competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The protection of intellectual property and  competition are both key drivers of innovation and growth. This is why it is essential that intellectual property is not misused to the detriment of healthy  competition and, ultimately, of consumers. In this context, I welcome Samsung's commitment to resolve disputes on standard essential patents without having recourse to injunctions in a way that could harm  competition. Together
with today's decision in the  Motorola  case, the Commission's decision to accept Samsung's commitments provides clarity to the industry on what constitutes an appropriate framework to settle disputes over "FRAND" terms in line with EU  antitrust rules. I would also encourage other industry players to consider establishing similar dispute resolution mechanisms."
The Commission's  competition concerns

SEPs are patents essential to implement a specific industry standard. It is not possible to manufacture products that comply with a certain standard without accessing these patents by obtaining a licence. This may give companies owning SEPs significant market power. As a result, standards bodies generally require their members to commit to license SEPs on FRAND terms. This commitment is designed to ensure effective access to a standard for all market players and to prevent "hold-up" by a single SEP holder. Such access on FRAND terms allows consumers to have a wider choice of interoperable products while ensuring that SEP holders are adequately remunerated for their intellectual property.

Seeking injunctions before courts is generally a legitimate remedy for patent holders in case of patent infringements. However, the seeking of an injunction based on SEPs may constitute an  abuse of a dominant position if a SEP holder has given a voluntary commitment to license its SEPs on FRAND terms and where the company against which an injunction is sought is willing to enter into a licence agreement
on such FRAND terms. Since injunctions generally involve a prohibition of the product infringing the patent being sold, seeking SEP-based injunctions against a willing licensee could risk excluding products from
the market. Such a threat can therefore distort licensing negotiations and lead to anticompetitive licensing terms that the licensee of the SEP would not have accepted absent the seeking of the injunction. Such an anticompetitive outcome would be detrimental to innovation and could harm consumers.

Samsung owns SEPs related to various mobile telecommunications standards and has committed to license these SEPs on FRAND terms. In April 2011, Samsung started to seek injunctions against Apple on the basis of its SEPs. The Samsung SEPs in question related to the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute's (ETSI) 3G UMTS standard, a key industry standard for mobile and wireless

communications. In December 2012, the Commission informed Samsung of its preliminary view that it considered Apple a willing licensee on FRAND terms for Samsung's SEPs and that against this background, the seeking of injunctions against Apple based on Samsung's SEPs in several EU Member States may constitute an  abuse of a dominant position in breach of Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) (see IP/12/1448 and MEMO/12/1021).
Samsung's commitments
To address the Commission's concerns, Samsung has for a period of five years committed not to seek
any injunctions in the European Economic Area (EEA) on the basis of any of its SEPs, present and future,
that relate to technologies implemented in smartphones and tablets against any company that agrees to a
particular framework for licensing the relevant SEPs.
The licensing framework provides for:
a negotiation period of up to 12 months; and

if no agreement is reached, a third party determination of FRAND terms by a court if either party chooses, or by an arbitrator if both parties agree on this.

An independent monitoring trustee will advise the Commission in overseeing the proper implementation of the commitments.
Background

Article 9 of the EU's  Antitrust Regulation (Regulation 1/2003) allows the Commission to conclude antitrust proceedings by making commitments offered by a company legally binding. Such a decision does not reach a conclusion on whether EU  antitrust rules have been infringed but legally binds the company to respect the commitments. If the company breaches these commitments, the Commission can impose a fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide turnover, without having to find an infringement of Articles 101 or 102 TFEU. A policy brief on commitment decisions under Article 9 is available here.

The Commission opened its investigation in January 2012 (see IP/12/89). In December 2012, the Commission issued a Statement of Objections setting out its preliminary  competition concerns (see IP/12/1448). In September 2013, Samsung offered commitments in order to address the Commission's concerns. In October 2013, the Commission consulted interested parties on Samsung's commitments (see IP/13/971). On 3 February 2014, Samsung submitted the final version of the commitments which addressed the Commission's  competition concerns.
The Commission recognises that other dispute resolution mechanisms than the specific ones to which
Samsung commits may also be relied upon to settle FRAND disputes.

More information on this investigation is available on the Commission's  competition website in the public case register under the case number 39939.

European Commission issues Motorola  and Samsung decisions on standard essential patents

TD
Click hereThe Commission has adopted decisions in the  Motorola  and Samsung cases relating to the enforcement of standard essential patents (SEPs). The two decisions relate to how EU  competition rules apply in a situation where a licensor has committed to license its SEPs on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms and then seeks an injunction preventing their use. The decisions confirm the Commission's view that the seeking of an injunction in this situation may amount to the  abuse of a dominant position when the potential licensee is willing to enter into a licence on FRAND terms. In the Motorola  case, the Commission concluded that a potential licensee is to be considered willing if, in case
of dispute, it agrees to a determination of FRAND terms by a Court. As the potential licensee had agreed to such a determination in that case, Motorala was held to have abused its dominant position. However, it was not fined because this is the first decision of the Commission that has considered these issues. In
the Samsung case, the Commission has accepted commitments from Samsung not to seek injunctions for five years in Europe on the basis of SEPs for smartphones and tablets against any potential licensee who agrees to accept a specified licensing framework. This licensing framework consists of a mandatory negotiation period of up to 12 months and, if the negotiation fails, a determination of FRAND terms by a third party - either by a court or arbitration. The commitments also include the appointment of an independent monitoring trustee. .

The Advocate General has concluded that the General Court erred in upholding the Commission's decision to exclude internal sales when calculating the total value of the market, which discriminated against Guardian as the only non-vertically integrated operator. The Advocate General therefore concluded that Guardian's  fine should be reduced from EUR148 million to EUR93.24 million. .

The European Commission has cleared the proposed acquisition of DuPont's Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls (GLSV) business by Kuraray. The clearance is conditional on the divestment of GLSV's PVB film production facility in Uentrop (Germany).

Ryanair applied for permission to appeal on three grounds. The CAT has granted permission on two of the grounds, relating to alleged errors by the CAT in considering issues of procedural fairness as to the disclosure of information by the  Competition Commission and in considering the EU duty of sincere co-operation. However, the CAT refused permission for the third ground, which relates to an alleged error by the CAT as to the test that the  Competition Commission should apply when imposing a remedy. The CAT also refused an application by Aer Lingus for costs, holding that there were no reasons to justify departing from the general rule that interveners bear their own costs. Click here.

HD      Important Day For The Application Of EU Competition Rules To Standard Essential  Patents

On 29 April 2014, the European Commission adopted two important decisions with respect to the application of EU competition rules to standard essential patents (SEPs).

Commission finds that  Motorola  Mobility abused a dominant position by misusing its SEPs but does not impose a fine

TD
On 29 April 2014, the  European Commission adopted a decision which found that  Motorola  Mobility abused a dominant position by seeking and enforcing an injunction against Apple before a German court on the basis of a smartphone SEP. As the Commission noted, a holder of SEPs has significant market power because it is not possible to manufacture products that comply with the relevant standard without obtaining a licence for the SEPs.

According to the Commission,  Motorola's  conduct amounted to an  abuse because, in the context of standardisation,  Motorola  had committed to license the SEP on FRAND terms and the licensee was found willing to take a licence on such terms (i.e., a "willing licensee"). The Commission was concerned that the threat of an injunction in these specific circumstances could distort licensing negotiations and lead to anti-competitive licensing terms that the licensee of the SEP would not have accepted absent the seeking of the injunction.

Similarly, the Commission also announced that it "found it anti-competitive that  Motorola  insisted, under the threat of the enforcement of an injunction, that Apple give up its rights to challenge the validity or infringement by Apple's mobile devices of  Motorola  SEPs." By recognizing the possibility that the patents in question may not be valid, the Commission interestingly appears to have found that the mere claim
that a patent is standards essential is enough to demonstrate dominance.

The Commission separately explained that whether a company can be considered a "willing licensee" needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the specific facts. Nevertheless, it noted that it had effectively created a safe harbour for licensees by specifying that they will be deemed "willing" if, in case of dispute, they are willing to have FRAND terms determined by a court or arbitrators (if agreed between the parties) and to be bound by such a determination.

Nevertheless, the Commission also clarified that seeking injunctions before the courts in circumstances other than those set out in its decision "is generally a legitimate remedy for patent holders in case of patent infringements".

The Commission ordered  Motorola  to eliminate the negative effects resulting from this conduct, but did not impose a fine. The Commission attempted to explain this on the grounds that there was no case-law by the European Union Courts dealing with the legality under Article 102 TFEU of SEP-based injunctions, and that national courts have so far reached diverging conclusions on this question. However, the Commission also recognized that it nevertheless could have imposed a  fine even in these
circumstances, so its precise reasoning remains unclear.
Commission accepts legally binding commitments by Samsung Electronics on SEP injunctions

On 29 April 2014, the same day it adopted its decision against  Motorola,  the European Commission announced that it had adopted a decision rendering commitments offered by Samsung to refrain from seeking injunctions for SEPs legally binding.
Page 73 of 75 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
According to the commitments, Samsung pledged not to seek injunctions in Europe on the basis of its standard essential patents (SEPs) for smartphones and tablets against licensees who sign up to a specified licensing framework designed to ensure the application of fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Under this framework, disputes over whether terms are FRAND are to be determined by a court, or if both parties agree, by an arbitrator. These commitments therefore provide a practical application of the "safe harbour" recognized by the Commission in its  Motorola decision (see above).

More specifically, for five years Samsung committed not to seek any injunctions in the European Economic Area (EEA) on the basis of any of its SEPs, present and future, that relate to technologies implemented in smartphones and tablets against any company that agrees to the following framework to determine the meaning of FRAND: (i) a negotiation period of up to 12 months; and (ii) if no agreement is reached during that 12 month period, a third party determination of FRAND terms by a court if either party chooses so, or by an arbitrator if both parties agree on this.

An independent monitoring trustee is also offered to help advise the Commission in overseeing the proper implementation of the commitments.

As noted previously (see VBB on  Competition Law, Volume 2013, No. 10, available at  www.vbb.com), it is interesting that the Commission accepted Samsung's commitments given that, when Microsoft offered its interoperability technology under a nearly identical approach, it was found to have acted unreasonably and fined € 899 million. The Commission's decision in the Samsung case (and, indeed, in the  Motorola decision) indicates that it is taking a more sophisticated and sensible approach to the determination of a FRAND rate than previously.
