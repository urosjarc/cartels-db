WMRC       Perspective Significance            The Commission's latest cartel-bust has
resulted in the second-highest fine to date.

TD

Implications            Two of the companies have appeared before the

Commission on similar charges before and been fined. The fact that the previous fines did not provide sufficient disincentive to indulge in illegal practices again is something that should worry the Commission if it is serious about its fight against cartels.
Outlook                 It is unclear where the Competition Commission will go from here; undoubtedly though the stance must get tougher if the war is to be won.

As expected, the  European Commission imposed record-breaking fines on the members of the latest
cartel to be busted by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and his colleagues (see  European Union:
21 November 2001: Gypsum  Cartel Faces Heavy Fines from EuropeanCommission). However, whether
Monti's hard-hitting  fines are working is in doubt, with two of the four companies in this case facing their
second fine for anti-competitive behaviour.

Between 1992 and 1998, UK-based BPB plc, Gebrueder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG of Germany and the French company Societe Lafarge SA undertook to work together, calling a halt to an ongoing
price war that was driving down retail prices. They were joined in 1996 by Gyproc Benelux SA/NV of Belgium. The four rival companies produce nearly all the plasterboard manufactured in the four countries in a market valued at (Pounds)750 million (US$1.2bn) per year. At the initial meeting, a system of secret
and regular information exchange was established so that advance warning of price rises could be passed on, as well as details of sales volumes. Evidence of the  cartel came to light following a lengthy Commission investigation that began in 1998, which was based, amongst other things, on information garnered from surprise inspections and evidence put forward by BPB and Gyproc.

In response to the unearthing of this cartel, which it is estimated affected 80% of consumers with the European Union (EU), the Commission decided to fine the colluders a total of 478.32 million  euro, which breaks down as follows:
Lafarge: 249.60 million  euro. BPB: 138.60 million  euro. Knauf; 85.80 million  euro. Gyproc: 4.32 million
euro.

The fines imposed on Lafarge and BPB are significantly higher than the rest because they have already fallen foul of the EU competition rules once before, something the Commission has treated as an aggravating factor. However, both BPB and Gyproc co-operated with the Commission in uncovering the cartel, a wise decision that allowed them to benefit from the 1996 leniency provisions with a 30% and
40% reduction in fines respectively.
Outlook and Implications

The BPB and Lafarge cases should worry the Commission. Not only have they both been  fined before, but they were in the midst of the current cartel when they were investigated previously. Whilst yesterday's fines may make companies think twice before indulging in such illegal practices again, they may not be a sufficient deterrent compared with the benefits which could be accrued from illicit  price-fixing practices.
This case is surely going to force a rethink in a number of areas:

Leniency Provisions: BPB and Lafarge did not consider the 1996 leniency provisions a sufficient incentive to blow the whistle on their  cartel colleagues and chose instead to risk punishment at the hands of the Commission. These provisions have since been improved upon (see  European Union: 25 July 2001: Whistleblowers to be Rewarded for Informing on Cartels), but it remains to be seen if these are any more persuasive than the previous legislation. A Second Bite of the Cherry: BPB has got off lightly. Even though it had been caught before, it still got a reduced sentence for handing over useful information to the Commission. Surely companies that have been caught red-handed once should not be entitled to such generous reductions in their  fines.

BPB has already indicated that it will be appealing against the  fine, indicating somewhat bizarrely that it was not involved in the price-fixing cartel. It will be joined by Lafarge, which also openly criticised what it considered to be an excessive fine. What is clear is that there is still a long way to go if Monti really does want to rid the economy of what he has labelled these 'cancerous' cartels.

BRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The European Commission is likely to fine companies in Japan, Germany and the United States next week for a cartel in specialty graphite,  a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.
The same firms were forced to pay  fines of 219 million euros in 2001 for their role in a  cartel in
graphite  electrodes.

They were SGL Carbon AG (SGCG.DE) and VAW Aluminium AG of Germany, UCAR International Inc., now known as GrafTech International Ltd (GTI.N), and Carbide/Graphite Group of the United States.
They also include Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd (5301.T)., Showa Denko K.K (4004.T), SEC Corporation
(5304.OS) and Nippon Carbon Co. Ltd (5302.T). of Japan.

The size of the fine next week is expected to be far smaller, but no exact figures were immediately available. Specialty  graphites are used in engineering and electronic manufacturing such as semiconductors and machines parts.

BRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The European Commission is likely to fine companies in Japan, Germany and the United States next week for a cartel in specialty graphite,  a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.

The same firms were forced to pay a total of 219 million  euros ($223.8 million) in  fines in 2001 for their role in a cartel in graphite  electrodes, at the time one of the biggest  fines ever levied.

TD
The size of the probable fine next week is expected to be far smaller, but no exact figures were immediately available. The EuropeanCommission's policy is to base its  fines on the size of the markets involved.
A spokeswoman for the  Commission had no comment.

The firms involved in the investigation are SGL Carbon AG and VAW Aluminium AG of Germany, UCAR International Inc., now known as GrafTech International Ltd, and Carbide/Graphite Group of the United States.

They also include Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd, Showa Denko K.K, SEC Corporation and Nippon Carbon Co. Ltd of Japan.

A spokesman for SGL Carbon said: "We have no official knowledge of a  fine." He declined to elaborate.
Spokesmen for GrafTech and Carbide/Graphite Group were not immediately available for comment. There are many kinds of  specialty graphites, used in everything from engineering to electronics. High purity graphite  is used in the aerospace and nuclear industries as well as for laboratories and
medical technologies.

Specialty graphites are also used for semiconductors, the automobile industry, household appliances and many other applications.

The earlier investigation was for  graphite  electrodes used in the production of steel in electric furnaces. That  cartel lasted for nearly all of the 1990s.
The biggest  fine in the earlier case was 80 million  euros paid by SGL Carbon, followed by 50 million
euros paid by UCAR International.

The firms also paid  fines in the United States, where they were found to be in violation of criminal laws there against cartels.

In calculating  fines in Europe, the Commission considers the gravity of the violations, the duration of the fines and the extent of cooperation by companies.

HD         Monti pushes ahead with action against cartels.

Brussels anti-trust regulators are this week set to push the total fines levied this year against cartels above the EUR1bn mark with decisions against three separate price-fixing conspiracies.

The fines are expected to be announced on Tuesday after the  European Commission's last meeting of the year. The action underlines the determination by Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, to attack cartels across the economy. He has already imposed penalties of EUR946m on  cartel participants this year.

TD
Fines are likely to hit several small Italian producers of steel reinforcing rods, used in construction, and
Japanese makers of food-flavouring ingredients.

But the most significant decision will involve SGL Carbon, a German company that is accused of taking part in a conspiracy to fix the price of  specialty graphite,  a material used to make computer chips.
The Commission decision on this cartel could herald changes in the way the Brussels authorities set
fines against companies found guilty of price-fixing.

After a six-year probe, the  Commission's competition department is believed to have found evidence that SGL and up to seven other companies from  Europe, the US and Japan took part in a  cartel during the 1990s.

Under normal circumstances, SGL would face a high  fine, as the cartel lasted for several years and the company has already been found guilty of similar practices.

However, it is understood that senior officials from the  Commission's 20 departments, who meet today to set the level of the  fine, will consider taking a softer line against SGL.

People close to the case say the  Commission will take into account SGL's ability to pay the penalty and the fact that the company has already been  fined for anti-competitive offences in a similar market in both Europe and the US. The  Commission declined to comment.

Such a move would be a sign that the Brussels authorities are reconsidering some of the criteria for setting  fines in cartel cases. The Commission's current test of a company's ability to pay is a very stringent one.
Under guidelines published four years ago, companies have to prove the penalty would have negative
"social" effects such as, for example, forcing the company to lay off workers or close businesses.
In practice, this sets a high burden of proof and several companies that contested the  Commission's
fines on those grounds have been rebuffed by the  European Court of Justice.

A less strict interpretation of the rules in SGL's case could herald a change in Commission policy. Brussels officials say the  Commission is considering updating its guidelines on setting fines, although nothing has been decided yet.

TOKYO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Japanese shares are expected to meet a round of selling at the open on Monday, led down by Sony Corp and other major exporters following a sharp rise in the yen against the dollar and a tumble on Wall Street.

But traders said the market would find support from technical indicators suggesting stocks are due for a short-term bounce after the Nikkei average fell eight percent during an eight-session skid to a
three-week low of 8,516.07 on Friday.

TD
"The Nikkei should probably lose about 100 points right off the bat. Sony, Toyota and other blue-chip exporters should take a hit," said Minoru Tada, director at World Nichiei Securities.

"But it's been a long time since we've fallen for nine days straight. I don't see us hitting a new low," he said, referring to the Nikkei's 19-year closing low of 8,303 hit on November 14.
Analysts said the Nikkei, which last fell for nine consecutive sessions in 1991, would move between
8,300 and 8,600.

The Nikkei's 14-day relative strength index is below the 30 oversold line at 26, suggesting limited downside near-term.

The dollar hit a one-month low of 120.32 yen in New York on Friday after reaching 125 earlier in the month. The greenback has been pressured by rising global tensions, weak U.S. stocks and questions about Washington's "strong dollar" policy.

On the domestic policy front, Japan's ruling coalition agreed on Friday to a net tax cut of about 1.8 trillion yen ($14.9 billion) for the next fiscal year, but critics said the changes would fail to give the economy any significant stimulus.
STOCKS TO WATCH
- Toshiba Corp

Japan's biggest chipmaker said on Friday it would spend nearly $3 billion to build two cutting-edge microchip plants in Japan as it plots a comeback against rising foreign rivals such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics.

Analysts widely expect that Toshiba, its finances depleted by last year's record chip industry slump and costly restructuring, will tap partners such as Fujitsu Ltd and Sony Corp for help with funding.
- Sega Corp and other software game makers.
Shares in U.S. videogame publishers slumped on Friday after Goldman Sachs cut the sector to
"underperform/cautious", citing fears that a slowdown in growth has come sooner than expected.

- Tokai Carbon Co Ltd, Showa Denko KK, SEC Corp and Nippon Carbon Co Ltd The  European         Commission is likely to fine the four companies along with German and U.S. firms next week for a cartel in specialty graphite,  a source told Reuters on Friday.

The probable fine is expected to be far smaller than a  fine of 219 million euros paid by the same firms in 2001 for their role in a  cartel in graphite  electrodes.
- Aeon Co

Japan's second-largest retailing group said on Friday it plans to invest about T$6 billion (US$172 million) to set up 18-20 outlets in Taiwan by 2010 to tap the island's growing retail market.
- Terumo Corp

The manufacturer of medical equipment has developed a syringe with what the company says is the world's smallest needle at just 0.20 mm in diameter, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun business daily said on Monday. The needle causes almost no pain, the paper said.
- Bosch Automotive Systems Corp

The maker of fuel-injection pumps plans to close three domestic plants next year to boost operational efficiency, the Nihon Keizai reported over the weekend. Bosch also plans to cut 550 jobs, or five percent of its workforce, the paper said. ($1=120.60 yen) (US$=T$34.8).

TOKYO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Japanese shares are expected to meet a round of selling at the open on Monday, led down by Sony Corp (6758.T) and other major exporters following a sharp rise in the yen against the dollar and a tumble on Wall Street.

But traders said the market would find support from technical indicators suggesting stocks are due for a short-term bounce after the Nikkei average fell eight percent during an eight-session skid to a
three-week low of 8,516.07 on Friday.

TD
"The Nikkei should probably lose about 100 points right off the bat. Sony, Toyota and other blue-chip exporters should take a hit," said Minoru Tada, director at World Nichiei Securities.

"But it's been a long time since we've fallen for nine days straight. I don't see us hitting a new low," he said, referring to the Nikkei's 19-year closing low of 8,303 hit on November 14.
Analysts said the Nikkei, which last fell for nine consecutive sessions in 1991, would move between
8,300 and 8,600.

The Nikkei's 14-day relative strength index is below the 30 oversold line at 26, suggesting limited downside near-term.

The dollar hit a one-month low of 120.32 yen in New York on Friday after reaching 125 earlier in the month. The greenback has been pressured by rising global tensions, weak U.S. stocks and questions about Washington's "strong dollar" policy.

On the domestic policy front, Japan's ruling coalition agreed on Friday to a net tax cut of about 1.8 trillion yen ($14.9 billion) for the next fiscal year, but critics said the changes would fail to give the economy any significant stimulus.
STOCKS TO WATCH
- Toshiba Corp (6502.T).

Japan's biggest chipmaker said on Friday it would spend nearly $3 billion to build two cutting-edge microchip plants in Japan as it plots a comeback against rising foreign rivals such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics (05930.KS).
Analysts widely expect that Toshiba, its finances depleted by last year's record chip industry slump
and costly restructuring, will tap partners such as Fujitsu Ltd (6702.T) and Sony Corp (6758.T) for help
with funding.
- Sega Corp (7964.T) and other software game makers.
Shares in U.S. videogame publishers slumped on Friday after Goldman Sachs cut the sector to
"underperform/cautious", citing fears that a slowdown in growth has come sooner than expected.

HD            E.U. To Take Measures Against  Price-Fixing Cartels - FT WC           480 words

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Brussels antitrust regulators are this week set to push the total  fines levied this year against cartels above the EUR1 billion mark with decisions against three separate
price-fixing conspiracies, the Financial Times reported on its Web site Monday.

The fines are expected to be announced on Tuesday after the EuropeanCommission's last meeting of the year, the FT reported.

TD
The action underlines the determination by Mario Monti, the E.U. competition commissioner, to attack cartels across the economy. He has already imposed penalties of EUR946 million on  cartel participants this year.

Fines are likely to hit several small Italian producers of steel reinforcing rods, used in construction, and Japanese makers of food-flavoring ingredients, the report said.

But the most significant decision will involve SGL Carbon AG (SGG), a German company that is accused of taking part in a conspiracy to fix the price of  specialty graphite,  a material used to make computer chips.
The Commission decision on this cartel could herald changes in the way the Brussels authorities set
fines against companies found guilty of price-fixing.

After a six-year probe, the  Commission's competition department is believed to have found evidence that SGL and up to seven other companies from  Europe, the U.S. and Japan took part in a  cartel during the 1990s.

Under normal circumstances, SGL would face a high  fine, as the cartel lasted for several years and the company has already been found guilty of similar practices.

However, it is understood that senior officials from the  Commission's 20 departments, who meet today to set the level of the  fine, will consider taking a softer line against SGL, the report said.

People close to the case say the  Commission will take into account SGL's ability to pay the penalty and the fact that the company has already been  fined for anti-competitive offenses in a similar market in both Europe and the U.S. The  Commission declined to comment.

Such a move would be a sign that the Brussels authorities are reconsidering some of the criteria for setting  fines in cartel cases. The Commission's current test of a company's ability to pay is a very stringent one.
Under guidelines published four years ago, companies have to prove the penalty would have negative
"social" effects such as, for example, forcing the company to lay off workers or close businesses.
In practice, this sets a high burden of proof and several companies that contested the  Commission's
fines on those grounds have been rebuffed by the  European Court of Justice.

A less strict interpretation of the rules in SGL's case could herald a change in Commission policy. Brussels officials say the  Commission is considering updating its guidelines on setting fines, although nothing has been decided yet.

TOKYO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Four Japanese companies identified as being involved in a price-fixing cartel in speciality graphite  said on Monday they had not heard about any European Commission investigation or potential fine.

Reuters, quoting a source familiar with the situation, reported from Brussels on Friday that Japanese, German and U.S. firms were being investigated by the  Commission for trying to fix prices of speciality graphite  and could face fines this week.

TD
The Japanese firms named - Tokai Carbon Co Ltd (5301.T), Showa Denko KK (4004.T), SEC Corp (5304.OS) and Nippon Carbon Co Ltd (5302.T) - all said they had not heard from the Commission and a Showa Denko spokesman said the company had never produced speciality graphite.

A Nippon Carbon spokesman said the company produced very little speciality  graphite.  Spokesmen for Tokai Carbon and SEC said they had not heard about any investigation.

The four companies were among a group of firms - including Germany's SGL Carbon AG (SGCG.DE) and unlisted VAW Aluminium AG, and U.S.-based UCAR International Inc and Carbide/Graphite Group Inc - that were  fined a total of 219 million  euros in 2001 for their role in a  cartel in graphite electrodes.
UCAR is now known as Graftech International Ltd (GTI.N).
A spokeswoman for the  Commission in Brussels had no comment.

Specialty graphites are used for semiconductors, the automobile industry, household appliances and in many other applications.  Graphite electrodes are used in the production of steel in electric furnaces.

Brussels' competition regulators will end the year with a bang on Tuesday with  fines on several companies involved in three separate  price-fixing conspiracies. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, is expected to punish producers of industrial materials, food-flavouring ingredients and steel products.

The largest  fines are likely to hit up to eight makers of  specialty graphite,  a product used to make computer chips. Competition experts will look closely at how much SGL Carbon will be  fined. The German company could have been in line for an heavy penalty, because the cartel lasted several years and it had already been  fined for another cartel. However, the European Commission could take a softer line after considering that another heavy fine would be unduly harsh on SGL.

TD
The other two cartels involve Italian makers of steel-reinforcing rods - used in the construction industry - and Japanese producers of food flavouring ingredients. Lawyers said the  fines on these two cartels were likely to be relatively small as the markets concerned were not very big.

Nevertheless, the  fines to be announced on Tuesday will bring the total penalties levied this year against cartel participants above EUR1bn. However, the Brussels authorities are unlikely to beat last year's record of EUR1.8bn, which included the largest  fine ever levied, EUR855m against eight vitamins producers.

Separately, the  Commission is also likely to clear a takeover of GVS, a German regional gas producer, by a consortium of ENI, the Italian energy group, and its French rival Electricite' de France. The two companies are believed to have offered concessions in order to reduce the deal's anti-competitive effects in the market for gas in the region near the border between Germany and France.

FRANKFURT, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The following German stocks may be affected by newspaper reports and other factors on Tuesday:

TD
HVB GROUP (HVMG.DE)

The outgoing head of Germany's second-biggest listed bank, HVB Group, was quoted as saying that a merger with Frankfurt rival Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) was not currently on the agenda.
"It would have a theoretical logic," HVB Chief Executive Albrecht Schmidt told the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. "Consolidation is on the agenda, but a merger with Commerzbank isn't."
TRAFFIC STRIKES

A brief strike by German public sector workers seeking higher pay forced the cancellation of over 160 flights at Frankfurt airport, officials said.

A spokesman for airport operator Fraport AG (FRAG.DE) said German domestic flights accounted for most of the cancellations and that passengers were being diverted to rail services.

Airline workers at Frankfurt and Munich airports had planned to stage "warning strikes" to underline their calls for a wage rise of at least three percent. Lufthansa (LHAG.F) said on Monday it would be the biggest casusalty of the stoppages.
E.ON (EONG.DE)

A German court has indicated that no decision is expected before Tuesday on whether to lift a temporary injunction blocking power giant E.ON's 10 billion  euro ($10.14 billion) purchase of gas importer Ruhrgas.

Ruhrgas is jointly owned by a number of heavyweight industrial companies and its shares are not quoted.

Independent energy traders and municipal power suppliers mounted a legal challenge after the government made rare use of its privilege earlier this year to approve the deal on grounds of national interest, despite  cartel office objections.
DEUTSCHE BANK (DBKGn.DE)

Deutsche Bank and IXE Casa de Bolsa, one of the largest independent stockbrokers in Mexico, have signed a letter of intent to launch a joint venture company to serve the Mexican equity market, the Financial Times reported.
The company, which will be majority-owned by IXE but headquartered in New York, will provide Latin
American equity research and emerging market equity sales to international institutional investors.
CELANESE AG (CZZG.DE)


Page 24 of 66 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European Commission gave its permission for German chemical firm Celanese to take control of most of the emulsion business of Swiss firm Clariant AG (CLRZn.VX).

The 213.5 million Swiss franc sale of Clariant's European emulsions and global emulsion powders business is part of its strategy to focus on  fine and specialty chemicals after a one-billion franc loss last year.
EDSCHA (EDHG.DE) (EDHG.F)
The European Commission also gave its permission for U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group to buy
German car parts supplier Edscha in a leveraged buy-out.

EdCar Beteiligungs GmbH, a vehicle set up by Carlyle Group, agreed to buy a 70.5 percent stake in the firm from Edscha's four main shareholders for 26  euros per share, Edscha said at the time the deal was announced.

BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Tuesday it had  fined seven firms in Japan, Germany, France and the Netherlands 60.6 million  euros ($62.5 million) for two  price fixing  cartels in specialty graphites.
The graphites are used to make industrial tools in the aerospace and electronics sectors and the
Commission said the cartels came to light in an earlier probe on  graphite  electrodes.

TD
"The companies have three months in which to pay the  fines," the  Commission, the European
Union's executive arm and competition watchdog, said in a statement.

It named the companies as SGL Carbon AG (SGCG.DE) of Germany, Carbon-Lorraine SA of France, Japanese firms Ibiden Co Ltd (4062.T), Tokai Carbon Co Ltd (5301.T), Toyo Tanso Co Ltd and
Nippon Steel Chemical Co Ltd (4363.T).
One Dutch company, Intech EDM BV, was also  fined.

A U.S. firm, GrafTech International (GTI.N), was also involved in the enquiry, but was granted full immunity as it revealed the  cartel to the Commission.
SGL suffered the biggest  fine at 27.75 million  euros, Toyo Tanso was ordered to pay 10.79 million
euros while Carbon-Lorraine and Tokai Carbon each face a  fine of 6.97 million  euros.
Ibiden and Nippon were  fined 3.58 milion euros each while Intech was  fined 980,000 euros.

FRANKFURT, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Germany's SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE) said on Tuesday it would appeal to the European Court against a 27.75-million-euro ($28.6 million) fine from the European                    Commission for price fixing  in specialtygraphites.

SGL, the world's largest maker of  graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, said the Commission had found no new facts in a case that had been going on since 1997. The  Commission had already fined the firm in July 2001. "In view of the penalties already imposed and the fact that it concerns the same events during the same period of time and in the same environment, SGL Carbon is of the opinion that the European Commission is not entitled to impose a further  fine," the company said in a statement.

TD
The Commission said earlier it had fined seven firms in Japan, Germany, France and the Netherlands
60.6 million euros for two price fixing  cartels in specialty graphites, used to make industrial tools in
the aerospace and electronics sectors.

BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Tuesday slapped  fines of more than
160 million euros ($165 million) on almost 20 firms for cartels from food additives to concrete bars,
bringing anticompetitive  fines to nearly 1 billion  euros this year.

The Commission fined eight Italian firms 85 million  euros for a cartel in reinforcing bars for concrete and slapped 60.6 million euros of penalties on seven firms from Japan, Germany and the Netherlands in the specialty graphite  sector.

TD
One Japanese company and two South Korean firms felt the  Commission's wrath for fixing prices for food flavour enhancers.

"This takes the total amount of  fines imposed by the Commission in competition cases this year to over one billion euros - a significant amount, not quite as high as 2001 and we don't seek to establish or break records in doing this," said  Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull.

The Commission is the policeman of the EU's internal market, making sure companies do not indulge in anti-competitive behaviour and punishing those that do.

The Italian case involved mainly unlisted companies. Their  cartel allowed the eight firms to increase their market share of reinforcing bars from 30 percent in 1989 to more than 80 percent in 2000, the Commission said.

The graphites case involved materials used to make industrial tools in the aerospace and electronics sectors.
The Commission imposed fines for cartels for two types of specialtygraphite and gave Germany's
SGL Carbon AG the heaviest punishment with a  fine of 27.75 million euros.
SGL Carbon said it would appeal the decision at the EU's top court, the  European Court of Justice. Toyo Tanso was ordered to pay 10.79 million  euros while Carbon-Lorraine and Tokai Carbon Co Ltd
each face a fine of 6.97 million  euros.
Fellow Japanese firms Ibiden Co Ltd and Nippon Steel Chemical Co Ltd were  fined 3.58 million euros
each while Dutch Intech EDM B was  fined 980,000 euros.

A U.S. firm, GrafTech International, was also involved in the enquiry, but was granted full immunity as it revealed the  cartel to the Commission.
"We just seek to restore competition and to punish those who restrict or distort it," Faull added.

The Commission fined Japan's Ajinomoto Co Inc 15.54 million  euros, South Korean Cheil Jadang Corp 2.74 million euros and fellow Korean firm Daesang Corp 2.28 million  euros for fixing prices in food flavour enhancers. (Addtional reporting by Marie-Louise Moller).

PARIS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - French steelmaker Carbone Lorraine (CBLP.PA) said on Tuesday that it would have to pay a 6.97 million  euro fine following a European Commission probe into price        fixing in specialty graphites.
The French firm said in a statement that it would continue to cooperate fully with  Commission
authorities in a second inquiry into electric motor brushes.

TD
The Commission said on Tuesday it had  fined seven firms in Japan, Germany, France and the
Netherlands 60.6 million  euros ($62.5 million) for two types of cartels in  specialty graphites.

The graphites are used to make industrial tools in the aerospace and electronics sectors and the Commission said the cartels came to light in an earlier probe on  graphite  electrodes. The firms have three months to pay the  fines.

Carbone Lorraine said the probes into  graphite  and brush operations followed an enquiry by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1999, but said it had reached an agreement that ended that dispute in 2000.

Class actions since begun by certain U.S. clients are close to conclusion and Carbone Lorraine said it had made $4.0 million in provisions to cover them. Such actions have just been started for the brush operations, it added.

BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (AFP) - The European Commission Tuesday fined eight companies, including four Japanese ones, a total of 60.6 million euros (62.4 million dollars) for operating a  cartel in speciality graphites.

The companies were found guilty of fixing prices worldwide of the  graphites -- which are used to make industrial tools in sectors including aerospace and electronics -- from 1993 to 1998.

TD
The eight were SGL Carbon of Germany, Carbone-Lorraine of France, US firm GrafTech International, Dutch company Intech and the four Japanese concerns -- Ibiden, Tokai Carbon, Toyo Tanso and Nippon Steel and Chemical.

The fines ranged from 27.75 million euros for SGL, which Brussels said was the "ringleader" of the cartel, to 980,000  euros for Intech.
"In each case the companies' conduct was a very serious infringement of the competition rules," the
European Union's executive arm said.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Tuesday fined seven companies from Germany, France and Japan a total of EUR60.6 million for price-fixing in the specialty graphite business.

Germany's SGL Carbon AG (SGG) received the heaviest  fine, EUR27.75 million. Japan's Toyo Tanso must pay EUR10.79 million, France's Carbon Lorraine SA (F.CBL) EUR6.97 million, Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd. (J.TCR) EUR6.97 million, Ibiden Co. Ltd. (J.IBD) EUR3.58 million, Nippon Steel Chemical Co. (J.NSL) EUR3.58 million and Intech Inc. (J.INT) EUR0.98 million.

TD
Specialty graphites are used in everything from engineering to electronics. High purity  graphite  is used in the aerospace and nuclear industries, semiconductors, the automobile industry, and household appliances.
Between 1993 and 1998, the seven companies engaged in a worldwide  price-fixing cartel, the E.U.
Commission concluded after a two-year investigation.

The cartel began with a meeting in Gotenba, Japan, on July 23, 1993. The major producers there agreed to divvy up the market.
Regular meetings were held by top executives in Japan.
At a meeting in Paris Feb. 24 and 25, 1993, the  European companies joined the  cartel. "Throughout the duration of the  cartel, the parties regularly discussed prices, included who would
announce what price on which date," the  Commission said in a statement.
SGL's  fine was the highest "because it was the ringleader," the  Commission said. The other companies received reductions for cooperating.
One other company, the U.S.'s GrafTech International Ltd. (GTI), formerly known as UCAR International
Inc., was given immunity "because it revealed the  cartel," the  Commission said.
-By William Echikson, Dow Jones Newswires; 32-2-285-0134; william.echikson@dowjones.com
SGL Carbon said it would appeal the  fine at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
The company said the penalty was unjustified because the  Commission imposed fines on the
graphite  industry in July 2001 in a related case.
SGL Carbon said that "the  Commission is not entitled to impose a further  fine" and that it was
"confident that this opinion will be confirmed by the court."

HD         NEWS SNAP: SGL Carbon Fined Again For Antitrust Breach
BY         By Christiaan Hetzner

LP
FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union's competition authorities imposed an antitrust fine on SGL Carbon AG (G.SGL) Tuesday as expected for its role as ringleader in a specialty graphites cartel dating back to 1993.
The company was slapped with the heaviest penalty among the seven offenders, with the E.U. levying a
fine of EUR27.75 million out of a total of EUR60.6 million.

TD
During the period between 1993 and 1998, the group of seven colluded in a worldwide  price-fixing
scheme, the E.U.  Commission concluded after a two-year investigation.

Specialty graphites are used in everything from high tech engineering to electronic appliances.

This is now the third time the company has been punished from antitrust regulators. SGL had already been fined EUR80 million by the E.U. in 2001 for  price-fixing among graphite  electrode products. In
1999, it had to pay $145 million to U.S. antitrust authorities.
"The level of the  fine did not surprise us as we expected some EUR30 million," said Marcus Storr of
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
Despite widespread speculation prior to the decision, the market reacted negatively to the size of the
fine.

Whereas shares had reached a high of EUR9.12 Tuesday, they fell roughly three percentage points to an intraday low at EUR8.57 immediately afterwards.
As of 1815 GMT, the stock was trading up at EUR8.93.

"The sort of impact this might have on the cash flow is what's decisive," said Storr, "as well as how this will effect the company's current refinancing discussions."

Storr expects SGL to have to offer an interest rate premium of 150-250 basis points to convert debt maturing at the end of the year into longer term liabilities, although this is certainly a factor that creditor banks "have already taken into consideration." He rates the stock a high risk hold.

Analysts estimate that roughly 60% of its EUR450 million in net debt, or EUR270 million, will come due as of Dec. 31.

Talks with creditor banks are "proceeding according to plan," said a spokesman for the company. He declined to provide any details as to the amount of debt maturing at the end of the month.
SGL said it would appeal the decision, arguing that the  Commission wasn't entitled to impose a further
fine following its earlier decision in 2001.

Other companies that were found to breach  cartel regulations include Japan's Toyo Tanso, which must pay EUR10.79 million. France's Carbon Lorraine SA (F.CBL) and Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd. (J.TCR) were both fined EUR6.97 million. Ibiden Co. Ltd. (J.IBD) and Nippon Steel Chemical Co. (J.NSL) each

Page 34 of 66 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
received penalties of EUR3.58 million each, while Intech Inc. (J.INT) was ordered to pay just EUR0.98 million.

U.S.-based offender, GrafTech International Ltd. (GTI), formerly known as UCAR International Inc., was granted immunity "because it revealed the  cartel," the  Commission said.

YEAR IN REVIEW

TD
This year was better than 2001 for most chemical firms, but a sputtering economy has delayed the
hoped-for recovery. Economic uncertainty limited M&A, although there were still many deals announced,
particularly by private equity capital firms. Companies had a lot to worry about during the course of the
year, including asbestos liabilities, heightened security requirements, higher insurance premiums,

FRANKFURT, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The following German stocks may be affected by newspaper reports and other factors on Wednesday:

TD
IFO

Germany's Ifo institute is due to release its monthly business confidence survey at 0900 GMT with firms' pessimism about the future seen sending the closely-watched index down for the seventh month in a row.

Analysts expect government plans to raise taxes and cut spending will help to knock the index to 87.0 from 87.3 in November. Forecasts ranged from 85.6 to 88.0. The Ifo index regularly impacts German stock prices.
LUFTHANSA (LHAG.F)

Lufthansa and United Airlines are planning to strengthen their alliance and boost sales by doing more cross-selling of trans-Atlantic tickets, the Wall Street Journal  Europe reported on Wednesday.

The deal would allow troubled United to fill more seats, thus boosting revenue without extra cost, while giving Lufthansa a better use of its sales network.

United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp. (UAL.N) and the number two U.S. airline, filed the largest bankruptcy in aviation history last week. Lufthansa has said in the past that it is considering options to support its Star Alliance partner.
LION BIOSCIENCE (LIOG.DE)

German bioinformation technology company Lion Bioscience said on Wednesday it was set to receive a $2 million milestone payment from drug major Bayer later this month.

The payment relates to software components for drug discovery and is accompanied by expanding cooperation between Lion and Bayer, according to the company's statement.
DEGUSSA (DGXG.DE)

German coal firm RAG said on Tuesday evening that its bid to take control of chemicals firm Degussa AG (DGXG.DE) from E.ON AG (EONG.DE) would fail unless the utility's acquisition of Ruhrgas was cleared by the end of January.

Earlier on Tuesday, a Duesseldorf court upheld an injunction blocking E.ON's 10 billion  euro takeover of gas importer Ruhrgas, throwing the future of Degussa into doubt and sending shares in the chemicals firm down over eight percent.
SGL CARBON (SGCG.DE)

SGL Carbon, the world's largest maker of  graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, said on Tuesday evening that it would appeal against an earlier decision by the  European Commission to fine the firm
27.75 million euros for price fixing  in speciality graphites.

HD         Infineon,  Telekom drag DAX lower despite Ifo help. BY          By Jess Smee
WC        477 words

LP
FRANKFURT, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Ailing telecoms and tech stocks led by chipmaker Infineon (IFXGn.DE) bruised the German DAX on Wednesday, overshadowing news that the closely watched Ifo index came in a whisker above expectations.

Infineon lost 5.9 percent after Micron Technology Inc. (MU.N), the No. 2 maker of computer memory chips, disappointed the market with a first quarter net loss.

TD
"This is bad news for the sector. Any signs of weakness will make people nervous about techs which are already seen as risky," one trader said.

The DAX index traded off 1.2 percent at 3,101.41 points by 0940 GMT. It trimmed losses slightly immediately after the Ifo figures but then returned to its previous levels.

The influential business sentiment indicator fell for the seventh month in a row in December. The headline west German business climate index eased to 87.1 from 87.3 in November, just above the consensus forecast for a decline to 87.0.

Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) inflicted the most damage on the DAX, joining a pan-European telecoms downturn after British mobile phone giant Vodafone (VOD.L) announced that chief executive Chris Gent would step down in July next year.

"That is not specifically a negative factor for Telekom but it is bad for the sector as a whole as he had a solid reputation," a trader in Frankfurt said.

"Telekom shares are also suffering from a technical point of view as we have repeatedly tried to break through the 13  euros barrier with no luck and now we are on a downtrend," he said.
TECH WOES

Epcos (EPCGn.DE), Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and SAP (SAPG.DE) all shed around two percent, stepping up the pressure and mirroring tumbling tech stocks across  Europe .
Infineon steepened its fall after investment bank Morgan Stanley downgraded the  European
semiconductor sector to "cautious" from "in-line".

Energy giant E.ON (EONG.DE) slipped 1.4 percent to 42.44  euros, extending Tuesday's fall of 4.4 percent after a German court upheld an injunction blocking its buy of Ruhrgas.

"This news is another delay but it doesn't mean the deal's off for good," a trader said, adding that the share would find support at around 40  euros.

On the mid-cap segment of the DAX index , SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE), the world's largest maker of graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, shed three percent, a move traders attributed to Tuesday's news that the European Commission would fine the firm 27.75 million  euros for price fixing  in speciality graphites.

Page 46 of 66 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SGL has said it would appeal the decision.

Market players expected market volumes to continue to dwindle in the run up to the Christmas break and expect more volatile price swings.

Infineon lost 5.7 percent after U.S. peer Micron Technology Inc., the number two maker of computer memory chips, disappointed the market with a worse-than-expected first quarter net loss as product prices dropped.

TD
The DAX index traded off 1.2 percent at 3,104.41 points by 1130 GMT. It trimmed losses slightly immediately after the Ifo figures but then returned to its previous levels.

The influential business sentiment indicator fell for the seventh month in a row in December. The headline west German business climate index eased to 87.1 from 87.3 in November, just above the consensus forecast for a decline to 87.0.

"The Ifo came in largely in line and therefore there was no big market reaction today," one trader in Frankfurt said. "We all know the Germany economy is doing badly but the figures did not come as a big surprise".
TELEKOM HURTS
Deutsche Telekom inflicted the most damage on the DAX, falling 1.5 percent and joining a
pan-European telecoms downturn after British mobile phone giant Vodafone announced that chief
executive Chris Gent would step down in July next year.

"That is not specifically a negative factor for Telekom but it is bad for the sector as a whole as he had a solid reputation," a trader said.

"Telekom shares are also suffering from a technical point of view as we have repeatedly tried to break through the 13  euros barrier with no luck and now we are on a downtrend," he said.

Epcos, Siemens and SAP all shed more than two percent, stepping up the pressure and mirroring tumbling tech stocks across  Europe.
Infineon steepened its fall after investment bank Morgan Stanley downgraded the  European
semiconductor sector to "cautious" from "in-line".
Energy giant E.ON slipped 1.9 percent to 42.15  euros, extending Tuesday's fall of 4.4 percent after a
German court upheld an injunction blocking its buy of Ruhrgas.

"This news is another delay but it doesn't mean the deal's off for good," a trader said, adding that the share would find support at around 40  euros.

On the plus side, HVB Group rose four percent, outperforming peers in a move which traders described as a technical reaction to its recent dip. The stock is still trading some seven percent below its pricetag ten sessions ago.

SGL SHEDS

On the mid-cap segment of the DAX index, SGL Carbon, the world's largest maker of  graphite electrodes for steelmakers, shed three percent, a move traders attributed to Tuesday's news that the EuropeanCommission would fine the firm 27.75 million  euros for price fixing  in speciality graphites.
SGL has said it would appeal the decision.

Market players expected market volumes to continue to dwindle in the run up to the Christmas break and expect more volatile price swings.

The market traded at less than a thirds of its average daily volumes by midday and market players said volatility would increase in the run-up to Friday's triple witching - the expiry of index futures, index options and stock options.
Outside the DAX, shares in logisitics firm Stinnes AG jumped over 22 percent to a multi-year high of
39.90 euros, a touch above the price offered by German rail operator Deutsche Bahn for remaining
shares in its subsidiary.
Deutsche Bahn currently holds 99.7 percent of Stinnes AG. (With additional reporting by Paul Hoskins).

HD        E.ON and sagging  Siemens hurt DAX as war fears grow. BY        By Marius Bosch

FRANKFURT, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Germany's DAX index plunged over three percent on Wednesday, pulled lower by hefty falls in utility E.ON and Siemens, as investors fled equities, fearing an imminent war with Iraq.
Fund managers said the DAX weakened further as market players jockeyed their positions ahead of
Friday's triple-witching derivatives expiry, hoping to push the index closer to the 3,000 level.

TD
"Fears about the Iraq war is one of the reasons why the DAX is going down but it also has something to do with Friday's triple-witching. The 3,000 level on the DAX is attractive to many options traders," said Boris Boehm, fund manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg.

U.S. President George W. Bush is concerned by omissions and problems in Iraq's arms declaration, the White House said on Wednesday, as Bush met top aides to discuss his likely announcement declaring Iraq in violation of a U.N. disarmament resolution.

The DAX was 3.37 percent lower at 3,034 points by 1626 GMT with market volatility nearing month-high levels as the DAX volatility index jumped over seven percent.

Market volatility usually rises sharply in the days ahead of a triple-witching, the simultaneous expiry of index futures, options on individual stocks and options on stock index futures.
E.ON SUFFERS

E.ON shares extended Tuesday's losses racked up after a German court upheld an injunction blocking its buy of Ruhrgas, throwing the group's future gas and disposals strategies into question.
The utility's stock crashed as much as 6.7 percent, erasing 1.99 billion  euros from its market value. "This news is another delay but it doesn't mean the deal's off for good," a trader said, adding that the
share would find support at around 40  euros.
E.ON shares were 5.89 percent down at 40.45  euros.

Siemens and other tech stocks also dived. Siemens lost 3.73 percent, passive electronic component maker Epcos plunged 11.48 percent and chipmaker Infineon lost 8.41 percent.
Traders blamed retreating U.S. tech stocks and Morgan Stanley's downgrade of the  European
semiconductor sector to "cautious" from "in-line" for much of the losses.

Tech sentiment was soured by fresh concern about corporate earnings after the world's number two maker of computer memory chips, Micron Technology Inc., disappointed the market with a
worse-than-expected first quarter.

Shares in Deutsche Telekom weakened 3.09 percent after credit rating agency Moody's said the review of Deutsche Telekom's credit rating that was due on December 16 may slip into next year.

Telekom stock was already weak on poor sector sentiment after British mobile phone giant Vodafone announced that chief executive Chris Gent would step down in July next year.
ALLIANZ FALLS
Shares in Europe's biggest insurer Allianz lost 3.13 percent after the surprise resignation of Chief
Executive Henning Schulte-Noelle.

"It was a short-term negative reaction because Schulte-Noelle is very highly respected and he did an excellent job over the years, except perhaps with the Dresdner deal and there's speculation that that's why he's going," said one trader.
Schulte-Noelle said his resignation was not linked to the company's current performance.

Allianz said earlier Schulte-Noelle, who at 60 is one of the oldest CEOs among Germany's blue-chip companies, would resign as chief executive with effect from April 29 and be replaced by Michael Diekmann, 47.

On the plus side, HVB Group rose 3.57 percent, outperforming peers in a move which traders described as a technical reaction to its recent dip. The stock is still trading some seven percent below its price tag ten sessions ago.

Health group Fresenius Medical Care stood 6.39 percent higher in a counter-reaction to Tuesday's nearly five percent fall.

On the mid-cap MDAX, SGL Carbon, the world's largest maker of graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, shed 5.23 percent, a move traders attributed to Tuesday's news that the European Commission would fine the firm 27.75 million  euros for price fixing  in speciality graphites.

(EDS: ADDING COMMENTS BY IBIDEN)

The European Commission fined four Japanese and three European firms 60.6 million euros (about $62.3 million) Tuesday for allegedly forming a price-fixing cartel for special kinds of graphite  used in the aerospace, electronics and nuclear industries.

TD
The four Japanese firms are Toyo Tanso Co., Tokai Carbon Co., Ibiden Co. and Nippon Steel Chemical Co. The three  European firms are SGL Carbon AG of Germany, Carbone-Lorraine S.A. of France and Intech EDM B.V. of the Netherlands.

According to the  commission, the seven firms set the price of the  specialty graphite  products in worldwide markets between 1993 and 1998 by forming a  cartel in violation of the competition rules of the European Union (EU).

In Tokyo, an Ibiden official said the company will study how to deal with the issue and may take necessary steps including a lawsuit.

The official said the European Commission notified Ibiden of its decision to fine it 3.58 million euros. If Ibiden agrees to pay it, the company will book the  fine as an extraordinary loss for the business
year to next March 31, the official said.

U.S. firm GrafTech International Ltd. also took part in the cartel, but the company was granted full immunity because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission, the commission said.

Brussels' antitrust regulators yesterday levied  fines of more than  Euros 160m ( $164m) on 18 companies for three separate  price-fixing conspiracies.

The penalties - for cartels in the specialty graphite,  steel products and food flavouring markets - bring the total  fines levied this year by the European Commission to more than  Euros 1.1bn.

TD
The worst-hit company was Germany's SGL Carbon,  fined Euros 28m for taking part in a seven-year conspiracy with six rivals from  Europe, Japan and the US to fix the price of  specialty graphite.
SGL could have been  fined more because it had already been found guilty of being part of another
graphite cartel but Brussels decided the two offences were too similar to warrant a punitive penalty.

Eight Italian producers of concrete reinforcing bars - a steel product used in construction - were ordered to pay Euros 85m after being found guilty of being part of a 10-year  cartel. Francesco Guerrera, Brussels

The European Commission has fined SGL Carbon and seven other graphite  makers a total of
EUR60.6m for participating in price fixing  cartel for speciality graphite.
Seven of these companies were also EUR219m  fined in July 2001 for operating a  cartel in the EU and
Norway in graphite  electrodes, used in EAFs for the steel industry.

TD
SGL Carbon, which received the lions share of both  fines, has already appealed the July 2001  fine and plans to also appeal this latest  Commission decision.

"In view of the penalties already imposed and the fact that it concerns the same events during the same period of time and in the same environment, SGL Carbon is of the opinion that the  European                   Commission is not entitled to impose a further  fine upon the Company and is confident that this opinion will be confirmed by the court," said the German company.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Commission continues anti-cartel investigation and  fines three companies for
price-fixing (nucleotides, speciality graphite  and reinforced concrete).

Brussels, 18/12/2002 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday the  European Commission demonstrated its determination to figh illegal agreements by taking puntitive active against three cartels. The first was in the speciality graphit sector, the second in reinforced concrete and the third in nucleotides, a substance used to enhance the flavour in foods. The companies have hree months to pay  fines imposed on them.

TD
Specialty  graphites: seven companies were  fined a total of EUR 60.6 million for participating in
price-fixing cartels in the market The investigation begun in the spring of 1999, when GraphTech revealed
information about anti-competitive practices also in the neighbour market of specialtygraphite. On the
basis of this information, the  Commission opened a new investigation in March 2000, which was
concluded today with the finding that eight companies participated in a worldwide  cartel between 1993 and
1998, through which they fixed the price for isostatic  specialty graphite  products used in the manufacture
of industrial tools in aerospace, electronics and other industries through which they fixed prices and
exchanged sensitive commercial information and occasionally shared out the market.. GraphTech was
granted full immunity because it revealed the  cartel to the Commission. However, the following
companies have been fined (in EUR millions): the German company SGL: EUR 27.75 (for the dominant
role it played); Toyo Tanso: EUR 10.79 Carbone-Lorraine: EUR 6.97; Tokai Carbon: EUR 6.97; Ibiden:
EUR 3.58; Nippon Steel Chemical: EUR 3.58; Intech: EUR 0.98. The  Commission revealed that for
several years the cartel accounted for most of the  specialty granite market (isostatic and extruded
granites).

Concrete reinforcing bar cartel. Fines were imposed totalling more than EUR 85 million on eight Italian firms for having organised a cartel on the market in concrete reinforcing bars, a product used in the construction industry. A detailed investigation carried out on-the-spot inspections in 2000 in the premises of several Italian companies. The  Commission found that eight firms took part in fixing the prices of reinforcing bar in bars or coils in Italy, which are long steel products, usually with a ribbed surface in the contructing buildings. The  Commission therefore imposed the following  fines (in EUR million): Riva
Acciaio SpA: 26.90; Lucchini SpA and Siderpotenza SpA: 16.14; Feralpi Siderurgica SpA: 10.25; Valsabbia Investimenti SpA and Ferriera Valsabbia SpA: 10.25; Alfa Acciai SpA: 7.175; Leali SpA and Acciaierie e Ferriere Leali Luigi SpA in liquidazione: 7.175; IRO Industrie Riunite Odolesi SpA: 3.58; Ferriere Nord SpA:
3.57. These firms accounted for around 30% of reinforcing bar produced in Italy in 1989 and more than
80% in 2000, the number of market players having fallen from some 40 to less than a dozen. The
Commission's investigation demonstrated that between 1989 and 2000, the  cartel members fixed the size
extras to be added to the base price for each product. Reinforcing bars are sold in some twenty diameters
ranging from 5 to 40 mm. From 1992 until 2000, the  cartel members also fixed the base price and, until
September 1995, agreed on standard terms of payment. Lastly, between 1995 and 2000, they limited
and/or monitored production and/or sales. The  Commission explains that some of the firms did not take
part in all the above infringements or did so for only part of the time. The Commission did not examine the
National cartels but rather the relevant product covered by the Treaty establishing the European Coal and
Steel Community (ECSC) for which the Commission has exclusive competence. Although the ECSC
Treaty expired on 23 July 2002, the Commission is entitled to take a decision because the facts took place
before that date.

a price-fixing cartel in nucleotides, a substance used to enhance the flavour in foods. Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd, another Japanese firm, was also found to be part of the  cartel, but it was granted full immunity from  fines for revealing the existence of the illegal agreement to the  Commission in 1999. According to the evidence in the  Commission's possession, Ajinomoto, Takeda, Cheil and Daesang operated a cartel for nine years until 1998 during which they agreed to fix "target" prices, implement concerted price increases, allocate customers, as well as exchange information on sales figures. Because they co-operated in the investigation, Daesang, Ajinomoto and Cheil also qualified for a reduction in the fines. Daesang was granted a bigger reduction (50%) because whilst it was not the first to approach the Commission Takeda was it did so on its own initiative, before receiving any information request. Ajinomoto is the world's biggest producer of nucleotides and was nearly twice as big as its competitors, hence a
higher fine. The four companies, however, accounted for the quasi totality of the sales worldwide. The relatively small size of the  fines is explained by the equally modest revenues procured by nucleotide of around EUR 8 million a year in the  European Economic Area.

FRANKFURT, Dec 20 (Reuters) - SGL Carbon (SGCG.DE), the world's largest manufacturer of graphite  electrodes for steelmakers, said on Friday it had secured a syndicated bank loan of 510 million euros ($523.1 million).
The loan, which expires in two and a half years, was lead managed by Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE)
and Dresdner Bank (ALVG.DE) and is secured at standard market conditions, the company said.

TD
"Together with the existing 134 million  euro convertible bond, it covers all of SGL Carbon's financial liabilities including the anti-trust  fines," the company said in a statement.

A 27.75-million-euro anti-trust fine was imposed on the company earlier this week by the European Commission for price fixing  in specialty graphites. SGL has said it would appeal to the European Court against the fine. SGL said the financing package, which entirely covers the firm's medium-term finance requirements, would be used to replace short-term credit facilities, among other things.
"With this we have covered all our debts and created a sound basis for group planning," SGL Chief
Executive Robert Koehler told Reuters.

Shares in the company rose after the news to stand up 4.67 percent at 7.85  euros by 1211 GMT, outperforming the mid-cap MDAX index, which was down 0.2 percent.

By the end of the third quarter SGL, which is also a supplier of carbon,  graphite  and related materials for industrial aerospace and defence applications, had cut its net debt by 73 million  euros to 454 million.
Koehler pledged to continue to focus on cutting debt in the coming years.

HD    COMPETITION - COMMISSION FINES 18 FIRMS MORE THAN EURO 160 MILLION FOR CARTEL BEHAVIOUR.

LP
There was little Christmas cheer to emerge from the  European Commission's last meeting of the year for
18 companies fined a total of more than  Euro 160 million for anti-competitive behaviour. The firms are a
motley collection of speciality  graphite  producers, food flavouring manufacturers and makers of concrete
reinforcing bars. The December 17 decision brings the total amount of  fines levied on cartels to just under
Euro one billion for 2002. But it is still slightly less than the amount levied in 2001.
Speciality  graphites.

TD
A Commission anti-trust investigation found eight companies to have participated in a world-wide  cartel between 1993 and 1998, through which they fixed the price for isostatic speciality  graphite  products, exchanged sensitive commercial information and occasionally divided up the market.

One of the eight, GrafTech International Ltd. of the US (formerly known as UCAR) was granted full immunity from any penalty because it was the first to bring the  cartel to the attention of the authorities.

The other seven firms were  fined as follows: SGL Carbon AG of Germany (Euro 27.75 million), Toyo Tanso Co. Ltd. of Japan (10.79 million), Carbone-Lorraine S.A. of France (6.97 million), Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd. of Japan (6.97 million), Ibiden Co. Ltd. of Japan (3.58 million), Nippon Steel Chemical Co. Ltd. of Japan (3.58 million), and Intech EDM B.V. of the Netherlands (0.98 million).
According to the  Commission's investigation, the  cartel behaviour began in Gotenba in Japan on July 23,
1993, where the companies concerned got together to agree some basic operating principles for their
market world-wide.

The Commission also found SGL and GrafTech to have participated in a parallel  price-fixing cartel for extruded graphite  products, which began at a meeting in Paris on February 24-25, 1993.

The Commission has already fined (on July 18, 2001) SGL, Tokai Carbon and GrafTech some  Euro 155 million for their involvement in a graphite  electrodes cartel, along with five other firms. Because of this offence, the  Commission looked at whether to increase the  fines against these companies to reflect the seriousness of a second infringement, but decided not to on the grounds that both infringements took
place at the same time.

Because it was ringleader in the  cartel for isoteric  graphite,  SGL received an increase of 50% in its  fine. But along with Ibiden, Tokai, Toyo Tanso and Nippon Steel Chemical, SGL also qualified for a reduction of
35% for co-operating. Intech received a reduction of 40% because of the considerable pressure it faced from Ibiden, for which it is the main distributor in  Europe, and a further 10% for not contesting the facts.
Flavour enhancers.

The second cartel fined by the Commission includes three companies found guilty of collusion to fix prices for nucleotides, a substance used to enhance the flavour of foods. Ajinomoto Co. Inc. of Japan was fined Euro 15.54 million. South Korean companies Cheil Jedang Corp. and Deasang Corp. were fined Euro 2.74 million and  Euro 2.28 million respectively. A fourth company that participated in the cartel, Japan's Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., was granted full immunity from  fines for its whistle-blower role.The  Commission says that a cartel operated between 1989 and 1999, in which the companies

concerned agreed to fix target prices, implement concerted price increases, allocate customers, and exchange information on sales figures.
Daesang's fine was cut by half because it co-operated closely during the investigation. Ajinomoto and
Cheil, which also co-operated, received a smaller reduction in  fines.
Concrete reinforcing bars.

The Commission fined eight Italian firms more than  Euro 85 million for colluding to fix the prices of reinforcing bars, a product used in the construction industry, in Italy. Usually, national cartels would not fall under the competence of the EU. But the  Commission is granted exclusive competence for certain products (including steel reinforcing bars) under the terms of the  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty. Although this agreement lapsed in July this year, it is still relevant for events that took
place prior to this date.The firms were  fined as follows:
- Riva Acciaio SpA:  Euro 26.90 million
- Siderpotenza SpA, which controls Lucchini SpA:  Euro 16.14 million
- Feralpi Siderurgica SpA:  Euro 10.25 million
- Valsabbia Investimenti SpA and Ferriera Valsabbia SpA (treated as a single unit):  Euro 10.25 million
- Alfa Acciai SpA:  Euro 7.175 million
- Leali SpA and Acciaierie e Ferriere Leali Luigi SpA (treated as a single unit):  Euro 7.175 million
- IRO Industrie Riunite Odolesi SpA:  Euro 3.58 million
- Ferriere Nord SpA:  Euro 3.57 million

The Commission also found the Italian trade association Federacciai to have taken part in the  cartel, but has not imposed a fine on this organisation because the ECSC Treaty does not provide for trade associations to be fined.

According to the  Commission's investigations,  cartel members fixed the amount to be added to the base product price according to the diameter size of the rods. Between April/May 1992 and 2000,  cartel members also fixed the base price and, until September 1995, agreed on standard terms of payment. Between 1995 and 2000,  cartel members were involved in restricting and monitoring sales. Some of the firms did not take part in all of the infringements or did so for only part of the time.

In calculating the level of  fines, the Commission took account of the fact that the  cartel affected only the domestic market on which the firms, for the early part of the infringement, enjoyed only a limited market share. The higher  fines imposed on Riva and Lucchini reflect their larger overall size.

Ferriere Nord received a 20% reduction in its  fine for co-operating with the  Commission. Furthermore, it participated in the  cartel for a much shorter period of time than the other companies. On the other hand, though, the firm had already been  fined, in August 1989, for taking part in an agreement on the market in welded steel mesh.

Following an investigation into an alleged  cartel by manufacturers of speciality  graphite,  the European     Commission has levied fines totalling EUR 60.6 M on seven producers. The investigation covered
1993-1998 and found that prices of isostatic moulded  graphite  products had been artificially inflated. SGL Carbon, Germany, was fined EUR 27.75 M, Carbone-Lorraine, France, was  fined EUR 6.97 M and Intech EDM, the Netherlands, was fined EUR 0.98 M. The  fines on four Japanese companies were EUR 10.79 M for Toyo Tanso, EUR 6.97 M for Tokai Carbon, EUR 3.58 M for Ibiden and EUR 3.58 M for Nippon Steel Chemical. The  fines must be paid within three months. No fine was levied on Graftech, US, which,
although involved, notified the  European Commission of the cartel's operation.

The European Commission has fined seven companies a total of EUR 60.5 M for their involvement in a speciality graphites price-fixing and distribution  cartel. The companies concerned were SGL Carbon of Germany, Carbone-Lorraine of France, the Japanese companies Ibiden, Tokai Carbon, Toyo Tanso and Nippon Steel, Intech of Holland and GraphTech International of USA.  Fines ranged from EUR 0.98 M to EUR 10.79 M. GraphTech was not fined due to the fact that it cooperated fully with the  Commission from the start of its inquiries. Speciality graphites are use extensively in the manufacture of components for the aerospace and automobile industries.
