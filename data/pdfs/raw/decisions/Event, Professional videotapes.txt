The European Commission said it has finedSony Corp, Fuji Film Corp and Hitachi Ltd's Maxell a combined total of E74.8 million for alleged cartel activity in the professional  videotape  sector around eight years ago.
Sony was fined E47.2 million, Fuji 13.2 million and 14.4 million.

TD
The commission said the companies managed to "raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contacts" between 1999 and 2002.

It said the groups, with a combined share of more than 85pc of the professional video tape market, allegedly organised "three successful rounds of price increases and endeavoured to stabilise prices whenever an increase was not possible". They also regularly monitored the implementation of the price agreements, it added. It said its evidence "describes in detail" 11 meetings at which Sony, Fuji and Maxell discussed and agreed prices and/or exchanged sensitive commercial information as well as continuous contacts intended to monitor the implementation of their  cartel agreements. The  cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time of the infringement: Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which in 2001 had total annual sales of E115 million in the European Economic Area (EEA), the commission continued. Television stations and independent producers of television programmes and advertising films are the main customers of professional  videotapes. Sony's  fine was increased by 30.0 pct for obstructing the commission's investigation during on-site inspections at its premises, the EU executive added in a statement. Fuji's and Maxell's  fines are reduced by 40.0 pct and 20.0 pct
respectively because they co-operated with the investigation under the commission's leniency laws. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "This decision sends two warnings to companies engaging in cartel activities: first, the Commission can prosecute cartels effectively even without prompts from immunity applicants, and second, obstructing a Commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe
penalties." The commission started an investigation with surprise inspections at European units belonging to Sony, Fuji and Maxell in May 2002. "The inspections proved particularly successful as abundant evidence of cartel activities was found," it said. The commission also noted a Sony employee "refused to answer oral questions asked by the Commission's inspectors, in breach of Sony's obligation to answer, while another Sony employee was found to have shredded documents during the inspection". Fuji and, at a later stage, Maxell co-operated with the commission and submitted additional evidence, the EU executive added. The  fines were based on the commission's 2006 guidelines -- the first antitrust decision to do so.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)-- Sony Corp. (6758.TO), Fujifilm Holdings Corp.(4901.TO) and Hitachi Maxell (6810.TO) will face a EUR75 million fine for fixing  prices in the European professional  videotape markets, the European Commission said Tuesday.

Sony faces a EUR47.1 million for trying to obstruct the commission from carrying out its investigation.

Fuji is facing a EUR13.2 million  fine after receiving a 40% reduction for cooperating with the regulator, while Maxell's fine was reduced by 20% to EUR14.4 million also for cooperating.
"Obstructing a Commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The cartel was active in the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time: Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which in 2001 totaled annual sales of some EUR115 million in Europe, according to the commission.

The three companies, with a combined market share of over 85%, colluded over eleven separate meetings forcing three successful price increases in the professional  videotape  market.
The commission started the investigation on its own initiative with surprise inspections at the offices of
Sony's, Fuji's and Maxell's European subsidiaries in May 2002.

During the inspections a Sony employee refused to answer questions while another employee was caught shredding documents.
Fuji and, at a later stage, Maxell co-operated by providing the commission with additional evidence. These are the first set of  fines handed out under the commission's new guidelines for cartels, which
aim to encourage cooperation and hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat
offenders. The  fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales. -By Peppi Kiviniemi, Dow Jones

EU FinesSony for Professional  Videotape Activities in Europe Today, Sony Corporation, Sony France SA and Sony Europe Holding BV were informed by the European Commission that it had taken a Decision fining those companies 47.19 million Euros for participating in a cartel from 1999 to
2002 in the professional video tape market in Europe. We have received a brief announcement, but do not yet have the full text of the Decision which we expect to receive in the coming days.

We are very disappointed by the conduct described in the announcement, which involved a small number of employees located in Europe. While the details still need to be confirmed in the full text of the Decision, Sony wants to make clear that it does not approve of or condone conduct of the kind described in the announcement. We are sorry that it happened and express our sincere regret.

Sony is committed to complying fully with all applicable competition rules, including the EU antitrust rules, and it did not contest the principal matters described in the Commission's announcement after they had been formally communicated to Sony.Sony does not, however, agree with the allegation that it obstructed the Commission's investigation. The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable, but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the Commission's investigation.

Since the events in the Decision took place some years ago, Sony has reinforced its antitrust compliance policies and training, and has repeatedly made clear to its employees, as it does again today, that such conduct violates our basic principles of integrity and our code of conduct, is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission imposed fines totaling 74.8 million euros (one euro equals 1.48 U.S. dollars) on Tuesday on Japanese companies Sony, Fuji and Hitachi Maxell for fixing  prices for professional  videotapes sold in Europe.

"Between 1999 and 2002, Sony, Fuji and Maxell managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contacts," the European Union (EU)'s antitrust watchdog said in a statement.

Sony's fine was increased by 30 percent to 47.2 million euros for obstructing the commission's investigation during on-site inspections at its premises.

Fuji's and Maxell's  fines were reduced by 40 percent and 20 percent to 13.2 million euros and 14.4 million euros respectively because they co-operated with the investigation.

The three companies were accused of running an illegal  cartel to fix prices for the two most popular professional videotape  formats, namely Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which are mainly used by TV stations and independent producers of TV programs and advertising films.

The Commission started an investigation on its own initiative with surprise inspections, carried out at the premises of Sony's, Fuji's and Maxell's European subsidiaries in May 2002.

Investigation revealed that the three companies, with a combined share of more than 85 percent of the professional video tape market, organized three successful rounds of price increases and endeavored to stabilize prices whenever an increase was not possible. They also regularly monitored the implementation of the price agreements.

In addition to the  fines, the commission said any person or firm affected by the three companies' behavior may also seek damages before the courts of the EU member states.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 20 -- The  European Commission on Tuesday finedSony Corp. and two other Japanese companies a total of 75 million euros ($111 million) for alleged formation of a price  cartel in the market for business-use  videotapes.
Sony was fined 47.2 million euros, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. 13.2 million euros and Hitachi Maxell Ltd.
14.4 million euros, the executive body of the European Union said.

TD
The three companies, which have a combined 85 percent share of the European market for videotapes used by television stations, allegedly set prices of them through a series of meetings between 1999 and 2002, the  European Commission said. They sold a combined 115 million euros in the market in 2001.

According to the commission, Sony obstructed its investigation, with company employees refusing to give testimony and destroying evidence.

The fines slapped on Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell represent respective reductions of 40 percent and 20 percent from the original amounts as the two companies cooperated with the commission in its investigation.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said, ''Obstructing a Commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties.''

In Japan, Sony released a statement saying it ''truly regrets the acts allegedly involving a small number of employees in Europe'' in reference to the price  cartel.
As for the commission's claim about Sony's obstruction, the statement said there were some
''inappropriate and regrettable'' acts on the part of Sony employees, but that the company believes
they had no material impact on the investigation.

A spokesman for Hitachi Maxell said that although the company will pay the  fine, it will closely examine the commission's decision and will ''consider countermeasures, including a lawsuit, if the decision is found to have unacceptable contents.''

A Fujifilm spokesman said the company will consider what to do about the order after studying the details of the decision.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 20 -- The  European Commission on Tuesday finedSony Corp. and two other Japanese companies a total of 75 million euros ($111 million) for alleged formation of a price  cartel in the market for business-use  videotapes.
Sony was fined 47.2 million euros, Fujifilm Holdings Corp. 13.2 million euros and Hitachi Maxell Ltd.
14.4 million euros, the executive body of the European Union said.

TD
The three companies, which have a combined 85 percent share of the European market for videotapes used by television stations, allegedly set prices of them through a series of meetings between 1999 and 2002, the  European Commission said. They sold a combined 115 million euros in the market in 2001.

According to the commission, Sony obstructed its investigation, with company employees refusing to give testimony and destroying evidence.

The fines slapped on Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell represent respective reductions of 40 percent and 20 percent from the original amounts as the two companies cooperated with the commission in its investigation, it said.

But the commission made no reduction for Sony and urged the company to pay the  fine and an additional 30 percent on top.

EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said, ''Obstructing a Commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties.''

In Japan, Sony released a statement saying it ''truly regrets the acts allegedly involving a small number of employees in Europe'' in reference to the price  cartel.
As for the commission's claim about Sony's obstruction, the statement said there were some
''inappropriate and regrettable'' acts on the part of Sony employees, but that the company believes
they had no material impact on the investigation.

A spokesman for Hitachi Maxell said that although the company will pay the  fine, it will closely examine the commission's decision and will ''consider countermeasures, including a lawsuit, if the decision is found to have unacceptable contents.''

A Fujifilm spokesman said the company will consider what to do about the order after studying the details of the decision.

TOKYO - Researchers from Kyoto University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States said separately on Wednesday that they have each succeeded in reprogramming human skin cells to behave like embryonic stem cells, known for their ability to turn themselves into every kind of body tissue.

The converted cells have many of the physical, growth and genetic features typically found in embryonic stem cells and can differentiate to produce other tissue types including neurons and heart tissue, according to Shinya Yamanaka, a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at Kyoto University.

Wealthy Gulf nations rethink peg to dollar: WSJ

NEW YORK - Oil-rich Persian Gulf states are pondering whether to cease to peg their currencies to the dollar, with the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates to shore up the slowing U.S. economy, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.
Because countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar sit on large reserves of
U.S. dollars, their decisions will have repercussions beyond their borders, the Journal said.

BRUSSELS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The  European Commission hit Sony Corp and two other Japanese producers of videotape  with fines totalling nearly 75 million euros ($109.8 million) on Tuesday for  fixing prices.

"Between 1999 and 2002, Sony, Fuji and Maxell managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contacts," the European Union executive said in a statement.

TD
Sony's  fine was increased by 30 percent to just over 47 million euros after it obstructed the investigation, the statement said.

The fines for Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Hitachi Maxell Ltd were reduced by 40 and 20 percent respectively -- to 13.2 million and 14.4 million euros -- after they co-operated with the investigation.
"This decision sends two warnings to companies engaging in  cartel activities," European Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in the statement.

"First, the Commission can prosecute cartels effectively even without prompts from immunity applicants, and second, obstructing a Commission antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," she said.
The Commission started an investigation with raids on EU subsidiaries of Sony, Fuji and Maxell in May
2002.

The raids found "abundant evidence of  cartel activities" although a Sony employee refused to answer questions by EU officials, in breach of Sony's obligations, and another employee shredded documents during the raid, the Commission said. Sony acknowledged its involvement only after receiving a formal charge sheet from the Commission, it said.

The cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time -- Betacam SP and Digital Betacam which in 2001 had total annual sales of 115 million euros in the EU and other European countries.
Television stations and independent TV producers are the main customers for professional  videotapes. Sony, Fuji and Maxell, controlling more than 85 percent of the professional  videotape  market,
"organised three successful rounds of price increases and endeavoured to stabilise prices whenever an
increase was not possible", the Commission said. They also regularly monitored the implementation of
price agreements and the evidence had details of 11 meetings at which the three companies organised
their cartel, it said.

The fines were the first applied under new EU guidelines, which will generally increase such penalties for companies which fix prices or do deals to divide up markets. (Writing by William Schomberg; editing by Dale Hudson)

TOKYO and BERLIN, November 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Sony Corporation, Sony France SA and Sony Europe Holding BV were informed by the European Commission that it had taken a Decision fining those companies 47.19 million Euros for participating in a cartel from 1999 to 2002 in the professional video tape market in Europe. We have received a brief announcement, but do not yet have the full text of the Decision which we expect to receive in the coming days.

We are very disappointed by the conduct described in the announcement, which involved a small number of employees located in Europe. While the details still need to be confirmed in the full text of the Decision, Sony wants to make clear that it does not approve of or condone conduct of the kind described in the announcement. We are sorry that it happened and express our sincere regret.

TD
Sony is committed to complying fully with all applicable competition rules, including the EU antitrust rules, and it did not contest the principal matters described in the Commission's announcement after they had been formally communicated to Sony.Sony does not, however, agree with the allegation that it
obstructed the Commission's investigation. The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable, but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the Commission's investigation.

Since the events in the Decision took place some years ago, Sony has reinforced its antitrust compliance policies and training, and has repeatedly made clear to its employees, as it does again today, that such conduct violates our basic principles of integrity and our code of conduct, is unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.

BRUSSELS, Nov 20, 2007 (AFP) -
EU antitrust regulators hit Japanese groups Sony, Fuji and Hitachi Maxell on Tuesday with a combined
fine of 74.8 million euros for running an illegal  cartel in the market for professional  videotape.

TD
The European Commission slapped the companies with the  fine worth 110.6 million dollars after finding they had colluded to raise or control prices from 1999 to 2002 through regular meetings and other illicit contacts.
Sony's fine was raised 30 percent to 47.2 million euros because one employee refused to answer EU
cartel investigators' questions during a May 2002 raid while another shredded documents during a May
2002 raid on a European subsidiary.
Fuji's  fine was reduced by 40 percent to 13.2 million euros and Maxell's penalty was cut by 20 percent to
14.4 million euros because they cooperated with investigators.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes is in the midst of a crackdown on cartels and has chalked up more than a billion euros in  fines so far this year against illegal clubs that her services have uncovered.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators imposed fines Tuesday totaling €74.79 million (US$109.6 million) on three Japanese companies for running a cartel that fixed prices on professional videotapes sold in Europe.

The companies involved were Sony Corp., Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Hitachi Maxell Ltd., which had a combined share of more than 85 percent of the professional video market.

TD
The cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time, Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which had 2001 sales of €115 million (US$168.5 million) in Europe, the Commission said. The main customers were TV stations, independent TV producers and makers of advertising films.

"Between 1999 and 2002, Sony, Fuji and Maxell managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contracts," said a statement from the  European Commission.

The biggest  fine, €47.19 million (US$69.15 million), was levied on Sony, which the commission accused of obstructing its investigation.

The penalty for the other companies was reduced because they cooperated with the investigation. Fuji received a fine of €13.2 million (US$19.34 million) and Maxell was  fined €14.4 million (US$21.1 million).
Inspectors from the EU's executive branch raided the companies' European subsidiaries in May 2002. "Abundant evidence of  cartel activities was found," the commission said.
It complained that one Sony employee had refused to answer questions from the inspectors and another had shredded documents during the raid.
"Obstructing a commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
In Tokyo, all three companies reacted cautiously.

Sony spokeswoman Mariko Yamabe said the company had no immediate comment because it is still confirming the content of European Union's announcement.

Masahiro Takahashi, a spokesman at Hitachi Maxell, said his company will "make an appropriate response" to the EU decision after examining the order. Takahashi said the company has not decided whether to appeal.

And Fuji, in a statement, said much the same thing: "The Fujifilm Group will consider further responses after investigating the full content of the  European Commission's decision."
The EU also said the three companies' customers could sue them.


Page 21 of 52 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"They are able to go to national courts to seek damages," said Jonathan Todd, the Commission's antitrust spokesman.

According to the EU, the companies "organized three successful rounds of price increases and endeavored to stabilize prices whenever an increase was not possible."

The fines are the first handed out under the commission's new guidelines for cartels. The aim is to encourage cooperation and hand out harsher punishments for obstruction and repeat offenders.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators Tuesday imposed  fines totaling about $109.6 million on Japanese companies Sony Corp., Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Hitachi Maxell Ltd. for running a cartel that fixed prices on professional  videotapes sold in Europe.

"Between 1999 and 2002, Sony, Fuji and Maxell managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contracts," said a statement from the  European Commission.

TD
Sony, Fuji and Maxell had a combined share of more than 85 percent of the professional video market. The main customers were TV stations, independent TV producers and makers of advertising films.

The biggest  fine of 47.19 million euros ($69.15 million) went to Sony, which the commission accused of obstructing its investigation.

The other companies had their penalties reduced because they cooperated with the probe. Fuji received a fine of 13.2 million euros ($19.34 million) and Maxell 14.4 million euros ($21.1 million).
Inspectors from the EU's executive branch raided the companies' European subsidiaries in May 2002. "Abundant evidence of  cartel activities was found," the commission said.
It complained that one Sony employee had refused to answer questions from the inspectors and another had shredded documents during the raid.
"Obstructing a commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

In Tokyo, Sony spokeswoman Mariko Yamabe said the company had no immediate comment because it is still confirming the content of European Union's announcement.

Masahiro Takahashi, a spokesman at Hitachi Maxell said his company will "make an appropriate response" to the EU measure after thoroughly examining the order. Takahashi said the company has not decided whether to appeal.

Fuji said in a statement that "the Fujifilm Group will consider further responses after investigating the full content of the  European Commission's decision."

The cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time, Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which had 2001 sales of 115 million euros ($168.5 million) in Europe, the Commission said.

On top of the  fines, the EU said the three companies could face legal action for damages from customers.

"They (customers) are able to go to national courts to seek damages," said Jonathan Todd, the
Commission's antitrust spokesman.

According to the EU, the companies "organized three successful rounds of price increases and endeavored to stabilize prices whenever an increase was not possible."

The fines are the first handed out under the commission's new guidelines for cartels, which aim to encourage cooperation and hand out harsher punishments for obstruction and repeat offenders.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed on Tuesday its forecast for the U.S. economic growth to a range of 1.8 to 2.5 percent in 2008 from the 2.5 to 2.75 percent pace it forecast previously.

"These revisions to the 2008 outlook since June stemmed from a number of factors, including the tightened terms and reduced availability of subprime and jumbo mortgages, weaker-than-expected housing data, and rising oil prices," the central bank said in its first quarterly economic forecast report under a new policy.

BRUSSELS
BRUSSELS - Sony Corp., Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Hitachi Maxell Ltd. have been fined a total of about
$110.5 million U.S. by European regulators for  fixing  the prices of professional videotape.

TD
The European Commission finedSony $69.2 million, Fujifilm $19.4 million and Hitachi Maxell $21.1 million. The commission said it raised the  fine against Sony, the world's second-largest maker of consumer electronics, by 30 per cent because an employee refused to answer questions during a 2002 raid and another worker shredded documents. It was the largest percentage increase for impeding a cartel probe.

"Obstructing the commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said yesterday in Brussels.

The commission cut the penalty against Fujifilm by 40 per cent and 20 per cent for Maxell because they co-operated with the probe.

Sony acknowledged its participation in the  cartel only after it received formal charges, the commission said.

The case is the first under new guidelines that allow regulators to increase  fines based on the size of the market and the length of the violation. The commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, said the  videotape market had sales of about $170 million in 2001.

"The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable, but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the Commission's investigation," Sony said.

Ms. Kroes has made fighting cartels one of her main priorities since her five-year term began in 2004. The EU has levied a record $3.81 billion in penalties in  cartel cases so far this year, compared with $2.71 billion in 2006.
Professional  videotape  is used to record optical signals made by a camera or computer.

The European Commission on Tuesday finedSony and two other Japanese  videotape  makers a total of 75m ($111m). Sony was given the bulk of the  fine on the basis that the group had obstructed its cartel investigation.

It is the first time Sony has been  fined by antitrust authorities outside Japan. Sony's  fine was increased by 30 per cent to 47m because an employee refused to answer questions by European Union officials during a 2002 raid, and another worker shredded documents.

Sony, Fujifilm Holdings and Hitachi Maxwell, which together control more than 85 per cent of the professional videotape  market, were  fined for allegedly forming a  cartel to fix prices.
Fujifilm was  fined 13.2m and Hitachi Maxell 14.4m. The commission cut the penalty against Fujifilm by
40 per cent and 20 per cent for Maxell after they co-operated with the investigation.

On Tuesday night Sony lashed out against the Commission's statement, denying it had obstructed the investigation. "The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the commission's investigation," Sony said.

The commission's finding is a blow to Sony, which has been focusing on expanding its business-to-business operations.

It is aiming to increase sales of equipment to broadcasters and film studios, a lucrative and growing business as companies shift to digitisation.
"Obstructing the commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said Neelie Kroes, EU
competition commissioner.

According to the commission, Sony, Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell organised three rounds of price increases and were in continuous contact to monitor and implement the price-fixing  agreements between 1999 and 2002.

Sony had acknowledged its participation in the  cartel only after it received formal charges, the commission said.

BRUSSELS -- European television stations and TV producers could see their expenses slashed after Sony and two other Japanese producers of  videotape  were hits with  fines totaling nearly €75 million ($109.8 million) for price  fixing.

The European Commission said the Sony, Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell -- who jointly account for more than 85% of the videotape  market -- managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contacts between 1999 and 2002.

TD
"This decision sends two warnings to companies engaging in  cartel activities," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "First, the commission can prosecute cartels effectively, even without prompts from immunity applicants, and second, obstructing a commission antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties."

The cartel covered the two most popular professional videotape  formats at the time, Betacam SP and Digital Betacam. The commission said that, at the height of the cartel's activities, 2001, the EU videotape market had sales of about €115 million, but this would have been grossly inflated by the price fixing.
The commission finedSony €47.2 million ($69.2 million), Fujifilm €13.2 million ($19.3 million) and Hitachi
Maxell €14.4 million ($21.1 million).

It raised the  fine against Sony, the world's second-largest maker of consumer electronics, by 30% because of deliberate obstruction -- one staffer refused to answer questions during a 2002 raid and another shredded documents. It was the largest percentage increase for impeding a  cartel probe. "Obstructing the commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," Kroes said.

By contrast, Fuji's and Maxell's  fines were cut by 40% and 20% respectively because they co-operated with investigators.

The case is the first under new guidelines that allow the commission to raise  fines based on the size of the market and the length of the violation. The EU has levied a record €2.6 billion ($3.9 billion) in penalties in cartel cases so far this year, compared with €1.9 billion ($2.7 billion) in 2006.

Brussels, 20/11/2007 (Agence Europe) - On 20 November, the European Commission imposed a total of
€74 790 000 fines on Sony, Fuji and Maxell for  fixing  prices for professional videotapes sold to
customers in Europe, in violation of the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices
(Article 81). Sony's  fine has been increased by 30% for obstructing the Commission's investigation during
on-site inspections at its premises. Fuji's and Maxell's  fines are reduced by 40% and 20% respectively
because they co-operated with the investigation under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice

TD
The Commission started surprise inspections at the premises of Sony, Fuji and Maxell in May 2002 and abundant evidence of  cartel activities was found. However, a Sony employee refused to answer oral questions asked by the Commission's inspectors, in breach of Sony's obligation to answer, while another Sony employee was found to have shredded documents during the inspection. Fuji and, at a later stage, Maxell co-operated with the Commission and submitted additional evidence. The  cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time of the infringement: Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which in 2001 totalled annual sales of some €115 million in the European Economic Area (EEA). Sony, Fuji and Maxell, with a combined share of more than 85% of the professional video tape market, organised three successful rounds of price increases and endeavoured to stabilise prices whenever an increase was not possible. This is the first Commission antitrust decision where the 2006 guidelines on fines have been applied. Under the new method,  fines better reflect the overall economic significance of the infringement as well as the share of each company involved. (C.D.)

The European Commission has slapped a fine of €74.79 million on the Japanese firms Sony, Fuji and Maxell (Hitachi Group) for their participation in a price-fixing cartel on the market for professional videotapes sold to European customers, it announced on 20 November.
"Between 1999 and 2002, the three companies met to control prices on Betacam SP and digital Betacam
videotapes," explained a spokesman. Sales of these products in Europe amounted to €115 million in

TD
Sony was hit with the biggest  fine, €47.19 million, followed by Maxell with €14.4 million and Fuji with
€13.2 million.

The Commission increased Sony's  fine by 30% owing to that company's "obstruction of the investigation" and "absence of cooperation." A Sony employee refused to answer inspectors' oral questions, in breach
of the firm's obligation of response, explained the spokesman. Another employee was discovered destroying documents during the investigation.

Fuji and Maxell were more cooperative and their  fines were consequently lowered by 40% and 20%, respectively, in keeping with the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice for firms that blow the whistle on serious violations of rules on concerted practices.

"Very precise information fell into our laps, together with tangible proof of the  cartel," the Commission explained, justifying its own-initiative investigation.

During the period in question, Sony, Fuji and Maxell, which together control over 85% of the professional videotape  market, met on 11 separate occasions to organise - successfully - three sets of price increases, the Commission states in a press release.

The fine represents the first application of the 2006 guidelines on  fines. Under the new method,  fines better reflect the overall economic significance of the infringement as well as the share of each company involved.

Customers of the three companies that may have paid too much may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages, added the Commission spokesman. They may submit elements of the Commission's decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Such "damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the  fine," added the EU executive.

Sony's  fine for fixing  prices in the market for professional videotapes was increased by 30 per cent because employees obstructed a European Commission inquiry into the  cartel by refusing to answer questions and by shredding documents. Officials said that it was the largest percentage uplift applied for obstruction.

The commission finedSony, Fuji and Maxell Euros 74.8m after ruling they had controlled prices through regular meetings and "other illicit contracts" between 1999 and 2002. It said the cartel covered two popular professional  videotape  formats - Betacam SP and Digital Betacam. Sony's fine is now Euros
47.2m (Dollars 67.7m, Pounds 33.8m). Those of Fuji and Maxell were reduced because of co-operation, and totalled Euros 13.2m and Euros 14.4m.

The European Commission yesterday finedSony and two other Japanese  videotape  makers a total of Euros 75m (Dollars 110m). Sony was given the bulk of the  fine on the basis that the group had obstructed its  cartel investigation.

It is the first time Sony has been  fined by antitrust authorities outside Japan. Sony's  fine was increased by 30 per cent to Euros 47m because an employee refused to answer questions by European Union officials during a 2002 raid, and another worker shredded documents.

Sony, Fujifilm Holdings and Hitachi Maxell, which together control more than 85 per cent of the professional videotape  market, were  fined for allegedly forming a  cartel to fix prices.
Fujifilm was  fined Euros 13.2m and Hitachi Maxell Euros 14.4m. The commission cut the penalty against
Fujifilm by 40 per cent and 20 per cent for Maxell after they co-operated with the investigation.

Last night Sony lashed out against the Commission's statement, denying it had obstructed the investigation. "The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the commission's investigation," Sony said.

The commission's finding is a blow to Sony, which has been focusing on expanding its business-to-business operations.

It is aiming to increase sales of equipment to broadcasters and film studios, a lucrative and growing business as companies shift to digitisation.
"Obstructing the commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said Neelie Kroes, EU
competition commissioner.

According to the commission, Sony, Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell organised three rounds of price inc-reases and were in continuous contact to monitor and implement the price-fixing  agreements between 1999 and 2002.

Sony had acknowledged its participation in the  cartel only after it received formal charges, the commission said.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission imposed fines totaling 75 million euros ($110 million) on Japanese companies Sony Corp., Fujifilm Holdings Corp. and Hitachi Maxell Ltd. for  fixing  prices in the European professional-videotape  market.

The companies were caught raising and controlling prices from 1999 to 2002 through regular meetings, according to the commission, the European Union's executive arm. Sony faces the biggest fine, 47.1 million euros, for allegedly obstructing the investigation.

TD
"Obstructing a commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties," said EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The other companies' penalties were reduced because they cooperated with the probe. Fuji received a fine of 13.2 million euros after a 40% reduction for cooperating with the regulator, while Maxell's fine was reduced by 20% to 14.4 million euros.

These are the first  fines handed out under the commission's new guidelines for cartels, which aim to encourage cooperation and hand out harsher punishments for obstructions and repeat offenders.
The fines are capped at 10% of annual global sales.

The commission said the  cartel was active in the two most popular professional-videotape  formats at the time, Betacam SP and Digital Betacam, which in 2001 had combined annual sales of about
115 million euros in Europe.

The three companies, with a combined market share of more than 85%, had 11 separate meetings that resulted in three successful price increases in the professional-videotape  market.

The commission started the investigation with surprise inspections at the offices of the three companies' European units in May 2002.

"We are very disappointed by the conduct described in the announcement, which involved a small number of employees located in Europe," Sony said in a statement.
Sony disagreed with the commission's view that it had obstructed the investigation.

"The incidents in question were inappropriate and regrettable, but did not amount to obstruction and had no material impact on the commission's investigation," Sony said.

Sony said it is committed to complying with competition rules and added that since the  cartel investigation, it has reinforced its antitrust compliance policies and training. Fujifilm couldn't be reached for comment. Hitachi Maxell said it "will carefully examine the  European Commission's reasoning" before deciding on next steps.

HD         Japanese trio fined Euro 70m for operating videotape cartel

Sony, Fuji and Maxell were  fined a combined total of nearly Euro 75 million (Pounds 54 million) yesterday for carving up the European  videotape  market between 1999 and 2002. The Japanese companies, which together held 85 per cent of the professional  videotape  market at the time, covertly organised three price increases during that period and monitored the agreement to ensure its observance.

The European Commission uncovered the cartel when it sprang dawn raids on the companies' premises in May 2002. These revealed 11 meetings during which prices had been agreed and sensitive commercial information exchanged. The Brussels based regulators singled out Sony for special treatment, increasing its  fine by 30 per cent, after one employee refused to answer investigators' questions and another was found to have shredded documents during the inspection.

TD
Announcing the penalties, Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "This decision sends two warnings to companies engaging in  cartel activities. First, the Commission can prosecute cartels effectively even without prompts from immunity applicants, and second, obstructing a Commission's antitrust investigation leads to severe penalties."

The Commission asserted yesterday that any customers who were affected by the illegal behaviour could seek damages before national courts.

The European Commission has finedSony, Fuji and Maxell nearly 75 million euros ($109.8 million) for
fixing  prices on Betacam SP and Digital Betacam cassettes for professional use.

“Between 1999 and 2002, Sony, Fuji and Maxell managed to raise or otherwise control prices through a series of regular meetings and other illicit contacts,” said European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

TD
Sony’s fine was increased by 30 percent to just over 47 million euros after it obstructed the investigation. The fines for Fujifilm and Hitachi Maxell were reduced by 40 percent and 20 percent respectively — to
13.2 million and 14.4 million euros — after they co-operated with the investigation, Reuters reported.
The commission began an investigation with raids on EU subsidiaries of Sony, Fuji and Maxell in May
2002. The raids found “abundant evidence of  cartel activities” according to the report, although a Sony
employee refused to answer questions by EU officials, and another employee shredded documents during
the raid, the commission said.

Reuters reported that Sony acknowledged its involvement only after receiving a formal charge sheet from the commission.

The cartel covered the two most popular professional  videotape  formats at the time — Betacam SP and Digital Betacam. In 2001, the formats, mainly sold to broadcasters and independent television producers, had total annual sales of 115 million euros in the EU and other European countries.

Sony, Fuji and Maxell controlled more than 85 percent of the professional  videotape  market. The trio “organized three successful rounds of price increases and endeavored to stabilize prices whenever an increase was not possible,” the commission said. The companies also regularly monitored the implementation of price agreements and had at least 11 meetings at which they organized the  cartel.

Leading glassmakers were on Wednesday  fined almost 500m ($739m) for rigging prices in the
European market for flat glass, used mainly by the construction industry.
The overall penalty of 489.9m is the fifth-highest on record imposed by the  European Commission.

TD
It is likely to drive home to companies the costly consequences, under a new fining regime, of engaging in anti-competitive activity in large markets or for long periods.
Guardian Industries, a privately owned US group, faces the biggest single penalty of 148m, followed by
Britain's Pilkington, which receives a 140m  fine.
France's Saint-Gobain is  fined 133.9m, while Japan's Asahi gets a 65m penalty.
Asahi's  fine was reduced because of its co-operation under the Commission's leniency arrangements. On Wednesday, the Commission said the companies had either raised or stabilised prices in the
European flat glass market through a series of meetings and illicit contracts between early 2004 and
early 2005.
"The companies profited from selling flat glass at artificially inflated prices,"said Neelie Kroes, the EU
competition commissioner.
"The direct victims were the buyers of flat glass - companies who made products such as
double-glazing and safety glass. But the final victims were European consumers who had to pay the
price for the glass used in buildings, private homes and apartments," she said.

The fine is only the second to be imposed under the new  fines guidelines, which are designed to reflect better the economic impact of anti-competitive behaviour.

Last week, fines were imposed under the new guidelines in a much smaller case involving the market for professional videotape.

Under the new regime,  fines are linked directly to the turnover which the companies derived from the manipulated market, and the length of time the  cartel lasted.

Lawyers said that the size of the latest penalty was a clear warning to companies - especially if they were operating in large markets - given that the  cartel in this case had lasted for barely a year.

Ms Kroes declined to elaborate on exactly how the  fines had been calculated, but she said that the "important thing is that the  fine as a whole is sufficiently deterrent, so that none of these companies will be tempted to infringe the rules again".
"I believe we achieved that aim in this case," she said.
Ms Kroes did confirm, that Saint-Gobain, which has faced antitrust action before, had not been hit by a
"repeat offender" penalty.


Page 47 of 52 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The latest  fine means that the Commission has so far raised more than 3bn in antitrust penalties from companies this year.

It also announced new guidelines on Wednesday for so-called "vertical" or conglomerate mergers - between, for example, a manufacturer and a supplier.

Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh will be fined €243.2 million for their participation in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in Europe, announced the European Commission on 5 December. The companies shared the European market from "at least" 1993 to 2002, announced the EU executive, and set prices for rubber used to manufacture adhesives, diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of shoes and a wide range of industrial goods.
The Commission increased the  fine for Italy's ENI, which had already been  fined for similar activities, by
60% (€132.1 million). Germany's Bayer, also a repeat offender, was given the biggest  fine (€201 million),
but the Commission granted it full immunity because it was the first company to reveal details about the
cartel. The EU executive is entitled to grant such reductions under the 2002 rules on leniency.

TD
The Japanese firm Tosoh (€4.8 million) and the American group DuPont-Dow (€59.2 million) were also granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25%, respectively. DuPont, on top of an initial  fine of €10.6 million, will have to share an additional  fine of €48.7 million with Dow, with which it had a joint venture in the cartel, explained the Commission. Japan's Denka will have to pay its full  fine of €47 million.

"The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal arrangements," explained the Commission.

This is not the first ruling against rubber producers. In November 2006, the Commission  fined five companies, among them ENI and Dow, €519 million for  cartel activities on the synthetic rubber market. Bayer, which had participated, was granted immunity for having blown the whistle.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press release. She will continue tracking down illegal concerted agreements. She recently imposed  fines on cartels acting on the European markets for professional  videotapes and for flat glass (see Europolitics 3423 and 3417).In this new rubber case, the  fines were decided on the basis of the 2006 guidelines on  fines, which are now based on a percentage of the annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years the violation existed. The  fines are intended to better reflect the participation of the different companies concerned and the economic impact of the violation.

The European Commission has slapped a fine of €74.79 million on the Japanese firms Sony, Fuji and Maxell (Hitachi Group) for their participation in a price-fixing cartel on the market for professional videotapes sold to European customers, it announced on 20 November.
"Between 1999 and 2002, the three companies met to control prices on Betacam SP and digital Betacam
videotapes," explained a spokesman. Sales of these products in Europe amounted to €115 million in
2001. Television stations and independent producers of TV programmes and advertisement films are the
main users of such professional  videotapes.

TD
Sony was hit with the biggest  fine, €47.19 million, followed by Maxell with €14.4 million and Fuji with
€13.2 million.

The Commission increased Sony's  fine by 30% owing to that company's "obstruction of the investigation" and "absence of cooperation." A Sony employee refused to answer inspectors' oral questions, in breach
of the firm's obligation of response, explained the spokesman. Another employee was discovered destroying documents during the investigation.

Fuji and Maxell were more cooperative and their  fines were consequently lowered by 40% and 20%, respectively, in keeping with the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice for firms that blow the whistle on serious violations of rules on concerted practices.

"Very precise information fell into our laps, together with tangible proof of the  cartel," the Commission explained, justifying its own-initiative investigation.

During the period in question, Sony, Fuji and Maxell, which together control over 85% of the professional videotape  market, met on 11 separate occasions to organise - successfully - three sets of price increases, the Commission states in a press release.

The fine represents the first application of the 2006 guidelines on  fines. Under the new method,  fines better reflect the overall economic significance of the infringement as well as the share of each company involved.

Customers of the three companies that may have paid too much may bring the matter before the courts of the member states and seek damages, added the Commission spokesman. They may submit elements of the Commission's decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal. Such "damages may be awarded without being reduced on account of the  fine," added the EU executive.

Bayer, Denka, DuPont, Dow, ENI and Tosoh will be fined €243.2 million for their participation in a  cartel for chloroprene rubber in Europe, announced the European Commission on 5 December. The companies shared the European market from "at least" 1993 to 2002, announced the EU executive, and set prices for rubber used to manufacture adhesives, diving equipment, condoms, the inner soles of shoes and a wide range of industrial goods.
The Commission increased the  fine for Italy's ENI, which had already been  fined for similar activities, by
60% (€132.1 million). Germany's Bayer, also a repeat offender, was given the biggest  fine (€201 million),
but the Commission granted it full immunity because it was the first company to reveal details about the
cartel. The EU executive is entitled to grant such reductions under the 2002 rules on leniency.

The Japanese firm Tosoh (€4.8 million) and the American group DuPont-Dow (€59.2 million) were also granted a reduction of their  fines of 50% and 25%, respectively. DuPont, on top of an initial  fine of €10.6 million, will have to share an additional  fine of €48.7 million with Dow, with which it had a joint venture in the cartel, explained the Commission. Japan's Denka will have to pay its full  fine of €47 million.

"The companies held regular meetings to discuss prices, exchange sensitive commercial information, discuss specific clients and to follow up the implementation of their illegal arrangements," explained the Commission.

This is not the first ruling against rubber producers. In November 2006, the Commission  fined five companies, among them ENI and Dow, €519 million for  cartel activities on the synthetic rubber market. Bayer, which had participated, was granted immunity for having blown the whistle.

"I find it very difficult to understand how shareholders and board members can tolerate such illegal behaviour," commented Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes in a press release. She will continue tracking down illegal concerted agreements. She recently imposed  fines on cartels acting on the European markets for professional  videotapes and for flat glass.In this new rubber case, the  fines were
decided on the basis of the 2006 guidelines on  fines, which are now based on a percentage of the annual sales concerned (up to 30% of sales), multiplied by the number of years the violation existed. The  fines are intended to better reflect the participation of the different companies concerned and the economic impact of the violation.
