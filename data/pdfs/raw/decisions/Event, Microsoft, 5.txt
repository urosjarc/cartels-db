A sampling of comments after the European Union issued a $613 million  fine and sanctions against
Microsoft Corp.:

"We think it's especially unfortunate that the  European Commission today embarked on a remedy that shows so little regard for the work and decision-making of the U.S. government. ... This is a case that started in the United States.  Microsoft is an American company, the complaining companies are American companies, the software is designed in the United States, and the U.S. government dealt with the issues thoroughly. There was no need for the Commission to disrupt that regime with this conflicting approach." -- Brad Smith,  Microsoft general counsel.

TD
----

"We do not take into account the nationality of (Microsoft). We take account of the welfare of consumers here in the European Union. ... The fact that many of those intervening ... are U.S.-based companies just like Microsoft brings on ... an important point. ... This case could not ... be read ... in terms of say, policy conflicts between the U.S. and EU, or in terms of industrial conflicting interests between the U.S. and EU."
-- EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
----

"We support the  European Commission's efforts to provide European consumers with all the benefits of a competitive marketplace, including choice in digital media products. The (EU) decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system." -- Bob Kimball, vice president and general counsel RealNetworks Inc., a complainant in the EU case.
----

"The European Commission may be trying to punish Microsoft, but its proposals reserve the harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies. The European Commission plans to regulate the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software costs
for everyone." -- Jonathan Zuck, President Association for Competitive Technology, a pro-Microsoft trade group.
----

"The Commission's decision seeks to create a level playing field ... enabling competitors to deliver work group servers that can fully interoperate and therefore compete on merits. This is enormously significant for consumers and for the industry." -- Lee Patch, vice president, legal affairs, Sun Microsystems Inc., a complainant in the EU case.
----

"This decision serves notice to  Microsoft of the presumptive illegality of similar activities and that the Commission will now turn its attention to other issues, such as (the pending complaint against Windows XP). If these cases demonstrate flagrant lawbreaking, they will justify far greater  fines, broader conduct

remedies and perhaps even structural remedies." -- Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which filed the XP complaint last year.
----

"Much of the EU's decision announced today reflects our recommendation upon the Justice Department's settlement two years ago. ... But we are also concerned that in an era of global business  competition, the U.S. and the EU must work harder to harmonize their  antitrust laws. A predictable playing field is imperative for American businesses that compete in the global marketplace." -- U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, Democrat, ranking member of Senate  antitrust subcommittee.

MICHELE NORRIS, host:

Microsoft has 90 days to begin offering in Europe a version of Windows that does not contain the company's media player software. The deadline is part of a ruling from the European Union today that fined Microsoft more than $600 million for abusing its dominance in the computer software market. NPR's Nick Spicer was in Brussels for the ruling.

TD
NICK SPICER reporting:

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has a reputation for toughness. When he goes hard after a firm he suspects of skewing competition in Europe's single market, insiders say he gives them `the full Monti.' And that's what was in store for Microsoft today, the biggest-ever  fine for practicing what lawyers call a near monopoly, and a 90-day deadline for  Microsoft to start offering its Windows operating system both with and without the Windows Media Player, which plays online video and music. Monti said in a news conference that the commission was ensuring that anyone who developed new software had a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace.

Mr. MARIO MONTI (Competition Commissioner, European Union): We are saying that consumers and PC hardware manufacturers ought to be able to decide which media player software they want to preinstall in their computers. They ought to choose; not  Microsoft.

SPICER: Another part of the decision gives  Microsoft 120 days to share the information rivals need to create server software, the kind that lets workers share an office printer, for example. In fact, this case ends a five-year investigation started after a complaint by  Microsoft's competitor in that market, Sun Microsystems. The record  fine and extra punitive measures come after talks last week that had many expecting a last-minute deal. Horatio Guttierez is the chief legal counsel for  Microsoft in Europe.

Mr. HORATIO GUTTIEREZ (Chief European Legal Counsel,  Microsoft): We're clearly disappointed. We worked very hard in order to reach an agreement with the commission that would address their concerns, while at the same time allowing us to continue to innovate and improve our product for the benefit of consumers.

SPICER: Guttierez said  Microsoft even offered to give computer manufacturers versions of Windows with three different media players,  Microsoft's and those of two different competitors. Now the software giant is planning to appeal the decision before the European Union court and ask for a suspension of the measures decided.

But if past verdicts are anything to go by, Microsoft will have to pay and do what Brussels wants, as the appeal drags on for years. Thomas Vinie is a competition lawyer in Brussels who represents an American computer trade association suing Microsoft in Europe. He said the decision was a legal landmark.

Mr. THOMAS VINIE (Lawyer): This decision should lay the basis for the commission to act more quickly, we hope, in our case. It will lay out a legal framework for addressing our case. That doesn't mean we won't have to prove our case; we still have to prove our case. But we're extremely happy to have this decision as a precedent and a framework for the consideration of our complaint.

SPICER: Observers say the big change is that the European Union has effectively banned, at least in Europe, a critical part of  Microsoft's business strategy: the bundling in of new features onto the operating system. That issue was at the heart of the American  antitrust case concerning Netscape and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Nick Spicer, NPR News.

HD         EU Commission Confirms Microsoft Windows  Monopoly Fine E497Mn. WC        348 words
PD         24 March 2004

LP
BRUSSELS (MktNews) - The  European Commission confirmed Wednesday it has agreed a record
fine of E497 million in the five-year-old anti-trust case against U.S. software giant  Microsoft.

EU regulators found that  Microsoft had abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

TD
The EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, will meet the press at 12:15 CET to discuss the  fine.

The fine tops the EU's previous record of E462 million imposed on pharmaceutical group Roche after a scandal involving price fixing in the vitamin pill market.
Monti earlier this week won the backing of EU member states for the  fine.

The Commission asked the company to detach its multimedia program Media Player from Windows to ensure fair competition for rival products.

The unprecedented size of the financial penalty might not hurt  Microsoft, which has cash reserves of some $53 billion. But enforced changes in Europe to its Windows operating system, which powers nine out of 10 personal computers, will be hard to swallow.

The Redmond, Washington-based company, denying that it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors, has already vowed to appeal the verdict at the European Court of Justice.
After largely settling its anti-trust problems at home through a hotly disputed deal with the US Justice
Department,  Microsoft sees no reason why it should undergo a drastic product overhaul in Europe.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, reportedly argued that the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should be under the Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.

Microsoft, he pointed out, does only about 30% of its business in Europe.
"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's
U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said.

HD     Analysis: European regulators impose fines on Microsoft

BOB EDWARDS, host:

European regulators today imposed a record $613 million  fine on Microsoft, branding the corporation an abusive monopoly. They also announced a series of measures they want Microsoft to take in the interest of consumers and competition. This includes making available a version of Windows without the Microsoft Media Player which provides users access to movies and music. The company denies it's abusing its dominant position in the market, and has said it will appeal. NPR's Nick Spicer is in Brussels.

TD
What more do you know about this decision?
NICK SPICER reporting:

Well, I just attended a news conference in which the European commissioner responsible for  competition said Microsoft was engaged in illegal behavior that was still ongoing. We already knew the amount of the fine that he was going to impose and, I mean, we had an idea of the punitive measures because they'd already been leaked. So today's news kind of came as a confirmation, a $613 million  fine, the biggest
ever in European Union history. More interestingly, the Commission has given the company 90 days to offer a version of Windows to PC manufacturers without its digital media player called the Windows Media Player, and it has given  Microsoft 120 days to release complete and accurate programming code to
rivals in the market for computer servers used in the workplace like the ones that run printers. The decision says the products of rival companies must have full interoperability with desktop computers running Windows and, in making all this public, the European  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said, and I quote, "Dominant companies like Microsoft have a special responsibility to ensure the way they do business doesn't prevent competition and does not harm European consumers."
EDWARDS: Why couldn't the  European Commission and Microsoft come to an agreement?

SPICER: Well, they nearly did last week, in fact. Commissioner Monti had a three-way phone call with Bill Gates and the  Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer. Ballmer flew here to Brussels last week, and most observers expected a deal to be struck. They were working on two big problems. One, as you were mentioning, was the Windows Media Player, which allows you to watch video and listen to music. That is built into the Windows operating system. Brussels wanted that to be unbundled, saying it kills
competition for makers of rival media players, such as Apple and RealNetworks.

The other problem they were studying was  Microsoft's dominant position in server software and its reluctance to share code with rivals such as the American Sun Microsystems, which actually brought this case in the first place. They made some progress in these talks, but they stumbled on Brussels' insistence that a deal be struck that would regulate  Microsoft's behavior in the future. Mario Monti said today he wanted to set a precedent, one that would guide future  antitrust cases against Microsoft.
EDWARDS: When does  Microsoft have to pay the $613 million?

SPICER: Well, it could be quite soon.  Microsoft has just over two months to file an appeal which it has already promised to do. It's expected to ask a European court to suspend the order during the appeal process but that's not what usually happens. Usually you have to pay. So the money's not really the big problem. That said,  Microsoft has cash reserves of over $50 billion. So the 600-odd million are not much. Analysts are saying what will really hurt is the accompanying punitive measures because these aim at the

heart of Microsoft's business strategy, of regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades.

EDWARDS: How does this ruling affect future possible lawsuits against  Microsoft, including those here in the United States?

SPICER: Well, that's perhaps the most damaging aspect of all. In  Microsoft's eyes, it fears exactly what the Commission wants, a precedent being set, a legal precedent that could be used again in courtrooms here and also add impetus to lawsuits being planned in the United States. And, in fact, the  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said he was working closely with US  antitrust officials on cases like this one.

FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, CNN MONEY MORNING: A busy morning in Midtown Manhattan. You`re taking a look right up north on 8th Avenue. It`s also a bright, sunny day as well. It`s getting warmer in the past few days.
Good morning. Seeing signs of spring. It`s Wednesday, March 24th. I`m Fred Katayama, in this week for
Kathleen Hays, and you`re watching CNN MONEY MORNING.

TD
Well, first, the headlines. The February number for durable goods has just come out. The goods meant to last at least three years or longer, durable goods in February rose 2.5 percent. That is much higher than the 1.5 percent rise that economists had been expecting and a reversal from the drop that we saw in January.

Now for a look at some of today`s top headlines. As expected, the European Union has found  Microsoft guilty of abusing the dominance of its Windows PC operating system and issued a  fine of about $613 million. It also found  Microsoft in violation of EU anti-trust law.
The software giant has two months to review the lengthy decision and says it will appeal. The European   
commission issued the unanimous decision after a five-year investigation.

In Washington today, more high-level officials from the Bush and Clinton administrations will be asked why more was not done to prevent the September 11th terrorist attacks. George Tenet, CIA chief under both administrations, will testify first before the 9/11 Commission.

He`ll be followed by President Clinton`s national security adviser, Samuel Berger, and then former counter terrorism chief Richard Clarke. In his new book, he accuses the Bush administration of ignoring the threat posed by al Qaeda until the day of the attacks.
And, finally, world leaders are gathering today in Madrid for a memorial service for the victims of the March
11th terrorist bombings. Spain`s royal family, headed by King Juan Carlos, will lead mourners at the state
funeral beginning with a midday mass. The terrorist bombings were the worst against the Western country
since the September 11th attacks in the United States.
Well, durable goods orders for February came in up 2.5 percent. Is economic growth possibly speeding
up? For more on today`s report we`re joined by Christian Weller. He`s a senior economist at the Center for
American Progress in Washington, D.C.
Good morning, Christian.

CHRISTIAN WELLER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Good morning, Fred. Thank you for having me.

KATAYAMA: Well, Christian, this durable goods orders in February rises 2.5 percent after that big drop we saw in January. Was this rise a surprise for you?

WELLER: It was definitely a surprise. Its certainly a welcome surprise. Durable goods orders are a good indicator of the direction that investment is taking. Not only do we need stronger investment at this point, but we also need broader investment. And the February numbers there are very positive.


Page 15 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Capacity utilization is up in all its sectors. So is industrial capacity. So I think we see a broadening and a deepening of an investment, which is certainly welcome because investment, at this point, is and has to be the primary engine for growth.

There are certainly some shadows here. This is the first month where it seem to be strengthening and we have to watch this carefully. Hopefully this will continue but it`s certainly welcome news.

KATAYAMA: And, Christian, I wasn`t able to take a look at the core durable goods rate. I assume you`ve already looked at it. Once you strip out the transportation orders, do you know how that came in?
WELLER: No, I`m sorry, I haven`t seen the numbers myself.

KATAYAMA: All right. Let`s skip that one for now, then. In terms of the economic recovery, what does this stronger than expected number portend for? And, of course, this has reflections for capital spending, as well.

WELLER: That is correct. I mean, at this point, you`ve got to remember investment is certainly the one sector, a, that has declined a lot during the recession, has a lot of catching up to do, but it`s also the sector that can carry the economy forward. The consumers are maxed out on credit, the government cannot really increase more spending.

And on the trade side, we still have a huge record trade deficit. So really investment is the one thing that can propel growth forward, meaning is it the one pillar that`s holding up growth but which most economies expect to come in around 3.5 to 4 percent for the year.

KATAYAMA: And, Christian, while you were just answering my question, I took a look and once you strip out transportation, durable goods orders fell 0.3 percent. Now I know that Wall Street or economists were looking for a rise of 1 percent there. We did see that huge transportation drop in transportation orders in January, especially on the aircraft sector and cars. And it looks like it didn`t gain as much as we might expect.

WELLER: Well, again, these are monthly numbers. They`re very volatile. But, again, I think overall, this indicates that we have a broadening sector. We`re seeing increases outside of the IT sector, which has been largely the sector where we saw most of the investment goods increases.

KATAYAMA: And as for the IT sector, what is your view on that? I know IT spending has been a focus of Wall Street. It had been weak in the past. We see tech stocks still in a slump. Do you see that turning around?

WELLER: I think IT spending has seen a boost in 2003, largely because a lot of replacement investments were taking place. It was the first part prior to the recession, the first part of investment that started declining. Clearly we expected it to be the first part turning around. But I think so far most of what we saw in IT has been replacement investment and I don`t expect it to turn around until everything else turns around, meaning we see a broadening of investment and we see a broadening and strengthening of growth.

KATAYAMA: And manufacturing. So far we`ve seen positive signs from the manufacturing sector, in terms of the numbers coming out from Washington. This durable goods number, the rise of 2.5 percent in February, is this consistent with the numbers that have been coming out on the manufacturing sector?

WELLER: Well, clearly we have seen a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, at least on the output side, for several months. But, however, what we need to see at this point is an increase in hiring in the manufacturing sector. Most of the job loss recovery that we`ve seen, most of the job losses we`ve seen for the past few years, were concentrated in the manufacturing sector.

So what we`re really watching for, at this point, is a turnaround in hiring. We have so far seen 43 consecutive months of job losses in manufacturing and that has to end and turnaround to really get the labor market going, to strengthen the labor market. Once the labor market is picking up steam, then consumption will also pick up and then growth will also broaden.
KATAYAMA: All right. Christian Weller, thanks for joining us with those views on the durable goods report. WELLER: Thank you ver much.
KATAYAMA: Thank you.
The European Union slaps Microsoft with a record fine of more than $600 million and says it broke
anti-trust law. Let`s get the latest on Microsoft and the European markets from Todd Benjamin in London.

Page 16 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Good morning, Todd.
TODD BENJAMIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Fred.

This decision is about as surprising as a day following night because this has been signaled now for days, including the amount, which you said was about $612 million.  Microsoft says they will appeal the decision. They fear the legal implications, in terms of restricting their future ability for their Windows operating system as they add new features.

In terms of the European Union`s position, Mario Monti, the EU  competition commission said, "today`s decision restores conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principle for the future conduct of the company with such a strong dominant position."

Now they got on  Microsoft`s case heavily for two different reasons. The first reason was that they said that the company deliberately restricted the ability of non-Microsoft software powering larger computers to
work with Windows. And they also, of course, the bundling of their media player. They didn`t like that. They said with its ubiquitous operating system was unfair to competitors and stifles innovation in the industry and "harming the competitive process and consumers who ultimately end up with less choice and higher
prices."

As I said,  Microsoft plans to appeal this decision. So it could be quite a lengthy process. The amount of the fine is equal to about 2 percent of their cash - or two weeks work of cash flow, one week worth of sales. So they can certainly weather this financially. But legally, it is a big headache.

The other big story today actually, Fred, is in the currency markets. The euro is off sharply from where we were trading in New York. Of course, this week the euro had strengthened on security concerns.

We`re trading above 1.23 in New York yesterday. Now we`re below 1.23, around 1.2183. And this follows comments of the head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet. This was in an interview with "Hodislot (ph)." This is a leading German business newspaper. "The Wall Street Journal" of Germany, so to speak.

And basically what he said was, should our expectations for stronger private household consumption and domestic demand not be fulfilled, we would change our forecast accordingly. And in talk that you and I can understand, basically if consumer spending doesn`t pick up, then they would have to re-evaluate their position because they say currently that interest rates are at the right level, that they`re not standing in the way of stronger growth.

But there`s been growing speculation because the data`s been quite soft, that they will have to cut rates again. Maybe not at their April 1st meeting. Barclays Capital puts about a 35 percent probably it will happen there. But several economists say there`s a possibility the odds are increasing, they may have to move at their June meeting.

In terms of the stock market action today, jitters, security jitters once again hurting these markets. There was apparently a truck parked in Midtown Manhattan, I`m sure you reported on it, that they thought was a security concern. There was a suspicious truck parked there illegally. Turned out to be no threat but, nevertheless, it rattled these markets.

And right now the FTSE`s down about 0.2 percent. The DAX is off just slightly 0.33 percent. The CAC is off the most in Paris, off better than 0.5 percent.
That`s how it looks from here. Fred, back to you. KATAYAMA: Thanks, Todd. Todd Benjamin in London.
And on to currencies, what can a dollar get you? Not much if you`re visiting Europe where Todd is. But it`s a bargain for Europeans traveling to the U.S. JJ Ramberg reports.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JJ RAMBERG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Claire Newman is on a shopping spree. CLAIRE NEWMAN, TOURIST: Since I`ve been here I`ve bought trainers, I`ve bought jeans, trousers,
jewelry, shoes, casual tops, more stuff.

RAMBERG: Visiting New York from England for a couple of weeks, she`s taking full advantage of the dollar`s plunge.


Page 17 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
PHILIP AMANDOLA, MANAGER, KENNETH COLE: They`re always amazed at what they can get here for the price versus being at home in the UK.

RAMBERG: With the dollar recently hitting a record low against the euro and an 11-year low against the British pound, Americans traveling overseas are experiencing some serious sticker shock. But for Europeans hopping the pond, Fifth Avenue is starting to look a lot like bargain boulevard. And for many, that`s a good incentive to visit the U.S.

CATHY KEEFE, TRAVEL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA: The fact that they`re getting a lot more bang for their buck means that they can stay in maybe a nicer hotel than they had planned. And for a lot of travelers, you can spend more money shopping.

RAMBERG: International tourism to the United States had been falling since 2000. But the Travel Industry Associations expects a turnaround this year, one they predict will translate into a $4 billion increase in spending.

KEEFE: International travelers spend three times as much money as the average U.S. traveler and they stay three time as long. And it`s a very lucrative and important market for the U.S.
RAMBERG: A market Claire Newman is contributing to purchase by purchase. JJ Ramberg, CNN financial news, New York.

KATAYAMA: It`s time for the morning buzz on Wall Street. Susan Lisovicz is at the New York Stock Exchange where the Dow fell for the fourth straight session yesterday. Susie, the durable goods report was strong but it didn`t seem to exactly turn around sentiment in the futures market, huh?

SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, CNN MONEY MORNING: No. And it`s interesting because the futures indicate we`re not going to have much of an open. And, of course, we didn`t have much of a close looking at the level. The Dow dropping just one point to close at 10063. Just one point off the session before.

Of course, during the day, a pretty choppy day, it started out with a rally but just couldn`t hold it. We are in correction mode. The Dow down 3.7 percent year-to-date. Down 6 percent, 6.3 percent, from its high reached on February 11th.

What else are we watching today? Well, we have earnings from Micron Technology. We`re expecting them, a loss of seven cents is the estimate for the second quarter. That`s versus a loss of 83 cents the year earlier.

We have some positive news from VF Corporation Lifting its financial outlook for the first quarter to reflect stronger than expected sales of its products at retail and most of its business.

What does VF do? Well, VF is actually the name behind jeans, Lee, Wrangler, Chic, Rustler, Gitano, you name it. It`s the number one maker of jeans in the United States. It`s also the parent company of "Vanity Fair", JanSport (ph), The North Face. So it`s got a lot of different retail brands out there. "First Call" estimate, 84 cents per share on revenue of $1.3 billion in the quarter. It will release its results on April 27th.

And, Fred, I`d love to be able to chat with you but I seem to have lost my connection with you. So I`ll be chatting with you later. Back to you.
KATAYAMA: All right. I`ll take a rain check on that. Susan Lisovicz at the NYSE.

Now let`s go over across town to the Nasdaq market site in Times Square. Stacey Tisdale is standing by there, watching all the pre-market action.
Stacey, I`ll bet you the buzz is about  Microsoft.

STACEY TISDALE, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, CNN MONEY MORNING: It certainly is, Fred. And actually two of  Microsoft`s major rivals, as you might imagine, are applauding the European Union`s decision to slap the company with the a more than $600 million  fine.



Page 18 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Let`s start with Sun Microsystems. Sun shares up slightly today in pre-market. Sun saying the commission`s decision seeks to create a level playing field in the work group server marketplace. Now Sun actually started this proceeding in 1998.

And the complaint was a lack of access to information about the desktop operating system. Now the ruling is significant to Sun going forward. See, it was expected to cover disclosure of Windows 2000. But Microsoft also must disclose information about successor products, which is why some analysts say this could help Sun in the future.
Another company, RealNetworks, really is getting a boost from this. That stock up 11.3 percent in
pre-market trading. Real Networks is a rival in the audio and video player market, as you might know. And
the company actually filed an anti-trust suit against  Microsoft in the United States last year on December
18th.

RealNetworks calls this ruling "fundamentally significant because the  European Commission has declared that  Microsoft`s media player bundling strategy is illegal."

I spoke to Art Hogan this morning, he`s a chief investment strategist at Jefferies & Company, and he said that there`s a possible positive for Linux players like Red Hat because this changes the overall environment in this market.

But Red Hat is in the headlines today because of its earnings. That stock up more than 11 percent, yes, we have Red Had up 11.5 percent right now. And, I`m sorry, Real Networks is up 3.6 percent. But Red Hat is
in the news because, as I said, the net income in the fourth quarter, which ended on February 29th, was 5 million or 3 cents a share. It was break even last year. Revenues rose about 43 percent to 37 million from
29.5 million.

Now these results are largely in line with estimates. But the current quarter sales forecast that Red Hat gave was between 42.5 and 43.5 million. That`s much stronger than expectations which seem to range in about 40.5 million level.

So those are some of the stocks that are getting some attention in the pre- market. Now let`s go back over to Fred.

KATAYAMA: Stacey, it was good news, I guess, for  Microsoft`s rivals. As for  Microsoft itself, when I last saw it in the pre-market it seemed to be trading higher. Was it all because this had all been baked into the stock price given the news reports the past few days of the expected  fine?

TISDALE: I spoke to an analyst about this. And, you`re right, actually right now  Microsoft is up about half a percent. He said $600 million to  Microsoft is like $5 to Stacey Tisdale. It`s just not a lot of money. They could have been fined as much as $3 billion, if you look at global revenues. So it`s just not that much money to this company. As you mentioned, it was widely expected. But it`s going to be interesting to see how this all plays out in the appeals process.
KATAYAMA: Stacey, if misery loves company, it`s $5 for me, too. Anyway, Stacey Tisdale at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Thank you. (PROMOTIONAL INFO)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KATAYAMA: Will today`s durable goods report affect trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange? Let`s find out from Yra Harris, a partner at Cadent Financial.
Good morning, Yra.
YRA HARRIS, PARTNER, CADENT FINANCIAL: Good morning, Fred. How are you? KATAYAMA:  Fine, thank you.
Yra, the orders for durable goods in February rose 2.5 percent and that was much stronger than expected. And yet futures have turned south following that report. Why the negative reaction?

HARRIS: Well, Fred, I think you`ve seen from all the economic numbers outside of that non-farm payroll number, which is what the market is really going to hang its hat on because it needs to see significant jobs growth. So we`re seeing good economic numbers over the last six months. But their impact has been negligible.

Page 19 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The stock market is, of course, traded more off of earnings, as it should. The interest rates have been on hold there for so long. Therefore, I think we have to look other places. And I think you see it out of Europe this morning. Because if you look at the European interest rates, the short rates, they`re up quite a bit off a statement by the European Central Bank head Trichet and it look like he`s softening the market up for a potential cut coming observe the next month.

As a matter of fact, if you look at the probability base into those (INAUDIBLE) that you`re seeing about a 60 percent chance of some cut in this next time period, whether it`s next week or the following month. And I think that`s what the market is much more going to be interested in.

KATAYAMA: So, Yra, in the absence of big economic news, you say you`re still waiting for the jobs number next week. It looks so far that you`re taking your cues from Europe. What domestic catalysts are there today? I mean we`ve got those congressional hearings going on in Washington on the 9/11 terrorist impact. What impact will that have today?

HARRIS: Well, Fred, those won`t have any impact because that`s a classic he said, she said. And I think if you look to the ex-Defense Department head Cohen, he was probably the most rational and said that everybody who`s ever been in government has to take a look at themselves and what their responsibility and culpability was. So that basically takes that off the table because I think that was a very solid comment. I think the markets viewed it as that.

So we`re looking at other dynamics. And I think that is, right now, it`s the (ph) world as much Europe been European has been the linchpin that the Fed, a lot of people believe, and I, myself, included, that the Fed and the Treasury have been trying to push the Europeans to reflate. That they`ve been the missing link in the global recovery. And any action from the European Central Bank that would move towards ease would be viewed as a positive. And I think that would be more important to get the stock markets to rally.

KATAYAMA: Yra, stocks fell for the fourth straight day yesterday. I was looking at the S&P 500 and it`s trading below it`s 20 and 50-day moving average. Over in the trading pits where you are, what are the key levels that you`ll be looking at for the S&P?

HARRIS: Well, I think we`ve traded to them. And, more importantly, I think, as some people have aptly reported, the Nasdaq 100 Index is under the 200-day, which we haven`t seen in quite a while and that`s a significant step. As is for myself, GE being under the 200-day moving average gives the overall picture is weak.

And I think that weakness stems from - I think we`re starting to see it slow down here a little bit. But as the Kerry campaign gathers momentum, it was a campaign in which he defeated his Democratic rivals based on a protectionist philosophy. And the market didn`t like that smell of protectionism and it has gone into a very cautious stance here waiting to see how this plays out. Because this market was priced too perfectly and it cannot sustain any real whiff of protectionism.
KATAYAMA: All right, Yra, got to go. Thanks a lot. HARRIS: Thanks, Fred.
KATAYAMA: Yra Harris in Chicago. HARRIS: Thanks, Fred. KATAYAMA: Thank you.
Health insurance is a hot topic, especially this election year. Today we take a look at the overcharging of the uninsured. Peter Viles reports.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, (voice over): Ed and Dianna Jellison are still paying the price for a trip to the hospital two years ago. Suffering from encephalitis, a viral infection, Ed was hospitalized 17 days.

DIANNA JELLISON, UNINSURED PATIENT: My whole word had been turned completely upside down. We had lost our business. My husband wasn`t going to be the same again. Everything had changed.

VILES: They paid $30,000 in doctors` bills but then another bill came from Florida Hospital. $116,000. The Jellison`s had no health insurance. If they did, the insurance company would have been charged a fraction of that amount.
JELLISON: It makes me very mad. Very mad.
Page 20 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
VILES: But that`s the way hospital billing works. List prices are wildly inflated but insurance companies don`t pay those high prices, only the uninsured do.

K.B. FORBES, WWW.CONSEJOHELP.ORG: It is outrageous that they price gouge a working-class, middle-class family here in the United States. It`s all about greed. All they wanted to do was suck out the hard earned assets of this family.
VILES: These are cases K.B. Forbes has analyzed. An appendectomy. The bill to Medicare would be
$10,000. To an insurance company $12,000. But if you are uninsured $29,000. A broken leg costs
Medicare $4,800, costs an insurance company $5,400, cost if you have no insurance $15,000. Still the
hospital industry says it loses money treating the uninsured.

CARMELA COYLE, AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION: We have 44 million Americans who have no health insurance coverage at all. And while they come to America`s hospital emergency departments and are able to receive care, there is no payment that`s ultimately received for many of those patients.

VILES: The Bush administration`s point man on this, Tommy Thompson, is urging hospitals to offer discounts to the uninsured and some hospitals are doing so.

HD      Microsoft slams EU for preparing massive penalty:  $615-million (U.S.) fine expected today.
Software firm says reported  amount appears to be double what it should  have been

BRUSSELS

In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union yesterday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615 million U.S. for alleged anti-trust abuses.

TD
With the EU decision on the software giant due today, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the  European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently," said  Microsoft spokesperson Tom Brookes.

Commission spokesperson Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Monti would address questions today at a news conference after the  European Commission adopts the ruling.

Sources familiar with the five-year-old case, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the EU ruling finds Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behaviour in the U.S. anti-trust case, but settled with the Bush administration in late 2001.
A U.S. appeals court is currently considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore
competition.

Page 22 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.

Microsoft was fined a record €497m by the European Commission today – a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft’s sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm’s Media Player program.

TD
The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by "bundling" its own software and other services with its Windows system.

That made it difficult for other software makers to compete – particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy.
The strategy worked well – more than 90% of personal computers worldwide run on  Microsoft
software.
Today’s ruling in Brussels followed a four-year investigation led by  Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti, who said: "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the
future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position."

But the real battle has only just begun.  Microsoft is appealing against the  fine to the European Court of Justice and a final verdict could take five years.

Meanwhile, Microsoft will be seeking suspension of the Commission’s order to start selling within 90 days a version of Windows without Media Player and to make available within 120 days the information other companies need to produce compatible rival server products.

Mr Gates is furious that the EU is interfering at all when  Microsoft is already subject to anti-trust laws in America.

But Mr Monti said the company’s commercial methods affect millions of European customers and must comply with European Union laws.

The Commission, he argued, has a duty to offer monopoly protection to  Microsoft’s commercial rivals – and its retail customers – in Europe.

With a healthy bank balance estimated at nearly €60.1bn,  Microsoft will not be troubled by the size of the fine, even if it is the biggest ever sought by the Commission against any company.

But the knock-on effect of changing the way  Microsoft markets its products in Europe could be huge.

Mr Gates is now determined to challenge the Commission’s contention that the company which made him the world’s richest man is an "abusive monopolist" which has manipulated the market at the expense of others.

Microsoft has 90 days to begin offering in Europe a version of Windows that does not contain the company's media player software. The deadline is part of a ruling from the European Union today that fined Microsoft more than $600 million for abusing its dominance in the computer software market. NPR's Nick Spicer was in Brussels for the ruling.

TD
NICK SPICER reporting:

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, has a reputation for toughness. When he goes hard after a firm he suspects of skewing competition in Europe's single market, insiders say he gives them `the full Monti.' And that's what was in store for Microsoft today, the biggest-ever  fine for practicing what lawyers call a near monopoly, and a 90-day deadline for  Microsoft to start offering its Windows operating system both with and without the Windows Media Player, which plays online video and music. Monti said in a news conference that the commission was ensuring that anyone who developed new software had a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace.

Mr. MARIO MONTI (Competition Commissioner, European Union): We are saying that consumers and PC hardware manufacturers ought to be able to decide which media player software they want to preinstall in their computers. They ought to choose; not  Microsoft.

SPICER: Another part of the decision gives  Microsoft 120 days to share the information rivals need to create server software, the kind that lets workers share an office printer, for example. In fact, this case ends a five-year investigation started after a complaint by  Microsoft's competitor in that market, Sun Microsystems. The record  fine and extra punitive measures come after talks last week that had many expecting a last-minute deal. Horatio Guttierez is the chief legal counsel for  Microsoft in Europe.

Mr. HORATIO GUTTIEREZ (Chief European Legal Counsel,  Microsoft): We're clearly disappointed. We worked very hard in order to reach an agreement with the commission that would address their concerns, while at the same time allowing us to continue to innovate and improve our product for the benefit of consumers.

SPICER: Guttierez said  Microsoft even offered to give computer manufacturers versions of Windows with three different media players,  Microsoft's and those of two different competitors. Now the software giant is planning to appeal the decision before the European Union court and ask for a suspension of the measures decided.

But if past verdicts are anything to go by, Microsoft will have to pay and do what Brussels wants, as the appeal drags on for years. Thomas Vinje is a competition lawyer in Brussels who represents an American computer trade association suing Microsoft in Europe. He said the decision was a legal landmark.

Mr. THOMAS VINJE (Lawyer): This decision should lay the basis for the commission to act more quickly, we hope, in our case. It will lay out a legal framework for addressing our case. That doesn't mean we


Page 27 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
won't have to prove our case; we still have to prove our case. But we're extremely happy to have this decision as a precedent and a framework for the consideration of our complaint.

SPICER: Observers say the big change is that the European Union has effectively banned, at least in Europe, a critical part of  Microsoft's business strategy: the bundling in of new features onto the operating system. That issue was at the heart of the American  antitrust case concerning Netscape and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Nick Spicer, NPR News.

BOB EDWARDS, host:

European regulators today imposed a record $613 million  fine on Microsoft, branding the corporation an abusive monopoly. They also announced a series of measures they want Microsoft to take in the interest of consumers and competition. This includes making available a version of Windows without the Microsoft Media Player which provides users access to movies and music. The company denies it's abusing its dominant position in the market, and has said it will appeal. NPR's Nick Spicer is in Brussels.

TD
What more do you know about this decision?
NICK SPICER reporting:

Well, I just attended a news conference in which the European commissioner responsible for  competition said Microsoft was engaged in illegal behavior that was still ongoing. We already knew the amount of the fine that he was going to impose and, I mean, we had an idea of the punitive measures because they'd already been leaked. So today's news kind of came as a confirmation, a $613 million  fine, the biggest
ever in European Union history. More interestingly, the Commission has given the company 90 days to offer a version of Windows to PC manufacturers without its digital media player called the Windows Media Player, and it has given  Microsoft 120 days to release complete and accurate programming code to
rivals in the market for computer servers used in the workplace like the ones that run printers. The decision says the products of rival companies must have full interoperability with desktop computers running Windows and, in making all this public, the European  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said, and I quote, "Dominant companies like Microsoft have a special responsibility to ensure the way they do business doesn't prevent competition and does not harm European consumers."
EDWARDS: Why couldn't the  European Commission and Microsoft come to an agreement?

SPICER: Well, they nearly did last week, in fact. Commissioner Monti had a three-way phone call with Bill Gates and the  Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer. Ballmer flew here to Brussels last week, and most observers expected a deal to be struck. They were working on two big problems. One, as you were mentioning, was the Windows Media Player, which allows you to watch video and listen to music. That is built into the Windows operating system. Brussels wanted that to be unbundled, saying it kills
competition for makers of rival media players, such as Apple and RealNetworks.

The other problem they were studying was  Microsoft's dominant position in server software and its reluctance to share code with rivals such as the American Sun Microsystems, which actually brought this case in the first place. They made some progress in these talks, but they stumbled on Brussels' insistence that a deal be struck that would regulate  Microsoft's behavior in the future. Mario Monti said today he wanted to set a precedent, one that would guide future  antitrust cases against Microsoft.
EDWARDS: When does  Microsoft have to pay the $613 million?

SPICER: Well, it could be quite soon.  Microsoft has just over two months to file an appeal which it has already promised to do. It's expected to ask a European court to suspend the order during the appeal process but that's not what usually happens. Usually you have to pay. So the money's not really the big

Page 29 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
problem. That said,  Microsoft has cash reserves of over $50 billion. So the 600-odd million are not much. Analysts are saying what will really hurt is the accompanying punitive measures because these aim at the heart of Microsoft's business strategy, of regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell
upgrades.

EDWARDS: How does this ruling affect future possible lawsuits against  Microsoft, including those here in the United States?

SPICER: Well, that's perhaps the most damaging aspect of all. In  Microsoft's eyes, it fears exactly what the Commission wants, a precedent being set, a legal precedent that could be used again in courtrooms here and also add impetus to lawsuits being planned in the United States. And, in fact, the  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said he was working closely with US  antitrust officials on cases like this one.

Reuters reported that  Microsoft Corp. was slapped with a record  fine for violating European Union antitrust law and ordered to take immediate steps to stop crushing software rivals. The EU executive said Microsoft must act within four months to change the way it does business in Europe "because the illegal behavior is still going on." The  European Commission levied a record EUR497.2 million ($611.8 million) fine, ordered the unbundling of Windows Media Player within 90 days and required that "complete and accurate" information be given to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days. The Commission characterized Windows as a "near monopoly."

PARIS -- PROVING that  Microsoft has a monopoly is not hard, and now regulators on two continents have agreed that it abuses that monopoly. But figuring out what to do about it is proving to be a daunting task for Europe, as it was for the United States after  Microsoft lost its antitrust trial there.

In the end, the risk to  Microsoft may not be that it will be forced to pay fines as large as the 497 million euros, or $613 million, being sought by the European Commission, or even to distribute a competitor's program, as it was reported to have agreed to do in ultimately unsuccessful settlement talks with the commission. Instead, the risk is that  Microsoft is becoming the functional equivalent of an old-style utility, with extensive government regulation that could even extend into determining what products it sells and at what prices.

TD
There are worse fates than running a regulated monopoly. But such stocks are not the type that appeal to traditional technology investors, and the prospect of such an outcome may be one thing that has been weighing on Microsoft's share price, which has underperformed the market badly over the last
18 months.

For antitrust regulators, the heart of the problem is the changing nature of the personal computer market. Consumers do want new features, as  Microsoft says, and they do want them bundled in. Any nonexpert who has ever tried to download and install a program would much rather have it done by someone else.

But Microsoft's pattern has been to wait for others to pioneer a computer application and then to put out its own program. If that program is eventually bundled as part of the operating system in all new Windows computers, the first arrival screams foul, but in the end  Microsoft wins.

Netscape pioneered Internet browsers but was left in the dust. RealNetworks, which led the way in music software, could face a similar fate. It is not easy to make money off a product that consumers must install themselves when the consumers already own  Microsoft's version, which comes already installed.

In the United States, a federal judge ruled in 2000 that  Microsoft had violated antitrust law and ordered it split in two, separating the operating system from the rest of the company. But that ruling was partly overturned on appeal, and the company later settled with the Justice Department on terms that left it free to pursue expansion of the operating system.

In an ideal world, decisions on which features to use would be made at an industry level, like the manufacturer level, where there is  competition. Just as General Motors, Ford and other automakers deal with many of the same suppliers for everything from seats to transmissions, and choose which to put on any given model, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers could decide among competing offerings from  Microsoft and other companies.

Page 32 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The manufacturers would be competing, presumably, on the basis of functionality and price. The consumer would be able to buy machines with everything already loaded, but different vendors would decide just what combination they wanted to offer and would do the work of integrating the programs.

But the fact is, that does not happen. To make that work,  Microsoft would have to sell different versions of Windows, some with features bundled in and others without them. And their prices would have to be set at levels that made fair  competition possible.

There is no clear way to accomplish that, short of government regulation, utility-style. Mario Monti, the European Union's chief  antitrust regulator, sought a deal that would give regulators a say in what was added to the operating system in the future, but  Microsoft was unwilling to give in. It is possible that when the commission issues its final decision on Wednesday it will order such changes in addition to the fine, whose size was reported by people close to  Microsoft on Monday. The company has said it will appeal, a process that could take years.

In the United States, efforts to foster  competition in areas that were deemed natural monopolies have had a mixed record of success, at best. In the local telephone market, would-be competitors have had to use local phone company lines, at prices set by regulators. There is a parallel in the personal
computer industry, where those who seek to compete with systems that  Microsoft uses in its operating system must use the same operating system and can hope to be price-competitive only as a result of government intervention.

Microsoft has managed to fend off such moves in the past, and may do so again as the European case continues on appeal. But it will face renewals of such fights time and again, as innovations prompt protests from injured competitors. The net effect of serial investigations and  antitrust cases could be to make Microsoft act like a regulated utility, whatever its legal status is.

Such companies may be quite profitable and pay high dividends -- far better than the current Microsoft payout of less than 1 percent -- but they do not get priced as growth stocks.  Microsoft's sheer size makes exponential growth impossible anyway, but the notion of governments watching over every new Microsoft innovation, prepared to challenge it if it seems unfair to some competitor, is a daunting one.

Microsoft was down 35 cents, to $24.15, in trading in New York yesterday, leaving it up just 10 percent from where it was when the stock market hit bottom on Oct. 9, 2002. Over that same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 41 percent, and the Goldman Sachs software index has risen 81 percent.

Measuring from the bottom may seem unfair to  Microsoft, since it did not fall as far as many stocks did during the bear market and therefore had less ground to make up. But the fact is that over the last
year, Microsoft has traded in a range of $23.60 to $30, a low-to-high difference of only 27 percent, the smallest range in Microsoft's history. And over that year, while most stocks have risen,  Microsoft is down 9 percent.

Microsoft Corp. agreed with European  antitrust enforcers last week to ensure worldwide distribution of at least three rival digital media players on personal computers running the Windows operating system, a company executive said yesterday. But the agreement fell apart when the regulators insisted on additional terms.
Feverish negotiations over two weeks yielded a plan to settle charges that the company used the
power of its Windows monopoly to favor its media player over those made by rivals, the executive said.
But as the details were being worked out, a  Microsoft negotiating team at European Union
headquarters in Brussels that included chief executive Steven A. Ballmer was told that something had
to be done to restrict future bundling of other programs into Windows.

TD
Microsoft has opposed all attempts to force it to remove software programs from Windows, and the two sides announced Thursday that no settlement was possible.

The Microsoft executive described the talks after EU offices were closed last night, and European officials could not be reached for their version of events. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the case.

The EU is scheduled to announce today that  Microsoft broke European antitrust laws and will be fined an estimated $613 million. The EU order is expected to require that Microsoft create two versions of Windows -- one with its media player and one without it -- giving computer makers the choice of which to install on new machines.

Sources involved with the case also expect the order to require  Microsoft to reveal more of its software code for network servers to rivals so their software is compatible with Windows.  Microsoft has said it would appeal such an order.

Throughout the talks,  Microsoft argued that requiring rival media-playing software to be included on Windows machines was better for consumers than forcing the company to decouple the Windows Media Player, an action it claimed would damage the operating system. Initially, the company offered to include rival media software on compact discs packaged with new computers.  Microsoft also sought to ensure that no EU sanctions would apply outside of Europe.

Rivals, however, said  Microsoft could easily remove the Windows media player without harming Windows, and that doing so was the best way to level the playing field. EU regulators were inclined to agree, and wanted a worldwide solution.
A compromise took shape early last week after private talks that often began at 9 a.m. and lasted until
9 p.m.

According to the  Microsoft executive, an agreement was fashioned that would have required computer makers around the world who licensed Windows to install at least three rival media players on the hard drives of new machines.

The Microsoft executive said that outside of Europe, computer makers would be free to choose which player would be the default program. Rivals would be allowed to provide incentives to the computer makers to choose theirs but  Microsoft would be barred from doing so, the official said.

Within Europe, the  European Commission, the EU administrative arm, would have a role in choosing which media players were installed on the machines.
The deal came together early last week, and Ballmer flew to Brussels to help tie up loose ends. Ballmer and Microsoft General Counsel Bradford L. Smith met with EU  competition commissioner
Mario Monti and Philip Lowe, director general of  competition, for several hours over two days.

But a Microsoft executive said EU officials then began to talk about what would end up as the deal killer: a "bright line" rule that would address the ability of  Microsoft to bundle future software.
The EU has other cases under investigation on the bundling issue involving the newest version of
Windows, and Monti wanted an agreement to address those cases and set rules for the future.

After negotiations ended last Thursday, Monti said at a news conference that consumers "will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent" rather than a settlement that would eliminate legal liability for wrongdoing.
That notion was endorsed last night by RealNetworks Inc., which helped the EU build its case. RealNetworks General Counsel Robert R. Kimball said a settlement on just the media player issue
would not have given the industry guidance on what  Microsoft's conduct might be in response to
products and services not yet contemplated.

A finding of legal violation and an order directing future conduct "is extremely important . . . and will be good for the industry and for consumers," Kimball said.

In an interview, Smith, the  Microsoft counsel, described the talks as cordial and professional. He said the company was "not averse" to discussing a settlement that addressed bundling, but could not see how such an agreement would fit with its 2001  antitrust deal with the U.S. Justice Department.

In that case, a judge rejected requiring  Microsoft to separate other applications from its operating system.

"In the years that it will take to litigate [appeals], we could either ensure the distribution of a billion media players, or create 10,000 pages of legal documents," Smith said.

HD           Microsoft Critics Are Hopeful --- Rivals Want EU's Tough Stance to Be Adopted  World-Wide

Brussels -- CRITICS OF  Microsoft Corp. hope a European  antitrust decision against the company today will set a precedent not only for the European Union, but for other  antitrust authorities
world-wide.

The European Commission, the EU's top  antitrust authority, is expected to impose a record 497 million euro fine and tough sanctions on the Redmond, Washington-based software giant for abusing its market power in networking and multimedia software markets.

TD
Microsoft and a U.S. political champion already are condemning the expected action as a threat to American innovation, jobs and growth. "The EU's proposed actions against  Microsoft amount to a hostile act with severe consequences for the global economy," said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington. She called on the U.S. government to "engage the EU immediately" in search of a negotiated settlement.
But Microsoft competitors and others who feel U.S.  antitrust authorities let Microsoft off easy in a
2001 settlement hoped for the opposite: That an EU crackdown would inspire antitrust authorities in
the U.S., Japan and elsewhere to take another look at the company's activities.

"It's proof that what was done in the U.S. is too little," said Douglas A. McIntyre, chief executive of New York-based On2 Technologies Inc., a company that, like  Microsoft, sells technology for compressing video images so they can been sent cheaply over the Internet. Mr. McIntyre says On2 has submitted complaints about alleged predatory pricing by  Microsoft to antitrust authorities in Japan, Europe and the U.S.

"I'd be happy to see the [U.S.] Justice Department come back and rethink some things that have gone on over the past couple of years," Mr. McIntyre said, referring to recent  Microsoft inroads into new markets that weren't covered in the 2001 settlement. The U.S. settlement, related to  Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, exacted some concessions from the company but allowed it to continue to integrate the browser with its dominant Windows operating system.

A commission spokeswoman and a  Microsoft lawyer declined to comment on Mr. McIntyre's complaints.

Ed Black, chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, agrees the commission's tough stance could spur U.S. and other  antitrust authorities world-wide to take complaints about the software company's business practices more seriously. "One could make the case that there's real value in having  competition between competition authorities," said Mr. Black, whose group represents Nokia Corp., Time Warner Inc. and about 30 other companies, including On2.

Last year Mr. Black's group complained to the  European Commission about the growing impact of Microsoft Windows XP on related technology markets. The commission has been investigating that complaint even as it moved to conclude the current case.

After European antitrust authorities backed the planned EU  fine against Microsoft on Monday, Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft's chief lawyer for Europe, complained that a fine on the company's U.S. operations would be "unprecedented and inappropriate" when those operations have been permitted by American regulators and a U.S. court. He added that the  fine was about double what the company expected. But Europe's regulators say they need broad discretion to impose penalties in order to discourage offenses.

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -  Microsoft Corp. will seek legal review of the  European                  Commission's decision in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, according to Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of the company.

The US software giant stated on Wednesday in a press release that its proposals to settle the  European Commission investigation would have provided more choices for European consumers and more opportunity for software companies than the official decision announced Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, by the European Union.

TD
"We worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European Commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of  Microsoft.

"We respect the Commission's authority, but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers."

"While we think today's action is unfortunate, we will continue to cooperate and collaborate with European governments and the European industry to address shared concerns, such as interoperability, security, privacy, spam and keeping our children safe online," Ballmer said.
Throughout this process, he said the company had cooperated fully with the  European Commission
and demonstrated due respect for the process and its concerns.

He also said Microsoft will continue to invest in new technology breakthroughs and continue to work to bring innovations to partners and customers.

Earlier on Wednesday, the European Union announced it is imposing a record  fine of nearly 500 million euros (about 600 million US dollars) on  Microsoft.

The EU executive arm, the European Commission, concluded after a five-year investigation that Microsoft had broken EU competition law by abusing its near monopoly of the EU market and ordered the company to pay a  fine of 497 million euros (611 million US dollars).

The European Commission ordered Microsoft to disclose within 120 days to their competitors the interfaces required for their products to be able to "talk" with  Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows System.


Microsoft is also required to offer within 90 days a version of
its Windows System without the Windows Media Player package to end- users.

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Xinhua) - The European Union announced Wednesday it is imposing a record
fine of nearly 500 million euros (about 600 million US dollars) on US software giant  Microsoft.

The EU's executive arm, the European Commission (EC), concluded after a five-year investigation that Microsoft had broken EU competition law by abusing its near monopoly of the EU market and ordered the company to pay a  fine of 497 million euros (611 million US dollars).

TD
The EC ordered  Microsoft to disclose within 120 days to their competitors the interfaces required for their products to be able to "talk" with  Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows System.

Microsoft is also required to offer within 90 days a version of its Windows System without the Windows
Media Player package to end-users.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition and does not harm consumers and innovation," EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

"Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position," he added.


Microsoft says it will appeal the fine before the European Court of Justice. The case could drag on for at least two more years.
The fine is significantly larger than the 460 million euros (

about 540 million US dollars)  fine imposed on Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche for its part in a price-fixing operation in the vitamins market.



Analysts said the
fine is unlikely to cause too much pain for
the software giant which holds 50 billion euros (60 billion dollars) in cash.

LOS ANGELES, March 24 (Xinhua) - Sum Microsystems, a long-time  Microsoft accuser, applauded on Wednesday the  European Commission' s decision to slap a 613 million US dollar  fine on Microsoft Corp.

"Sun applauds the  European Commission's decision in the  Microsoft case," said Lee Patch, vice president of Sun Microsystems, a major US server maker. "This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and  competition worldwide."

TD
The European Commission announced today it has concluded that  Microsoft broke European Union competition law by leveraging its " near monopoly" in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group server operating systems and for media players.

Because the illegal behavior is still ongoing, the commission said, it has ordered  Microsoft to disclose to competitors the interfaces required for their products to be able to "talk" with the ubiquitous Windows and offer unbundled Media Player from its Windows OS, in addition to paying a 613 million dollar  fine.

"This decision is an important precedent for defining the principles of open  competition not just for today, but for the future of a vibrant and vital worldwide IT industry," Patch said. "We look forward to participating in an exciting period of innovation that will deliver the tangible consumer benefits that derive from competition on the merits."

The commission's decision seeks to create a level playing field in the work group server market place, enabling competitors to deliver work group servers that can fully interoperate and therefore compete on the merits, Patch said.



He hailed the EC decision as "enormously significant" for consumers and for the industry.
"For the first time in many years, IT managers will be able to

choose from a variety of work group servers, confident that they will interoperate with  Microsoft desktops," he said. "Because the decision is forward looking and covers future product releases, consumers can be confident that other work group server suppliers will be able to meet their needs even as Microsoft introduces new products."


Microsoft Corp. said it will seek legal review of the European                                     
Commission's decision in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. "We have acted responsibly while seeking to build the best

products we can to meet the needs of our customers," Smith said. " We believe that the Commission's decision would actually reduce consumer choice and hurt European software developers," said Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of  Microsoft.

Software giant  Microsoft this afternoon said it would seek a legal review of today's EU ruling, which

As well as the  fine, the ruling also demands the  Microsoft offer a stripped-down version of Windows without Windows Media Player and to disclose interface information to rivals.

The company will ask the European Court of First Instance to suspend the Commission's remedies in both areas, pending an appeal.

ATTENTION - ADDS reax ///

US antitrust regulators sharply rebuked their EU counterparts Wednesday for imposing a record  fine and other sanctions on  Microsoft, but rivals of the software giant hailed the action as a victory for free competition.

TD
The 497 million euro (613 million dollar)  fine and other requirements by the  European Commission drew a sharp reaction on both sides of the debate on  Microsoft in the United States.

Some lashed out at European intrusion into the US market, while  Microsoft's technology rivals termed it a positive message for  competition in the marketplace.

The US Department of Justice said Wednesday's EU  antitrust ruling on Microsoft was "unfortunate" and could have unintended effects on the marketplace.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing 'code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences," the department's  antitrust chief R. Hewitt Pate said in a statement.

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies. A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."
Pate said the US settlement of its long-running  antitrust case "provides clear and effective protection for
competition and consumers."

But Microsoft rivals called the ruling a vindication of their charges that the company used its dominance to crush competitors.

"This decision is fundamentally significant because the  European Commission has formally declared that Microsoft's media player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, vice president and general counsel at RealNetworks.

RealNetworks was a key firm in the EU case because it complained that Microsoft's "bundling" of its media software for audio and video within the Windows operating system was an abuse of the Microsoft monopoly position.

The EU ordered  Microsoft to offer a European version of its dominant Windows operating system without the Media Player program within 90 days.

Microsoft also was ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data to enable rival companies to offer low-end servers that can work with Windows within 120 days.
Server hardware and software maker Sun Microsystems also hailed the EU decision.
"This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and
competition worldwide," said Lee Patch, Sun's vice president for legal affairs.

Page 45 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Ed Black of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group of  Microsoft rivals, said the EU decision is a "confirmation of  Microsoft's anti-competitive and illegal business tactics."

"The issues outlined today will prevent  Microsoft from controlling the platform for the delivery and subsequent control over digital content," Black said.

"The decision prevents  Microsoft from 'locking in' their media player and their proprietary format as the de facto standard, which would force developers and consumers alike to bow to whatever demands or taxes Microsoft wishes to place on digital content."
But US Senator Trent Lott lashed out at the ruling, calling it "an unprecedented intrusion into the US
marketplace."

"It will force  Microsoft to disclose to its competitors in Europe, and potentially to non-European companies as well, some of  Microsoft's most valuable trade secrets and other intellectual property assets," Lott said.

The activist group Citizens Against Government Waste called the measure "draconian" and said it flew in the face of traditional acceptance of  antitrust settlements in the US and Europe.

"The decision by the  European Commission will have a global impact of negative consequence," CAGW president Tom Schatz said. "The EC should not be making decisions that are best left to the marketplace. Attempting to restrict the future design of software is unprecedented and has been rejected by the US courts."
Meanwhile Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly, who represents the only US state rejecting the
US settlement, said the EU "sent a very clear message" that  Microsoft "is not above the law."

"The EU's ruling underscores what we've known all along, that the remedies Massachusetts is seeking in its case against  Microsoft are both practical and possible," Reilly said.

"Without a court order that curbs  Microsoft's illegal use of its monopoly power and holds it accountable for past, present and future actions, this company will continue to crush innovation,  competition and consumer choice in the software industry here in the United States."

London --- Sanctions imposed by the  European Commission against Microsoft Corp. --- not a
record-setting $615 million  fine levied against the company --- are likely to have the biggest effect on its
future operations, industry experts say.

The European Commission ruled Wednesday that the world's largest software company had illegally abused its ''near monopoly'' in personal computers.

TD
Microsoft said the action could ''hobble'' its Windows operating system and harm consumers.

The impact could affect product pricing, packaging and marketing strategies, and could lay the groundwork for more antitrust action against the firm, said industry experts.

Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, told reporters the company would appeal to Europe's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg within 70 days. He said it would ask that ''at least part'' of the ruling be stayed or suspended during the appeal process --- which he predicted would take four or five years.

The European Commission, which enforces EU  competition law, slapped the world's largest software company with the largest  fine levied against a single company in the EU's history.

The fine is not likely to faze  Microsoft, which last month was reported to have $52.8 billion in cash on hand. But other sanctions imposed by the EU ''because the illegal behavior is still ongoing'' could be more difficult for the company to grapple with.

The commission ordered  Microsoft to offer within 90 days a version of Windows that doesn't incorporate its Media Player. Such digital players are becoming far more important to consumers as music and video become digitized and computers are marketed as ''entertainment centers.''

The company will still be allowed to sell a version of Windows bundled with the Media Player, meaning that computer makers will be offered two versions.

The commission also ordered  Microsoft to disclose to rivals within 120 days proprietary computer coding that will let their products ''talk'' more efficiently with Windows, which runs more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers.
It will appoint a special trustee to monitor  Microsoft's compliance with the ruling.

''Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position,'' said European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

According to The Associated Press, Monti said he limited the order to Europe ''in deference to the
competition authorities of the United States and other countries.''

But the ruling still hits  Microsoft hard. The company's sales of Windows in Western Europe totaled
$3.4 billion in 2002, almost a third of its worldwide sales.

''If  Microsoft's appeals fail, the EU's decision will have a profound impact on the way Microsoft does business in the future,'' said Laura DiDio, a senior analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. ''Microsoft will be forced to implement new product-packaging and product-marketing strategies.

''And future pricing strategies will be tricky,'' she said. ''The EU, while not setting prices, also said that Microsoft could not offer PC manufacturers a discount if they opt to purchase the version of Windows bundled with Media Player.''
Rivals praise ruling

Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association in Washington, a trade group representing many of  Microsoft's rivals, called the ruling ''historic.''

He said it would make a ''positive impact'' on innovation in the marketplace while laying the groundwork for possible follow-up  antitrust cases against Microsoft.

While European media called Wednesday ''a day of reckoning,''  Microsoft's counsel argued that the legal showdown was far from over.

Smith said it was particularly important for the European Court of First Instance to stay the commission's order requiring the offering of a second version of Windows.

''There are a number of technologies in third-party Web sites that rely on Media Player coding to be in the operating system,'' he said.

Instead of the commission's ''unwarranted and ill-considered step,'' Smith said, consumers would have been better off with a settlement proposed last week under which the Redmond, Wash.-based company would immediately make available a version of Windows that included three competing media players
in addition to  Microsoft's.

Smith predicted the  antitrust case in Europe would play out the way a similar case involving the company's Internet Explorer browser did in the United States.

In late 2001,  Microsoft and its chairman, Bill Gates, agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department after an appeals court overturned part of an  antitrust ruling made against the company by a trial judge.

''Similarly, I'm hoping we get clarity from the European court this year, and then there may well be an opportunity to talk again,'' Smith said.
Open to settlement

In a conference call with reporters,  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer emphasized that the company would like to settle the case. ''We remain hopeful that we may be able to resume discussions,'' he said.

The commission began investigating  Microsoft more than five years ago after Silicon Valley-based Sun Microsystems Inc. complained in 1998 that it wasn't fair for  Microsoft to refuse to provide the details necessary to allow Sun products to interface with Windows computers as efficiently as with  Microsoft's own products.

Commentators expressed little surprise at the ruling, saying the commission is eager to portray itself as a vigorous antitrust watchdog --- especially since U.S. sanctions against  Microsoft have been viewed as being largely ineffective.

And Monti has never been afraid to take on corporate giants from the other side of the ocean --- even amid fears that harsh rulings against U.S. corporate giants could make trans-Atlantic relations, already suffering from various trade spats, even more tense.

In 2001, Monti blocked General Electric Co.'s $47 billion takeover of Honeywell International Inc. --- a merger approved in the United States --- sending shudders through the global business community.

''That ruling showed how different the European perspective is from the U.S. one and illustrated the need for commonality on  antitrust issues,'' said Felix Rohatyn, U.S. ambassador to France during the Clinton administration. ''The both sides have different perspectives that eventually need to be worked out and that shouldn't be allowed --- then or now --- to lead to trans-Atlantic economic rifts.''

Robert Levy, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, said the commission's ruling doesn't promote consumer interests but rather transforms  antitrust into a corporate welfare program for market losers.

He said the EU second-guessed the judgment of both the judicial and executive branches of the American government ''in a matter that concerns management decisions made in the United States by an American company."

''The EU has now become a sanctuary for disgruntled businesses that use political influence in attempts to bring down their rivals,'' he said.

* Litigation

THEY can have any colour as long as it is black. Thus, Henry Ford famously rubbished consumer choice. The founder of the motor industry was concerned with volume, not the irritating distraction
and expense of variety. He wanted every car rolling down the highway to be one of his creations -- an ambition never fulfilled.

TD
A century later, however, Bill Gates has come close to world domination with his computer operating system, and there are indications that the  Microsoft ideologues are taking the occasional leaf from the book of Ford.

The European Commission and its competition commissioner Mario Monti is set to impose a hefty fine against Microsoft for bundling its Media Player software into sales of its Windows operating system to the detriment of rival makers of media software. In the jargon of EU  competition law, Microsoft has abused its dominant position, contrary to Article 82 of the EU treaty.

What nonsense, say  Microsoft advocates as they prepare the intellectual battleground for the appeal to the European Court of Justice. Asking  Microsoft to sell Windows without Media Player is like asking Ford to sell a car without a radio, the argument goes.

Well, why not? Suppose you like the Ford Focus but hate the built-in radio? Fortunately, there are as many models of cars as there are brands of radio, so choice is not a big problem. It is, however, a problem for buyers of PCs, as Windows dominates the industry.

And it is not just PCs; suppose that Ford were a conglomerate that not only made cars but owned media businesses. Suppose that its car entertainment system automatically channelled you to Ford FM, a music station, guided you to your destination by Ford satellite navigation and linked your car phone to Ford Mobile Communications.

Well, Microsoft is halfway there. Last year it launched a software platform for motor manufacturers, offering hands-free mobile phones, real-time traffic updates and access to internet news and weather services.

Within  Microsoft's frantic lobbying efforts is the kernel of a transatlantic political argument, similar to that used by General Electric when its acquisition of Honeywell was prohibited by the  European        Commission. Microsoft is beginning to say that horrid totalitarian EU law is trampling American free enterprise.

Yesterday  Microsoft's counsel complained that the commission was seeking to impose a  fine on Microsoft's US operations when those operations were already regulated by US law. A spurious argument, given the size of the  fine -- about 2 per cent of total revenues.


Page 50 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
What Microsoft's US lawyers find irksome is not the  fine but the huge damage of setting a precedent that could outlaw a core  Microsoft strategy: bundling new products with Windows. The relevant law, Article 82, prohibits behaviour by dominant firms which is abusive -- that is to say, harmful to competition per se.

Article 82 has no direct counterpart in the US, where behaviour that hurts your competitors is generally OK until it hurts consumers. The general philosophy is you can use your economic clout to undercut the other guy, even put him out of business, but woe betide you if you exploit the buying public.

Americans suspect there is a political agenda, that the Commission uses Article 82 to prop up weak companies and protect its domestic industry from foreign  competition. It is part of a wider agenda, they say, to promote an industrial policy, a relic of our socialist heritage.

The trouble with that argument, however, is that the complainants in this case are Americans, those notorious communist fellow travellers Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks.
There is no serious European competitor to protect.

The American critics are partly right, nevertheless, because the  European Commission is trying to shape things. The goal, however, is not to support a particular industry or protect Europeans. It is to promote the common market.

"It is a wider policy," says Julian Joshua, a former commission official and partner at the Brussels office of Howrey Simon, a US law firm. "It is not designed to do down foreigners but to promote the EU agenda, market integration."

HD       European Commission Fines Microsoft EUR497 Million  For Breaches Of European  Competition
Law.

LP
On 24 March 2004, the  European Commission concluded its five-year investigation of  Microsoft, imposing a fine of EUR497 million (approximately $610 million), the largest  fine ever imposed on a company by the Commission for  antitrust infringements. The Commission has imposed on  Microsoft the obligation to disclose sufficient information to allow  Microsoft's competitors in low-end servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers and to unbundle Media Player from Windows.

TD
The Commission's investigation into  Microsoft's trading practices should be differentiated from the Microsoft proceedings and settlement in the US. The US and EU cases do not address the same facts and are thus complementary. In the US, the main thrust of the proceedings revolved around  Microsoft's efforts to protect its dominance on the PC operating systems market by weakening Netscape's Navigator Internet browser and Sun's Java system. The allegations which the Commission has examined centre on Microsoft leveraging its dominance in PC operating systems into the server operating systems. The Commission's decision follows an extensive investigation into  Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system, which was launched by the Commission on its own initiative in February 2000. The Commission had already opened proceedings against  Microsoft relating to its licensing practices following a complaint by Sun Microsystems in December 1998. These two cases were merged into one investigation.

The Commission's  Microsoft decision seeks to increase choice and price arbitrage and encourage innovation by establishing a level-playing field in which rival software vendors can compete. Despite this decision, however, third-party software manufacturers should remain cautious.  Microsoft is likely to appeal the Commission's decision to the Court of First Instance, which could suspend the Commission's orders from taking effect for two years or more. Moreover, the payment of the  fine could be postponed until the end of the appeal proceedings by arranging a bank guarantee.

Currently, only the Commission's press release on the  Microsoft decision is publicly available. The final decision will be published shortly. Below provides a summary of the Commission's principal findings against Microsoft's practices at issue, as set out in the press release.
Commission Decision

There are two key violations: the refusal to disclose interface information on  Microsoft's PC operating system necessary to allow third-party server operating systems to communicate with Windows 2000 and the tying of Windows Media Player and its dominant PC operating system. More detail on these issues follow:

The Commission found that  Microsoft's refusal to supply technical interoperability information to its competitors was a breach of European  competition law. The allegation is that  Microsoft's
non-disclosure of interface information of Windows operating system forces consumers to favour Microsoft's server products. The Commission, therefore, concluded that nondisclosure indirectly harmed consumers by undermining effective  competition and innovation.

By way of remedy, the Commission has ordered  Microsoft to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation to competitors, which would allow their non-Microsoft servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers.  Microsoft is required to disclose the relevant data within
120 days. The disclosed information will have to be updated each time  Microsoft brings to the market new versions of its relevant products.
Page 52 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
To the extent that any of the interface information might be protected by intellectual property rights in Europe,  Microsoft would be entitled to reasonable royalties. The disclosure order concerns the interface documentation only and not the Windows source code.

Second, the Commission determined that the tying of Media Player with the Windows PC operating system distorted  competition. Similar to Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer to Windows, bundling Media Player with Windows for PCs means that Microsoft is able to leverage its dominant PC operating system platform in order to gain a competitive advantage over competing media player software. Given consumers' tendency to use the pre-installed configuration on their desktop, this tying foreclosed other vendors of streaming media software.

Microsoft is required, within 90 days, to offer PC manufacturers a version of its Windows client PC operating system without Media Player. While  Microsoft retains the right to offer a version of its Windows client PC operating system product with Media Player, it must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing. In particular, it must not give PC manufacturers a discount conditional on their buying Windows together with Media Player. The Commission makes clear that the untying remedy is designed to allow the configuration of streaming media/operating system bundles to reflect what consumers want, and not what  Microsoft imposes.
Implications for companies operating in the EU

At least three key implications follow from the decision. First, the decision shows that US companies can realise substantial benefits from bringing an  antitrust complaint in the EU against conduct that is practised globally by a US rival. As noted above, a major part of the European Commission's investigation into  Microsoft was instigated by a complaint from Sun Microsystems, Microsoft's US rival. Perhaps more importantly, the decision also highlights that the European Commission can impose strong remedies that have an extraterritorial effect impacting a rival's worldwide conduct, subject or course to the condition that such extraterritorial conduct produces effects in Europe. Recourse to the EU complaints procedure could, therefore, be a feasible complement or alternative to bringing US proceedings.

Second, in the non-merger context, the  Microsoft decision makes clear that the  European Commission is willing to seek behavioural remedies that are different, and in some cases more effective, than those available from the US courts. For instance, from a comparison of the  Microsoft proceedings in the EU and US, it is apparent that while there is parity in the analysis of similar substantive  antitrust issues, the subsequent remedies imposed by the  European Commission and the US Department of Justice, respectively, are significantly different.

Third, in light of expanding damage opportunities in EU member state courts and possible experience of US extraterritorial jurisdiction, the Microsoft decision highlights the increased opportunity for European companies to seek damages for European antitrust violations in the US and Europe. The fact that the Commission decision addressed the legality of worldwide conduct impacts the risk of litigation in national European courts and in the US. In Europe, a new  competition regime relating to the enforcement of the prohibition of  abuse of dominance will allow complainants to bring an action for damages in a EU member state court by relying on a relevant Commission decision. By way of example, in the UK, a company may sue for damages in the UK's  Competition Appeal Tribunal pursuant to a Commission infringement decision. This new regime will be introduced on 1 May 2004.

Conversely, in the US, current jurisprudence suggests that non-US purchasers may recover treble damages under US antitrust laws for damages suffered as a result of conduct in violation of those laws.
In Empagran SA v F Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd, F.3d, No.01-7115, 2003 WL 131804 (D.C.Cir. Jan. 17, 2003), the US Court of Appeal for the District Columbia allowed such claims even where the transactions giving rise to the damages took place outside the US and the purchaser had no connection to the US, so long as the underlying illegal conduct had an effect on US commerce and injured at least one US-based claimant. This judgment is being appealed. But if the ruling withstands appellate review, US companies face potentially substantial liability (including treble damages) for sales to customers wholly outside the US.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

HD         Gates fury at commission's 'interfering'. BY         By Steve Pain.

European regulators have slapped a record £331 million  fine on US software giant  Microsoft for violating EU anti-trust law - and ordered it to take immediate steps to change the way it does business.

The EU executive yesterday said  Microsoft must act within four months 'because the illegal behaviour is still going on'.

TD
The European Commission levied a record 497.2 million euros ( £331.4 million)  fine, ordered the unbundling of Windows Media Player within 90 days and required that 'complete and accurate' information be given to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days.
However the fine is seen as a mere 'fleabite' for  Microsoft, which will appeal against the decision to the
European Court of Justice. A final verdict could take up to five years to reach.
Bill Gates, founder and chairman of  Microsoft, is furious that the EU is interfering at all when  Microsoft
is already subject to anti-trust laws in America.

And with a healthy bank balance estimated at nearly £40 billion,  Microsoft will not be unduly troubled by the size of the  fine.

Nevertheless, the knock-on effect of changing the way  Microsoft markets its products in Europe could be huge.

Mr Gates is now determined to challenge the commission's contention that the company which made him the world's richest man is an 'abusive monopolist' which has manipulated the market at the expense of others.

The commission investigation was triggered when Sun Microsystems, an American  Microsoft rival, complained in December 1998 that  Microsoft had refused to provide the technical information necessary for Sun to develop products able to 'talk' properly with Windows personal computers.

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement yesterday: 'This decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the market concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company withsuch a strong dominant position.' The commission will appoint a special monitoring trustee to ensure that  Microsoft's disclosures to rivals are 'complete and accurate and that the two versions of Windows are equivalent in terms of performance'.

But the commission admitted that its decision 'does not mean that consumers will obtain PCs and operating systems without media players'.

It added: 'Most consumers purchase a PC from a PC manufacturer which already has put together on their behalf a bundle of an operating system and a media
The Commission ruled that  Microsoft bundled its own audiovisual player to damage such rivals as
RealNetworks RealPlayer and Apple Computer Quicktime.

Microsoft has said it will try to get the ruling delayed until final appeals are over.

Although that limits the immediate impact of the decision, the commission has shown no inclination to slow two other investigations now underway.

Experts said the commission would be able to use the precedent from the decision in bringing the next cases, easing the way for quicker action. The  fine exceeds the record 462 million euro penalty imposed on Swiss firm Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001.

BRUSSELS, Belgium

The European Union hit  Microsoft Corp. with a $613-million US  fine Wednesday for abusing its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond a U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

TD
Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered," and said it would ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal.

The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behaviour because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behaviour is still ongoing."

It gave the company 90 days to offer European computer manufacturers a version of Windows stripped of the company's digital media player, software for viewing video and listening to music that is expected to become pivotal in the industry as multimedia content becomes more pervasive.

The EU also gave  Microsoft 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," EU  antitrust chief Mario Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market.

Microsoft, which had $32 billion US in revenue last year, does about 20 per cent of its business in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said he would ask the presiding judge at the European
Court of First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.

"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," he said.

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, announcing a new speech server product in San Francisco on
Wednesday, did not mention the EU case.

The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser now in private practice.

Others noted, however, that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors, such as the danger they could go out of business. And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Monti called the ruling "proportionate" and "balanced," noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition."

He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints already pending against Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision," he said.

Settlement talks broke down last week over the EU's insistence on just such a precedent-setting element: preventing  Microsoft from adding features such as Google-like search to future versions of Windows.

Smith argued that  Microsoft's settlement proposal, which he said included an offer to release a worldwide Windows version that included three competing media players besides its own, would have been more useful to consumers than the penalties.

He called the order to produce a version of Windows without media software an "unwarranted and ill-considered" violation of intellectual property rights under World Trade Organization rules.

EUROPEAN regulators were last night expected to slap  Microsoft with a record fine and tell it to change the way it does business in Europe so that it will stop crushing software rivals.

The ruling, which the  European Commission says is a coup for consumers, goes further than a negotiated settlement on the firm's home base of the US that critics deemed insufficient.

TD
The 20-member commission was expected to  fine Microsoft $497 million ($A828 million).
It planned to order the software giant to offer a version of its Windows operating system without
Windows Media Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software.

The US-based company must also license information to make the servers of rivals more compatible with Windows desktop machines. Windows runs more than 95 per cent of all personal computers.

Microsoft has said it will take the decision to European Union courts in Luxembourg and try to get the remedies delayed until final appeals are over, a process that could take four to seven years or more.

Although that limits the impact of the decision, the commission has shown no inclination to slow two other investigations of  Microsoft it now has under way.

It will be able to cite the precedent from its decision due late yesterday in bringing the next cases, easing the way for quicker action, experts say.

The decision to go for a broad remedy follows a decade of investigations and settlements on narrow issues without any formal findings against the software firm.

A US Appeals Court ruled unanimously in a 2001 decision against  Microsoft, but critics say the remedies failed to encourage vigorous  competition.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti explained to reporters last week that his decision was based on what was needed for the European marketplace.
"In the end, I had to do what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he said. "I
believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."
The commission fine exceeds the record $462 million penalty imposed on Switzerland's
Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel. Nonetheless, it amounts to about only 1
per cent of  Microsoft's roughly $US53 billion ($A70.5 billion) cash on hand.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The  European Commission's decision to impose a record $613 million fine on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unfortunate, the top U.S.  antitrust enforcer said Wednesday.

"For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the most notorious price-fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities," R. Hewitt Pate, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for  antitrust, said in a statement.

TD
Pate also said the E.C.'s decision to force  Microsoft to remove its media player from the
Windows operating system could produce unintended consequences.
During the U.S.  antitrust case against Microsoft, removal of computer code "was not at any time
- including during the period when the U.S. was seeking a breakup of  Microsoft prior to the
rejection of that remedy by the Court of Appeals - part of the United States' proposed remedy," he
said.

A remedy proposed by nine state attorneys general requiring removal of the Internet Explorer browser was rejected by the U.S. District Court, Pate said.

Pate said there is "considerably more overlap" between the U.S. and E.C.'s requirement that Microsoft license protocols that enable its network server software to communicate with other Microsoft software on a network. But he added the U.S. would have to examine the requirements more closely.

Despite the disagreements, Pate said there is an "overall strong and positive relationship between the U.S. and the E.C. on matters of  competition policy."

Massachusetts Atorney General Tom Reilly, who is challenging the Justice Department's settlement of the U.S. case, said the E.C. ruling validates the remedies Massachusetts is still seeking in court.

"After a thorough investigation, the E.U. (European Union) is not only holding the high-tech giant for past antitrust violations, it is taking steps to put an end to the unlawful and predatory conduct that has continued for too long in the United States," Reilly said.

The E.C. Wednesday imposed the  fine and sanctions against  Microsoft for abusing its market power. The company is expected to appeal.

HD                   Microsoft Concedes Misstep In Search Technology

REDMOND, Wash. (AP)--When  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) entered the Internet browser war in the
1990s, Netscape Navigator was the early leader and  Microsoft's Internet Explorer the
late-blooming upstart.
Now, Microsoft is gearing up for a similar battle in search technology.

TD
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer conceded Thursday that one big misstep by  Microsoft over the past few years is that the company did not put resources toward in-house research and development of search technology.

"That's probably the thing I feel worst about over the last few years - not making our own R&D investment," Ballmer said at a conference for online advertisers held at  Microsoft's Redmond campus.

Instead, he said, the company had relied on outside sources for that technology. Joking that the pervasive software giant is often stereotyped as "doing it all," he said: "This is a case where we didn't do it all - and I wish we had."

But Microsoft is now turning its considerable might toward catching up. It's a move that puts Microsoft head-to-head with Google, the world's most popular Web surfing vehicle, and Yahoo (YHOO), the Internet's most popular destination, in what many see as an important, growing and lucrative market.
"I think you'll see some good  competition in this area," Ballmer said.

Ballmer mentioned the European Union's ruling against  Microsoft only in passing, when asked about rumors the company may be making some big acquisitions. He said he hadn't heard that; he'd been too busy paying attention to rumors coming out of Europe.
The European Commission slapped Microsoft with a $613 million  fine Wednesday for
abusively wielding its near monopoly in desktop operating systems and ordered sanctions that go
well beyond the company's  antitrust settlement with the United States. The company has vowed
to appeal.

About 114.5 million Americans, or 39% of the population, now use search engines, according to Nielsen NetRatings. Also, businesses spent an estimated $2 billion last year on search-related advertising and some analysts expect the market to triple during the next three years.

Microsoft - which will spend nearly $7 billion this year on overall research and development - hopes to have some of its own search technology development done in the next 12 months, Ballmer said. It will take longer to develop search technology focused on advertising, he told the advertising executives.

The software titan also has said that better search technology will be a big part of the next version of its dominant Windows operating system, which may not be released for a couple years or
more.


Page 65 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
At the conference,  Microsoft also unveiled a study on the effectiveness of online advertising. The company is using the study as the basis for an argument that companies spending about 1% of their advertising budget online should consider increasing that to 4% or 5% because people are spending more time online.

Ballmer said Microsoft spends about 12% of its media budget on online advertising, and that he orders his staff to "saturate" that market first and foremost.
"I want to make sure (a user) can't get through ... an online experience without hitting a  Microsoft
ad," he said. [ 03-25-04 1644ET ]

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS -  Microsoft Corp. said it will ask a judge to suspend a European Union order yesterday that slapped the software giant with a $613-million U.S.  fine and ordered sanctions that go well beyond a U.S. antitrust settlement.

TD
Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered."

The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behaviour because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behaviour is still ongoing."

It gave the company 90 days to offer European computer manufacturers a version of Windows stripped of the company's digital media player, its software for viewing video and listening to music that is expected to become pivotal in the industry as multimedia content becomes more pervasive. The EU also gave Microsoft 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows. "We are simply
ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace," EU antitrust chief Mario Monti said.

Mr. Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market.

Microsoft, which had $32 billion U.S. in revenue last year, does about 20 per cent of its business in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said he would ask the presiding judge at the European Court of
First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.

"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," Mr. Smith said.

Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, announcing a new speech server product in San Francisco yesterday, did not mention the EU case.

The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser.

Page 67 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others noted that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors. And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" asked Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Mr. Monti called the ruling proportionate and balanced, noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition." He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints already pending against Microsoft's Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision."
Settlement talks broke down last week over the EU's insistence on just such a precedent-setting element:
preventing Microsoft from adding features such as Google-like search to future versions of Windows.

Mr. Smith argued that  Microsoft's settlement proposal, which he said included an offer to release a worldwide Windows version that included three competing media players besides its own, would have been more useful to consumers. He called the order to produce a version of Windows without media software an "unwarranted and ill-considered" violation of intellectual property rights under World Trade Organization rules. Doing so, he said, would be difficult and make other features and even some Web sites work less effectively.
The company made similar claims in the U.S. case, which surrounded  Microsoft's inclusion of its Internet
Explorer Web browser in Windows.

Microsoft was also found guilty of monopolistic behaviour in the U.S. case, but the EU order strikes at the heart of Microsoft's business strategy: regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades. The company argues that such "bundling" benefits consumers. Rivals call it unfair  competition, given that Windows runs more than 90 per cent of all PCs.

If the United States'  antitrust settlement with Microsoft was too soft for you, the European Union's penalties may suit you better. The European Commission, the body that oversees  antitrust, is being much harsher than the United States.

Or so it sounds. The  European Commission is telling Microsoft to pay $613 million in damages, which would certainly break the bank for you and me.

TD
But for  Microsoft, it's different. Six hundred million dollars amounts to only 6 percent of last quarter's revenues. Had the entire  fine been put on the books in December, it would have decreased the company's quarterly profits by only 40 percent. While other software makers are struggling with a still soft economy,  Microsoft's profits for a single quarter would still have exceeded $800 million.

No wonder Microsoft's competitors are worried. The annual revenue for Real Networks, the company that competes most heavily with Microsoft in the streaming technology segment of the market, was only $202 million in 2003. Microsoft's December quarterly profit alone was seven times Real's revenues for the entire year.

While U.S. legislators had been toying with the idea of breaking Windows into competing products -- an idea that was abandoned with the settlement in 2002 -- European legislators are taking a more expeditious route. They are telling  Microsoft to supply two versions of Windows, one without Windows Media Player built in.

Over the years,  Microsoft has been accused of using its Windows monopoly as an unfair advantage. It bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and wiped out the market for stand-alone browsers, which was catastrophic for Netscape and other companies that were making money selling browsers. It bundled various utilities into the operating system, wiping out the markets for stand-alone utilities. It has even bundled a stand-alone e-mail package with Internet Explorer, which itself is bundled with Windows.

So the European Commission seems to be sending a signal and trying to avert another catastrophe. By requiring Microsoft to provide a version of Windows without Windows Media Player, it is opening the market for Real Networks, Apple's Quicktime and other technologies to compete against Windows Media Player. Otherwise, the game will be over -- just as it has been in other segments.

Frankly, it might already be too late. Over the past few years, even I have, on several occasions, decided to post audio only in Windows Media format. I'd never consider posting only in Real format because the chances are much higher that a visitor to my Web site will have Windows Media Player. That's Windows bundling at work.

You can argue that  Microsoft is making good business decisions by bundling these items. We might consider doing the same thing if we were calling the shots there. You also can argue that the company is bringing down the cost of computing by giving away technology that had previously cost too much
Page 69 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
money. But you'd be hard-pressed to argue that the tactic fosters  competition. I've spoken to many technology entrepreneurs who won't even consider developing a product that might be in  Microsoft's sights as a potential growth area for Windows.

Now Microsoft is doing the same with MSN, most recently by striking a deal with Major League Baseball to provide exclusive free baseball content and live baseball broadcasts on a paid service. It doesn't need to leverage its own monopoly. It can leverage the monopolies of others.

Don't be surprised if the battle for movies, music and other copyrighted material becomes the biggest battleground of them all.  Microsoft is positioning to be the major player, and  Microsoft executives don't like to lose. Do you?

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said he's "troubled" by the  European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft Corp.

"This breakdown in trans-Atlantic cooperation is likely to have ripple effects that will do harm to the trade and economic relationship between the United States and the European Union," the senator said in a statement. "The Commission's action will be felt worldwide, resulting in conflicts in the area of international  competition law."

TD
Europe's  antitrust authority Wednesday  fined Microsoft a record $613 million and ordered it to unbundle media players from some versions of its Windows desktop operating system as punishment for abusing its market power.

Lugar warned that "conflicting regulatory obligations imposed by  antitrust authorities globally will create uncertainty in the marketplace, reduce incentives for innovation, and create significant risks for U.S. firms seeking to enter foreign markets.

"The European Commission's ruling is likely to impose significant barriers to trans-Atlantic trade, not only for Microsoft, but also for its many commercial partners in the United States and in Europe," he added.

Lugar called on the Bush Administration to take measures that it deems appropriate to work with its counterparts in Europe "to ensure the final resolution of this matter promotes cooperation between the United States and the European Union."

MICROSOFT have been fined a record £331million for breaking  competition rules.

The computer software giants immediately appealed the  European Commission's penalty against their 'virtual monopoly'.

TD
The Commission ruled  Microsoft worth £40billion had abused their position by forcing people to purchase their Media Player program when they buy the Windows operating system.

And the Seattle-based firm refused to give competitors access to the Windows computer code. That stopped firms such as Sun Micro-systems writing programs that work with Windows, which runs 90 per cent of the world's PCs.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: 'Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition or harm consumers and innovation.'

Microsoft were ordered to start selling Windows without Media Player within 90 days.

And Bill Gates's company must also let their rivals see the technical information they need within 120 days.
Gates is furious about the decision because  Microsoft is covered by US anti-trust laws. The firm's appeal could take five years and the penalties may be suspended until then.

THE European Commission fined Microsoft a record 497m ( pounds 330m) yesterday after it decided the US software giant was guilty of using its near monopoly to stifle its rivals.  Competition commissioner Mario Monti also ordered it to change its behaviour to enable rivals to compete. The judgment means Microsoft must separate its Windows operating system from its Media Player program within 90 days. It also has 120 days to provide rivals with vital data enabling them to produce computer servers that can work alongside Windows software. The Seattle-based company denies it abuses its dominance to crush competitors and has already vowed to appeal at the European Court of Justice. Mr Monti said the sanctions laid down a clear marker for the future conduct of  Microsoft, which escaped fines in a US
anti-trust investigation. Competition lawyers believe the decision could pave the way for individual lawsuits against Microsoft from companies claiming they have been disadvantaged.

TD
Microsoft's senior vice-president Brad Smith argued the verdict was "unwarranted and ill-considered". His view was echoed by the US Department of Justice, which said the decision was "unfortunate" and could have unintended consequences for the marketplace. The requirement to offer a stripped-down version of Windows in Europe that excludes Media Player could play havoc with the operating system, he warned. "Today's decision is a setback not only for  Microsoft but ultimately for our entire industry and especially for consumers." The company indicated it would ask for the fine and remedies to be
suspended until an appeal was heard. The  fine equates to about 8pc of Microsoft's revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa from the products concerned. However, the penalty is far lower than the fine of 10pc of worldwide revenues it could have faced. Even so,  Microsoft's rivals hailed the decision. "It is fundamentally significant because the Commission has formally declared that  Microsoft's Media Player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, vice-president and general counsel at Real Networks, which makes rival audio and video software to Media Player. Sun Microsystems, which brought the initial complaint that it was denied information that would let it produce servers compatible with  Microsoft's Windows software, also welcomed the announcement. However, industry experts questioned whether the decision would have the desired effect. IT research company IDC said computer makers, even given a choice, would most likely carry on pre-installing Windows with the Media Player to avoid the risk of programming conflicts.

COUNTRY BRIEFING
FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

TD
In the highest-profile antitrust case since it vetoed the GE-Honeywell merger three years ago, the European Commission on March 24th brought to a climax its five-year investigation of Microsoft by imposing a record Euro497m ($613m)  fine and tough sanctions on the US software giant for abuse of its dominant position in personal computer operating systems.  Microsoft immediately confirmed that it
would appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance (CFI) in Luxembourg, which could take up to another five years to hand down its ruling.

According to the Commission,  Microsoft violated the EU competition rules "by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non- Microsoft work group servers, and by tying its Windows Media Player (WMP), a product where it faced competition, with its ubiquitous Windows operating system". To restore a level playing field, it ordered Microsoft to disclose "complete and accurate
interface documentation" to manufacturers of rival servers, and to offer PC makers a version of Windows without WMP bundled in.  Microsoft will be entitled to charge a "reasonable remuneration" for any interface information that is protected by intellectual property rights, and must refrain from any tactics that would make the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing.

For both sides, the heavy  fine--which represents less than 2% of  Microsoft's global turnover and 8% of its sales in Europe--is less important than the "remedies", forcing it to change its business practices in Europe, and the setting of a precedent on which possible future cases could be based. (Following Microsoft's bundling of a web browser and later a media player into Windows, the next expected addition is an Internet search engine.) As the Commission put it: "Microsoft's tying of WMP is an example of a more general business model which, given Microsoft's virtual monopoly in PC operating systems, deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

But Microsoft's decision to launch a court appeal--and to seek an injunction suspending the remedies imposed on it in the meantime--has raised doubts as to whether the Commission's decision will have the intended effect. Brad Smith, the US firm's general counsel said: "The  European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word." If the CFI does grant an injunction, by the time that last word has been heard, it could be too late to prevent  Microsoft once again leveraging its dominance into new technologies at the expense of its more innovative rivals.

FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

The European Commission’s decision to fine Microsoft US$612m for monopolist behaviour hardly amounts to a serious blow against the world’s largest software company. With cash reserves of more than US$50bn, the company can easily afford to pay up. Despite  Microsoft's enormous financial strength, however, the Commission’s decision casts a distinct shadow over its future growth prospects.

TD
First, the ruling is likely to influence a number of similar cases pending against  Microsoft. The company successfully settled an  antitrust action brought by the US government in November 2001, so it had high hopes that it could do the same with the European Union (EU). Indeed, as late as last week  Microsoft was still proposing settlement options. Instead, after four years of investigations, Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, found the company in violation of  antitrust law by failing to give rivals the
information they needed to compete fairly in the market for server software. He also accused  Microsoft of stifling  competition in the market for so-called media player software, which is used to play video and music.

Although the company intends to appeal the decision, it now seems likely that Mr Monti’s ruling can only result in further legal losses for the company in other venues. These may or may not result in  fines, but cumulatively they will damage the company’s reputation around the world. For example, the EU is also examining complaints that  Microsoft is using its Windows XP system to extend the company's dominance in new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones. In the US,  Microsoft is still awaiting a US appeals court ruling on whether the settlement it reached with the government in 2001 was proper. It is
also facing a lawsuit in Minnesota which alleges the company overcharged customers between 1994 and
2001. Apart from government actions, Microsoft is also being sued by RealNetworks, the software
company the EU said was the victim of Microsoft's uncompetitive behaviour in Europe.

Pressures are building in Asia as well. In February, Japanese government officials raided  Microsoft's offices on suspicion of monopolistic practices. In particular, the government is investigating complaints that the company attached restrictive conditions to its sales of software to computer makers. Although
Microsoft says it no longer engages in such activities, it is co-operating with authorities. In the wake of the
EU's decision, it now seems clear that many more such cases will be emerging around the world.
Trouble ahead

At the heart of  Microsoft’s anti-competitive behaviour, according to the Commission, is its practice of "bundling" new products into its dominant operating system, guaranteeing an instant market for those products. Because the price of the new software is hidden in the cost of a new computer, critics assert, consumers can't compare the product with the  competition. As Microsoft controls 94% of the market for personal computer (PC) operating systems globally, the process is akin to automakers an specifying
in-house brand of CD player for all their cars. The Commission, in response, has ruled that  Microsoft
must make its Windows software in two versions--with its media player and without.

This poses a real dilemma for the company: it must now decide whether to design the next version of Windows, dubbed Longhorn and due in 2006, with integrated extras or forego them. Given that Microsoft’s sales growth has slowed recently, the company has high hopes for Longhorn. But if the product is eventually released without the extras that consumers have come to expect from Windows, it

Page 79 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
may not be well-received. In essence, bundling allowed computer buyers to think they were receiving something for nothing, since the cost of the extra software was buried in the price of the PC. The result, however, is that  Microsoft has trained consumers to believe that programs like its Windows Media Player essentially are free.

While the Commission’s recent ruling forces the company to unbundle its wares in Europe,  Microsoft could face a backlash from consumers elsewhere who have come to depend on the bundled extras. That could mean selling different versions of its product in different markets--in effect, building integrated and unintegrated versions of Longhorn, which will be costly and time-consuming. And if the company is forced to bundle its rivals' products with its own, it will lose sales.

The Longhorn problem is not a minor one. Over the last 18 months,  Microsoft has been losing sales to the competing open-source Linux operating system--Microsoft has admitted that licensing renewals have fallen off in recent months. This fact, and the company’s mounting legal hassles, have caught the attention of Wall Street, which has sent the company’s shares down. Over the last six months,  Microsoft's stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 by 23%. Over the last 12 months, while the share prices of most technology companies have been rising,  Microsoft's has dropped by 8% .

Microsoft has also lost its position as the world’s most valuable company, as measured by market capitalisation. It handed the crown to General Electric (GE) at the end of the third quarter last year and is now the world’s third most valuable company, trailing GE and Exxon Mobil. As of mid-March, it was just barely ahead of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company. Given its parsimonious approach to paying out dividends, on the one hand, and its growing business and legal worries, on the other,  Microsoft’s
stock--both in terms of equity and reputation--could have further to fall.

Mario Monti managed a headline-grabbing finale to the  European Commission's five-year investigation into Microsoft. The Euros 497m  fine, for abuse of market power, is a European record.  Microsoft will have to provide new information to rivals in the server market to help them interface better with
Microsoft products. It will also have to offer a version of Windows without Media Player included in the
European Union. But the immediate impact on  Microsoft will be negligible.

The fine represents little more than 1 per cent of  Microsoft's cash pile. The remedy on Media Player actually looks less onerous than  Microsoft's offer to include rivals' programs alongside its own in both the EU and beyond.

TD
The real point of Mr Monti's decision is to kick off a fight for the future, rather than trying to alter the past. Microsoft's Media Player is already established. That will not change. Mr Monti's strategy is to minimise the chance of his remedies being overturned in the courts - and avoid disagreements with the US authorities - while securing a framework to contain  Microsoft from now on. If the  European                    Commission weathers Microsoft's appeals, it should be in a position to check abusive behaviour in the future more quickly.

Such close control in a major market would make it yet more difficult for  Microsoft - which relies heavily on its maturing Windows and Office products - to accelerate growth. Negotiations may have been amicable. Mr Monti should expect the gloves to come off.

The European Commission's decision yesterday to  fine Microsoft for abusing its Windows software monopoly and set up guidelines for its future behaviour, is being hailed by  competition lawyers as a breakthrough.

The decision comes after a 20-year history in which the EU regulator has reviewed complaints about the technology industry but always reached a mutual agreement on remedies with the companies involved. "It is a ground-breaking decision. Its the first time an important regulator has really challenged  Microsoft directly," says Antoine Winckler, partner at Cleary Gottlieb, which acted for RealNetworks in the case.

TD
In cases dating back to an investigation of IBM that ended in 1984, the Commission agreed a code of behaviour with the company rather than issue a legal ruling. In IBM's case it settled for an  antitrust compliance programme allowing rivals to connect hardware products to IBM's mainframe.

But Mario Monti is aware that settlements with companies have often been circumvented and he was keen to set a legal framework. This means other companies and consumers can base future complaints on any precedents established in the  Microsoft case.

The decision will also give national  competition authorities and European judges guidelines on which to base decisions in related or similar cases.

Mr Monti has established an important finding of dominance against  Microsoft - something the company had disputed. A company can be a dominant player in any industry with a market share as small as 40 per cent, depending on the strength of  competition and the availability of rival products.  Microsoft's lawyers sought to argue that the fast-moving software sector made traditional  antitrust rules irrelevant because a leading player can be unseated very quickly by a rival.

Mr Monti decided traditional rules should apply and  Microsoft must be forced to comply with the stricter responsibilities that govern the behaviour of a dominant player. "It was felt that other issues of a similar nature would arise," said Michael Reynolds, head of  antitrust at Allen &Overy, which acted for Sun Microsystems. "Every time you have these cases, you don't want a five-year procedure to get a solution."

Microsoft's settlement offer would have applied only to the specific issues under consideration. Although the offer would have covered the company's business worldwide, it would not have affected future versions of Windows or other products that it might develop. "As it brings forward new versions of Windows, there needs to be a framework within which the legality of Windows can be assessed," says Chris Thomas,  antitrust partner at Lovells which acted for Novell in the case.

Other complaints against  Microsoft remain outstanding in the EU. The most prominent has been filed by the Computer &Communications Industry Association about the company's bundling of products
including Instant Messenger, Outlook Express and Movie Player on to Windows XP.

"It gives our case a boost. It does not mean we will prevail, but it puts forward a framework for our case," said Thomas Vinje at Clifford Chance, which is representing the CCIA.

The CCIA complaint affects the future of digital content on PCs. "The content providers will write for the media player that is available. If the  Microsoft format becomes a standard for the industry, there is a problem for everyone else," Mr Vinje said.

Microsoft will appeal against the Commission's decision, but Mr Monti should be able to enforce the behavioural remedies even while the courts are considering the appeal.

The European Union's decision to force  Microsoft Corp. to “untie” its media software from its Windows operating system is a dangerous precedent that will mean further  antitrust lawsuits for the U.S. company, analysts warned yesterday.
“There are going to be private lawsuits in both Europe and in the United States on this issue,” said
Matt Rosoff, analyst at Directions on  Microsoft in Kirkland, Wash. “Whenever  Microsoft wants to add
functionality to Windows that is already provided by a competitor on a stand-alone basis, they would
face a legal risk.”

TD
As expected, European Union regulators ordered the world's largest software maker yesterday to pay a record 497-million-euro fine ($603-million U.S.) for “abusing its market power.” To restore fair competition, the European Commission said the Redmond, Wash.-based company must offer a version of its popular Windows system without a music and video player within 90 days. Then, 30
days later, it must share software code with competitors.

“The ongoing abuses act as a brake on innovation and harm the competitive process and consumers, who ultimately end up with less choice and facing higher prices,” the commission said in a ruling that concludes a five-year investigation. The European market accounts for about 30 per cent of the company's business.

Microsoft said it will seek a stay on the decision pending an appeal process that may take up to five years to complete. In a conference call with journalists, chief executive officer Steve Ballmer said the company has no plans to alter its software strategy, including development, packaging and marketing.

A Microsoft team led by Mr. Ballmer struggled to reach a settlement with the EU's regulatory arm in Brussels. The software firm offered to bundle three competing media players on Windows worldwide, but talks broke down when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on how further features may be added to the platform.

“It's unfortunate that the commission decided to pursue a riskier course of litigation,” Mr. Ballmer said. “Hopefully, we will be able to resume discussions and reach a resolution of these issues.”

Microsoft was found guilty of similar near monopolisticbehaviour in a U.S.  antitrust case in 2001. The ruling led Microsoft to pay AOL Time Warner Inc. $750-million last year to settle allegations that it tried to put the rival's Internet browser out of business. Other U.S.  antitrust cases have dogged Microsoft, including civil lawsuits from Sun Microsystems Inc. and Real Networks Inc. The two tech firms led the effort to prosecute  Microsoft in Europe.

“Private actions will continue and they will, to a certain extent, be bolstered by jurisdictions in which they are filing,” said Jim Balderston, senior industry analyst at consulting and research firm Sageza Group Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. “Each one of these cases . . . lays a foundation for the next set of legal actions.”
Page 84 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The EU decision may have little impact on U.S. civil cases, said Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel. European case law may not be considered relevant by the court and industry rivals seeking worldwide damages will prefer to fight  Microsoft before a U.S. jury, he said.

The investment community shrugged off the EU ruling with  Microsoft shares up 26 cents to $24.41 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts noted that the $603-million  fine represents about three weeks profit for the company.

“A cloud of uncertainty has been removed,” brokerage Piper Jaffray & Co. of Minneapolis said in a note yesterday. Goldman Sachs of New York reported “the outcome does not appear to alter Microsoft's business model or involve . . . draconian measures.”

Despite yesterday's gains,  Microsoft shares are down 11 per cent in value since the beginning of the year. In comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is off only 4 per cent since January.

Duncan Stewart, co-owner and portfolio manager of Toronto's Tera Capital Corp., said the investment community views Microsoft as a slow-growth, blue-chip firm rather than a high-flying tech player.

“It's like the point when Mick Jagger went from being a rebel Rolling Stone to the public realizing, ‘Oh my god, he's old.'  Microsoft has all of a sudden turned from the dynamic young software rebel in to this dividend-paying senior citizen,” Mr. Stewart said.

HD           Microsoft ordered to open up: EU issues record euros 500m fine for software  group's abuse of its monopoly

The European Union yesterday condemned Microsoft for illegal abuse of its near monopoly, ordering it to change its business practices and pay a record fine of nearly euros 500m (pounds 333m).

After a five-year investigation, Mario Monti, the EU  competition commissioner, said the world's second largest company must now offer its Windows operating system without its digital Media Player to PC manufacturers.

TD
The US software group, chaired by Bill Gates, must also release "complete and accurate" information to rivals about the code underlying its Windows operating system, found in 90% of PCs worldwide, so they can produce software for servers which link desktop computers in offices.

"Today's decision restores conditions for fair  competition and establishes clear principles," Mr Monti said. "Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition on merit and does not harm consumers and innovation."

Steve Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, described the ruling as "unfortunate", saying the firm had "worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our product".

Microsoft legal counsel Brad Smith said the company will appeal. The issue is likely to be bogged down in the courts for up to five years. "The EC has the first word but European courts have the final word," he said.

The company hopes to stay at least part of the order, demanding a second stripped-down version of Windows, pending the appeal. US politicians also hinted at worsening trade relations with Europe, complaining that the EU action was a threat to US innovation, growth and jobs.

Patty Murray, a Democratic senator in Washington,  Microsoft's home state, said: "The EU's proposed actions amount to a hostile act with severe consequences for the global economy." She said the ruling was an "unprecedented and blatant attempt to regulate the US economy" and called on the Bush administration to "engage the EU immediately" to hammer out a settlement.

The Cato Institute, a Republican thinktank, said the decision was instigated by competitors who failed to get their way when  Microsoft agreed a more lenient settlement with the US justice department three years ago. "Far from promoting consumer interests, the latest EU order, pure and simple, transforms antitrust into a corporate welfare programme for market losers," said Cato's Robert Levy.

Microsoft's rivals welcomed the decision. RealNetworks, the Seattle-based firm which pioneered software for audio and video on PCs, said: "We expect that PC equipment manufacturers will take advantage of their new found freedom. For the first time in five years they are not going to be forced to include Windows Media Player."
Lee Patch, vice president of legal affairs at Sun Microsystems said the decision will lead to increased
competition in the server market. "We want to be able to have products competing on their merits
Page 86 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
rather than on the basis of whether or not they can effectively communicate with  Microsoft's desktops," he said.

European politicians praised the decision. "It is impossible to imagine a British  competition authority facing down the political pressures to insist on such remedies," said British Lib Dem MEP Chris Huhne.

Analysts, however, remained unconvinced that the ruling would have any long-term effect on Microsoft, which has $53bn in the bank. Neil Ward Dutton, a director at tech research firm Ovum, said it was "like an elephant being stung by a bee".

"The ruling is a legacy of where we were two or three years ago and by the time any remedies are forced on Microsoft it will be further down the line by which time they will be irrelevant."

Mr Monti's decision follows negotiations which broke down last week over Brussels' insistence on ground rules that would apply to future versions of Windows. Experts described yesterday's twin track punishment of a  fine and "remedies" as one of the most significant rulings in the history of EU competition policy.
The euros 497.2m  fine beats the previous record of euros 462m imposed on Swiss chemical firm
Hoffmann-Laroche for participation in a vitamin cartel.

Get this for a piece of corporate cynicism: "We expect the court to suspend sanctions in both areas. I
would anticipate this case has another four or five years of litigation ahead of it."

The words come from an unnamed  Microsoft legal official, speaking after yesterday's record  fine from the European commission.

TD
It is not the size of the  fine that will have so irritated Bill Gates' team, since  Microsoft has a cash pile of more than $50bn. Rather, it is the instruction by EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti that Microsoft produce a stripped down version of its Windows software for Europe, unbundling its in tegrated Media Player. This cuts at the heart of  Microsoft's core strategy for maintaining and extending its near-monopoly over desktop computer software. This involves waiting to see which new rival
software applications are proving popular, producing a  Microsoft version, and then giving the software away free with Windows.

The effect is that the original developer either goes out of business or settles for a tiny market share, even if the  Microsoft version of their product is hugely inferior.

It happened with word processing (remember WordPerfect?), it happened with the internet browser (Netscape), it has more or less already happened with video and sound playback (RealNetworks), while a string of would be competitors in video editing are now in the process of being cut down by Windows Movie Maker. Innovation is suppressed; second-rate products become the de facto standard.

Mr Monti has shown himself ready to stand up to this crude behaviour. But the appeal process, through the European court of justice, will take a number of years - just as the triumphant legal adviser declared yesterday. By which time the commission's ruling will be irrelevant, since the Windows Media Player will already be established as the universal standard.

During the gruelling investigation into  Microsoft, and the subsequent attempts to reach a negotiated settlement, specialist anti-monopoly lawyers in Brussels have been making all sorts of noises about how traditional anti-monopoly rules need to be changed for the modern hi-tech age, where big companies
can suddenly lose their dominant market positions to innovative up-starts, especially in areas like software.
Given the record of  Microsoft, this argument would seem to be utter tosh.

What European consumers need is a reform of the legal system so that the existing rulebook can be properly enforced.

The European commission's move to fine Microsoft euros 330m and also to force it to open up its products to more competition is a landmark decision. It shows that a European institution can play a leading role in curbing the excesses of multinational corporations - though the case could go to appeal and drag on for years. The  fine was a record one for the EU. That will not worry  Microsoft, which has reserves of over $50bn. More important, perhaps, are the restrictions imposed. The problem is that Microsoft, which sells 95% of the operating systems running personal computers, also "bundles in" functions like its Media Player (enabling users to play music and videos) that competitors say give it an unfair advantage.  Microsoft argues that it employed functions like that before rivals existed and that they are an intrinsic part of its Windows operating system.

TD
Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, thinks otherwise. Yesterday the commission endorsed his view that Microsoft should be ordered to share more of its Windows code with ri vals in the server market and to produce a version of Windows free of the bundled audio-visual software within 90 days. Microsoft responded by offering to make a couple of rival media players available on a worldwide basis. This may have been the germ of a solution - if  Microsoft could have been trusted to implement it fairly - but it would not have been embedded in EU law so the EU decided to go all the way.

Microsoft will now appeal, which may delay a solution for up to four years. Such a course would only worsen Microsoft's image as a corporation that takes on governments in order to win. It would do Microsoft good simply to accept the EU's mild requirement to make a "clean" version of Windows available. After all, if  Microsoft really believes that its media player (and future add-ons) have to be part of the operating system, then a version without the add-ons ought not to do harm. The objective is not to knock Microsoft, but to achieve a fair market for products that have to work in Windows because of its
95% monopoly.

Only legal reform can rein in Bill Gates
Get this for a piece of corporate cynicism: "We expect the court to suspend sanctions in both areas. I
would anticipate this case has another four or five years of litigation ahead of it."

TD
The words come from an unnamed  Microsoft legal official, speaking after yesterday's record  fine from the European commission.

It is not the size of the  fine that will have so irritated Bill Gates' team, since  Microsoft has a cash pile of more than $50bn. Rather, it is the instruction by EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti that Microsoft produce a stripped down version of its Windows software for Europe, unbundling its in tegrated Media Player. This cuts at the heart of  Microsoft's core strategy for maintaining and extending its near-monopoly over desktop computer software. This involves waiting to see which new rival
software applications are proving popular, producing a  Microsoft version, and then giving the software away free with Windows.

The effect is that the original developer either goes out of business or settles for a tiny market share, even if the  Microsoft version of their product is hugely inferior.

It happened with word processing (remember WordPerfect?), it happened with the internet browser (Netscape), it has more or less already happened with video and sound playback (RealNetworks), while a string of would be competitors in video editing are now in the process of being cut down by Windows Movie Maker. Innovation is suppressed; second-rate products become the de facto standard.

Mr Monti has shown himself ready to stand up to this crude behaviour. But the appeal process, through the European court of justice, will take a number of years - just as the triumphant legal adviser declared yesterday. By which time the commission's ruling will be irrelevant, since the Windows Media Player will already be established as the universal standard.

During the gruelling investigation into  Microsoft, and the subsequent attempts to reach a negotiated settlement, specialist anti-monopoly lawyers in Brussels have been making all sorts of noises about how traditional anti-monopoly rules need to be changed for the modern hi-tech age, where big companies
can suddenly lose their dominant market positions to innovative up-starts, especially in areas like software.
Given the record of  Microsoft, this argument would seem to be utter tosh.

What European consumers need is a reform of the legal system so that the existing rulebook can be properly enforced.
Rail mistake

Hats off for sensitivity at Network Rail, which yesterday reappointed Jarvis to carry out track renewals on the very stretch of line which claimed seven lives in the Potters Bar train crash two years ago.


Page 93 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The announcement was unfortunate - particularly as it came just a week after bereaved relatives
learned to their disgust that a criminal investigation into the crash had been downgraded, with the health
and safety executive taking over the lead from the British Transport Police.

The outcome is a result of two poor decisions. One is the government's insistence that there is no need for a public inquiry into the accident. Only an inquiry can finally settle who was responsible for the parlous state of the points at Potters Bar and put a stop to finger-pointing and innuendo between the companies involved.

The other is Network Rail's curious insistence that track renewals should remain in private hands, despite its brave step in taking day-to-day maintenance of the whole of Britain's rail infrastructure in-house.

Network Rail justified its renationalisation of maintenance on grounds of cost and performance. But the very same engineering firms are responsible for renewals. It cannot be the case that they are delivering value and excellence on one set of contracts while routinely ripping off the taxpayer on the other.

Network Rail's chairman Ian McAllister and his team have a lot on their plate - they are in the process of taking on 18,000 new employees.

But they should seriously consider taking renewals in a single region in-house to test whether any benefits can be gained.
They will not gain the confidence of passengers or staff by doling out more five-year contracts to Steve
Norris's sharp-suited "infrastructure services" experts.
Dear John

Barclays' annual report and accounts is a thumping 228-page tome devoid of all illustration, save 20 postage-stamp monochrome mugshots of the directors. But it does contain a single sentence on page
19 which probably puts paid to any hopes that chief executive-designate John Varley might harbour of following the suave Mr Barrett into the chairman's office.

"The board does not regard his appointment [Mr Matt's promotion] as setting a precedent in Barclays for appointing the group chief executive to the position of chairman".
The message could not be clearer - JV can forget it.

The European commission's move to fine Microsoft euros 330m and also to force it to open up its products to more competition is a landmark decision. It shows that a European institution can play a leading role in curbing the excesses of multinational corporations - though the case could go to appeal and drag on for years. The  fine was a record one for the EU. That will not worry  Microsoft, which has reserves of over $50bn. More important, perhaps, are the restrictions imposed. The problem is that Microsoft, which sells 95% of the operating systems running personal computers, also "bundles in" functions like its Media Player (enabling users to play music and videos) that competitors say give it an unfair advantage.  Microsoft argues that it employed functions like that before rivals existed and that they are an intrinsic part of its Windows operating system.

TD
Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, thinks otherwise. Yesterday the commission endorsed his view that Microsoft should be ordered to share more of its Windows code with ri vals in the server market and to produce a version of Windows free of the bundled audio-visual software within 90 days. Microsoft responded by offering to make a couple of rival media players available on a worldwide basis. This may have been the germ of a solution - if  Microsoft could have been trusted to implement it fairly - but it would not have been embedded in EU law so the EU decided to go all the way.

Microsoft will now appeal, which may delay a solution for up to four years. Such a course would only worsen Microsoft's image as a corporation that takes on governments in order to win. It would do Microsoft good simply to accept the EU's mild requirement to make a "clean" version of Windows available. After all, if  Microsoft really believes that its media player (and future add-ons) have to be part of the operating system, then a version without the add-ons ought not to do harm. The objective is not to knock Microsoft, but to achieve a fair market for products that have to work in Windows because of its
95% monopoly.

HD             EU imposes  €497m fine on Microsoft

SOFTWARE giant  Microsoft has been ordered to pay a record  fine of €497m to the EU - around half of Ireland's annual membership contributions. But while Ireland gets nearly €2bn back in net receipts from the Brussels coffers,  Microsoft faces further revenuelosses after it was ordered to open up
some of its secret code to its competitors.

Despite a last minute attempt by  Microsoft to negotiate a deal,  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti still went ahead with the same anticipated ruling, which gives the software supplier just 90 days to comply and offer a new version of Windows to purchasers.

TD
The size of the  fine beats the previous record of €462m handed down to Roche for its role in a vitamin cartel. But it represents just 2pc of  Microsoft's annual turnover and a fraction of its $53bn cash war chest. Nevertheless, it's anticipated that the precedent set will be more damaging than the actual fine itself.

Already,  Microsoft has vowed to appeal to the European Court, although CommissionerMonti was confident that the five-year-long investigation would withstand the scrutiny. Heclaimed it had illegally used its windows operating system to prevent any real competitionfrom rivals developing server software and the kind of media players that are used to playvideo and sound clips.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," insisted the powerful Competition Commissioner. "This is not a decision we have taken easily or hastily."

Unlike almost all other areas of EU business where power is shared between the Commission, the member states and the European Parliament, Mr Monti wields strong direct controls over state aid and competition policy directly from Brussels that can onlybe appealed to the EU courts.

But the decision damages the "fundamental" way that  Microsoft adds new features to the basic Windows programme, insisted its chief executive, Steve Ballmer. It has alreadysuccessfully beaten a similar claim taken by Mr Monti's counterparts in the US.

"We worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European Commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers," said MrBallmer.

The company now has 70 days to appeal the decision to the lower EU court, the Court of First Instance, and will also seek to suspend the order to open up the code or pay the  fine pending the decision.

YESTERDAY'S RULING by the European Commission against Microsoft was historic for two reasons. First for the record size of the fine, and second for the determination with which Mario Monti, the European  Competition Commissioner, has taken on one of the great icons of America's thriving information technology economy. In the US, the  fine will be seen by many as a vindictive piece of
anti-Americanism from the surrender monkeys of Europe, yet the reality is that America flew in the face of its once formidable tradition of trust busting in letting  Microsoft off the hook during a similar anti-trust case nearly two years ago.

TD
The reasons are understandable enough.  Microsoft is one of the most brilliant entrepreneurial creations of the modern age, and for the country that produced it to turn round and attempt to stamp it out looked
to many a perverse response to the nature of the problem. As soon as the new Administration came in, the case was settled with only minor conditions to address the anti-competitive abuses  Microsoft was accused of.

So it perhaps required a foreign jurisdiction to take on the might of  Microsoft. Wisely, Mr Monti confined himself to just two aspects of the  Microsoft monopoly. There is nothing he could or should have done about Microsoft's underlying dominance of the PC operating system market. That  Microsoft managed to make Windows into the industry standard is part of its genius as a company. It cannot now be taken away.

Rather the EU has chosen to concentrate its attention on the way  Microsoft has attempted to leverage its monopoly of desktop operating systems on to the market for server operating systems and media players. Microsoft is now required to offer Windows software free of the Windows Media Player, so that rival software producers get a chance to enter this fast-growing area of the market. More importantly, Microsoft is being required to disclose all interface documentation, so that non  Microsoft work servers can achieve full interoperability with with Windows PCs and servers.

The significance of this second ruling cannot be overestimated, as it potentially allows for the widespread development of alternatives to  Microsoft delivered to the desktop via centralised servers. Mr Monti reckons his rulings are water tight, and cannot be successfully appealed. That won't stop Bill
Gates, chairman of  Microsoft, fighting them like an alley cat. Post the US anti-trust case,  Microsoft has talked the language of compromise and inclusion, but there's still an iron fist beneath the silken gloves.

I've long held the view that the biggest threat to  Microsoft comes not from  competition regulators, but from technological change and innovation. Nothing in yesterday's decision leads me to change that conclusion. The importance of Mr Monti's ruling is rather that he has at least given the innovators a better chance.

BRUSSELS:

In a landmark ruling Wednesday, the  European Commission found Microsoft guilty of abusing its near monopoly on computer operating systems in order to squeeze out rivals from separate sectors of the software industry.

TD
The decision, which includes a record  fine of 497.2 million, or $613 million, will have important repercussions for separate lawsuits against the company in the United States, for the way the world's biggest software maker does business, and for  competition in the computer industry worldwide, analysts and legal experts said.

Unless it is overturned in court  Microsoft has already promised to appeal the ruling will set a precedent making it easier to prosecute possible future monopoly  abuse by the company, said Mario Monti, competition commissioner, shortly after the commission issued the ruling. If future cases do materialize, they will benefit from this precedent, he said.
Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, said in a conference call with journalists that the company
would request an appeal of the ruling at the European Court of First Instance within 70 days of this ruling.

Microsoft wants the remedies imposed on it suspended until after the appeal, which could take four or five years. Smith said the company would request a suspension within days of filing its appeal. Although a suspension is likely, it is not assured. Given that the monopoly  abuse is ongoing, and given that it is the most serious case of it the European Union has ever ruled against, the commission is expected to submit strong arguments against a suspension to the court, said Amelia Torres, commission spokeswoman. Monti said he was confident we have produced a decision that can withstand an appeal.

Microsoft's chief executive, Steven Ballmer, said in a statement that the settlement offer  Microsoft proposed last week, which was rejected by the commission, would have been a much better solution for consumers and for innovation in the software industry.

As this case moves forward, you can rest assured we will respect and comply fully with European law, we will continue to invest in new technology breakthroughs, and we will continue to work to bring our innovations to our partners and customers, Ballmer said.

The commission is ordering the broadest compulsory licensing of intellectual copyright since the founding of the European Union more than 50 years ago, Smith said.

In its ruling, the commission found that by withholding vital information about Windows,  Microsoft's hugely successful personal computer operating system, the company deliberately restricted interoperability between PCs using Windows and computer servers installed with competitors' server software. Servers connect PCs together to form computer networks.
But the most important aspect of the ruling in terms of its impact on the future strategy of  Microsoft
concerned the bundling or tying of its media playing software into Windows in order to steal a march on
Page 100 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
rivals, legal observers agreed. Tying harms  competition because it prevents a lot of high-quality alternatives from being available, Monti said. Media players are separate products from operating systems. There is separate demand for them.

Among other things, tying forecloses the market to competitors because it leads providers of content for media players, such as music and movie companies, to design their content to suit the most dominant media player, which happens to be  Microsoft's Media Player.  Microsoft says there are more than 450 million registered copies of Media Player in circulation.

The commission gave Microsoft 90 days to offer PC manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Fujitsu Siemens, and consumers directly, a separate version of Windows with Media Player stripped out. A version with Media Player may still be sold, but the commission said this bundled version must not be favored in any way over the unbundled one.

Microsoft must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive, the commission said in a statement.

Even though Monti said the ruling only applied to Europe,  Microsoft is still unsure whether it will have worldwide impact, Smith said. Even if it is limited in geographical reach from a legal standpoint, its impact in practice could be much wider. We all know that software crosses borders, even if the ruling is limited to Europe, he said.
Media software like  Microsoft's player allows PC users to download, listen to, organize and copy to
hand-held players music that has been converted to digital form. Later in an interview, Monti said he was
convinced that the commission's solution would open up the market for media players. Companies like
RealNetworks and Apple Computer have tried to make money in this field, but they have complained of
being held back by the proliferation of Media Player. RealNetworks' deputy general counsel, David
Stewart, said Wednesday's decision was a great step towards leveling the playing field for media players.
The ruling, he said, validates our concerns about  Microsoft, adding that the ruling will help
RealNetworks in its private  antitrust lawsuit against the software giant in the United States.

The commission also gave the company 120 days to reveal the necessary information about Windows to rival server software makers to allow them to design products that work as easily with Windows as Microsoft's own server software.

Sun Microsystems, a maker of rival server software products, sparked the five-year-long  antitrust case with its complaint to the commission about  Microsoft in 1998. Its vice president of legal affairs, Lee Patch, on Wednesday applauded the commission's ruling.

The remedy concerning interoperability will result in a wave of new competitive products on the market, he said. Users will be able to mix and match software from different vendors. They'll be able to choose the best product on the market, then six months later take advantage of the choice to pick the best product at that particular time.

Microsoft would not say exactly what it offered Monti during the settlement talks last week. In an interview, Smith said the offer included bundling two rival media players into  Microsoft's Windows. In addition,  Microsoft offered to implement the changes worldwide. The commission's decision only applies to Europe.

BRUSSELS:

Microsoft was handed its greatest legal defeat to date Wednesday when the  European Commission not only declared the software company an abusive monopolist, as the U.S. government did in 2000, but levied penalties designed to prevent similar abuses in the future.

TD
The ruling, anticipated for more than a week, orders  Microsoft to sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers of personal computers such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Toshiba and Fujitsu Siemens. One of those versions must be sold without  Microsoft's audio- and video-playing software, called Media Player. The commission, the executive agency of the European Union, ordered Microsoft to produce the alternate version within 90 days.

More than 95 percent of personal computers in the world are powered by Windows software. The commission ruled that  Microsoft could not use such a dominant product to leverage its position in other markets.

The ruling also orders the company to divulge within 120 days previously proprietary information about the way Windows works, to allow rivals to make software suitable for Windows users. Sun Microsystems, whose complaint in 1998 sparked the commission's investigation, persuaded the European regulator that by holding back vital Windows code from competitors,  Microsoft was using its operating system dominance in the related market for server software that runs networks of PCs.

The commission also fined Microsoft 497.2 million, or $612.8 million. It is establishing a new advisory group to examine Microsoft's compliance.

Microsoft said Wednesday that it would appeal the ruling. Microsoft believes a settlement would have been better for European consumers, Tom Brookes, Microsoft spokesman in Brussels, told The Associated Press. At a press conference Wednesday, the European  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said, I am confident that we have produced here a decision that will stand before any appeal.

Media software like  Microsoft's allows PC users to download, listen to, organize and copy to hand-held players music that has been converted to digital form. Companies like RealNetworks and Apple Computer have tried to make money in this field, but they have complained of being held back by the proliferation of Media Player.

Consumers ought to be able to choose their media player, not  Microsoft, Monti said at the press conference. Media Player is a separate product. There is a separate demand for media players.

The commission is not requiring Microsoft to charge a lower price for a version of Windows sold without Media Player bundled in. Microsoft must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing, the commission statement said. It added that  Microsoft must not give PC makers a discount if they buy Windows with Media Player bundled in. We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace, Monti said.

Page 102 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Monti said he had decided to limit the order to Europe in deference to the  competition authorities of the United States and other countries, adding, We could legally have imposed explicitly a worldwide geographic scope, given the global nature of these markets. We have not done so. By going further than the U.S. Department of Justice in punishing  Microsoft, the European Commission is trying to build an image of being the toughest  antitrust regulator in the world. The sanctions eventually agreed to in Microsoft's settlement of the U.S. case are widely seen as being ineffectual.
According to some commentators, this is one reason why Monti decided to come down hard on
Microsoft.

Ironically, the remedies in the United States case against  Microsoft were so insubstantial that this probably added greater urgency in the European case, said a Washington-based  antitrust lawyer close to the Justice Department, who asked not to be named.

The antitrust problems in the European case emerged later than the issues dealt with in the United States. The Justice Department was investigating accusations that  Microsoft had effectively crushed the Internet browser Netscape by bundling in its own browser, Internet Explorer, into Windows. In the end, it settled with  Microsoft, allowing the company to escape with what many saw as only modest changes to the way it does business. The lawyer said that Justice's demands on  Microsoft were so weak, I wasn't surprised that the same problems continued after the U.S. case with newer technologies.

The part of the European case concerning Media Player is similar to that of Netscape, although the technology emerged later. By being found guilty of unfairly bundling again,  Microsoft has showed itself to be a repeat offender.

PARIS:

Proving that  Microsoft has a monopoly is not hard, and now regulators on two continents have agreed that it abuses that monopoly. But figuring out what to do about it is proving to be a daunting task for Europe, as it was for the United States after  Microsoft lost its antitrust trial there.

In the end, the risk to  Microsoft may not be that it will be forced to pay  fines as large as the 497 million, or $613 million, being sought by the  European Commission, or even to distribute a competitor's program, as it was reported to have agreed to do in ultimately unsuccessful settlement talks with the
commission. Instead, the risk is that  Microsoft is becoming the functional equivalent of an old-style utility, with extensive government regulation that could even extend into determining what products it sells and
at what prices.

There are worse fates than running a regulated monopoly. But such stocks are not the type that appeal to traditional technology investors, and the specter of such an outcome may be one thing that has been weighing on Microsoft's share price, which has underperformed the market badly over the past 18 months. For antitrust regulators, the heart of the problem is the changing nature of the personal
computer market. Consumers do want new features, as  Microsoft says, and they do want them bundled in. Any nonexpert who has ever tried to download and install a program would much rather have it done by someone else.

But Microsoft's pattern has been to wait for others to pioneer a computer application and then to put out its own program. If that program is eventually bundled as part of the operating system in all new Windows computers, the first arrival screams foul, but in the end  Microsoft wins.

Netscape pioneered Internet browsers but was left in the dust. RealNetworks, which led the way in music software, could face a similar fate. It is not easy to make money off a product that consumers must install themselves when the consumers already own  Microsoft's version, which comes already installed.

In the United States, a federal judge ruled in 2000 that  Microsoft had violated antitrust law and ordered it split in two, separating the operating system from the rest of the company. But that ruling was partly overturned on appeal, and the company later settled with the Justice Department on terms that left it free to pursue expansion of the operating system.

In an ideal world, decisions on which features to use would be made at an industry level where there is competition, such as the manufacturer level. Just as General Motors, Ford and other automakers deal with many of the same suppliers for everything from seats to transmissions, and choose which to put on any given model, Dell and Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers could decide among competing offerings from  Microsoft and other companies. The manufacturers would be competing, presumably, on the basis of functionality and price. The consumer would be able to buy machines with everything loaded on already, but different vendors would decide just what combination they wanted to offer and would do the work of integrating the programs.

But the fact is, that does not happen. To make that work,  Microsoft would have to be selling different versions of Windows, some with features bundled in and others without them. And their prices would have to be set at levels that made fair  competition possible.

There is, however, no clear way to do that, short of government regulation, utility-style. Mario Monti, the European Union's chief  antitrust regulator, sought a deal in which regulators would have a say in what was added to the operating system in the future, but  Microsoft was unwilling to give in. It is possible that when the commission issues its final decision Wednesday it will order such changes in addition to the fine, whose size was reported by people close to  Microsoft on Monday. The company has said it will appeal.

In the United States, efforts to get  competition in areas that were deemed natural monopolies have had a mixed record of success, at best. In the local telephone market, would-be competitors have had to go over local phone company lines, at prices set by regulators. There is a parallel in the personal computer industry, where those who seek to compete with systems that  Microsoft uses in its operating system must use the same operating system and can hope to be price-competitive only as a result of government intervention.

Microsoft has managed to fend off such moves in the past, and may do so again as the European case continues on appeal. But it will face renewals of such fights time and again, as innovations prompt protests from injured competitors. Such companies may be quite profitable and pay high dividends far better than the current  Microsoft payout of less than 1 percent but they do not get priced as growth stocks. Microsoft's sheer size makes exponential growth impossible anyway, but the notion of governments watching over every new  Microsoft innovation, prepared to challenge it if it seems unfair to some competitor, is a daunting one.

At $24.50,  Microsoft's most recent price, it is up just 11 percent from where it was when the stock market hit bottom on Oct. 9, 2002. Over that same period, the Standard &Poor's 500 is up 41 percent, and the Goldman Sachs software index has risen 80 percent.

Measuring from the bottom may seem unfair to  Microsoft, since it did not fall as far as many stocks did during the bear market and therefore had less lost ground to make up. But the fact is that over the past year, Microsoft has traded in a range of $23.60 to $30, a low-to-high difference of only 27 percent, the smallest range in Microsoft's history. And over that year, while most stocks have risen,  Microsoft is down 8 percent.

BRUSSELS:

Mario Monti has stalked plenty of big game in his five turbulent years as the European Union's chief antitrust enforcer. With his term in Brussels coming to an end this autumn, Monti's latest trophy, Microsoft, is without a doubt his biggest.

TD
The European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft, issued here Wednesday, brands the software developer as an abusive monopolist, and imposes remedies on the company that go much further than those negotiated between  Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department in 2001.

Brussels also hit Microsoft with a fine of 497 million, or $613 million, the largest it ever levied on a single company in an antitrust case. The money, both sides agree, pales in comparison to the message.

Europe continues to chart an aggressive course in regulating the behavior of big corporations, despite the more laissez-faire approach in the United States under the Bush administration, and despite a series of legal setbacks that many predicted would blunt Monti's hard-charging style.

It's hard to argue he's pulled his punches, said Joe Simons, a former head of the  competition bureau at the Federal Trade Commission.  Microsoft is about as big a thing as you can bite off.

For Monti, the  Microsoft case is a defining moment. It is also something of a bookend to the commission's landmark decision in 2001, blocking the $42 billion takeover of Honeywell by General Electric.

That decision, which came after bruising negotiations with GE's former chairman, Jack Welch, and despite intense pressure from Washington, brought Monti sudden notoriety. A Brussels bureaucrat had thwarted one of America's leading industrial empires.

Now, Monti, 61, has taken on arguably the leading American technology company, and again refused to settle, despite face-to- face negotiations last week with  Microsoft's chief executive, Steven Ballmer.

We wanted a settlement which would set clear principles concerning the future conduct of  Microsoft, to avoid going back to these sort of abuses, Monti said in an interview Wednesday. We had to realize that they were not prepared to do this. We had to agree that, on this point, we disagreed.

Critics said the ruling perpetuated the European Union's tendency to take a more restrictive approach to business.

There is still a broad gulf between  competition policy in Europe and the United States, said William Kolasky, a former  antitrust official in the Justice Department who had criticized the ruling on General Electric's planned takeover of Honeywell.


Page 106 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
European agencies come from a more corporatist perspective, Kolasky said. There really is less stomach in Europe for the kind of Darwinian  competition that we've embraced here.

Still, Kolasky noted that the  Microsoft case did not arouse the same invective from Washington as did the GE-Honeywell case. Partly, he said, that is because the Justice Department had already settled with Microsoft. Partly, it is because Washington is eager not to antagonize Brussels.

Microsoft said the commission's ruling would stifle innovation and deprive consumers of choices, since the company will be required to offer PC manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system, stripped of its multimedia software, Media Player.

Microsoft had offered to sell Windows with three rival PC media- player programs installed on it, which the company's general counsel, Brad Smith, said would have resulted in  Microsoft's distributing 300 million copies of competing programs a year for the next three years.

This gives consumers less value for their euros, Smith said about the commission ruling in a conference call with reporters. It is crystal clear that it would have been far more productive to reach a settlement last week.

Lawyers involved in the negotiations said they believed a settlement was within reach when Ballmer arrived in Brussels last Tuesday. But Monti insisted on provisions that would constrain  Microsoft from future behavior that would be similar to the issues raised by the Media Player.

Microsoft, said one lawyer, was absolutely astonished.
Still, he said, the company did not reject the demand outright. After two days of trying to close the gap,
Microsoft was not willing to expand the scope of the agreement enough to suit Monti.

Several lawyers speculated that Monti might have felt emboldened to take a tougher stance at the eleventh hour by the unanimous endorsement of his ruling by the European Union's member states.

I can't figure out any other explanation for it, except that he wanted to make a grand public gesture, said one lawyer close to Microsoft, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
By spurning a settlement with  Microsoft, Monti has probably bequeathed this case to his successor.
Microsoft plans to appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Monti seemed unconcerned about leaving behind unfinished business, saying that was inevitable in a big institution. Some of Monti's comfort may stem from the fact that, after a rocky period during which his staff came under criticism for inadequate and even slipshod legal work, the ruling has rebuilt its reputation.

After a European court overturned three of the commission's vetoes of mergers in 2002, Monti instituted sweeping changes recruiting a chief economist to analyze mergers from a business perspective, and appointing devil's advocates to cross-examine his staff's conclusions.
Monti's newfound caution was evident in the  Microsoft case, which stretched over five years.

He reacted well to his three defeats, Kolasky said. Hiring an economist, and giving him staff, has made the analysis more sophisticated. Merger reform is moving in the right direction.

Despite his reputation for confrontation, Monti adopted a penitent tone after the legal reversals, promising to learn from them. Some experts said the strategy probably saved his reputation.

The effect of the  European Commission antitrust ruling Wednesday against  Microsoft on the future of the global software business is likely to be greater than any immediate punishment the company may have to absorb. The  fine of 497.2 million, or $613 million, is pocket change for  Microsoft, which has
more than $50 billion in cash on hand. The sanctions requiring that  Microsoft offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and to divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows will likely have little near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays Internet music and movies.

And Microsoft executives declared there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.

TD
But the importance of the move is that after a decade of government investigation and litigation in the United States and Europe, the  European Commission is challenging Microsoft's fundamental business strategy of bundling new products to its Windows operating system, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.

The European ruling, if upheld, could leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts in future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. On its own, that might be seen as little more than a nuisance to Microsoft. Yet the ruling comes as other forces are loosening Microsoft's grip on computing. An antitrust settlement reached with the Bush administration three years ago gave personal computer makers more freedom to use and market software from Microsoft rivals. And  Microsoft faces not only  competition from Linux, an operating system that is distributed free, but also shifts in the marketplace as growth in technology is coming from beyond the
personal computer business: from the cellphone industry to Internet services like search, where Google is the early leader.

The significance of Europe is not the decision itself, but it adds to the other pressures on  Microsoft, said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school. To  Microsoft's critics and competitors, the bundling strategy is the essential anticompetitive strategy the company uses to protect and extend its monopoly, tying new products like a Web browser and a media player for music and video sent over the Internet onto Windows.  Microsoft sees a new product and says, 'We were about to invent that, too,' comes up with its version and bundles the software into Windows, said Timothy Bresnahan, a professor
at Stanford University who was chief economist for the  antitrust division of the Justice Department in the Clinton administration. It's bundled into Windows, and the early leader in some promising new technology is bundled out of the market. It's an innovation tax that is a problem for society.

That strategy was at the center of the federal  antitrust suit in the United States, filed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. The suit, joined by several states, alleged that  Microsoft engaged in a variety of anticompetitive tactics, including tying, to stifle  competition from the commercial pioneer in the browser market, Netscape Communications.  Microsoft lost the case, but a federal appeals court said the tying charge should be reconsidered. The Bush administration decided not to revisit the tying claim and settled with Microsoft in 2001.

Microsoft contends that putting new things into Windows is good for consumers, even if it is bad for some competitors. It was to defend its bundling strategy that  Microsoft refused to settle in eleventh-hour negotiations with the Justice Department in 1998, and the issue over which settlement talks broke down in Brussels last week.

For Microsoft, the immovable line in the sand is its right to add whatever it wants to its dominant product, Windows. We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products in the interests
of consumers, Steven Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters. We are protecting the fundamental principle of innovation.

Microsoft executives believe that after its competitors lost the bundling issue in the United States, they sought a more sympathetic audience in Europe, which has often proved to be more willing than Washington to place restrictions on dominant companies.

This was the core issue during several years of judicial review in the United States, Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. The irony is that in Europe the claimants were the very same American companies that had their day in court in the United States.

Europe Tells  Microsoft To Change A Key Way The Company Operates Abused Its "Near Monopoly' Big antitrust ruling claims software maker squeezing rivals out of some sectors.

With a record  fine and tough sanctions, Europe's regulators have emphasized that they believe Microsoft Corp.'s practice of bundling new applications within its Windows operating system - which the company says is a key to its business - violates  antitrust laws.

TD
The European Union's top  antitrust authority, the  European Commission, Wednesday  fined         Microsoft $613 million and demanded changes in how the firm does business. The commission
said Microsoft abused its "near monopoly" with Windows to squeeze rivals in the markets for media player software and work group server operating systems.

It ordered  Microsoft to sell a separate version of Windows that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, software used to play music and video. It also said  Microsoft must take steps to let other firms' servers work better with Windows PCs by "disclosing" some of its software code.

Microsoft executives sharply criticized the ruling. They say it benefits a small number of rivals, but not consumers. Those competitors include server maker Sun Microsystems Inc. and media software firm RealNetworks Inc.

Microsoft said it will appeal, a process that could last four or five years. It will seek a stay of the
EU's sanctions.

Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith, in a conference call with reporters, called the EU's moves a "step in the wrong direction." The EU ignored the existing  antitrust settlement between  Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department and showed "little regard" for the U.S. court proceedings, he said.

The U.S. case dealt with Microsoft using its Windows PC operating system to crush rivals in the Web browser market. Microsoft bundled its Internet Explorer browser with Windows, much like it does the media player. But the U.S. ultimately decided not to challenge  Microsoft's right to bundle application software. The courts signaled that the government was unlikely to win on that front.
On the conference call,  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said he hopes the company and
EU can resume settlement talks. Talks broke down last week.

Ballmer said the proposal  Microsoft made during those negotiations would have better served consumers. Microsoft had agreed to include three rival media players with Windows, he said.

Removing the Windows Media Player would disable 20 functions in Windows, Smith said. Some software products from others also wouldn't function, he said.

The Redmond, Wash., software king believes important principles are at stake in the EU case and intends to defend them, Smith said.

Some analysts agree that the anti-bundling ruling would set a bad precedent. "If they can get the media player removed, who's to say another competitor who's ticked off at  Microsoft could get something else removed?" asked Jason Kraft, an analyst with A.G. Edwards.
Page 110 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Consumers have come to expect new features and applications in Windows, said Ken Kiarash, an analyst with Buckingham Research. It would be difficult to decide which features  Microsoft can include and which it can't, he said. "Maybe they should take out the calculator built into Windows as well," he quipped.

The next generation of Windows, code-named Longhorn and due out in 2006, is expected to have new integrated applications such as an Internet search engine, security software and more digital media features, analysts say.

With $53 billion in cash,  Microsoft could pay the EU  fine. But the company is worried about the precedent established by the sanctions.
The disclosure order amounts to a "compulsory license" of intellectual property, Smith said. Analysts said  Microsoft's legal problems will continue to be a drag on its stock, which has slogged
through four years of decline or flat trading. Shares are off nearly 60% from an all-time high of 59.97
reached in December 1999. Its shares have an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 8, meaning 92% of
publicly traded companies have outperformed it in the last year.

The stock could get a boost if the company distributes some of its cash to shareholders in increased dividends, Kraft said. "That's one of the key catalysts to get the stock going," Kraft said.

Analysts expect  Microsoft to come up with a plan to distribute the surplus by mid-July, when it holds its annual analyst meeting.

Meanwhile, many analysts expect  Microsoft will try to work out a more favorable settlement. "It's going to stretch on for a while," Kraft said. "If it plays out, this could be settled in '09. I think it behooves everybody to settle (now)."

In a landmark bid to shake  Microsoft Corp.'s stranglehold on the personal-computer industry, European Union regulators slapped the software titan with tough sanctions aimed directly at its treasured business model and designed to influence its future behavior in the marketplace.

The European Commission, judging that  Microsoft was abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips, ordered the company to reveal code from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals' competing server software. Unless Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with the disclosure requirement.

In the other major part of the penalties,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer PC makers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play audio and video.

The European Commission signaled it would keep up the pressure on  Microsoft, saying the company's "illegal behavior is still ongoing." It also warned that it remains concerned about  Microsoft's "general business model," saying that it "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take an interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

The EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, also  fined Microsoft $612.7 million, a record against a single company. Still,  Microsoft has more than $50 billion in cash and short-term investments, making any  fine less important than the other orders to modify its business model.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and doesn't harm consumers and innovation," Mr. Monti said. He denied his orders violated  Microsoft's intellectual-property rights and called his moves "proportionate" and "balanced."

Microsoft said it will appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance, saying the decision oversteps
European and international law.  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, made it clear the company plans
to use laws regarding the protection of intellectual property as the foundation of its appeal of the
commission's ruling and for a stay of its orders.

The company contends the disclosures about information related to server software amount to an improper form of compulsory licensing, which he compared to ordering a movie studio to give competitors its scripts.  Microsoft has 70 days to ask judges to freeze and eventually overturn the decision.

Antitrust experts say the company has a fighting chance to win that order for a stay -- particularly if judges share Microsoft's fears that the commission's ruling represents a threat to intellectual-property protection in Europe.

In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, condemned the commission's action. Claiming that Europe's economies were stagnant because of huge debt, taxes and crippling business regulation in Brussels, Mr. Frist said: "Now, the  European Commission has taken aim at  Microsoft, a company whose products and technology have been engines of global economic growth."
The ranking Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, hailed the
ruling as offering "significant steps to protect competition in this vitally important industry." But he also
raised concern about diverging U.S. and EU regulatory policy.

R. Hewitt Pate, the Justice Department  antitrust chief, said the commission's demand that a Windows version be offered without the media player went too far. "Imposing `code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences," he said. "Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by `dominant' companies." But he added that U.S.-European  antitrust cooperation remained "strong and positive."

Microsoft competitors RealNetworks Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. praised the decision and said it gave them a much fairer chance in the market. Both companies led the anti-Microsoft campaign in Europe. "The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' vice president and general counsel.

Lee Patch, a Sun vice president of public affairs, challenged Microsoft's basis for appeal, saying intellectual-property laws don't necessarily trump rules governing antitrust law.

Mr. Monti, the competition commissioner, spent much of yesterday defending a decision that goes far beyond what Microsoft agreed to in a 2001 settlement with the Bush administration in a similar case. Mr. Monti said he could have imposed a  fine on Microsoft's global sales but refrained "in deference" to regulators in different parts of the world, including the U.S.

Europe's case against  Microsoft dates to 1998, when Sun accused the company of withholding code that enables smooth connections between its servers and  Microsoft-powered PCs. Yesterday, EU regulators upheld those charges, but said  Microsoft can charge "reasonable remuneration" for sharing its interfaces.

In 2001, the commission expanded the case to investigate  Microsoft's power over multimedia software, where the company's Media Player program competes against RealNetworks' RealPlayer product. As part of yesterday's ruling, the commission said  Microsoft can't offer a discount to induce PC makers to use Windows with Media Player, but the commission didn't require a discount on Windows without the software, as some observers expected.

The earlier U.S. case also focused on the concept of bundling, but was largely prompted by Microsoft's actions in selling its Internet Explorer Web browser with Windows. An overriding philosophical concern in both cases is whether government should limit the features a dominant company can add to its products. In the case of Media Player, the commission argued that  Microsoft's inclusion of the software with Windows amounted to an illegal "tying" action that hurt competitors and deterred the development of products that could help consumers.

Microsoft long has argued that it should be able to add almost any feature to Windows for the purpose of product improvement. To address the commission's concerns, the company in settlement talks proposed including three competing media-player programs with Windows.  Microsoft's Mr. Smith argued that stripping Media Player out of Windows will cause parts of the operating system not to work properly and will affect other software products and Web sites designed to work with Media Player.

EU regulators are pursuing separate investigations as to whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, such as hand-held computers and smart phones. They also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer-hardware makers to agree to unfair technology-licensing terms.

Taking on a Titan

The
European Commission concluded a five-year investigation by ruling
Microsoft violated European Union antitrust law.

Page 115 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
THE FINDING:
-- "Microsoft abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft work group servers, and by tying its Windows Media Player, a product where it faced competition,
with its ubiquitous Windows operating system." THE FINE:
-- $612.9 million based on "very serious abuses" for five and a half
years.

WHAT'S NEXT:
-- Within 120 days, Microsoft must disclose information that will allow non-Microsoft servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers.
-- Within 90 days, Microsoft must offer PC manufacturers a version of
Windows without Media Player. It also must refrain from making such versions less attractive.
-- Microsoft has 70 days to appeal the order.

(EDS: UPDATING WITH COMMISSIONER MONTI'S COMMENTS)

The European Union (EU) decided Wednesday to  fine Microsoft Corp. a record 497.2 million euros for abusing its market dominance in the way it sells its Windows operating systems.

TD
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, also ordered the U.S. software giant to sell a European version of its Windows operating system by detaching the popular Media Player program within 90 days.

"The Commission has taken a decision today which finds that  Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe. This is not a decision that we have taken easily or hastily," Mario Monti, the commissioner in charge of  competition, told a press conference.
The fine, which is equivalent to 65 billion yen, is the largest ever imposed on a single company by
European regulators.

Monti said the decision came after five years of investigation and intense debate within his department and consultations with the 15 member states and law and economics experts.

The commission concluded that  Microsoft's sale of the Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating system runs counter to fair  competition.

The ruling follows last week's failure to settle the landmark  antitrust case between the commission and Microsoft. Microsoft has to pay the  fine within three months.
Relying on the European market for 30% of its sales,  Microsoft has said it will file an appeal with the
Court of First Instance in a bid to nullify the ruling.

"We are not expropriating  Microsoft's intellectual property," Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said the decision came after five years of investigation and intense debate within his department and consultations with the 15 member states and law and economics experts.

In response to the decision,  Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said, "We worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European Commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers."

Brad Smith, senior vice president of  Microsoft, also said, "We believe that the commission's decision would actually reduce consumer choice and hurt European software developers."

The commission concluded that  Microsoft's sale of the Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating system runs counter to fair  competition.

As a remedy, the commission suggests the complete disclosure for the protocols necessary for its competitors' server products to be able to "talk" on an equal footing with Windows PCs.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director George Tenet said Wednesday both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations seriously took the threat posed by the al-Qaida terror network.

"There was no lack of care of focus in the face of one of the greatest dangers our country has ever faced," Tenet said in testimony before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, known as the 9-11 Commission.
-U.N. Security Council 'strongly' back mission to Iraq

NEW YORK - The United Nations Security Council issued a statement Wednesday welcoming and "strongly" supporting U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's decision to send a mission to Iraq to lend support for the formation of an interim government.
The panel also called on "all parties in Iraq to fully cooperate" with Annan's special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi and other U.N. delegates to Baghdad.

SAN JOSE, March 24 (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) competitors see a glimmer of hope in the European Commission's ruling on Wednesday to change the way that new features are bundled into Windows, but analysts caution that such a fundamental shift may be far off or never happen at all.

The world's largest software maker was told by European Union regulators to pay a 497 million euro ($606 million) fine, decouple Windows Media Player from the Windows operating system and provide information on how its server software for networked computers works.

TD
RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK.O), which makes the digital media software at the heart of the EC's ruling, applauded the EC decision, with deputy general counsel Dave Stewart calling the decision "fundamentally significant because the Commission has clearly ruled that  Microsoft's strategy of bundling Windows Media Player into its software is illegal."
Yet the reaction among some of  Microsoft's competitors fell well short of jubilation.

Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW.O), a longtime Microsoft adversary in the market for servers, said it wasn't sure whether Wednesday's ruling would help competition or its own ongoing  antitrust case against Microsoft.

"All of those are things that need to get resolved before we're going to be able to say anything definitive about what we're going to do based upon this momentary decision," Sun vice president of legal affairs Lee Patch said.

Analysts point out that the U.S. government's  antitrust case over Netscape ultimately resulted in a settlement allowing  Microsoft to keep the Internet Explorer Web browser as part of Windows. Netscape now has a minimal presence in that market.

Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who is leading Microsoft's charge into new markets, said in a conference call that the EC's decision not to settle with Microsoft was a "much riskier course of litigation" for Europe.
"We believe we should have the ability to improve our products," Ballmer told reporters.

When settlement talks broke down last week, legal experts noted that  Microsoft was essentially adopting the same strategy it did with the U.S. Department of Justice, by duking it out with authorities in courts and waiting for a more favorable political climate to reach a settlement.
LOOMING TRADE WAR?

In the U.S. capital, lawmakers were quick to come to  Microsoft's defense, saying they would protest the EC's decision.

"I now fear that the U.S. and the EU are heading toward a new trade war - and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee, said.

Page 122 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
If the EC's decision prevails in what is expected to be a lengthy court battle in European courts, that would create a precedent making it difficult for  Microsoft to bundle other features into its operating system software products.

"That's what  Microsoft is really worried about," said Matt Rosoff, analyst at Directions on  Microsoft, an independent research firm based in Kirkland, Washington.

Indeed, the breakdown in settlement talks between Ballmer and EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti last week hinged on whether  Microsoft would agree on general rules over software bundling for future disputes.

"That's why Monti was pressing so hard for a general rule," said Rosoff. "They were almost ready to reach a settlement until this issue over future rules came up."

At stake in future disputes could be any of the software market segments where  Microsoft is hoping to make inroads, ranging from database and mobile phone software to speech software and applications for small and medium-sized businesses.

Oracle Corp. (ORCL.O) another  Microsoft competitor in the database software market, declined to comment on Wednesday.

Still, security software vendors - which provide security software that could potentially be bundled into Windows - saw their shares rally on Wednesday on the view that the EC ruling would protect them from any potential  Microsoft moves in the future.

Symantec Corp. , best known for its Norton antivirus and firewall products, rose as much as 4.7 percent and RSA Security Inc. (RSAS.O), which sells network security software, soared 7.6 percent, both on
the Nasdaq.

Microsoft Monopoly Fine Of Eur497m

Software giant Microsoft is facing the highest penalty ever to be imposed on a company by the EU, following the European Commission's decision to punish the company for alleged  abuse of its Windows monopoly. The Eur497m fine could still be revised as the company will appeal, saying that since the case sets precedent, it was unaware it was breaking  competition law.

LP
The European Commission’s decision to fine Microsoft US$612m for monopolist behaviour hardly amounts to a serious blow against the world’s largest software company. With cash reserves of more than US$50bn, the company can easily afford to pay up. Despite  Microsoft's enormous financial strength, however, the Commission’s decision casts a distinct shadow over its future growth prospects.

TD
First, the ruling is likely to influence a number of similar cases pending against  Microsoft. The company successfully settled an  antitrust action brought by the US government in November 2001, so it had high hopes that it could do the same with the European Union (EU). Indeed, as late as last week  Microsoft was still proposing settlement options. Instead, after four years of investigations, Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, found the company in violation of  antitrust law by failing to give rivals the
information they needed to compete fairly in the market for server software. He also accused  Microsoft of stifling  competition in the market for so-called media player software, which is used to play video and music.

Although the company intends to appeal the decision, it now seems likely that Mr Monti’s ruling can only result in further legal losses for the company in other venues. These may or may not result in  fines, but cumulatively they will damage the company’s reputation around the world. For example, the EU is also examining complaints that  Microsoft is using its Windows XP system to extend the company's dominance in new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones. In the US,  Microsoft is still awaiting a US appeals court ruling on whether the settlement it reached with the government in 2001 was proper. It is
also facing a lawsuit in Minnesota which alleges the company overcharged customers between 1994 and
2001. Apart from government actions, Microsoft is also being sued by RealNetworks, the software
company the EU said was the victim of Microsoft's uncompetitive behaviour in Europe.

Pressures are building in Asia as well. In February Japanese government officials raided  Microsoft's offices on suspicion of monopolistic practices. In particular, the government is investigating complaints that the company attached restrictive conditions to its sales of software to computer makers. Although
Microsoft says it no longer engages in such activities, it is co-operating with authorities. In the wake of the
EU's decision, it now seems clear that many more such cases will be emerging around the world.
Trouble ahead

At the heart of  Microsoft’s anti-competitive behaviour, according to the Commission, is its practice of "bundling" new products into its dominant operating system, guaranteeing an instant market for those products. Because the price of the new software is hidden in the cost of a new computer, critics assert, consumers can't compare the product with the  competition. As Microsoft controls 94% of the market for personal computer (PC) operating systems globally, the process is akin to automakers specifying in-house brand of CD player for all their cars. The Commission, in response, has ruled that  Microsoft must make
its Windows software in two versions--with its media player and without.

This poses a real dilemma for the company: it must now decide whether to design the next version of Windows, dubbed Longhorn and due in 2006, with integrated extras or forego them. Given that Microsoft’s sales growth has slowed recently, the company has high hopes for Longhorn. But if the product is eventually released without the extras that consumers have come to expect from Windows, it may not be well received. In essence, bundling allowed computer buyers to think they were receiving something for nothing, since the cost of the extra software was buried in the price of the PC. The result,

Page 129 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
however, is that  Microsoft has trained consumers to believe that programs like its Windows Media Player essentially are free.

While the Commission’s recent ruling forces the company to unbundle its wares in Europe,  Microsoft could face a backlash from consumers elsewhere who have come to depend on the bundled extras. That could mean selling different versions of its product in different markets--in effect, building integrated and unintegrated versions of Longhorn, which will be costly and time consuming. And if the company is forced to bundle its rivals' products with its own, it will lose sales.

The Longhorn problem is not a minor one. Over the past 18 months,  Microsoft has been losing sales to the competing open-source Linux operating system--Microsoft has admitted that licensing renewals have fallen off in recent months. This fact, and the company’s mounting legal hassles, has caught the attention of Wall Street, which has sent the company’s shares down. Over the past six months,  Microsoft's stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 by 23%. Over the past 12 months, while the share prices of most technology companies have been rising,  Microsoft's has dropped by 8% .

Microsoft has also lost its position as the world’s most valuable company, as measured by market capitalisation. It handed the crown to General Electric (GE) at the end of the third quarter last year and is now the world’s third most valuable company, trailing GE and Exxon Mobil. As of mid-March, it was just barely ahead of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company. Given its parsimonious approach to paying out dividends, on the one hand, and its growing business and legal worries, on the other,  Microsoft’s
stock--both in terms of equity and reputation--could have further to fall.

The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) expressed concern over the penalties imposed on  Microsoft March 24 by the European Commission, including largest  fine in antitrust history, but said the United States "will continue to work constructively with the EC to develop sound antitrust enforcement policies that benefit consumers on both sides of the Atlantic."

TD
In addition to the  fine, the European Commission also ordered Microsoft to disclose certain system information to competitors and release a version of its Windows Operating System without the Windows Media Player.

"It is significant that the U.S. district court considered and rejected a similar remedy in the U.S. litigation," DOJ said in a press release.

The European Commission's actions "may produce unintended consequences. Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies," DOJ said.
"Notwithstanding today's divergence [in  antitrust enforcement approaches], it is important to emphasize
the overall strong and positive relationship between the U.S. and the EC on matters of  competition policy,"
the press release concluded.

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ANTITRUST, R. HEWITT PATE, ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE EC'S DECISION IN ITS MICROSOFT INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- R. Hewitt Pate, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, issued the following statement today after the  European Commission announced its order that Microsoft disclose certain information to competitors, offer for sale a version of its Windows Operating System that does not contain the Windows Media Player, and pay a  fine of 497 million euros (about $613 million):

"The United States filed a complaint against  Microsoft in 1998, alleging that  Microsoft had restrained competition in violation of U.S.  antitrust laws. A lengthy trial and appeal confirmed that  Microsoft had violated the Sherman Act, though the court of appeals rejected the breakup remedy the U.S. had advocated and disapproved certain aspects of the district court's theory of liability.

Following the remand of the case, the United States reached a settlement, embodied in a Final Judgment, which was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the district court.

"The United States' Final Judgment provides clear and effective protection for competition and consumers by preventing affirmative misconduct by  Microsoft that would inhibit competition in 'middleware'
programs, such as the web browser that was the subject of the United States' lawsuit and the media player that is the subject of the EC's action today. The Final Judgment, for example, prohibits the use by Microsoft of exclusive contracts or other provisions that inhibit competition, prohibits anticompetitive manipulation of icons and default settings, and requires Microsoft to provide information to allow

Page 131 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
'interoperability' of competitors' software. The United States continues to be active in its enforcement of Microsoft's compliance with the Final Judgment, and this work has resulted in substantial changes to Microsoft's business practices.

"The EC has today pursued a different enforcement approach by imposing a 'code removal' remedy to resolve its media player concerns. The U.S. experience tells us that the best  antitrust remedies eliminate impediments to the healthy functioning of competitive markets without hindering successful competitors or imposing burdens on third parties, which may result from the EC's remedy. A requirement of 'code removal' was not at any time - including during the period when the U.S. was seeking a breakup of  Microsoft prior
to the rejection of that remedy by the court of appeals - part of the United States' proposed remedy.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing 'code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences. Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies. A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it.
It is significant that the U.S. district court considered and rejected a similar remedy in the U.S. litigation. "While the imposition of a civil fine is a customary and accepted aspect of EC  antitrust enforcement, it is
unfortunate that the largest antitrust fine ever levied will now be imposed in a case of unilateral
competitive conduct, the most ambiguous and controversial area of  antitrust enforcement. For this  fine to
surpass even the fines levied against members of the most notorious price fixing cartels may send an
unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities.

"With respect to the EC's 'interoperability' remedy, which requires Microsoft to license technologies used by Microsoft server software to communicate with other Microsoft software on a network, there is considerably more overlap with the United States' approach. Like the U.S. decree, the EC decision appears to focus on providing competing software developers with the opportunity to build products that communicate and interoperate with Windows-based PCs. The details of the EC's requirements on this point remain to be seen, and we look forward to examining them.

"Notwithstanding today's divergence, it is important to emphasize the overall strong and positive relationship between the U.S. and the EC on matters of  competition policy. The continued success of this working relationship is particularly important in the context of global markets, where the sale and use of products stretch across borders. The Justice Department will continue to work constructively with the EC to develop sound antitrust enforcement policies that benefit consumers on both sides of the Atlantic."

HD      Microsoft Plans Two-Pronged Attack  To European Ruling

Microsoft is likely to mount a two-track attack on the European Union's  antitrust ruling against the firm,
Microsoft and other legal officials said after the decision.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday that the company will appeal the decision by the competition commission, an EU administrative body, to the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance. The firm also will seek to halt enforcement of the directive, which would impose a record  fine and require Microsoft to offer, within 90 days, a version of the Windows computer-operating system that does not include media-playing software.

TD
Microsoft also will try to persuade U.S. officials to register a complaint at the World Trade Organization on grounds that the decision violates European obligations under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs),  Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said.

Because only governments, and not individual companies, can file complaints to the WTO,  Microsoft's possible second-track attack could put pressure on the Bush administration to take a decisive stance on an issue that most American policymakers believed was settled.

U.S. Justice Department officials reacted negatively to the EU decision, which would impose stricter penalties on Microsoft than those of U.S. courts. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) speaks for the government in WTO matters, but an agency spokeswoman said Justice is taking lead on the Microsoft matter.

USTR complaints to the WTO normally address national trade barriers or individual countries' intellectual property laws deemed inadequate under TRIPs. Further complicating the matter, the European Union is not a WTO member, even though all nations within the union are.

Smith said the EU decision "amounts to a compulsory license of our copyright, which gives us the exclusive right to create an adaptation of the Windows product."

Because the penalty calls for mandatory changes to Windows, Smith said, "We're being ordered to create a derivative work that the  European Commission is designing instead." A  Microsoft spokesman said that demand violates Articles 13 and 15 of TRIPs.

The ruling also would require  Microsoft to disclose proprietary information that lets software competitors create products that work with Windows desktop software within 120 days. The EU also imposed a $613 million fine.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing 'code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences," Assistant Attorney General R. Hewitt Pate, chief of Justice's antitrust division, said in a statement.

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies," Pate continued. "A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

Pate also criticized the severity of the  fine. "It is unfortunate that the largest  antitrust fine ever levied will now be imposed in a case of unilateral competitive conduct, the most ambiguous and controversial area
of antitrust enforcement," he said. "For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the

Software giant  Microsoft was fined a record £331m by the European Commission yesterday after a four-year probe - a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft's sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm's Media Player programme. The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by "bundling" its own software and other services with its Windows system.

TD
That made it difficult for other software makers to compete - particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy. It worked - more than 90pc of personal computers worldwide run on Microsoft software.

But Microsoft is now seeking suspension of the Commission's order while it appeals the  fine and a final verdict could take five years.

The company, owned by the world's richest man Bill Gates, was also told to reveal the secrets of its
Windows software.

TD
Euro chiefs told  Microsoft to change how it operates to restore  competition in the software market.

Microsoft is used on 95 of every 100 personal computers in the world.

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe."

He said the company created less choice and higher prices, and broke EU rules by "bundling" software with its Windows system.

It was also accused of withholding technical information to stop rivals developing products that work with Microsoft.

Under the ruling, similar to one in the US,  Microsoft must now sell Windows without Media Player, a music and video player.

Microsoft has Pounds 29BILLION in the bank but is set to appeal, claiming the move will cut customer choice.

BRUSSELS

The European Union slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a $613-million US  fine yesterday for abusing its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond a U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

TD
Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered," and said it would ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal.

The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behaviour because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behaviour is still ongoing."

It gave the company 90 days to offer European computer manufacturers a version of Windows stripped of the company's digital media player, software for viewing video and listening to music that is
expected to become pivotal in the industry as multimedia content becomes more pervasive.

The EU also gave  Microsoft 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," EU  antitrust chief Mario Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market.

Microsoft, which had $32 billion US in revenue last year, does about 20 per cent of its business in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said he would ask the presiding judge at the European Court of First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.
"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," he said. The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the
company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser now in private practice.

Others noted, however, that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors, such as the danger they could go out of business.
And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.
"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals,
"how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, of the Herbert Smith law firm in
Brussels.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union has slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a 497 million euro ($807.6 million Canadian) fine for abusing its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the U.S. antitrust settlement.

"We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

But the U.S. justice department's  antitrust chief said the huge  fine, the equivalent of $603 million (U.S.), was "unfortunate" and other sanctions against the company could have "unintended consequences."

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies," Assistant Attorney-General Hewitt Pate said.

"A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not  competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, a business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Monti called the ruling "proportionate" and "balanced," noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition."
He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints pending against
Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision," he said.
But Bill Frist, majority leader in the U.S. Senate, said the ruling was "preposterous."

"I now fear that the U.S. and the EU are heading toward a new trade war - and that the commission's ruling against  Microsoft is the first shot," he said.

Chairman Bill Gates unveiled on Wednesday  Microsoft Corp.'s latest foray into business computing with Speech Server 2004 and an updated version of its software for mobile phones. The world's largest software maker has been expanding its product offerings as it targets a wider base of business customers, but its efforts so far have been overshadowed by the wide reach of its Windows, Office and server software for networked computers. "There's a huge range of scenarios that this new speech capability will be used for," Gates told an audience of developers at a conference in San Francisco.

TD
Gates made no reference to Wednesday's decision by the  European Commission to pay a record 497 million euro ($606 million)  fine for violating EU  antitrust law and to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers a fairer chance to compete "because the illegal behaviour is still going on." Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft's new Speech Server, based on natural language recognition technology developed over the past several years, is a software platform for networked computers that allows other software developers to create programs tailored to their needs. The No. 1 use of speech server technology is expected to be for companies setting up call centres with automated voice and
touch-tone menus to provide customers service,  Microsoft said. Information technology departments are also expected to use the speech server to provide internal support functions, such as password resetting and help for computer users. In addition,  Microsoft unveiled an updated version of its cell phone software, called Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition, which adds features such as better screen management and resolution, as well as support for phones with built-in keyboards. Gates also unveiled new software releases of  Microsoft's tools for other software developers to create programs that run on top of its Windows and server software products. "We don't' see ourselves backing off in terms of large
research and development investments in these areas," Gates said.  Microsoft has also been trying to get more wireless carriers and mobile phone manufacturers to use its cell phone software. Although it says 37 handset maker are developing phones with  Microsoft software, only Motorola Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. offer phones in the United States featuring Windows Mobile. "We are certainly at the early stage of the market and an industry that is beginning to accept us more and more," said Ed Suwanjindar, lead product manager for  Microsoft's mobile and embedded software group.

HD         Regulators want Microsoft to pull media player out

BRUSSELS -- European  antitrust regulators slammed Microsoft on Wednesday with far-reaching sanctions that could force the world's largest software maker to alter the way it does business globally.

The European Commission ruled that Microsoft abused its monopoly of the Windows operating system, which runs 94% of PCs. As a remedy, it fined Microsoft a record $613 million and placed restrictions on the sale of two key  Microsoft products: media players and midsize computer servers.

TD
Yet Europe's boldest stroke may be in establishing a basis for dealing with  Microsoft in the future. Whether the company absorbs Europe's sanctions without missing a beat -- or is forced to make major adjustments -- will play out in the months ahead.

Mario Monti, head of the commission's  antitrust division, raised the stakes by insisting that the remedy include mechanisms that could allow the commission to dictate how  Microsoft may sell other current and future products in Europe.

Monti said in an interview that he believes it is "crucial" for  antitrust regulators to have a framework to deal with fast-changing technology markets. "That is one reason why . . . we have introduced principles which will be able to clarify the handling, in the future, of similar issues."

The U.S. Department of Justice won a similar case against  Microsoft in 1999. But an initial order to split Microsoft into two companies was reversed. U.S. sanctions imposed against  Microsoft were widely viewed as ineffectual.

The Justice Department's  antitrust chief said Wednesday that the huge  fine European regulators imposed on Microsoft was "unfortunate" and other sanctions against the company could have "unintended consequences."

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by dominant companies," Assistant Attorney General Hewitt Pate said in a statement.

Europe's ruling presents  Microsoft with a new set of legal and strategic obstacles. Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said the company will ask an appeals court to suspend "many or perhaps all" of the sanctions. He said the appeal could take "four or five years."
"We think today's decision is a step in the wrong direction," he said. Consensus in Europe

It was not a step taken in haste. Monti, who has been investigating  Microsoft for five years, surveyed European PC users to gather evidence of how  Microsoft's business practices hurt them. The remedies, first proposed in August, have undergone extensive review by high-ranking officials in the European Union's 15 member states.
Page 143 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We did not rush to a decision," Monti said. "In the end, we decided to do what's best for innovation and
European consumers."

Microsoft is expected to file its appeal with Europe's Court of First Instance within 70 days and ask the court to postpone the implementation of sanctions. The court could rule on the request for a delay in days or weeks.

If denied, the company will have 90 days to offer PC makers a separate version of Windows that does not have its Windows Media Player tied in. The software is used to play video and music. PC makers can then decide whether to ship new PCs with competing media players from RealNetworks, Apple Computer and others.

Within 120 days,  Microsoft will also have to reveal technical information that will help rivals such as Sun Microsystems and IBM design server software that can tie together Windows PCs in corporate settings. Server computers allow PC users to log into a secured network to do tasks such as share files and print documents.

Last week,  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer flew to Brussels to negotiate a settlement. He offered to carry as many as three rival media players in all new Windows PCs but refused to supply a version of Windows without a  Microsoft player. "There's an important principle at stake," Ballmer said Wednesday. "We believe every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers."
Cloudy future for bundling

However, Monti told USA TODAY that he was intent on establishing a "framework" for limiting Microsoft from abusing its Windows monopoly. He said negotiations broke down when  Microsoft would "not agree on making commitments for their future conduct."

Monti sought to leave open the possibility of relating the findings in the media player and server case to a probe launched in January 2003 into allegations that  Microsoft illegally bundled its Outlook e-mail program, an instant-messaging service and a moviemaking application in Windows XP.

Microsoft has also widely promoted its plan to bundle a search engine, voice-activation and collaboration software in the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, expected by 2006.

If Europe's sanctions hold up in court -- and if the result is accelerated competition in the media player market -- the commission would have a precedent for monitoring how Microsoft bundles other programs into Windows.

Microsoft will now argue before Europe's Court of First Instance that Monti's reasoning is "ill-founded" and unreasonably conflicts with the U.S. Justice Department's remedies for similar  antitrust abuses, says Smith.

"The problem is it creates a conflicting framework, and we now have dueling approaches on opposite sides of the Atlantic," Smith said in an interview.

Under Monti's guidelines, the commission will also keep an eye on whether  Microsoft does enough with future products to let rival server software operate with Windows PCs. That finding went beyond what Sun Microsystems sought in filing the original server complaint and came as a pleasant surprise to Microsoft's rival. "It is explicitly future looking," says Lee Patch, Sun's general counsel.

Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a trade group made up of Microsoft's rivals, said the ruling was built on "tried-and-true" legal principles. "The commission didn't use novel theory, because they wanted to have a strong case that can stand up to appeal," said Black.

PC makers could be the first to feel the impact of the ruling should  Microsoft be forced to supply a stripped-down version of Windows, for which it may have to charge $45, instead of $50, a copy. That could help boost sales for manufacturers of low-end PCs, says IDC PC analyst Roger Kay.
"Let's say a stripped-down version of Windows costs $5 less (than a regular version)," Kay says. PC
makers shave pennies wherever they can, he says. " For them, $5 is a fortune."

PC makers have already shown they are open to breaking from  Microsoft. Hewlett-Packard, for instance, recently made Apple's iTunes music player standard on some models, along with Windows Media Player.
No. 1 PC maker Dell is "studying our options," says spokesman Venancio Figueroa. Dell's PCs in the
USA already ship with two media players -- one from  Microsoft, one from RealNetworks.
Page 144 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
RealNetworks general counsel Bob Kimball said the ruling should open more doors with PC makers. "We think the playing field will be more level," he says.

While Europe's sanctions apply only there, it could lead to PC makers asking  Microsoft to make stripped-down versions of Windows available elsewhere. And as  Microsoft discloses technical information about its server software, competitors can use that knowledge to compete globally, not just in Europe, analysts say.

Microsoft will try to limit the effects of any sanctions.

"If we don't get relief in court, then we'll have different approaches in Europe than in the rest of the world," says Smith. "It sends a very unhappy message to the global business community, that even if
the U.S. government spends five years sorting something out, the  European Commission will feel free to step in after the fact and turn things upside down."

Microsoft's supporters characterized the ruling as bad for consumers. "By using the guise of  antitrust concerns, European regulators can cripple American business, allowing European firms to catch up," says Sonia Arrison, director of technical studies at the Pacific Research Institute, a public policy think tank.

Robert Levy, a senior fellow at public policy research foundation Cato Institute, called the ruling "a corporate welfare program for market losers."

HD           Antitrust czar uses cerebral tactics

SEATTLE -- Europe's  antitrust czar is a dignified Italian economics professor who has quietly emerged as the world's leading  antitrust watchdog.

Known for his bold enforcement actions, silver-haired Mario Monti, 61, studied at Yale before moving to Brussels in 1999 to become the  European Commission's competition commissioner.

TD
He earned the nickname Super Mario by methodically striking down anti-competitive cartels, subsidies and mergers, applying economic principles and established  antitrust law.

Prior to his showdown with Microsoft, Monti was perhaps best known for blocking GE's $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell, after U.S. antitrust regulators had blessed it. Monti had his arguments ready when GE's then-CEO Jack Welch flew to Brussels to dissuade him from blocking the merger. Welch
left Europe without getting his way.

How Monti refuted reports circulated by Microsoft this week shows his penchant for using cerebral tactics. Monday, Monti won approval to fine Microsoft a record $613 million.  Microsoft immediately leaked word that Monti had based the amount on the company's worldwide sales, including in the USA, its largest market.

Microsoft officials began complaining to reporters that the amount was inappropriate, implying a misguided move on Monti's part.

Wednesday, Monti quietly put out word that the amount was based on levying an 8% penalty on Microsoft's sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Why those regions?  Microsoft always reports its European business combined with sales from the other two regions.
"He may have outflanked  Microsoft on that one," says Matt Rosoff, analyst for research firm
Directions on Microsoft. "Monti has proven himself to be very aware of all the issues."

Monti is the product of a European bureaucracy with fewer ties to industry than its U.S. counterpart. "The whole European system is much more insulated from political pressures," says Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association. "They pay civil servants better. . . . The result is smart people rise to the top."

Monti's term as Europe's  antitrust czar expires in November. But last month, he told reporters he would consider serving another term if nominated by the Italian government.

WMRC Perspective
Significance     The
European Commission has issued its highest-ever anti-monopoly fine, but the action that Microsoft has been asked to take is more of an issue. Implications     The deep divisions between the EU and the US over the philosophy of anti-trust law, in particular its relationship to innovation, will continue, bolstered by increasing criticism of the Commission's philosophy within Europe itself.
Outlook          Microsoft is set to appeal, and the case is unlikely to be settled for a further four or more years. In the meantime, other companies' commercial considerations regarding the desirability of Microsoft's dominance
are likely to have a greater impact on the market than yesterday's ruling itself.

TD
The European Commission yesterday fined US software giant  Microsoft the record sum of 497m euro (US$607m) for abuse of monopoly in the European PC market. The sum, thought to amount to 1% of the company's cash on hand, is considerably higher than had been earlier expected (although, technically speaking, the Commission could have levied a  fine of 10% of  Microsoft's global sales, which would have equalled US$3.5bn). The Commission's calculation was, however, ultimately made on the basis of European sales. The accusations in the four-year case are that  Microsoft did not allow sales of its Windows package without the inclusion of the Media Player program, thus putting competing media programs such as Real Player at a disadvantage, and that it withheld from other server-makers the necessary source code of its proprietary software that would allow them to make servers fully interoperable with desktop computers using Windows. However, the  fine is less problematic for
Microsoft than the action that it has been ordered to take. It has been ordered to offer Windows without Media Player within 90 days, and to provide other server-makers with the necessary code within 120 days.
Fostering Innovation or Hindering It?

Microsoft says that the code is its intellectual property, and the earlier 2001 settlement between Microsoft and the US Justice Department on the same issues had said that code-removal would hinder innovation. The  European Commission, taking a very different stance, believes that  Microsoft's alleged abuse of market dominance, on the other hand, hinders innovation.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the ruling 'restores the conditions for fair  competition in the market concerned, and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position.' He added that the ruling did not enter new legal ground. However, the US Department of Justice clearly regards it as a bridge too far, and yesterday warned that  competition policy should 'avoid chilling innovation and competition'.
Ban on Further Similar Behaviour

The Commission has also barred  Microsoft from coming up with any other product bundlings or similar which would restrict  competition in other areas. Were it not for this last clause,  Microsoft and the Commission might have reached a settlement last week, but the Commission was determined that the

Page 148 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ruling should extend to other areas as well. There are concerns that  Microsoft might use product bundling when it launches Longhorn, its next operating system, which is due out in 2006.
Outlook and Implications

Microsoft is certain to appeal against the decision in the European Court of First Instance (CFI) and have the orders suspended. Going by previous behaviour, it is likely to fight as long as it can, and the battle
may continue for another four years or more. However, the European Union (EU) is likely to fight too against the request for a suspension of the orders. Monti has said that he thinks the EU ruling will stand up to appeal, but the European court has issued several recent rulings that have gone against the
Commission. However, they have all come years afterwards. By the time the case is resolved, technology will have moved forward several steps in any case.

Commercial (and, increasingly, security) concerns as to the desirability of  Microsoft's monopoly may end up having a much greater impact on the market than yesterday's ruling in itself, however. It is not a foregone conclusion that  Microsoft will continue to dominate certain markets, such as audio-visual content over the internet - content providers may start to release more using open standards.
Manufacturers of multimedia-related electronics which have to make choices as to what software to install on their goods are also not keen to see themselves locked into a market dominated by  Microsoft. At a corporate information technology (IT) and government level, increasing security concerns as to the desirability of  Microsoft dominance may play a significant role in shaping the market. One illustration of likely future developments came yesterday with an announcement by computer-maker Hewlett-Packard (HP) that it will be selling globally a range of PCs that run on the Linux open-source operating system. It had already announced that such PCs would be sold in Asia, where HP believes they will be taken up in particular by call-centres and similar.

In addition, the ruling could also spur further litigation from Microsoft's rivals in the US or from consumer electronics manufacturers, which may take encouragement from the European Commission to launch fresh cases against  Microsoft in the US. Indeed, a complaint was filed with the European Commission by a consortium of telephone, computer and electronics companies in February 2003. Although the US ruling on the Media Player and code-provision charges was settled in most states in 2001, nine states continued not to settle, and they have since made allegations that  Microsoft is not adhering to the terms of its settlement.

Meanwhile, the deep divisions between the EU and the US over the philosophy of anti-trust law, in particular its relationship to innovation, will continue. Such basic differences were last uppermost
following the  European Commission's controversial ruling on the GE/Honeywell merger, and will now be given new momentum. This will be the case not least because within Europe itself, the Commission's concepts of  competition law are coming under attack from European companies, bolstered by several recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings that have gone against the Commission's original decisions. However, in this case the differences of opinion will be overshadowed by the debate on the intellectual property aspect, given steam by the increasing  competition posed to Microsoft by the commercial uptake of open-source operating systems. This is a global debate rather than a transatlantic one.

Consumer groups have applauded the European Commission's decision to hit  Microsoft with a 497 million euro ($613 million/GBP331 million) fine and force it to disclose software secrets. Rival software makers including Realnetworks and Sun Microsystems, have also been quick to back the punishment. The move, they say, was likely to lead to lower prices, increased  competition and more variety for consumers. But  Microsoft has said it will appeal against the ruling that it abused its dominant market position. According to the company's main lawyer, Brad Smith, "the Commission's decision would actually reduce consumer choice and hurt European software developers". Referring to the planned appeal, Smith says, "the Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word." (GES/WNWCCB/TN)

Paul Geitner BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Union slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a $613 million US fine yesterday for abusing its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond a U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered" and said it would ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal.

TD
The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behaviour because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behaviour is still ongoing."

It gave the company 90 days to offer European computer manufacturers a version of Windows stripped of the company's digital media player, software for viewing video and listening to music that is expected to become pivotal in the industry as multimedia content becomes more pervasive.

The EU also gave  Microsoft 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," EU  antitrust chief Mario Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market.

Microsoft, which had $32 billion US in revenue last year, does about 20 per cent of its business in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith said he would ask the presiding judge at the European
Court of First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.

"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," he said.

Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, announcing a new speech server product in San Francisco yesterday , did not mention the EU case.

The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser now in private practice.
Page 151 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others noted, however, that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors, such as the danger they could go out of business. And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Monti called the ruling "proportionate" and "balanced," noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition."

He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints already pending against Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision," he said.

Microsoft was fined a record £331 million by the  European Commission yesterday - a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft's sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm's Media Player program.

TD
The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by "bundling" its own software and other services with its Windows system.

That made it difficult for other software makers to compete - particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy.
The strategy worked well - more than 90% of personal computers worldwide run on  Microsoft
software.

The Brussels ruling followed a four-year investigation led by  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. He said: "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position."

The European Commission is prepared to defend its decision to slap a record  fine of half a billion euros on US software giant Microsoft in a landmark anti-trust ruling, an EU official said Thursday.

TD
Erkki Liikanen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society who is visiting New Delhi, told reporters that the  European Commission was ready to face any court action that  Microsoft might initiate against it.
"We are strong believers in competition and have taken a significant decision.... It is for them (Microsoft)
to challenge it," said Liikanen.

"We have a strong case but we are not above the law. If  Microsoft takes us to court we are ready to defend our decision in court and abide by the court's ruling," he added.

At the end of a five-year investigation, the  European commission announced on Wednesday that it was fining Microsoft 497 million euros (611 million US dollars) in a landmark anti-trust ruling that labelled the US software giant a predatory monopolist.

Microsoft said it would appeal to the European Court of Justice and seek to have the sanctions suspended.

The European Commission also ordered Microsoft to offer a European version of its all-conquering Windows operating system without Media Player, a software product that is able to play back music and video content over the Internet, within 90 days.

The US firm has been ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data within 120 days to enable rival companies to offer servers that can work with Windows.

The unprecedented size of the EU's financial penalty might not hurt  Microsoft, which has cash reserves of some 53 billion dollars.

But analysts say enforced changes in Europe to its Windows operating system, which currently powers nine out of 10 personal computers, will hurt.
After largely settling its anti-trust problems at home through the 2001 deal with the US Justice
Department,  Microsoft sees no reason why it should undergo a drastic product overhaul in Europe.

Being forced to unbundle Media Player would be the thin end of the wedge for a company that has placed an all-in-one suite of applications at the heart of its hugely successful business strategy.
"Microsoft stifled  competition by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and
non-Microsoft work group servers and by bundling its Windows Media Player with its Windows operating
systems," said Liikanen.
"We hope our decision will refocus  competition," he added. uc/sdm.

US lawmakers joined the chorus of criticism Thursday of the European Union decision imposing a record
fine and other sanctions on  Microsoft for antitrust violations.

Several senators and congressmen echoed the criticism leveled at Brussels a day after the  European     Commission ordered a 497 million euro (613 million dollar)  fine and changes to the Windows operating system by the software titan.

TD
Senator Richard Lugar head of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement he was "troubled"
by the decision, which came in sharp contrast to a US settlement of an antitrust action against Microsoft.

"This breakdown in trans-Atlantic cooperation is likely to have ripple effects that will do harm to the trade and economic relationship between the United States and the European Union," Lugar said.
"The Commission's action will be felt worldwide, resulting in conflicts in the area of international
competition law."
Senate Majority leader Bill Frist said the move could lead to "a new trade war" adding that the  European
Commission ruling against Microsoft" is the first shot."

"In imposing this anti-consumer, anti-innovation penalty, the Commission has blatantly undercut the settlement that was so carefully and painstakingly crafted with  Microsoft by the US Department of Justice and several state  antitrust authorities," Frist said.
"There can be no question that the US government was entitled to take the lead in this matter -  Microsoft
is a US company, many if not all of the complaining companies in the EU case are American, and all of
the relevant design decisions took place here."
Ten members of the House International Relations voiced similar concerns in a joint statement. Representative Robert Wexler said that the EU decision "sets a harmful precedent for other countries in
the area of competition policy - particularly given that the US and EU signed a Comity Agreement on
competition laws in 1991, which was reaffirmed and strengthened in 1998."

"It is imperative that we maintain America's competitiveness," said Peter King, another of the 10 congressmen.

"Today's ruling undermines the US/EU Comity Agreement and will deter US companies from participating in European markets. The EU should reconsider its ruling and follow the Comity Agreement."

The US Department of Justice said Wednesday's EU  antitrust ruling on Microsoft was "unfortunate" and could have unintended effects on the marketplace.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing 'code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences," the department's  antitrust chief R. Hewitt Pate said in a statement.

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies. A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

NEW YORK (AFX) - U.S. stocks were mixed Wednesday as blue chips bounced in and out of positive territory, while the Nasdaq Composite held onto gains as Microsoft rose on hopes it can now put its European anti-trust woes behind it after the European Commission fined it $612 million for market abuses. "Day-to-day we're seeing choppy trade as the market lacks catalysts, and the only catalyst that is going to help the markets is the upcoming earnings season," said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. Hyman said stocks were also suffering from the flight to safety into bonds and gold amid the uncertain geopolitical situation. On today's economic numbers, Hyman said February durable goods orders were "mixed at best." "Although the headline number was good, the figure excluding orders for transportation goods suggests the economy is slowing down." Demand for U. S.

made durable goods soared 2.5 percent in February, beating economist expectations of a 1.7 percent rise, but January's numbers were revised downwards to 2.7 percent. Excluding often-volatile transportation goods, February's new orders fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.6 percent in January. On more positive economic note, sales of new homes in February rose more sharply-than-expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9 points at 10,055, trading in a narrow 63-point range. The Nasdaq Composite was up 3 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,905.21. Strength in chip stocks was underpinning the
tech-rich index with the Philadelphia semi-conductor index gaining 1.1 percent. The S&P 500 Index was dipped 4 points to 1,090 while the Russell 2000 Index, tracking the performance of small-cap stocks, was down 2.06 at 558.86. On the broader market, decliners outpaced advancers by an 18 to 12 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 15 to 12 score on the Nasdaq. Total volume was 386 million on the NYSE, and 535 million on the Nasdaq. Dow components posting gains include Hewlett-Packard up 1.3 percent, Intel 1.0 percent higher while Wal-Mart rose 1.2 percent. Alcoa was the leading decliner on the benchmark index, down 1.9 percent at $33.20. Among the main sector showing gains, software stocks, semi-conductor companies and networking shares were all moving higher. Gold stocks, insurance and banking shares and oil companies were all lower. Currencies The U.S. dollar remained sharply higher against its rivals in the wake of mixed U. S. factory data issued Wednesday. The dollar rose after comments from European officials fed market speculation the European Central Bank would consider an interest-rate cut when it next meets April 1. The dollar was up 1. 2 percent against the euro, with the shared currency valued at $1.2178. The dollar fell against the yen, last down 0.4 percent at 106.31 yen, after Standard & Poor's offered an upbeat outlook for the Japanese economy. Gold futures moved lower, following a more than $24-an-ounce climb in the last seven sessions and the rally in the U.S. dollar. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April gold is down $3.90 to trade at $416.10 an ounce. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was modestly higher in the wake of the U.S. data which showed a stronger-than-expected rise overall but an unexpected decline when volatile transportation orders were excluded. Oil prices moved lower, with imminent reports expected to show a fall in U.S. gasoline
inventories for last week, along with an increase in crude supplies.  Microsoft Shares of  Microsoft gained
30 cents, or 1.2 percent to $24.44, after sliding 1.4 percent Tuesday as investors anticipated the
European Commission's decision to  fine the software maker $612 million for abusing its dominant
market position. The company's share price is also not far off its 52-week low of $23.60, a position some
investors may be interpreting as a buying opportunity. The Commission ordered  Microsoft to disclose
operating system interface information to rival server maker within 120 days, AFX reported from Brussels.
It also ordered  Microsoft to offer personal computer manufacturers a version of its Windows operating
system without Windows Media Player. Mario Monti, Europe's top  antitrust regulator, told reporters there
was nothing specifically on pricing in the order. There had been some concern that Europe would demand
Microsoft put a price on Media Player. Shares of Real Networks, which offers the leading alternative to
the Windows Media Player, were up 1.8 percent at $5.70. Another company perhaps benefiting from the

$22.11 in intraday trading Earnings pre-announcements continue apace with Rockwell Automation boosting its outlook second quarter outlook. The Milwaukee-based maker of industrial automation power and control products said it now expects to earn between 37 and 39 cents per share, ahead of the current average estimate of 10 analysts polled by Thomson First Call for a profit of 36 cents per share in the March period.

tacked on 18 cents to $16.59 after CIBC World markets upgraded the media giant to "sector outperformer" from "sector performer," and raised its price target to $20 from $18. Analyst Michael Gallant believes the media giant will post better growth than its peers during 2004 and 2005, while its stock trades at a discount following i ts underperformance since the end of 2003.

NEW YORK (AFX) - U.S. stocks turned lower Wednesday after an indecisive start to the session, with blue chips falling on declines for Alcoa, Merck and ExxonMobil, while gains for  Microsoft failed to keep the Nasdaq Composite from drifting into negative territory. "Day-to-day we're seeing choppy trade as the market lacks catalysts, and the only catalyst that is going to help the markets is the upcoming earnings season," said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. Hyman said stocks were also suffering from the flight to safety into bonds and gold amid the uncertain geopolitical situation.
On today's economic numbers, Hyman said February durable goods orders were "mixed at best." "Although the headline number was good, the figure excluding orders for transportation goods suggests the economy is slowing down." Demand for U.S.

made durable goods soared 2.5 percent in February, beating economist expectations of a 1.7 percent rise, but January's numbers were revised downwards to 2.7 percent. Excluding often-volatile transportation goods, February's new orders fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.6 percent in January. On more positive economic note, sales of new homes in February rose more sharply-than-expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 41 points at 10,023. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,900, after falling as low as 1,896. 91. The S&P 500 Index was dipped 4 points to 1,090 while the Russell 2000 Index, tracking the performance of small-cap stocks, was down 2.06 at 558. 86. On the broader market, decliners outpaced advancers by an 18 to 12 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 15 to 12 score on the Nasdaq. Total volume was 386 million on the NYSE, and 535 million on the Nasdaq. Dow components posting gains include Hewlett-Packard up 1.3 percent, Intel 1. 0 percent higher while Wal-Mart rose 1.2 percent. Alcoa was the leading decliner on the benchmark index, down 3.5
percent at $32.66. Among the main sector showing gains, software stocks, semi-conductor companies and networking shares were all moving higher. Gold stocks, insurance and banking shares and oil companies were all lower. Currencies The U.S. dollar remained sharply higher against its rivals in the wake of mixed U.S. factory data issued Wednesday. The dollar rose after comments from European officials fed market speculation the European Central Bank would consider an interest-rate cut when it next meets April 1. The dollar was up 1.2 percent against the euro, with the shared currency valued at $1.2178. The dollar fell against the yen, last down 0.4 percent at 106.31 yen, after Standard & Poor's offered an upbeat outlook
for the Japanese economy. Gold futures moved lower, following a more than $24-an-ounce climb in the last seven sessions and the rally in the U.S. dollar. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April gold is down $3. 90 to trade at $416.10 an ounce. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was modestly higher in the wake of the U.S. data which showed a stronger-than-expected rise overall but an unexpected decline when volatile transportation orders were excluded. Oil prices moved lower, with imminent reports expected to show a fall in U.S. gasoline inventories for last week, along with an increase in crude supplies.
Microsoft Shares of  Microsoft gained 30 cents, or 1.2 percent to $24.44, after sliding 1.4 percent Tuesday as investors anticipated the  European Commission's decision to  fine the software maker $612 million for abusing its dominant market position. The company's share price is also not far off its 52-week low of $23.60, a position some investors may be interpreting as a buying opportunity. The Commission ordered Microsoft to disclose operating system interface information to rival server maker within 120 days, AFX reported from Brussels. It also ordered  Microsoft to offer personal computer manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player. Mario Monti, Europe's top antitrust regulator, told reporters there was nothing specifically on pricing in the order. There had been some concern that Europe would demand  Microsoft put a price on Media Player. Shares of Real
Networks, which offers the leading alternative to the Windows Media Player, were up 1.8 percent at $5.70. Another company perhaps benefiting from the European ruling on  Microsoft was Red Hat, the developer of Linux, a rival to  Microsoft's Windows operating system. The company also posted fourth quarter

Earnings pre-announcements continue apace with Rockwell Automation boosting its outlook second quarter outlook. The Milwaukee-based maker of industrial automation power and control products said it now expects to earn between 37 and 39 cents per share, ahead of the current average estimate of 10 analysts polled by Thomson First Call for a profit of 36 cents per share in the March period. Shares of Rockwell climbed 1.3 percent in early trading. Broker calls Time Warner (:,, ) tacked on 18 cents to $16.59 after CIBC World markets upgraded the media giant to "sector outperformer" from "sector performer," and raised its price target to $20 from $18.

HD     FOCUS Microsoft seen winning suspension of EU interface  sanction. BY      - By Emma Davis-
WC     714 words

BRUSSELS (AFX) -  Microsoft Corp is expected to win a suspension from the European Court of Justice of the EU's demand that it license out interface information to its rivals following today's  antitrust ruling which brands the company a violator of EU law, said sources close to the case.

Earlier, the  European Commission fined the company 497.2 mln eur for its breach of antitrust rules, ordered it to license the interface information which allows rivals products to interoperate with Microsoft's and ordered it to offer a Windows operating system stripped of the Windows Media Player.

TD
According to the commission, the company had excluded its rivals from the market by refusing to disclose enough interface information for them to make interoperable products and had illegally tied Windows Media Player to its operating system forcing clients to buy them together.

Microsoft said it will now seek a stay or suspension of the  fine and the conditions imposed by the commission. A source close to the commission said: "The likelihood of getting a suspension differs depending on whether you look at the interface information or the Windows Media Player."

The source explained: "If the company licenses out the intellectual property-right protected information and the court then rules against the commission in five years time, you cannot then suck back out that information. With Windows Media Player, the company can still sell this together with Windows."

A second source said: "On the interoperability front it seems pretty straight forward that the court will suspend the commission remedy. The court looks at whether irreparable harm will be done to the company. Once this interface information is on the market, that is it."

Microsoft will appeal today's ruling at the Court of First Instance and sources close to the company said that if an appeal here fails then it will take it all the way to the EU's top court, the European Court of Justice. The court will have to decide if traditional rules on tying products apply to the technology sector.
Traditionally with tying or bundling, EU law states that tying is forbidden where there is a separate
demand for the products being tied together and where the company has entered into contracts to ensure
that its clients buy the products together.
A source close to the case said: "The court will have to take a position on this. Is adding Windows Media
Player really tying or is it a continuous improvement of the operating system?"

The source added: "There is separate demand for the media player since people download from the internet for free but adding Windows Media Player to the system is a technological development and there is therefore no contractual tying."

Some competition law experts fear that the court will not make it any easier for companies in future despite the view that Monti refused to enter into a settlement with the company because he actually wants the case to go to court and wants the court to clarify how tying rules relate to technology.

"If anything, the most you can hope for is a clear articulation of the Rule of Reason (the rule relating to tying in EU  antitrust regulation). The court will say the commission has to evaluate on a case-by-case basis," said one Brussels-based legal expert speaking on the condition of anonymity.


Page 162 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Concerning the pending complaint against  Microsoft by its rivals who claim it is abusing its market power with its latest version of the Windows XP server, sources said today's decision does set a precedent for dealing with this case but does not make this latter one open-and-shut.

"Today's ruling does not mean that every tying case is illegal. The commission still needs to prove the company is dominant and it still needs to prove there is separate demand for the products involved. It can use today's ruling as a precedent but this will not make the burden of proof easier."

Microsoft has 70 days to file its appeal with the European court. A decision on the suspension of the commission remedies must be announced within 90 days.

NEW YORK (AFX) - U.S. stocks dipped in and out of positive territory Wednesday as investors weighed a
$612 million European Union  fine for Microsoft and a confusing picture of the state of the economy
painted by fresh economic data, while anxiety over the tense geopolitical situation persisted. "Day to day,

January. On a more positive economic note, sales of new homes in February rose more at a
sharply-than-expected rate. In other news, reports of an explosive package, later neutralized, found on
French railroads had only a muted impact on stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6 points at
10,069, after touching an intraday low of 10,007.49 - its worst level since Dec. 12, when the index hit a low
of 9,976.79. The Nasdaq Composite was up 9 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,910, after falling as low as
1,896.91. The S&P 500 Index was flat at 1,094, while the Russell 2000 Index, tracking the performance of
small-cap stocks, was down 1.57 at 559. 35. On the broader market, decliners outpaced advancers by an
18 to 12 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 15 to 13 score on the Nasdaq. Total volume
was 596 million on the NYSE, and 791 million on the Nasdaq. Dow components posting gains included
Hewlett-Packard up 1.6 percent; Intel, up 1.7 percent; and Wal-Mart, up 1.4 percent. Alcoa was the
leading decliner on the blue-chip benchmark, sinking 1.8 percent at $33.23 but having off its low for the
session of $32.63. Among the main sectors showing gains, software stocks, semiconductor companies
and networkers were all moving higher. Gold stocks, insurance and banking shares and oil companies
traded lower. Currencies, gold, bonds, oil Trading in the U.S. dollar played in part off the mixed
durable-goods data. The dollar benefited from European officials' comments that fed market speculation
that the European Central Bank would consider an interest-rate cut when it next meets April 1. The
greenback was up 1.0 percent against the euro, with the shared currency valued at $1.2209. The dollar fell
against the yen, last down 0.5 percent at 106.22 yen, after Standard & Poor's offered an upbeat outlook
for the Japanese economy. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was modestly higher in the
wake of the durables data. In commodities, gold futures moved lower, following a more than $24-an-ounce
climb in the last seven sessions and the rally in the dollar. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April
gold was down $3.90 to trade at $416.10 an ounce. And a hefty buildup in last week's U.S. crude supplies
and a smaller-than-expected decline in gasoline stocks pulled oil futures lower.  Microsoft fine Also in the

SAN FRANCISCO (AFX) - RealNetworks, a pioneer in digital media players for the Internet, was handed a victory of sorts after European regulators on Wednesday fined Microsoft over the use of its dominant position in computer operating systems. The ruling calls for Microsoft to pay a $613 million  fine, and sell two versions of its Windows operating system to manufacturers within 90 days. One of them must remove the Windows media player, the rival that competes with RealNetworks' player. Even so, RealNetworks, which is vying to become the next-generation cable company and music store, still faces challenges in the United States. In midday trading, Seattle-based RealNetworks saw only a modest lift for its shares on the news. It was up 7 cents at $5.53 at last check. RealNetworks praised the ruling and said it could lend the company ammunition in its $1 billion  antitrust suit pending against  Microsoft.

TD
In December, RealNetworks sued  Microsoft, alleging that the software giant was abusing "monopoly power" to limit consumer choice in media players. "This decision is fundamentally significant because the European Commission has formally declared that  Microsoft's media player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' general counsel, in a written statement. RealNetworks intends to "obtain injunctive relief, sufficient to stop all of Microsoft's illegal conduct as well as to secure compensation for the harm  Microsoft has done to our business," Kimball added. The consumer card  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the European ruling was unfortunate for consumers. "We respect the Commission's authority, but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers." For both companies, U. S. consumers are the ones who matter most. Last year, 75 percent of RealNetworks' sales came from consumer subscriptions, mostly from the United States. On that front, the company has suffered a blow with Major League Baseball's decision to let other companies bid for the rights to carry live Webcasts of ballgames. Earlier this week,  Microsoft and Time Warner's America Online emerged the winners in the bidding. RealNetworks is suing baseball to block the decision. By contrast, only 16 percent of RealNetworks' $202 million in sales last year came from Europe. The company doesn't disclose how much of those sales are generated from consumer subscriptions. RealNetworks says it has 1.3 million subscribers to its audio and video services, up from 900,000 at the end of 2002. That growth reflects the company's acquisition last year of San Francisco-based Rhapsody, which rents digital music to consumers for a monthly fee, and is becoming the foundation upon which RealNetworks is building a digital music emporium. RealNetworks says it has 350,000 subscribers to its music services, including Rhapsody and premium radio. In, the company launched its music store that allows consumers to buy one song at a time. It has yet to disclose how many songs have been sold through its stores. They're filing, but they're profitable Shopping.com, a Web site that brings together a
myriad of merchants to allow consumers to do comparison shopping, is stoking the fires of a new dot-com IPO boom. Shopping.com - borne of a merger of two dot-com start-ups, Epinions and Dealtime - has filed to go public in a deal that would raise an estimated $75 million. Unlike the dot-com IPO heyday, when unprofitable companies flooded the market, Shopping.com last year earned $6.9 million on sales of $60 million. Shopping.com is an intermediary bringing together consumers and merchants. It competes against all the main portals and search engines, from Yahoo to Ask Jeeves to Google, as well as e-commerce companies like Amazon.com, eBay, and Overstock.

Brussels, 24/03/2004 (Agence Europe) - The  European Commission has made its decision:  Microsoft has indeed broken European  competition rules by abusing its quasi-monopoly on PC operating systems to weaken competition on the work group server operating systems and multimedia reader systems. The Commission has therefore imposed a series of  fines, which Microsoft will have to pay off in order to
re-establish competition, and fined the company 497 million EUR, the highest ever  fine, because these were "very serious abuses, which have been ongoing for five and a half years".

TD
The decision was taken following an extremely delicate and detailed investigation, which DG  Competition has been working on for several years, and which has given rise to three statements of objections. Up until the last minute,  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and high-level staff tried to modify the Commission's position, which they feared would be harsh, but Mario Monti was not impressed by the world renown the American giant enjoys. "This is not a decision that we have taken lightly or hastily. It's a decision that follows a five-year investigation and intense debate within my department (...). The result is a decision which is proportionate to the market abuses we identified, and balanced", said the Commissioner, aware
of the enormous media impact of the decision.

According to the Commission,  Microsoft abused its market power by firstly deliberately limiting the interoperability between Windows PCs and its rivals' work group servers, and secondly, coupling the sale of is Windows Media Player with its operating system, which equips almost all of the world's PCs (95%). Work group servers are systems which provide services to office staff throughout the world in their management of daily tasks such as sharing files or printers, or security and user-identification management.  Microsoft's abusive behaviour gave it a dominant position on this large market segment (these products are the lifeblood of company IT networks), with the risk of quite simply wiping out the competition. Microsoft's behaviour has also considerably weakened competition on the media player market. "This abuse slows down innovation and damages competition and consumers, who, at the end of the day, have less choice and have to pay higher prices", said the European Commission.
The Commission imposed the following corrective measures:

for interoperability,  Microsoft has 120 days in which to divulge a full and specific document about Windows interfaces, to ensure total interoperability between rival work group servers and Windows PCs and servers. Microsoft's competitors will this be able to design interesting and efficient products as an alternative to Microsoft. Given the speed with which these products develop to become increasingly innovative, Microsoft will have to update this information each time it brings out a new version. "Under Community rules, refusing to divulge essential information can, in exceptional circumstances, force dominant companies to share information", said Mario Monti, who stressed that the existence of exceptional circumstances had been established, given the company's dominance. The Commission, which must make sure that the company is guaranteed the protection it can demand under intellectual property rights, stressed that  Microsoft can request remuneration, which must remain reasonable and non-discriminatory. The information to be divulged relates only to documents on interfaces, and not the Windows source code, which is not necessarily needed to develop interoperable products, added the Commission;

on tying sales,  Microsoft has 90 days to offer to PC manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player. This corrective measure does not mean that consumers will end up without a media player.

complete package imposed by  Microsoft, but will be able to configure the product to consumer wishes, rather than a choice imposed by the American giant. However,  Microsoft retains the right to offer a version of Windows with the Media Player (as a tied sale per se is not against the rules), but they will not be allowed to use procedures designed to make the untied version less attractive and less efficient. Nor
will it be able to make discounts to its suppliers conditional on the tied version. According to data collected by the Commission, there is currently a clear trend in favour of the  Microsoft Media Player and Windows Media technologies. If this domination was confirmed, there was a risk of the market tipping  Microsoft's way definitively, with the consequence of the company's being able to control the related markets for
digital media (coding technology, software to publish musical content on the Internet, management of digital rights etc).

The Commission also indicated that Wednesday's decisions would create a "precedent", in that the corrective measures it imposed would be clear principles for the behaviour for the company to adopt in the future, and also on how the Commission would treat similar cases in future.

Microsoft confirms that it will appeal

Soon after the decision was announced,  Microsoft stated in a press release that it would appeal the decision before the European Court of First Instance. "We are convinced that the Commission's decision will restrict consumer choice, and harm European software developers", said Microsoft's legal director, Brad Smith. "We hope to resolve these differences as soon as possible", he said. Microsoft says that it has offered its rivals "unprecedented access to its technology". He also said that he had suggested selling three other rival sound and image reader software systems with the Windows system: "we acted responsibly while trying to create the best possible products to respond to our clients' needs", he said.

When asked about the probability of  Microsoft's seeking legal redress, Commissioner Monti expressed his confidence: "We have been at pains to ensure the quality of the decision-making procedure. We have also developed an investigation system with many checks on it, to ensure that all parties' rights are respected". "The decision will hold water if appealed against, because we have evaluated all the risks", he concluded.

(ANSA) - BRUSSELS, March 25 - Washington launched late on Wednesday criticised the  European        Commission's sanctions on  Microsoft, but Brussels hurried to pour oil on troubled waters and tried to avoid a possible new transatlantic duel.

Robert Hewitt Pate, head of the U.S. Justice Department's  antitrust division criticised the EC's decision to force the Redmond-based software giant to offer on the European market a version of its Windows operating system without Media Player software. The EC sanction could damage the functioning of the market and posed an obstacle for software companies favouring single competitors and not the competition, Pate said.

TD
The Justice Department also criticised the amount of the  fine, which stands at 497 million euro and is the biggest ever imposed by the European  antitrust authorities, claiming that the EC decision was unfortunate as other notorious price-fixing cartels had received smaller  fines.

European Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, did not comment Pate's criticism and confirmed his Wednesday statement. Monti, notorious in the U.S. for blocking the $42-billion mega-merger between General Electric and Honeywell, did everything possible to avoid a possible dispute with the U.S.

"This case cannot be interpreted as a commercial or industrial conflict between the U.S. and the EU," Monti told reporters.

Monti said that many of the companies which had filed complaints against  Microsoft, were U.S.-based, including Realnetworks and Sun Microsystems.

"We could legally have imposed explicitly a worldwide geographic scope, given the global nature of these markets. We have not done so out of respect for the U.S. and other countries," Monti added.

As for the  Microsoft case, the EC had carried out a dialogue on all levels with the U.S. Department of Justice and has been very careful in avoiding clashes, Monti said. According to Brussels, there is no reason to criticise the actions or the decision of the commission.

According to sources close to the EU  antitrust the tones of Washington's statement were very moderate, and according to an EC source there were no elements in EU's position that might have created a transatlantic conflict. The source added that there was a diverging interpretation of the application of antitrust regulations, above all regarding the pairing off of Windows products, but the approach was the same regarding the so-called interoperability.

Monti also insisted Wednesday that despite the fact that the verdict of the EU  antitrust would be a good precedent for similar cases in the future it hardly constituted a new regulation in itself and every case would be examined separately.

But in support of the protests of  Microsoft, which apart from announcing its intention to appeal before the European Court of Justice has threatened it would ask the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to intervene, U.S. Senator Bill Frist said he was afraid that the U.S. and the EU were heading towards a new trade war
-- and that the commission's ruling against  Microsoft was the first shot. (ANSA). (DG/ID/MD/krc)

HD     EU Orders Microsoft to Make Changes

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Complaining that  Microsoft Corp. has abused its "virtual monopoly power," the European Union is giving the U.S. computer giant 90 days to release a stripped-down version of Windows without the company's digital media player, used for viewing video and listening to music.

The EU also slapped  Microsoft with a $613 million  fine Wednesday for abusively wielding its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

TD
Microsoft also has 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows, the EU decision said.

Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered," and said it expected to ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal.

The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behavior because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behavior is still ongoing."

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," EU  antitrust chief Mario Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market. Microsoft, which had $32 billion in revenue last year, does about 20 percent of its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said he would most likely ask the presiding judge at the
European Court of First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.
"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," he said.

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, announcing a new speech server product in San Francisco on
Wednesday, did not mention the EU case.
The U.S. Justice Department said the decision could hamper innovation and harm consumers.

The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser now in private practice.


Page 172 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Others noted, however, that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors, such as the danger they could go out of business. And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Monti called the ruling "proportionate" and "balanced," noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition."
He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints already pending against
Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision," he said.
Settlement talks broke down last week over the EU's insistence on just such a precedent-setting element:
preventing Microsoft from adding features such as Google-like search to future versions of Windows.

Smith argued that  Microsoft's settlement proposal, which he said included an offer to release a worldwide Windows version that included three competing media players besides its own, would have been more useful to consumers than the penalties.

He called the order to produce a version of Windows without media software an "unwarranted and ill-considered" violation of intellectual property rights under World Trade Organization rules.

Doing so, he said, would be difficult and make other features and even some Web sites work less effectively.
The company made similar claims in the U.S. case, which surrounded  Microsoft's inclusion of its Internet
Explorer Web browser in Windows.

Microsoft was also found guilty of monopolistic behavior in the U.S. case, but the EU order strikes deeper, at the heart of  Microsoft's business strategy -- regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company argues that such "bundling" benefits consumers. Rivals call it unfair competition, given that Windows runs more than 90 percent of personal computers worldwide.

The EU said it was concerned that a stranglehold on media players could let  Microsoft dictate future standards for how digital music and video files are encoded, distributed and played.

Under the EU order,  Microsoft can continue selling a version of Windows with its media player software installed but must not make the stripped-down version less attractive or a poorer performer.

The ruling could boost other makers of media software, led by RealNetworks Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' general counsel, said the EU decision "confirms the merit" of his company's private  antitrust lawsuit against  Microsoft.

The EU case also involved low-end servers that tie desktop computers together in offices. Sun Microsystems Inc. complained to the EU in 1998 that Microsoft refused to provide details needed for Sun programs to "talk" to Windows computers as efficiently as Microsoft's own server software could.

The Commission called  Microsoft's refusal to disclose interface information "part of a broader strategy designed to shut competitors out of the market."

Microsoft could get "reasonable remuneration" for disclosing its proprietary code, the ruling said, adding that the Windows source code itself would remain untouched.

The EU said it would appoint a trustee to monitor Microsoft's compliance with the ruling. The expert is to be selected from at least three names submitted by Microsoft, but the company would have to demonstrate the independence of its nominees. The trustee would have access to  Microsoft sites, employees and documents.

The EU described the decision in a three-page statement. The ruling itself may not be released for weeks, as Microsoft may ask that business secrets be redacted.

Microsoft's shares rose 26 cents to close at $24.41 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a euro497.2 million (US$613 million)  fine for abusively wielding its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

HD      Microsoft concedes  misstep  in search technology

REDMOND, Wash. (AP) - When  Microsoft Corp. entered the Internet browser war in the 1990s, Netscape Navigator was the early leader and  Microsoft's Internet Explorer the late-blooming upstart.
Now, Microsoft is gearing up for a similar battle in search technology.

TD
Chief executive Steve Ballmer conceded Thursday that one big misstep by  Microsoft over the past few years is that the company did not put resources toward in-house research and development of search technology.
"That's probably the thing I feel worst about over the last few years -- not making our own R&D
investment," Ballmer said at a conference for online advertisers held at  Microsoft's Redmond campus.

Instead, he said, the company had relied on outside sources for that technology. Joking that the pervasive software giant is often stereotyped as "doing it all," he said: "This is a case where we didn't do it all -- and
I wish we had."

But Microsoft is now turning its considerable might toward catching up. It's a move that puts  Microsoft head to head with Google, the world's most popular Web surfing vehicle, and Yahoo, the Internet's most popular destination, in what many see as an important, growing and lucrative market.
"I think you'll see some good  competition in this area," Ballmer said.

Ballmer mentioned the European Union's ruling against  Microsoft only in passing, when asked about rumors the company may be making some big acquisitions. He said he hadn't heard that; he'd been too busy paying attention to rumors coming out of Europe.

The European Commission slapped Microsoft with a $613 million  fine Wednesday for abusively wielding its near monopoly in desktop operating systems and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the company's antitrust settlement with the United States. The company has vowed to appeal.

About 114.5 million Americans, or 39 percent of the population, now use search engines, according to Nielsen NetRatings. Also, businesses spent an estimated $2 billion last year on search-related advertising and some analysts expect the market to triple during the next three years.

Microsoft -- which will spend nearly $7 billion this year on overall research and development -- hopes to have some of its own search technology development done in the next 12 months, Ballmer said. It will take longer to develop search technology focused on advertising, he told the advertising executives.

The software titan also has said that better search technology will be a big part of the next version of its dominant Windows operating system, which may not be released for a couple years or more.

At the conference,  Microsoft also unveiled a study on the effectiveness of online advertising. The company is using the study as the basis for an argument that companies spending about 1 percent of


Page 178 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
their advertising budget online should consider increasing that to 4 percent or 5 percent because people are spending more time online.

Ballmer said Microsoft spends about 12 percent of its media budget on online advertising, and that he orders his staff to "saturate" that market first and foremost.

"I want to make sure (a user) can't get through ... an online experience without hitting a  Microsoft ad," he said.

EU penalties give Gates big problem

MICROSOFT was fined a record £331m by the European Commission yesterday - a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

TD
The penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft's sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm's Media Player program.

The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by "bundling" its own software and other services with its Windows system.

That made it difficult for other software makers to compete,particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy.

The strategy worked well - more than 90pc of personal computers worldwide run on  Microsoft software. Yesterday's ruling in Brussels followed a four-year investigation led by  Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti, who said: "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position."

But the real battle has only just begun as  Microsoft is appealing against the  fine to the European Court of Justice and a final verdict could take five years.

Meanwhile, Microsoft will be seeking suspension of the Commission's order to start selling within 90 days a version of Windows without Media Player and to make available within 120 days the information other companies need to produce compatible rival server products.
Mr Gates is furious that the EU is interfering when  Microsoft is subject to anti-trust laws in America. But
Mr Monti said the company's commercial methods affect millions of European customers.

HD     EU hammers Microsoft with $600-million fine: Software giant to appeal ruling.  Company given 120 days to disclose Windows  information to rival makers

BRUSSELS, Belgium

European regulators ruled yesterday that  Microsoft had broken European Union law by using its "near monopoly" in the Windows operating system to squeeze out rivals in other kinds of software.

TD
The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, ordered  Microsoft within 90
days to offer in the European Union - soon to be a trade bloc of 25 nations - a version of Windows with its
media-playing software stripped out.

The commission also gave the company 120 days to disclose the necessary information about Windows to rival makers of software for PC network servers to allow them to design products that work as easily with Windows as  Microsoft's own server software.

The commission fined Microsoft 497 million euros (about $603 million U.S.), its largest  fine ever. The penalty, which came after five years of investigation, consultations and negotiations, went well beyond what the U.S. Justice Department ultimately agreed to in its anti-trust case in the late 1990s.
The Justice Department said late yesterday that it was concerned about the European action. "Sound
anti-trust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies," R. Hewitt
Pate, assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust division, said in a statement.

Microsoft said it would appeal the ruling to the European courts. Such an appeal could take as long as five years. The company said it would also ask for a suspension of the commission's penalties during its appeal.
The European decision is "an unfortunate step and it's an unnecessary step," said Brad Smith,
Microsoft's general counsel.

The ruling can be expected to change the way the company does business in the EU, a market of more than $3 billion for  Microsoft, and may make the company more vulnerable to  antitrust litigation in the future.

Mario Monti, the top European anti-trust official, said he was "confident we have produced a decision that can withstand an appeal."
"If future cases do materialize," Monti added, "they will benefit from this precedent."

While a number of  Microsoft's competitors, including Apple Computer, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Intel, declined to comment, others hailed the European ruling.

Matthew Szlulik, chief executive of Red Hat, a company that competes against  Microsoft in
operating-system software for PCs and PC network servers, said: "This sends a clear message to the
international and European marketplaces that innovation and choice really matter. As the EU looks
forward, they are going to create an environment that inspires  competition and leads to better products
and lower prices."
The most important aspect of the ruling concerned  Microsoft's bundling of its media-playing software in
Windows, a practice the commission called "tying."

"Tying harms  competition because it prevents a lot of high- quality alternatives from being available," Monti said, adding: "Media players are separate products from operating systems. There is separate demand for them."

Under the commission's order,  Microsoft may still sell in Europe a version of Windows with Media Player, but this bundled version must not be favoured in any way over an unbundled one.

But the commission did not order  Microsoft to sell the unbundled version of Windows at a discount to the version with Media Player attached - an important requirement for restoring  competition, according to computer analysts and lawyers.

"If the commission's remedy allows Microsoft to sell the two versions of Windows at the same price, then that's a problem," said Thomas Vinje, a competition lawyer in the Brussels office of the law firm of
Clifford Chance, who represents one of Microsoft's most vocal adversaries on both sides of the Atlantic, the Computer and Communications Industry Association.

Monti said in an interview he was convinced that offering two operating systems would open up the market for media players.

The deputy general counsel for RealNetworks, David R. Stewart, said the decision was "a great step towards levelling the playing field" for media players.

Microsoft must also disclose enough information about Windows to rival software makers to allow them to design products that work as easily with Windows as  Microsoft's own software. The disclosure order concerns only information about how Windows works with other applications, so-called "interface documentation," and not the operating system's source code, the commission said.
Sun Microsystems prompted the anti-trust case with its complaint to the commission about  Microsoft in
1998.

Sun's vice-president of legal affairs, Lee Patch, applauded the commission's ruling. "This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and  competition worldwide," he said.

"The remedy concerning inter-operability will result in a wave of new competitive products on the market," Patch said. "Users will be able to mix and match software from different vendors. They'll be able to choose the best product on the market, then six months later take advantage of the choice to pick the best
product at that particular time."

United States, 2004 Mar 25 (NB). The record-setting  antitrust fine imposed by the on could do far more than make a small dent in Bill Gates & Co's mammoth bank account. The ruling, a much more hard-line approach than was taken by the , could send mixed signals for other technology companies with a global reach, not to mention threaten U.S.-European trade relations.

The question is whether the dueling  antitrust approaches of the United States and the EU are a harbinger for other U.S. companies doing business across the pond. USA Today, in a blunt assessment, said the EU's action "dealt a blow to one of the planet's most powerful forces: globalization." The newspaper said that the action "by a regulatory entity in one part of the world threatens to fundamentally alter the operations of a company on a different continent." , an economics professor at told the newspaper: "It threatens the ability of multinationals to operate seamlessly around the world."

TD
The Financial Times focused on the trade war theme, reporting that the "prospect of a new transatlantic split over competition policy loomed on Wednesday after the US Department of Justice strongly criticised the European Union's anti-trust action against  Microsoft. , European Union  competition commissioner, had sought to defuse possible tensions over the record $612m  fine and other penalties, saying the ruling against the software group broke no new legal ground. But within hours , head of antitrust at the DoJ warned of 'unintended consequences,' adding: 'Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition, even by 'dominant' companies.' The apparent divergence between the two jurisdictions brought echoes of the 2001 clash between Mr Monti and , the former US  antitrust
chief, after the EU vetoed 's $43bn acquisition of , a proposed deal that US authorities had cleared." (The Seattle Times was among the newspapers to note that the White House punted questions to the Justice Department).

"For businesses operating in an increasingly global marketplace," a Washington Post analysis piece said, "such divergence in the rules can be a nightmare." EU  antitrust expert told the newspaper, ""In a world
in which products cross borders regularly and in which dominant companies operate in both places . . . it becomes difficult to advise those companies on what kind of unilateral conduct they can engage in."

The Washington Post reported that "several members of Congress warned that the ruling could widen trade and diplomatic rifts between the United States and Europe. EU officials, in defense of their action, said they sought to establish what has eluded  Microsoft competitors in the United States: legal precedent to limit the company's 20-year-old practice of constantly incorporating new applications such
as the into the operating system, then capitalizing on Windows' nearly universal distribution to overwhelm rival products."

Senate Majority Leader (R-Tenn.) "expressed fear of a transatlantic trade war," The Los Angeles Times noted. But of Wisconsin, the "ranking Democrat on the Senate  antitrust subcommittee, hailed the ruling as offering 'significant steps to protect  competition in this vitally important industry.' But he also raised concern about diverging U.S. and EU regulatory policy," The Wall Street Journal reported.

Instead of pointing out a potential rift in trade over the EU's decision, Silicon Valley lawyer offered a different read for the New York Times. Reback, "who has argued cases against Microsoft, said that the position taken by the Europeans means that regulators there have a chance to preserve competition, while American regulators have reacted too slowly." More: "The prevailing sentiment of U.S. antitrust

enforcers is, 'Come back when you're dead,'" Reback said. "This is the first time somebody's stepped in while there was still  competition."

In a separate piece, The New York Times noted how an  antitrust ruling in one place can ripple throughout the globe: "If upheld on appeal, [the EU decision] would leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts into future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. The  antitrust settlement the company reached with the Bush administration in 2001, by comparison, merely gives personal computer manufacturers the ability to place rival software on the Windows desktop, but does not require that  Microsoft's bundled software features be removed from Windows. On its own, the European ruling might be seen largely as a nuisance to  Microsoft. Yet it
comes as other forces are also weakening  Microsoft's grip on desktop computers" -- such as .

A San Jose Mercury News editorial noted that the EU's "ruling goes farther than the U.S. settlement in another important area: It expands the technical information  Microsoft is forced to disclose so that rivals such as , and makers of the Linux operating system can make their products work with Windows. Because of insufficient technical data, some corporate customers have been forced into a Windows-only world. If the commission's ruling stands,  Microsoft will have to think twice about leveraging its Windows monopoly to thwart  competition in new software markets."

No surprise here: "Microsoft said the Commission ruling would worsen transatlantic relations, infringe international trade law and violate its intellectual property," The Financial Times reported.

"There's an important principle at stake in this case," CEO said during a conference call with the media, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. "We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers. We recognize the sort of special position our company has, but nonetheless, we think we should have that ability to improve our product subject to the appropriate guidelines."

Meanwhile, The Financial Times reminded readers that the EU is still investigating separate  Microsoft business practices that could potentially generate additional remedies. "The pending case, which deals with the entire operating system, is much more extensive, but follows up both the basic issues behind yesterday's decision. People close to Mr Monti hope that the next case could be resolved in two years -- the present struggle took five years. The problem is that -- partly to assuage possible tensions with the
US -- Mr Monti has watered down talk of precedents for the coming fight. That may make it legally harder to push through, even with the political impetus provided by yesterday's decision."

According to The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, many Microsoft "competitors said they were happy to see the European Commission go further than the U.S. antitrust enforcers in addressing  Microsoft's
anti-competitive conduct."

The most turned-to critic for the handicapping of the  Microsoft ruling was , chief of longtime  Microsoft foe . Glaser told the New York Times: "This would be a step in the right direction, helping to open up the industry further for  competition and innovation." However, the Times noted that "even Mr. Glaser has modest expectations for the immediate impact of the European ruling."

Another piece in The New York Times quoted , chief executive of the Linux software firm . "This sends a clear message to the international and European marketplaces that innovation and choice really matter. As the E.U. looks forward, they are going to create an environment that inspires  competition and leads to better products and lower prices," Szlulik said.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted how the EU ruling could benefit a wide range of  Microsoft competitors: "If upheld in the European courts, the commission's decision sets a precedent with implications for other companies, including Silicon Valley firms such as , and , that might compete with new add-ons to the Windows operating system. RealNetworks Inc., based in Seattle, is waging its own lawsuit against  Microsoft in the United States over the bundling of Windows Media Player with the operating system, the same practice that the EC deemed anti-competitive." Ed Black, of the lobbying group "said the ruling 'makes it more probable' that RealNetworks' lawsuit and others like it will be successful."

, a software analyst with market research firm , put the damper on any far-reaching impact of the EU decision. "There are a lot of broad factors that one ruling isn't going to change," Kusnetzky told The Los Angeles Times. "The trend that existed will continue -- the trend to use Windows for more and more things."

Don't expect the EU controversy to stop  Microsoft from rolling out the next version of its operating system. The Seattle Times noted that the company's "chief lawyer said he's confident the company can win a stay [of the EU sanctions] in court, which would delay imposition of the penalties until an appeal is

Page 189 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
heard. That process could take until 2009, long after a crucial new version of Windows, codenamed , is shipped in 2005 or 2006."

In a commentary for CNET's News.com, 's offered this view on how the ruling could impact Longhorn: "Microsoft's next major consumer operating system release (scheduled for 2006) ... may now have to come in two versions. ... One version would have all the  Microsoft bells and whistles; vendors could dress up the other, bare-boned version. ... [B]ut will it impact consumer adoption of the digital home? No. Microsoft will still have a huge competitive advantage, as the full Longhorn edition will beat the patchwork solutions to market and work more seamlessly. Furthermore, apart from a dedicated group of consumers antagonistic to  Microsoft--the hip Mac fans and home Linux mavericks--consumers will care even less about the inner workings of their PCs, phones and set-top boxes."

Open-source software continues to be a threat for  Microsoft, and 's move to embrace could make that threat even worse. The Financial Times noted that the software giant "was dealt a further blow on Wednesday as Hewlett-Packard, the world' largest personal computer maker, said it planned to bundle its PCs globally with the Linux open source operating system later this year. The decision by HP, which
has long sold PC! s with  Microsoft Windows installed, is a boost for Linux and could alter the balance of power in the desktop operating system market. Last week HP said it would install Linux software in PCs destined for Asia."

MICROSOFT was fined a record €497 million by the  European Commission yesterday – a financial flea bite for the computer giant but a big political and legal headache for chairman Bill Gates.

TD
The cash penalty was accompanied by orders to dismantle  Microsoft's sales monopoly by no longer making purchase of its Windows operating system conditional on buying the firm's Media Player program.

The company was accused of breaching EU  competition rules by "bundling" its own software and other services with its Windows system.

This made it difficult for other software makers to compete particularly as  Microsoft withheld the technical codes which allowed Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft said the information was its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy.
The strategy worked well more than 90% of personal computers worldwide run on  Microsoft
software.
Today's ruling in Brussels followed a four-year investigation led by  Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti, who said: "It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the
future conduct of a company with such a strong, dominant position."

But the real battle has only just begun:  Microsoft is appealing against the  fine to the European Court of Justice and a final verdict could take five years.

Meanwhile, Microsoft will be seeking suspension of the Commission's order to start selling within 90 days a version of Windows without Media Player and to make available within 120 days the information other companies need to produce compatible rival server products.
Mr Gates is furious the EU is interfering at all when  Microsoft is already subject to anti-trust laws in
America.

But Mr Monti said the company's commercial methods affect millions of European customers and must comply with European Union laws.

The Commission, he argued, has a duty to offer monopoly protection to  Microsoft's commercial rivals, and its retail customers, in Europe.

With a healthy bank balance estimated at nearly €60 billion,  Microsoft will not be troubled by the size of the  fine, even if it is the biggest ever sought by the Commission against any company.

But the knock-on effect of changing the way  Microsoft markets its products in Europe could be huge.


Page 191 of 198 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr Gates is now determined to challenge the Commission's contention that the company which made him the world's richest man is an "abusive monopolist" which has manipulated the market at the expense of others.

Mr Monti said his "exhaustive and extensive" investigation into  Microsoft has lasted a total of more than five years, and the conclusion was that the company had violated EU  competition rules by abusing its "near-monopoly".

The illegal behaviour was still going on, said Mr Monti, adding: "Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation."

He added: "Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position."
He said Microsoft's "abuses" of its position had acted as "a brake on innovation", harming
competition.

The Commission could have imposed a much bigger  fine it has power to demand financial penalties of up to 10 per cent of the annual turnover of the company concerned.

WASHINGTON -- European regulators on Wednesday finedMicrosoft Corp. a record $613 million and imposed broad restrictions on the way it develops and sells software -- a stinging defeat for a company that has spent nearly two decades battling accusations of anti-competitive behavior.

If it survives  Microsoft's promised appeal, the unanimous ruling by the  European Commission would mete out significantly harsher penalties than the 2002 settlement the company reached with the Justice Department to end similar  antitrust litigation in the United States.

TD
Wednesday's  fine was the highest levied against a company by the commission, but the practical implications of the ruling could take years to sort out as the case moves through the European court system. In the meantime, "Microsoft has to be very careful about its behavior," said  antitrust lawyer David Wood. "With this precedent, Microsoft is on notice."

Although the  fine amounts to less than an average week's worth of sales for Redmond, Wash-based Microsoft, the ruling opens the door for private  antitrust lawsuits that could cost the company additional hundreds of millions of dollars. Potentially most damaging to the company are the far-reaching restrictions announced in Brussels, Belgium, by European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

Monti gave Microsoft 90 days to offer a version of its flagship Windows operating system without multimedia software for playing digital video and music. And he told  Microsoft that it had 120 days to share "complete and accurate" details about the inner workings of Windows so competitors could make products more compatible with the operating system that powers 95 percent of the world's personal computers.

Rivals have long complained that  Microsoft uses the dominance of Windows to take over lucrative new applications -- from Web browsers to media players.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly over the PC desktop in Europe," Monti said. "Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business does not prevent competition . . . and does not harm consumers and innovation."
Competitors in Silicon Valley and elsewhere said the ruling could help restore  competition to the
fast-moving computer industry. But some expressed concern that it might suffer the same crucial defect
as the 2002 U.S. settlement -- by the time the case is concluded, it may be too late to make a practical
difference.

The U.S. case focused on  Microsoft's practice of bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser into Windows at a time when Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator was the leading browser. By the time the case settled, Netscape no longer existed as a separate company and Explorer was ubiquitous.

In the five years since the 15-nation European Union launched its case,  Microsoft's share of the European market for media software has grown to about 35 percent and its share of the software that powers the servers behind small and midsized computer networks has risen to about 70 percent.

Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said the company will appeal Wednesday's ruling the to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, a process that can take several years. Barring a stay, the sanctions would take effect later this year as the case proceeds.

THE REACTION

"We do not take into account the nationality of (Microsoft). We take account of the welfare of consumers here in the European Union."
-- EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti
"I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it's like they have a monopoly on water. It's not healthy."
-- Gerbert Kaandorp, chief executive of Dutch software company Backbase BV, on  Microsoft
"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word."
-- Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel

The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft Corp. failed in last-ditch talks to reach an accord on its business practices with European antitrust regulators and now faces rulings that could affect the way it sells software for an array of products, from servers now to mobile phones in the future. The  European Commission next Wednesday is expected to order  Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows without its Media Player multimedia software for sale to European consumers -- and that could lead to such a choice being offered world-wide. The commission also is expected to require  Microsoft
to release enough new information about Windows to allow rival companies to make software that works as well in a Windows-dominated world as  Microsoft's own software does. It also will likely levy its
largest fine, widely expected to be at least $200 to $300 million.

The European Commission issued an antitrust ruling against Microsoft yesterday that is intended to force the company to change its fundamental business strategy of bundling new products into its Windows operating system, which runs more than 90 percent of all personal computers.

The ruling imposed a $603 million  fine. It also required  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without its Media Player and divulge technical information to competitors so that they can create software for business servers that would work well with Windows. [Page C1.]

TD
The impact on the future of the global software industry may well be greater than on the company's immediate business prospects.

The fine is pocket change for  Microsoft, which has more than $50 billion in cash in its corporate coffers. The sanctions, according to industry analysts, are not likely to have any significant near-term effect on the computer industry or the market for software that plays music and videos sent over the Internet. And  Microsoft executives declared that there would be no changes in their product plans or business practices as a result of the European decision.

But the ruling could set profound new ground rules for  Microsoft in Europe, and perhaps in other markets around the world, as well.

If upheld on appeal, it would leave  Microsoft with a regulator in Europe standing over its shoulder, scrutinizing what it puts into future generations of Windows and what it leaves out. The  antitrust settlement the company reached with the Bush administration in 2001, by comparison, merely gives personal computer manufacturers the ability to place rival software on the Windows desktop, but does not require that  Microsoft's bundled software features be removed from Windows.

On its own, the European ruling might be seen largely as a nuisance to  Microsoft. Yet it comes as other forces are also weakening  Microsoft's grip on desktop computers.

Beyond the moves to open the Windows desktop to rivals,  Microsoft faces growing competition from Linux, an operating system that is distributed free. Even more important,  Microsoft's dominance is threatened by a shift in computing from the personal computer to technologies like Internet-connected cellphones and Internet-based services offered by Google and similar companies.

''The significance of Europe is not the decision itself, but it adds to the other pressures on  Microsoft,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.

Those pressures may be having some effect. There are signs that  Microsoft has altered its practices since the settlement with the Bush administration -- and the European ruling could provide a further prod.

Industry analysts note that work on the company's next generation of Windows, expected in 2006 or
2007, emphasizes programming code as building blocks, or modules, that can be removed and
snapped into the larger program.

This approach may be paving the way for the day when  Microsoft shifts away from its bundling approach. Skeptics, however, say that  Microsoft may be adopting this approach simply because it needs to be able to locate and combat security flaws in Windows more easily.

Other analysts say that the  Microsoft division responsible for MSN Web sites -- and not the Windows division -- is working to develop a Web search service to compete with Google. To be sure,  Microsoft could eventually decide to fold its search software into Windows, as it has with other products in the past.

Critics and competitors contend that the company, having long used the bundling strategy to protect and extend its Windows monopoly into other software products, will not significantly change its approach.

''How do you really deter  Microsoft from pursuing this bundling strategy when they have bet the company on it?'' asked Andrew I. Gavil, an  antitrust expert at the Howard University law school in Washington.

Timothy F. Bresnahan, a professor at Stanford University who was chief economist for the Justice Department's  antitrust division during the Clinton administration, said, ''Microsoft sees a new product and says, 'We were about to invent that, too,' comes up with its version and bundles the software into Windows.'' The result, he added, is that ''the early leader in some promising new technology is
bundled out of the market.''
''It's an innovation tax that is a problem for society,'' Mr. Bresnahan said.

Bundling was at the center of the federal  antitrust suit in the United States, filed in 1998 by the Clinton administration.  Microsoft lost the case, but a federal appeals court said the charge that the company engaged in anticompetitive tying should be reconsidered. The Bush administration decided not to
revisit the tying claim and settled with  Microsoft in 2001.

Microsoft contends that putting new things into Windows is good for consumers, even if it is bad for some competitors. It was over the bundling issue that settlement talks with the  European                    Commission broke down in Brussels last week.

For Microsoft, the immovable line in the sand is still its right to add whatever it wants to its dominant product, Windows. ''We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products in the interests of consumers,'' Steven A. Ballmer,  Microsoft's chief executive, said yesterday in a conference call with reporters. ''We are protecting the fundamental principle of innovation.''

Microsoft executives say that after the bundling issue was taken off the table in the United States, its competitors sought a more sympathetic audience in Europe.

''This was the core issue during several years of judicial review in the United States,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. ''The irony is that in Europe the claimants were the very same American companies that had their day in court in the United States.''

The European Commission has ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows stripped of its Media Player within 90 days. And it has told the company that within 120 days it must share more technical information with software competitors in the market for server computers, which run corporate networks.  Microsoft said it would seek a temporary halt to both sanctions, while its appeal makes its way through the European courts, a process that is expected to take years.

Microsoft's leading competitor in media-playing software is RealNetworks, the early front-runner, whose market share has declined sharply since  Microsoft began bundling Windows Media Player into its operating system.

''This would be a step in the right direction, helping to open up the industry further for  competition and innovation,'' said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. But even Mr. Glaser has modest expectations for the immediate impact of the European ruling.

Instead, he pointed to the long-run importance of challenging  Microsoft's bundling strategy. ''If the Windows operating system is seen as completely mutable -- something that anything can be put in -- that doesn't mean there won't be innovation in PC software, but it does tend to inhibit it,'' Mr. Glaser said.

Under the ruling from Brussels, the pared-down Windows without the Media Player applies only to
European markets and does not have to be sold for less than Windows with the Media Player.

''If there's no price difference, there will be no impact on PC makers' choices,'' said David M. Smith, an analyst at Gartner Inc.

The ruling's demand that  Microsoft share more technical information with competitors in the server market, like Sun Microsystems, I.B.M. and others, is intended to ensure that  Microsoft does not unfairly extend its monopoly beyond the desktop to the server market. The United States settlement also required that  Microsoft share some technical information, but the European order requires that more information be shared.

Microsoft contends that the European order amounts to an unwarranted and sweeping grab of its intellectual property rights. It also says the unbundling ruling, if imposed, is an assault on its valuable Windows trademark.

''It will be a derivative product that the  European Commission is designing,'' Mr. Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, said. ''It will cause confusion to consumers, and whatever it is, it's not Windows.''
