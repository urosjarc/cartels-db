FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German  chemicals companies BASF AG (BF) and Degussa AG (DGX.XE) expect the  European Commission to announce "shortly" whether they will be  fined for fixing prices for a product used in everything from contact lenses to auto paints.

In August, the commission said it had charged several companies with running a  cartel between 1995 and 2000 in the European market for methacrylate monomers and derivative products. These
products are worth about EUR1.5 billion a year in Europe.

TD
The commission didn't name the charged companies, but BASF, Degussa, France's Arkema SA, (1031383.FR), U.K.-based  Lucite International Ltd. and its former parent company,  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI), conceded they had been charged.

The commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd Tuesday said, "I can confirm there is a  cartel on the agenda tomorrow." Antitrust penalties, including  cartel fines, must be cleared by the commission's 25-member board, which meets on Wednesdays.

A person familiar with the matter said Degussa won't be  fined, since it disclosed the  cartel to the commission and earned immunity. A Degussa spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the case.
A BASF spokesman only said the company expects the  commission to make a decision Wednesday. Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), has a EUR175 million provision on its balance sheet for
possible regulatory penalites. Total has promised to pay 90% of any  fines exceeding that amount.
Arkema hopes its  fine is reduced by the fact that it has fully cooperated with the  commission's
investigation, a company spokesman said.

A spokesman for ICI said the company is awaiting the  commission's decision, but it hasn't been notified about when the decision will come.  Lucite International wasn't immediately reachable for comment.

World-wide, there are about a dozen companies making methacrylates, five of which are based in Europe. Degussa is the largest, with a 35% share of the European market. Lucite International and BASF each control roughly a quarter of the market.

Cartel probes in Europe's chemicals sector are common, according to Paul Teheux, a spokesman for the European Chemistry Industry Council, a lobbying group. "This often happens when you have a very small number of companies making one product for hundreds, if not thousands, of users," he said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European regulators Wednesday  fined acrylic glass makers EUR344.5 million for price-fixing.

Degussa AG (DGX.XE), which blew the whistle on the illegal  cartel in 2002, was granted immunity by the European Commission and wasn't  fined. Arkema SA (1031383.FR) received the largest  fine, of EUR291.4 million.

Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), received a 50% increase in its  fine since it was a repeat offender. The U.K.'s Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) received the second-largest  fine,
EUR91.4 million. That fine also included a 50% hike for a repeat offender.

"I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realize that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," the  commission's top antitrust regulator, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, Kroes has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR344.5 million  fine ranks amongst the most severe penalties the regulator has imposed.

In addition to Arkema and ICI, U.K.-based  Lucite international Ltd. was  fined EUR25 million and Irish group Quinn Barlo, part of the Barlo Group PLC (BGA.YY), was  fined EUR9 million. [ 05-31-06 0612ET

Acrylic glass, known in the industry as polymethyl-methacrylate, is used in a wide range of products, including car headlights, DVDs, and store displays. These products are best known under the trade names Plexiglas, Perspex, Acrylite, Acrylplast and  Lucite.

In December 2002, Degussa disclosed that it was part of a price-fixing ring, and asked the commission for immunity. The  commission said it would have fined Degussa EUR264.5 million has it not disclosed the  cartel.

With Degussa's evidence, the  commission raided the other  cartel members. The regulator found handwritten notes showing the companies met in October 1999 in a Dublin hotel room to coordinate a price increase for acrylic glass sold in  Europe.

The commission's decision could trigger a slew of lawsuits against the companies. In a statement, the regulator said its punishment can be used as evidence in civil cases against the  cartel members.

European regulators Wednesday  fined four acrylic glass makers a total of EUR344.5 million for
price-fixing.

Arkema SA (1031383.FR) received the largest  fine, of EUR219.1 million. The U.K.'s  Imperial              Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) received the second-largest fine, of EUR91.4 million. Both companies received a 50% increase in their  fines since they are repeat cartel offenders.

U.K.-based  Lucite international Ltd. was  fined EUR25 million and Irish group  Quinn Barlo, part of the
Quinn Group Ltd. (BGA.YY), was  fined EUR9 million.

German chemicals giant BASF AG (BF) and Spanish oil company Repsol YPF SA (REP) were suspected of participating in the  cartel, but regulators found no evidence of wrongdoing, the commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), said the  fine won't affect its results, since it has booked a EUR206.5 million provision for antitrust  fines. Total also has agreed to cover 90% of Arkema's  fines above EUR176.5 million. ICI said it is considering whether to file an appeal with a  European court. Quinn Group said it will appeal the  fine.

By Geoff Meade, PA  Europe editor, Brussels

Five companies which ran an illegal price-fixing cartel in the acrylic glass market were  fined more than £240 million by the European Commission today - the fourth largest financial penalty Brussels has ever imposed.

TD
They include UK-based  chemicals giant ICI and Lucite International, whose share of the total  fine was set at about £63 million and £17 million respectively. Quinn Barlo, based in Ireland, Belgium and Germany, was  fined more than £6 million.

The Commission made clear that  Quinn Barlo's parent company,  Quinn Group, only purchased Barlo after the illegal cartel ended.

The five competing companies, whose products are best known under the trade names Plexiglass, Perspex, Acrylite, Acrylpast and Lucite, first met in Dublin's Merrion hotel in 1999 to end their rivalry and fix a joint increase in European price levels, the  Commission revealed.

Handwritten notes obtained by the  Commission's competition experts revealed that the  cartel reached agreement on a price in January 2000.

They also met at tapas bars in Barcelona and, at a meeting in a German hotel in August 2000, decided the rise would be announced in November - by ICI in the UK and Scandinavia, by French company Atofina (now Arkema) in France, Italy and the Benelux countries, and by the German Degussa firm in Germany and Spain.
Degussa got off without a penalty after claiming immunity for whistle-blowing and  Lucite received a
30% 'discount'' for providing the  Commission with evidence.
But ICI and Arkema had their  fines increased by 50% for being 'repeat  cartel offenders', according to a
Commission statement.
'Cartels are a scourge'' said EU Competition Commissioner Nee lie Roes.

'I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down and punished. I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema should have been  fined once again.

'Those  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated.''
Acrylic glass is used in cars, electronics, baths and showers.

The Commission stepped up its anti-cartel campaign last year, assigning a full-time staff of 60 eurocrats to the task of monitoring illegal secret agreements between competitions in various market sectors.

A Commission spokesman said illegal cartels must be rooted out because they shield the involved companies from competition, letting them charge higher prices and 'removing the pressure on them to improve the products they sell or find more efficient ways in which to produce them'.
Page 10 of 83 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said consumers benefit to two ways from  cartel fine decisions: 'The  fines discourage the artificial inflation of product prices - and the money goes back into the Community budget to help keep down taxpayers' contributions to the EU'.

European Commission Decision on Methacrylates

TD
ICI has been informed by the  European Commission ("the Commission") that it has decided to fine the Company ?91.4m (?63m) following an investigation into alleged cartel activity in the European methacrylates market during a period from 1997 to 2002. ICI co-operated fully with the Commission throughout the investigation. The  fine relates to ICI's period of ownership of ICI Acrylics, which ended in 1999 when the business was sold. ICI will make a provision for this  fine in its Q2 2006 Income Statement as a special item.

The Commission's decision relates to five companies, which manufactured and sold acrylic products in the European Economic Area.

Once ICI receives the full decision it will review the  Commission's findings in detail and will consider whether to file an appeal at the  European Court of First Instance. ICI expects to receive the full decision within the next few weeks. ICI will have two months in which to submit any appeal.

Edgy investors gave ICI a wide berth on the expectation that a  European Commission ruling on
chemical price-fixing -in which the British company is implicated through its former acrylics business
-could come as soon as this week.

A weakening of the US dollar -ICI draws a third of its sales from the United States -and a rising oil price could in themselves be considered good reasons for selling the shares yesterday, but ICI also had to contend with concerns that the Commission shortly will announce whether it is fining a clutch of European companies for behaving as a cartel in the pricing of  methacrylates and their derivatives, chemicals that are used in the manufacture of everything from paints to domestic appliances.

TD
The Commission confirmed last August that it had charged a group of companies for  price-fixing activity between 1995 and 2000. Although it declined to name them, they are known to include Degussa and BASF, of Germany, and Arkema, of France, the  chemicals group that two weeks ago was spun off from Total. Of more interest to followers of the London market is the involvement of  Lucite International, the name given to ICI's acrylics business when it was acquired by Charterhouse Development Capital seven years ago for Pounds 505 million.

Given that ICI was the owner for all but three months of the five years under scrutiny by the Commission, it will shoulder any responsibility alongside its continental  European peers. Further, analysts note that a fine can be set at up to 10 per cent of turnover a year divided between members for as long as the cartel was running. ICI closed 13 3/4p lower at 351 3/4p.

The wider market was also in sharp retreat, hurt by a rebound in oil prices and concerns that the new US Treasury Secretary will be tolerant of a weak dollar. The FTSE 100 closed 139.0 points lower at 5,652.0, with high US dollar-earners - Hanson down 38p to 642p, Wolseley off 63p at Pounds 12.02
-conspicuous among the casualties. In contrast, bid speculation continued to buoy ITV, up 1 1/4p to 105
1/4p, and BT Group, 1 1/4p dearer at 230 1/4p. Bearish noises on  European cigarette makers from
Citigroup weighed on the UK sector, with Gallaher -where it moved from "hold" to "sell" -lost 26 1/2p to
817p, and Imperial Tobacco -downgraded from "buy" to "hold" -48p weaker at Pounds 16.22.

Punch Taverns, the pub company that paid Pounds 2.7 billion for Spirit Group in January, frothed 15p higher to 877p amid suggestions that GI Partners, the American private equity firm, is the frontrunner in the Pounds 500 million plus auction for 290 former Spirit pubs. Industry sources insisted that the process was not done and dusted and that Robert Tchenguiz's R20 vehicle was in the running. Mr Tchenguiz,
the underbidder in the original Spirit sale, recently made an abortive Pounds 4.4 billion approach to Mitchells & Butlers and, despite being rebuffed, has quietly built a stake of about 8.5 per cent in M&B, partly through a Luxembourg vehicle.

NEW YORK: Prices slumped on fears that higher petrol prices may be hitting consumer spending. At the close the Dow Jones industrial average was down 184.20 points at 11094.40.

LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc said on Wednesday it had been informed that the European Commission planned to fine it 63 million pounds ($118.4 million).

ICI said the  fine followed an investigation into alleged  cartel activity in the  European methacrylates, or acrylic products, market from 1997 to 2002.

The firm said it would make a provision for the  fine its second-quarter results and would consider launching an appeal.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European regulators Wednesday  fined acrylic glass makers EUR344.5 million for price-fixing.

Degussa AG (DGX.XE), which blew the whistle on the illegal  cartel in 2002, was granted immunity by the European Commission and wasn't  fined. Arkema SA (1031383.FR) received the largest  fine, of EUR291.4 million.

Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), received a 50% increase in its  fine since it was a repeat offender. The U.K.'s Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) received the second-largest  fine,
EUR91.4 million. That fine also included a 50% hike for a repeat offender.

"I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realize that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," the  commission's top antitrust regulator, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, Kroes has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR344.5 million  fine ranks amongst the most severe penalties the regulator has imposed.

In addition to Arkema and ICI, U.K.-based  Lucite international Ltd. was  fined EUR25 million and Irish group Quinn Barlo, part of the Barlo Group PLC (BGA.YY), was  fined EUR9 million. [ 05-31-06 0612ET

Acrylic glass, known in the industry as polymethyl-methacrylate, is used in a wide range of products, including car headlights, DVDs, and store displays. These products are best known under the trade names Plexiglas, Perspex, Acrylite, Acrylplast and  Lucite.

In December 2002, Degussa disclosed that it was part of a price-fixing ring, and asked the commission for immunity. The  commission said it would have fined Degussa EUR264.5 million has it not disclosed the  cartel.

With Degussa's evidence, the  commission raided the other  cartel members. The regulator found handwritten notes showing the companies met in October 1999 in a Dublin hotel room to coordinate a price increase for acrylic glass sold in  Europe.

The commission's decision could trigger a slew of lawsuits against the companies. In a statement, the regulator said its punishment can be used as evidence in civil cases against the  cartel members.

Imperial Chemical Industries was landed with a £63 million European Commission fine today after regulators ruled it had been one of several firms guilty of price-fixing. The fine was part of a e344.5 million (£234 million) penalty imposed on companies adjudged to have run an anti-competitive cartel in the clear plastics market. The others involved include fellow British acrylics producers Lucite and Quinn Barlo, a plastics subsidiary of  Quinn Group, as well as French oil firm Total's chemicals unit Arkema and Germany's Degussa. The latter was not  fined, and ICI said it may appeal. The investigation found representatives of the firms were helped to co-ordinate prices after twice meeting to exchange competitively sensitive information.

BRUSSELS, May 31, 2006 (AFP) -

The European Union's competition watchdog slapped its fourth-biggest ever  fine on five European chemical  firms Wednesday for violating EU competitions rules by running an industrial plastics cartel.

TD
The European Commission found Arkema (formerly Atofina), Degussa, ICI,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo
(formerly Barlo) guilty of running a  cartel on the market for acrylic glass.

As a consequence it levied a 344.5 million  euro fine on them for  price fixing  which it said continued between 1997 and 2002.

"Cartels are a scourge. I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down, and punished," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, adding she was "shocked" that firms like ICI and Arkema had been fined again.
Arkema and ICI had their  fines increased by 50 percent as they are repeat offenders.

"These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," she added.

BRUSSELS (XFN-ASIA) - The  European Commission said it has fined four chemical  companies, Arkema SA -- formerly a unit of Total SA's Elf Aquitaine -- Lucite, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and Quinn Barlo, 344.5 mln eur for participation in an acrylic glass cartel.
It is the fourth-largest  cartel fine imposed by the commission.
Degussa AG was not  fined since it disclosed the  cartel to the commission and earned immunity. Arkema was fined 219.1 mln eur,  Lucite 25.0 mln, ICI 91.4 mln and  Quinn Barlo 9 mln.

debt mountain, Jacques Gounon, the chairman, told a news conference.
The debt mountain will be slashed by 3.3 bln stg to 2.9 bln stg or 4.2 bln eur, he said.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European regulators Wednesday  fined acrylic glass makers EUR344.5 million for price-fixing.

Degussa AG (DGX.XE), which blew the whistle on the illegal  cartel in 2002, was granted immunity by the European Commission and wasn't  fined. Arkema SA (1031383.FR) received the largest fine, of EUR291.4 million.

Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), received a 50% increase in its  fine since it was a repeat offender. The U.K.'s Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) received the second-largest fine, EUR91.4 million. That fine also included a 50% hike for a repeat offender.

"I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realize that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," the  commission's top antitrust regulator, Neelie Kroes, said in a statement.

Since taking office at the end of 2004, Kroes has cracked down on cartels in markets ranging from chemicals to tobacco. The EUR344.5 million  fine ranks amongst the most severe penalties the regulator has imposed.
In addition to Arkema and ICI, U.K.-based  Lucite international Ltd. was fined EUR25 million and
Irish group Quinn Barlo, part of the Barlo Group PLC (BGA.YY), was fined EUR9 million. [ 05-31-06

Acrylic glass, known in the industry as polymethyl-methacrylate, is used in a wide range of products, including car headlights, DVDs, and store displays. These products are best known under the trade names Plexiglas, Perspex, Acrylite, Acrylplast and  Lucite.

In December 2002, Degussa disclosed that it was part of a price-fixing ring, and asked the commission for immunity. The  commission said it would have fined Degussa EUR264.5 million has it not disclosed the  cartel.

With Degussa's evidence, the  commission raided the other  cartel members. The regulator found handwritten notes showing the companies met in October 1999 in a Dublin hotel room to coordinate a price increase for acrylic glass sold in  Europe.

The commission's decision could trigger a slew of lawsuits against the companies. In a statement, the regulator said its punishment can be used as evidence in civil cases against the  cartel members.

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Imperial Chemical Industries has been informed by the  European                 Commission that it has decided to fine the Company EUR91.4 million (GBP63 million) following an investigation into alleged  cartel activity in the  European methacrylates market during a period from
1997 to 2002.

TD
ICI co-operated fully with the  Commission throughout the investigation. The  fine relates to ICI's period of ownership of ICI Acrylics, which ended in 1999 when the business was sold. ICI will make a provision for this  fine in its Q2, 2006 Income Statement as a special item.

The Commission's decision relates to five companies, which manufactured and sold acrylic products in the European Economic Area.

Once ICI receives the full decision it will review the  Commission's findings in detail and will consider whether to file an appeal at the  European Court of First Instance. ICI expects to receive the full decision within the next few weeks. ICI will have two months in which to submit any appeal. [ 31-05-06

HD            Quinn Barlo Intends To Appeal EU Price Fixing Ruling

DUBLIN (Dow Jones)--Ireland's  Quinn Group Ltd., parent company of  Quinn Barlo, said Wednesday that it will appeal  European union regulators' decision to  fine the group EUR9 million for  price fixing.

The European Commission earlier Wednesday imposed  fines of about EUR344.5 million on four companies for fixing prices of acrylic glass over a six-year period.

TD
But a spokesman for the  Quinn Group, which acquired Barlo Group PLC (BGA.YY) in May 2004, told
Dow Jones Newswires it intends to appeal the decision.

"The Quinn Group had no involvement whatsoever in the alleged infringement and is a respondent to the proceedings purely as a consequence of its acquisition of Barlo," the spokesman said.
The spokesman said the alleged infringement took place between 1998 and 2000, and said  Quinn
Barlo only learnt of the E.U. investigation after the acquisition had been completed. [ 31-05-06
1547GMT ]

Founded in 1973, the  Quinn Group offers financial services, operates hotels and pubs, manufactures construction materials like cement, concrete and tarmac, and also supplies plastics through  Quinn Barlo.

Quinn's fine only amounts to around 3% of the total fines imposed by the E.U.  Commission in this case; the U.K.'s  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI), fined EUR91.4 million, has said it will consider an appeal.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European regulators Wednesday  fined four acrylic glass makers a total of
EUR344.5 million for price-fixing.

TD
Arkema SA (1031383.FR) received the largest  fine, of EUR219.1 million. The U.K.'s  Imperial              Chemical Industries PLC (ICI) received the second-largest fine, of EUR91.4 million. Both companies received a 50% increase in their  fines since they are repeat cartel offenders.

U.K.-based  Lucite international Ltd. was  fined EUR25 million and Irish group  Quinn Barlo, part of the
Quinn Group Ltd. (BGA.YY), was  fined EUR9 million.

German chemicals giant BASF AG (BF) and Spanish oil company Repsol YPF SA (REP) were suspected of participating in the  cartel, but regulators found no evidence of wrongdoing, the commission's antitrust spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

Arkema, a recent spin-off from Total SA (TOT), said the  fine won't affect its results, since it has booked a EUR206.5 million provision for antitrust  fines. Total also has agreed to cover 90% of Arkema's  fines above EUR176.5 million. ICI said it is considering whether to file an appeal with a  European court. Quinn Group said it will appeal the  fine.

HD        French Arkema To Pay 219 Mln Euro for Price Fixing

The European Commission (EC) imposed a fine of 219.1 mln  euro ($282 mln) on French chemical group Arkema for acrylic glass  price-fixing agreements with four other  European sector companies, it was reported on May 31, 2006.

Three of the companies, precisely UK ICI Group,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo, were  fined with 91.4 mln euro ($118 mln), 25.02 mln  euro ($32 mln) and 9.0 mln euro ($11.6 mln) respectively. The EC increased the fines of Arkema and ICI by 50 pct because they were repeat offenders.

TD
German specialty chemicals group Degussa AG was exempted from paying a  fine, which would have totalled 264.48 mln euro ($340 mln), because it was the first to give information about the cartel. The five companies agreed in October 1999, to raise the prices per kg of acrylic glass sheets by 0.1 euro ($0.13), and exchanged important confidential information in the  European Economic Area (EEA) between 1997 and 2002.

Acrylic glass is widely used for the manufacture of cars, optical media, household appliances, electronics, baths and showers, the EC said.

Five companies which ran an illegal price-fixing cartel in the acrylic glass market were  fined more than £240 million by the European Commission yesterday - the fourth largest financial penalty Brussels has ever imposed. They include UK-based  chemicals giant ICI and  Lucite International, whose share of the total  fine was set at £63 million and £17 million respectively.

In view of its role as a witness, Degussa, the German special  chemicals group, will not now be forced by the EU Commission to pay a fine of 264.5m  euros in connection with an unlawful  price fixing  case, dating from the years 1997 to 2002 and involving four acrylic glass manufacturers.
The fines will apply to Arkema, formerly a subsidiary of French oil and gas group Total, the UK groups ICI
and Lucite and the Irish group  Quinn Barlo together with German and Belgian subsidiaries.

BRUSSELS, May 31 -- The  European Commission issued one of its largest  fines against a cartel
on Wednesday when it found five acrylic glass makers guilty of colluding and fixing prices.

Arkema of France, formerly known as Atofina; Imperial Chemical Industries and the  Lucite International Group of Britain; and  Quinn Barlo of Ireland were fined a total of 344.5 million  euros ($443 million). Degussa of Germany also participated in the cartel but was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, which ran for five years, and it cooperated in the regulators' investigation, the commission said.

TD
Acrylic glass is sold under trade names like Perspex and Plexiglas and is used in lenses, electronic goods and showers.

Arkema was fined the most, reflecting its central role in coordinating the collusion and because it had previously been found guilty of cartel involvement, the  commission said in a statement. The  fines for Arkema and Imperial Chemical were increased by 50 percent because they were repeat offenders.

Degussa reported the cartel to the commission at the end of 2002 and admitted its role in the arrangement. The commission, which acts as the  European Union's top antitrust authority, said it raided all the companies identified by Degussa and found evidence that the rivals met to fix prices in a hotel in Ireland in 1999, and met in a hotel in Germany the next year.

Imperial Chemical said it was considering appealing the ruling and the  fine. It also said it would
make a provision for the  fine as a special item in its profit statement for the second quarter. The other
companies were not immediately available to comment.

BASF of Germany and Repsol of Spain were implicated but not fined, said Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for competition matters at the European Commission. ''We could not find them guilty of breaking the competition rules.''

THE European Commission fined ICI, the manufacturer of Dulux paint, and three other companies a total of Euro 344.5 million (Pounds 236 million) yesterday after they were found guilty of operating a cartel for acrylic glass for more than five years.

The penalty is the fourth-highest imposed on companies that ignore  European Union antitrust rules, underlining the  Commission's determination to clamp down on illegal collusion that stifles competition.

TD
Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "Cartels are a scourge. I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down and punished. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies."

Ms Kroes said that two of the  fined businesses, ICI and Arkema, of France, were repeat offenders. ICI has had to pay Euro 11 million to the  Commission after being caught operating cartels for polypropylene in 1986 and PVC in 1994.
In a statement, ICI said that it had co-operated with the Commission inquiry, which had centred on its
ICI Acrylics unit, which it had sold in 1999. ICI has provided for its Euro 91.4 million fine in its
second-quarter income statement and may contest the ruling. A spokesman said: "We are definitely
disappointed. We do not believe this reflects the products and performance of today's ICI. We have
done an enormous amount over a long period to raise standards of governance and compliance."

The inquiry began in 2002 after Degussa, of Germany, disclosed the  cartel, avoiding a Euro 264.5 million fine. The inquiry found that representatives of the five companies met in Dublin in 1999 to fix the European price of acrylic glass.
The cartel ran from 1997 to 2002.
Arkema, part of Total, was fined Euro 219 million, Lucite International, the British  chemical  company,
Euro 25 million and Ireland's Quinn Group Euro 9 million.

Ici has been fined £63m by the European Commission for its part in an alleged  price-fixing cartel.
The chemical  giant said the  fine followed an investigation into alleged  cartel activity in the  European
acrylic products market from 1997 to 2002.

TD
It is now planning to make a provision for the  fine in its second-quarter results and has said it will consider launching an appeal. Fellow UK company Lucite International was  fined £17m with Quinn Barlo, based in Ireland, Belgium and Germany, was fined more than £6m.

France's Arkema received a £150m  fine while Germany's Degussa got off without a penalty after claiming immunity for whistle-blowing.

The five competing companies first met in Dublin's Merrion hotel in 1999 to end their rivalry and fix a joint increase in European price levels, the Commission said. Handwritten notes obtained by the Commission's competition experts revealed that the cartel reached agreement on a price in January
2000.

They also met at tapas bars in Barcelona and, at a meeting in a German hotel in August 2000, decided the rise would be announced in November.

Lucite received a 30% "discount" for providing the  Commission with evidence.

The European Commission imposed fines of about $442-million (U.S.) yesterday on four companies for fixing prices over a six-year period on acrylic glass, which is widely used in cars, household appliances and DVDs. French oil company Total SA's  chemical  unit Arkema was  fined €219-million ($309-million Canadian) — the fourth-largest  fine levied by the EU in such a case. Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC was ordered to pay €91-million, British chemical  company Lucite International Group Holding Ltd. was  fined €25-million and Ireland's Quinn Group Ltd. has to pay
€9-million. A fifth company, Germany's Degussa SA, escaped a €264-million  fine because it was the first to blow the whistle on the  cartel. FP (Paris) rose 25  euro cents to €50.60. ICI (London) rose 6.75 pence to £3.58 ($7.37). DGX (Frankfurt) fell 3  euro cents to €44.85. AP

HD         ICI fined pounds  63m for its part in European glass price fixing

The chemicals group ICI and three other  European companies were yesterday hit with the
fourth-largest cartel fine in EU history after an investigation into price fixing by the European            
commission.
ICI's pounds 63m  fine is its fourth in almost four decades. It has previously paid out a total of  euros
11m (pounds 7.5m) in EC  fines. ICI said it would account for the  fine in its second quarter income
statement this year but added that it was awaiting the full decision from the  commission before
considering whether to appeal at the  European court of first instance.

TD
The commission said it was fining the UK group and other acrylic glass makers -  Lucite in the UK, Arkema of France and  Quinn Barlo - a total of  euros 344.5m for fixing prices and exchanging commercially important and confidential information between 1997 and 2002.

Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, said: "Cartels are a scourge. I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down and punished. I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated."

ICI was previously  fined for infringing  European competition law during the 1960s and 1980s. Out of seven cases against the company, three resulted in  fines, three decisions were annulled and one has been ongoing since 1989. A company spokesman said: "Since then ICI has undertaken a radical restructuring which has made it a very different company from before, both in terms of its size and the nature of its businesses."
For repeat offending, ICI had its  fine increased by 50%. The company's  fine relates to its ownership of
Lucite, formerly ICI Acrylics, before it was acquired by Charterhouse Development Capital in 1999.

German company Degussa, also a repeat offender, received immunity from  fines for being the first to provide information about its involvement in the  cartel in 2002. It was disclosed by the  commission that the competitors met in October 1999 to coordinate an increase in the  European price level for acrylic glass, widely used in cars, DVDs, lenses, household appliances and bathroom fixtures. They met again in August the next year to plan another  price fixing.

Chemical makers including ICI, Arkema and  Lucite International were yesterday  fined EUR344.5m (£236m) for fixing the price of acrylic glass used in DVDs, car parts and household appliances. They had forged a cartel that met in hotel rooms and tapas bars.

In total yesterday's  fine was the fourth largest imposed by  European regulators in a price-fixing case, with the EUR91.4m slapped on ICI the ninth most costly penalty for a  cartel offence.

The companies met in the Mer-rion Hotel in Dublin in October 1999 and the Hatterer's Hotel in Deidesheim, Germany, in August the following year, as well as tapas bars in Barcelona. At the meetings, at which official records or hand-written notes were taken, the companies exchanged commercially sensitive information and agreed and monitored prices for the material.

The scam ran between 1997 and 2002, ending only because the German  chemical  giant Degussa tipped off  European regulators.

For that Degussa escaped punishment, while Arkema, its former parent Total and related businesses received the highest  fine of EUR219 .1m. The UK's  Lucite International Group Holdings Ltd - which co-operated with the regulator - was  fined EUR25m and the Irish group  Quinn Barlo, EUR9m.
The penalties against Arkema and ICI were doubled for being "repeat offenders", the commission
said. Earlier this month it penalised seven hydrogen peroxide makers for price-fixing

ICI said that it is considering an appeal. All  cartel decisions can be contested in front of the Court of First Instance and then the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  Quinn Group, the parent company of Quinn Barlo, is also likely to appeal as it says it was not aware of the  cartel until after it bought Barlo Group Plc in a hostile takeover in May 2004.

The European Commission has imposed fines totaling €344.6 million ($442 million) for  price fixing on five acrylic glass producers, including Arkema, which was part of Elf Aquitaine and, later, Total at the time of the offences.
Total recently hived off its Arkema (formely Atofina)  chemicals division, and shares began trading in
Paris May 18.

TD
The fines were imposed days after the commission mounted a series of raids on energy firms suspected of anticompetitive activity, and after European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that offenders are  fined less severely when they provide evidence against fellow price fixers (IOD May31,p8). "Cartels are a scourge," Kroes said on Wednesday.

Arkema, Degussa, ICI,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo (formerly Barlo) participated in the price-fixing cartel between 1997 and 2002, according to the  commission. Four -- Arkema, Lucite, ICI and Quinn Barlo -- were subject to the  fines.

Arkema and ICI had their  fines increased by 50% for being repeat offenders, but Arkema's was subsequently reduced for passing on some information to the  commission.

Degussa, also a repeat offender, would have been  fined €264.5 million but had its fine waived under the commission's leniency regime for being first to provide information about the cartel.

Even with a 40% reduction, the  fine imposed on Arkema amounts to over €219.1 million ($282 million). The  commission said that corresponding legal entities may be held jointly and severally responsible for the whole or part of the  fine imposed.
Total said it was studying the  commission's sentence, but had no further comment.

HD             EU fines Quinn Barlo €9m for role in price fixing cartel. BY              Jamie Smyth in Brussels

The European Commission yesterday fined plastics and heating group  Quinn Barlo €9 million for its part in a cartel that illegally fixed the price of acrylic glass.
Three other companies were also  fined for their role in the  cartel, which dates back to the late
1990s, when executives met in a Dublin hotel to exchange sensitive data and fix prices.

TD
The total  fines imposed by the commission in the case are €344.56 million, the fourth highest ever imposed by the EU in a price fixing  and cartel case.
The other companies affected in the case are: Arkema, which was spun off this month from the
French oil firm Total; British  chemicals company firm ICI, and British acrylics producer  Lucite.

A fifth company involved in the acrylic glass  cartel, Germany's Degussa, was spared a  fine after it took advantage of the EU leniency programme created for firms that provide information about  price fixing.

"These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes in a statement announcing the  fines.

Acrylic glass is widely used in cars, DVDs, lenses and household appliances.  Quinn Barlo, which was formed when the  Quinn Group completed a hostile takeover of Barlo in May 2004, said it intended to appeal the decision by the  commission.

In a statement, the company said it had only become aware of the cartel investigation by the commission after it had paid €84 million for Barlo in May 2004. "The Quinn Group had no involvement whatsoever of the alleged infringement," it said.

The commission's investigation found that the five companies had agreed, fixed and monitored prices for acrylic glass, and exchanged commercially important and confidential information in the EU between 1997 and 2002.

It pinpointed a meeting in a Dublin hotel in October 1999 between the competing firms at which officials co-ordinated an increase in the  European price level for types of acrylic glass widely used in the car industry for the production of tail lamps and glass for dashboards.

Handwritten notes obtained by the  commission showed the participants agreed on a price increase for the acrylic glass as of January 2000, with an announcement of the increase in November for the European market, the  commission said. Company executives also met in Germany in 2000 to plot another co-ordinated price rise.

The decision notes that any person affected by the anti-competitive behaviour may seek damages before national courts using elements of the decision as evidence. This may leave the firms cited open to further losses.

French oil group Total and its former chemicals subsidiary, Arkema, are among five chemicals companies which were fined a total of 344m euros yesterday by the European Commission for price    fixing.  The Commission has found that, along with Degussa of Germany, Ireland's Quinn Barlo and the UK companies ICI and Lucite, the two French firms conspired to fix the price of acrylic glass on the European market between 1997 and 2002.

Arkema, which has already been found guilty of price-fixing on the markets for PVC, polypropylene and hydrogen peroxide, received the heaviest  fine (219m euros), which it shares with its parent company. Both Total and Arkema stress, however, that the  fine will not have a detrimental effect on their finances: between them, they have set aside provisions for that sum in their accounts.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission imposes  fines of 344 million euro for price fixing  in acrylic glass sector

Brussels, 31/05/2006 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday, the Commission imposed its fourth largest  fine
ever on five acrylic glass manufacturers for participating in a cartel. Acrylic glass or
polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA), best known under trade names such as Plexiglas, Perspex and
Acrylite, has various uses, particularly in cars, DVDs, contact lenses, household goods, electronics, baths
and showers. Between 1997 and 2002, Arkema (formerly Atofina), ICI, Lucite, Quinn Barlo and Degussa
agreed on prices and exchanged confidential information in the European Economic Area, the
Commission found following an inquiry. The first four companies mentioned were  fined a total of 344.5
million euro, while Degussa was granted full immunity, after providing important information to the inquiry
(the German company would otherwise have faced a  fine of almost 265 million  euro).

TD
Because they also cooperated, French firm Arkema and British Firm  Lucite (25 million euro) also saw their fines reduced, but the French company, which is a repeat offender, will nonetheless have to pay the highest amount of all, more than 219 million euro. ICI, another United Kingdom company which is also a re-offender, was  fined over 91 million euro, and Quinn Barlo will have to pay 9 million  euro in fines. Since the Quinn group only purchased Barlo after the end of the infringement, the ultimate parent company (Quinn Group Ltd) was not an addressee of the decision, said the  Commission in a press release.

The Commission inquiry showed that those involved met several times in hotels to plan coordinated price rises in January and November 2000. After exchanging information on their prices, the competitors agreed to raise the prices per kg sheets by 0.10  euro and also discussed the charges for extra services, like cutting and dying of sheets. “I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again,” said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes. She went on, “These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated”.

DEAL
MAKER

TD
API Group, which manufactures specialised packaging and security products, might soon come back into play. Last year, it received a bid from US giant Illinois Tool Works.

It is understood the deal was hampered by Steel Partners, the activist fund which is a major shareholder in API. Steel Partners -which is working with Carl Icahn on his bid for KT&G Corp, South Korea's biggest tobacco company - was thought to be against a bid that wasn't higher than 215p a share.

However, it's now understood that the fund, which is run by financier Warren Lichtenstein, has signalled to the company that it would not stand in the way of an offer for API.

Whispers abound of a potential counter-bidder to Goldman Sachs' pounds 2.4bn conditional offer for Associated British Ports. One rumour is that private equity fund 3i has been studying a possible counter-bid now that Goldman has been given access for due diligence on AB Ports.

Bankers say 3i is eyeing several infrastructure assets for its own infrastructure fund. It's highly unlikely that 3i would bid for AB Ports on its own but it is possible the firm could team up with others.

Const-ruction corporate financier Tim Blois, of Grant Thornton, yesterday completed the management buyout of construction group John Doyle for an undisclosed sum.

In retail, Aiden Clegg of UBS advised HMV on its recommended pounds 62m cash offer for book chain Ottakar's. John Craven of Bridgewell Securities advised Ottakar's on the deal.
BAD DAY ICI

Chemicals  giant ICI has been  fined pounds 63m by the European Commission over alleged cartel
activity.

The company said it had been informed that the EC planned to levy the fine, following an investigation into alleged  cartel activity in the European methacrylates, or acrylic products, market from 1997 to 2002.
The UK group said it would make a provision for the  fine and, once it had reviewed the
Commission's findings, would consider launching an appeal.
ICI said it had co-operated fully with the  Commission throughout the investigation. The fine relates to ICI Acrylics, which ICI sold in 1999.

The EC said it had also fined three other companies, Arkema,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo. It is the fourth largest cartel fine imposed by the EC. A fifth company, Degussa, received immunity from fines by acting as whistleblower.
Acrylic glass is used in products including cars, DVDs and household appliances. ICI shares rose
6.75 to 358.5p.
GOOD DAY
CALEDONIA INVESTMENTs

Caledonia Investments said its net asset value rose 33.6pc last year to pounds 20.61, as it confirmed plans to return cash to share-holders. The investment group said it would return up to pounds 128m
to shareholders via a special dividend and capital reduction. The special dividend will be on the basis of one new share for every 10 held.

Chief executive Tim Ingram, pictured, said: "Notwithstanding recent market volatility, we continue to see interesting investment opportunities, particularly in the unquoted sector.''
Caledonia said its total return had outperformed the FTSE by 152pc over five years.

Peter Buckley, the chairman, said: "We have been fortunate to enjoy a long run of good performance, but market highs have recently suffered an unsurprising check.''

He said while not immune from market downturns, the group's long held investment strategy was less susceptible to the market cycle.
The shares rose 48p to pounds 18.78.

HD       CHEMICALS : FIVE ACRYLIC GLASS MANUFACTURERS FINED FOR RUNNING CARTEL WC     485 words

The European Commission cracked down on chemicals groups Arkema, Degussa, ICI,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo for cartel activity between 1997 and 2002 in the acrylic glass sector, fining the companies a total of 344,562,500 on 31 May. But repeat offenders Arkema (formerly Atofina) and ICI both had their fines doubled to 219,131,250 and 91,406,250 respectively to account for the fact that they are repeat offenders.

Arkema's steep  fine accounted for a reduction given under the Commission's leniency programme because it provided useful information about the cartel. Lucite's fine was also cut (to 9,000,000) under the leniency scheme, whilst Degussa avoided a fine altogether receiving full immunity for being the first company to confess to Brussels.

TD
Acrylic glass (polymethyl-methacrylate) is used to make car headlamps, tail-lights, dashboards and household appliances such as DVDs and bath tubs.

Degussa applied to the  Commission for leniency in December 2002 and the  Commission then carried out a series of raids on the companies which revealed that they had fixed and monitored prices between
1997 and 2002.

The Commission uncovered evidence that the companies representatives had met in a Dublin hotel room in October 1999 where they fixed the European price level for acrylic glass moulding compounds. The different companies dealt with the price-fixing in their own markets: Atofina announced the price rise in France, Italy and Benelux, Degussa in Germany and Spain and ICI announced the hike in the UK and Scandinavia.

As they are all part of the same legal entity, French companies Total, Elf Aquitaine, Altuglas and Altumax are all jointly and severally liable for Arkema's  fine.

The variety in the distribution of the  fines to the different companies depending on the amount and timing of information volunteered to the EU anti-trust authorities will be scrutinised by other sectors currently under the Commission's spotlight for potential cartel activity. Most notably the energy sector is currently the subject of a huge investigatory effort. In May, the Commission carried out dawn raids on 20 sites in six member states in connection with alleged anti-competitive behaviour, and did not rule out the possibility that it suspected  cartel activity. Subsequently further follow up raids were carried out in Germany this week.

The Commission is currently internally reviewing the basis on which it can offer reductions of  fines to companies volunteering information under the leniency programme. At the moment, the system is relatively rigid, with the first company coming forward being the only one with the chance of obtaining full indemnity from  fines in respect of the  cartel. Firms in the US have more scope to barter information in exchange for indemnity.

Describing cartels as «a scourge», Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was «shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again».

Billingham-based acrylics manufacturer Lucite is among five firms to be  fined by the European         Commission for running an illegal price-fixing cartel in the acrylic glass market.

The £240m combined penalty is the fourth largest Brussels has ever imposed following its investigation of  price fixing  over a five year period from 1997 to 2002.

TD
Lucite, which operates from the Cassel Works site, was  fined £17m following a 30pc "discount" for providing the Commission with evidence.

Chemicals  giant ICI, which sold  Lucite, formerly known as Ineos Acrylics, to Charterhouse
Development Capital six years ago, took the major share of the  fine at £63m.
Other offenders included  Quinn Barlo, Arkema and German firm Degussa, which was spared a  fine
after claiming immunity for whistle blowing.

The five competing companies, first met in Dublin's Merrion hotel in 1999 to end their rivalry and fix a joint increase in European price levels, the  Commission revealed.

Handwritten notes obtained by the  Commission revealed that the  cartel reached agreement on a price in January 2000.
EU Competition Commissioner Nee lie Roes said that he considered cartels "a scourge." "Cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," he added.
Acrylic glass is used in cars, electronics, baths and showers.

A spokesman for  Lucite said: "Lucite International has co-operated fully with the  Commission's investigation and will now review its findings."
ICI said it may consider filing an appeal.

Leading Spanish petrochemicals group Repsol YPF has been spared a fine imposed by the European    Commission on four chemicals companies found guilty of acting as a cartel. The four companies - Quin Barlo, ICI, Lucite and Arkema - have been given a total  fine of 344.56m euros, the fourth-largest  fine
ever imposed in the history of the  European Union. Repsol YPF, which was included among the companies that received notification of the charge of being part of the  cartel, as well as German chemicals group BASF, escaped a  fine. According to  European competition authorities, these four companies fixed prices and exchanged confidential information on the acrylic crystal market between
1997 and 2002.

TD
According to  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd, these two companies were able to demonstrate that they were not involved in the operation in the same capacity as the four that were  fined. Separately, the chairman of Repsol YPF, Antoni Brufau, has called for an extension of the period for the exploitation of its reserves in Ecuador in return for an increase in its taxation burden there.

The European Union's top antitrust regulator on Wednesday imposed  fines totalling ?344.6m ($441.9m) on four  chemical  groups for operating a  cartel in the market for plexiglas and similar acrylic glass products.

French oil group Total's Arkema unit was hardest hit, with a  fine of ?219.1m. Britain's ICI was ordered to pay ?91.4m. Lucite, another UK group, was  fined ?25m and Quinn Barlo of Ireland ?9m. Both Arkema and ICI saw fines increased by 50 per cent because of convictions in other  cartel cases.

TD
Degussa, the German  chemical  group and another member of the cartel, escaped punishment because it blew the whistle on its co-conspirators. The Commission said Degussa would otherwise have faced the highest individual  fine of all the  cartel members, ?264.5m.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: "Cartels are a scourge. I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated."
The Commission said it had obtained handwritten notes of a meeting in a Dublin hotel room in October
1999, at which the companies agreed to raise their prices as of January 2000.

Acrylic glass is used for a wide range of products, including headlamps and tail-lights, for optical media such as DVDs and lenses and household products such as baths and showers. . The EU market for acrylic glass products is worth some ?665m a year, a  Commission spokesman said.

Wednesday's total  fine was the fourth-highest ever imposed by the  Commission in a cartel case, and comes less than a month after the regulator slapped  fines totalling ?388m on another chemicals cartel. Again, Degussa had blown the whistle on the illegal arrangement and so escaped a fine of ?130m.

The European Union's top antitrust regulator yesterday imposed  fines totalling  Euros 344.6m (Dollars
441.9m) on four  chemical  groups for operating a  cartel in the market for plexiglas and similar acrylic
glass products.

Lucite, another UK group, was fined Euros 25m and Quinn Barlo of Ireland Euros 9m. Both Arkema and ICI saw  fines increased by 50 per cent because of convictions in other cartel cases.

TD
Degussa, a German  chemical  group and another member of the  cartel, escaped punishment because it blew the whistle on its co-conspirators. The Commission said Degussa would otherwise have been made to pay Euros 264.5m - the highest single fine of all the members.

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said: "Cartels are a scourge. I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated."
The Commission said it had obtained handwritten notes of a meeting in a Dublin hotel room in October
1999, at which the companies agreed to raise their prices as of January 2000.

"Records of a meeting at a hotel in Germany in August 2000 reveal that the meeting focused on a co-ordinated price increase for November 2000," it added.

Acrylic glass is used for a wide range of products, including headlamps and tail-lights, for optical media such as DVDs and lenses and household products such as baths and showers. The EU market for acrylic glass products is worth about  Euros 665m a year, a Commission spokesman said.

Yesterday's total  fine was the fourth-highest imposed by the Commission in a cartel case, and comes less than a month after the regulator slapped  fines totalling Euros 388m on another chemicals cartel. Again, Degussa had blown the whistle on the illegal arrangement and so escaped a fine of Euros 130m
- meaning the company saved itself nearly  Euros 400m in cartel fines in the space of four weeks.

HD     Hefty fines for acrylic  price fixing.(MATERIALS MARKETPLACE) WC    835 words

EUROPE's major producers of acrylic sheet and moulding compounds have been fined heavily by the European Union for price fixing.  Degussa, Arkema, ICI,  Lucite International and Quinn/Barlo were  fined a total of 344,562,500 [euro], the fourth largest penalty imposed by the  European Union in a long list of cartel-busting actions.

The price fixing  started in a Dublin hotel room in 1999 when the EU says competitors met to co-ordinate an increase in the European price level for PMMA moulding compounds. Handwritten notes show that the participants agreed on a price increase for PMMA as of January 2000 with an announcement of the increase in November for the  European market. It was agreed that Atofina (now Arkema) would announce the increase in France, Italy and Benelux, ICI in the UK and Scandinavia and Degussa in Germany and Spain.

TD
Records of another meeting in a German hotel room in 2000 reveal that the meeting focused on a coordinated price increase for November 2000, says the European Commission. The competitors, after exchanging details of their prices, agreed to raise the price of sheet by 0.10 [euro]/kg and also discussed the charges for extra services like cutting and dyeing.

The largest  fine, of 264,468,750 [euro], was imposed on Degussa/Rohm/ParaChemie but not actually levied as the company was given immunity for being the first to provide information about the  cartel. The French grouping of Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema/Altuglas and Altumax also had their  fines reduced for
co-operating by 40 per cent to 219,131,250 [euro]--although Arkema had its  fine increased by 50 per cent because it was a repeat offender.  Lucite had its fine cut by 30 per cent to 25,025,000 [euro]. ICI, with Arkema a repeat  cartel offender, also had a 50 per cent increase added to its  fine to cost it 91,406,250 [euro].

Barlo Group was  fined 9 million [euro] as part of  Quinn Barlo and Quinn Plastics, but the  Commission said it had not linked its judgement with  Quinn Group because the group only purchased Barlo after the end of the infringement.

Fines totalling 344.6 million euro (US$441.9 million) were yesterday imposed by the European Union's (EU) top regulator on four chemical  groups. They were found to have operated a cartel in the market for plexiglas and similar acrylic glass products. The largest fine of 219.1 million euro went to French firm Total's Arkema unit. Two U.K. firms, ICI and  Lucite, were fined 91.4 million euro and 25 million euro, respectively. Ireland's  Quinn Barlo was hit with a 9 million euro fine. Germany's Degussa was spared as it blew the whistle on the others. It would have faced a 264.5 million euro fine otherwise. This is not the first time that ICI and Arkema have been fined, which suggests that cartel behaviour has been relatively widespread in the  chemicals industry. The European Commission's case rested partially on notes of a meeting held in Dublin in October 1999. The firms agreed to raise their prices from January 2000, and a similar meeting was held in August 2000 in Germany.

TD
The total acrylic glass market in the EU is worth some 665 million euro annually.Significance: The  fines were exceptionally heavy – the fourth-largest imposed by the Commission in a cartel case to date – and serve as a powerful warning to other firms. Degussa's whistle-blowing has saved the firm a huge  fine, as it did a month ago when a 388 million  euro fine was imposed on separate  cartel.

HD         Europe: European Commission fines glass cartel members

The European Commission (EC) has decided to  fine Arkema (formerly Atofina), Degussa, ICI,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo (formerly Barlo) for violating the EC Treaty ban on restrictive business practices (Article 81) by participating in a  cartel on the market for acrylic glass.

Four of these companies - Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema,  Lucite, ICI and Quinn Barlo - were fined a total of €344.56m (US$441.57m). As Arkema and ICI are repeat offenders, their fines were increased by
50%.

TD
Degussa is also a repeat offender, but received full immunity under the  Commission's leniency regime for being first to provide information about the  cartel. The five companies agreed, fixed and monitored prices for acrylic glass and exchanged commercially important and confidential information in the European Economic Area (EEA) between 1997 and 2002.

"I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again. These  fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies, who have to realise that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated," said Neelie Kroes, Competition Commissioner.

Acrylic glass or polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is mainly used in the automotive industry for the production of headlamps, tail-lights and glass for dashboards as well as household appliances, optical media (DVDs, lenses) and electronics.

The EC's investigations proved that executives from the fined companies met in a hotel room in Dublin, Ireland, in October 1999 to co-ordinate an increase in the European price level for PMMA-moulding compounds. The participants agreed to increase the price of PMMA as of January 2000, with an announcement of the increase in November for the European market. It was also agreed that Atofina would announce the increase in France, Italy and the Benelux countries; ICI in the UK and Scandinavia; and Degussa in Germany and Spain.

The total of the  fines imposed in this case is considered to be the fourth largest  fine ever imposed on a given cartel.

THE EUROPEAN Commission has imposed fines totaling ?344.6 million ($443.5 million) on four producers of poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) who were found to be participating in a  cartel on the market for acrylic glass.
The firms were acrylics producer Arkema, and its previous owners Total and Elf Aquitaine; Lucite; ICI;
and Quinn Barlo. Arkema was  fined ?219.1 million, ICI ?91.4 million,  Lucite ?25 million and Quinn Barlo
?9 million.

TD
The fine against French producer Arkema was the fourth largest imposed by the  Commission in a cartel
case. The overall  fine was also the fourth largest by sector.  PMMA, or acrylic glass, is used in products
as diverse as DVDs and baths.

German specialty chemicals company Degussa, which the  Commission said was also a repeat offender, would have been fined ?264.5 million but received full immunity as it was the first to provide information about the cartel.

UK-headquartered ICI said it would make a provision for the fine in its second quarter 2006 accounts and consider an appeal when it had full details of the commission?s findings.
The commission said it increased ICI and Arkema?s  fines by 50% as they were repeat  cartel offenders. The EC said the five companies agreed to fix and monitor prices for poly methyl  methacrylate in the ?665
million European market between 1997 and 2002. The competitors, it said, exchanged price details and
agreed to raise prices per kilogram sheets by ?0.10 and discussed charges for extra services.
Total/Elf Aquitaine/Arkema and  Lucite had their fines reduced in return for information provided to the
Commission.

?Cartels are a scourge,? said Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes. ?I will ensure that cartels will continue to be tracked down and punished.?

?I am shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again,? she added. ?These fines will serve as a cold shower for the management and shareholders of all these companies who have to realize that cartels cannot and will not be tolerated.?
In the past four years, the EC has imposed  fines for cartels on 18 businesses, half in or related to the
chemicals sector.

Four companies have been  fined with a total of EUR 344.5 M ($444 M) by the European Commission for conspiring to fix the price of polymethyl  methacrylate (PMMA) in Western Europe during 1997-2002. The commission imposed a fine of EUR 219.1 M for Total, EUR 91.4 M for ICI, EUR 25 M for  Lucite International and EUR 9 M for Quinn Plastics. Degussa was also involved in the  cartel, but was spared after it alerted the authorities on the price-fixing activity. The PMMA market in Western  Europe is pegged at EUR 665 M/y, based on commission estimates. The commission also imposed a combined
fine of EUR 388 M on Total and six other companies for conspiring to fix the price hydrogen peroxide and sodium perborate.

Fines were doubled for ICI, to EUR 91,406,250, and Arkema, to EUR 219,313,250, because this was a repeat offence. Because of its cooperation, Arkema's  fine was reduced under the  Commission's leniency programme. Under this programme, Lucite also received a reduced fine of EUR 9,000,000 and, as the
first company to alert the Commission to the cartel, Degussa was not fined at all. Arkema's  fine includes those for the companies in the same legal entity: Total, Elf Aquitaine, Altuglas and Altumax.

The European Commission cracked down on chemicals groups Arkema, Degussa, ICI,  Lucite and Quinn Barlo for cartel activity between 1997 and 2002 in the acrylic glass sector, fining the companies a total of 344,562,500 on 31 May. But repeat offenders Arkema (formerly Atofina) and ICI both had their fines doubled to 219,131,250 and 91,406,250 respectively to account for the fact that they are repeat offenders.

Arkema's steep  fine accounted for a reduction given under the Commission's leniency programme because it provided useful information about the cartel. Lucite's fine was also cut (to 9,000,000) under the leniency scheme, whilst Degussa avoided a fine altogether receiving full immunity for being the first company to confess to Brussels.

TD
Acrylic glass (polymethyl-methacrylate) is used to make car headlamps, tail-lights, dashboards and household appliances such as DVDs and bath tubs.

Degussa applied to the  Commission for leniency in December 2002 and the  Commission then carried out a series of raids on the companies which revealed that they had fixed and monitored prices between
1997 and 2002.

The Commission uncovered evidence that the firms' representatives had met in a Dublin hotel room in October 1999 where they fixed the European price level for acrylic glass moulding compounds. The different companies dealt with the price-fixing in their own markets: Atofina announced the price rise in France, Italy and Benelux, Degussa in Germany and Spain and ICI applied it in the UK and Scandinavia.

As they are all part of the same legal entity, French companies Total, Elf Aquitaine, Altuglas and Altumax are all jointly and severally liable for Arkema's  fine.

The variety in the distribution of the  fines to the different companies depending on the amount and timing of information volunteered to the EU anti-trust authorities will be scrutinised by other sectors currently under the Commission's spotlight for potential cartel activity. Most notably the energy sector is currently the subject of a huge investigatory effort. In May, the Commission carried out dawn raids on 20 sites in six member states in connection with alleged anti-competitive behaviour, and did not rule out the possibility that it suspected  cartel activity. Subsequently further follow up raids were carried out in Germany this week.

The Commission is currently internally reviewing the basis on which it can offer reductions of  fines to companies volunteering information under the leniency programme. At the moment, the system is relatively rigid, with the first company coming forward being the only one with the chance of obtaining full indemnity from  fines in respect of the  cartel. Firms in the US have more scope to barter information in exchange for indemnity.

Describing cartels as "a scourge", Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was "shocked that companies like ICI and Arkema have been  fined once again".

Charterhouse Capital has pulled out acrylics producer Lucite due to an increasingly unstable market. Charterhouse is now considering to again allot funds for Lucite, and the proceeds might be used in
paying off  Lucite's current debt, including an outstanding 10.25% senior notes due in 2010. Charterhouse selected Deutsche Bank to sell  Lucite in Jan 2006 following several unsolicited offers. With 16 facilities in nine countries, Lucite's value was estimated at $2.5 bn including debt. Lucite has been served a EUR 25
M fine by the European Commission in connection with the PMMA cartel.

Charterhouse Capital has taken acrylics producer  Lucite off the market, the venture capitalists said last week.

Charterhouse has withdrawn the asset because of increased market volatility, but declined to elaborate and is now considering refinancing. If it does this, the proceeds are likely to be used to repay  Lucite International?s existing debt, including its outstanding 10.25% senior notes due in 2010.

In January, Charterhouse commissioned Deutsche Bank to sell the business after receiving several unsolicited offers. At the time,  Lucite, which has 16 plants in nine countries, was estimated to fetch
$2.5bn, including debt.

It was expected to generate interest from  chemicals companies including Dow, Rohm & Haas, BASF, Asahi Kasei and Mitsubishi Rayon.
Charterhouse bought  Lucite, then Ineos Acrylics, from ICI in 1999.  Lucite makes methacrylate
monomers and has about 25% of the world market.

Lucite also confirmed it has received the  European Commission notification of a ?25m  fine relating to the PMMA cartel.

?Lucite International has co-operated fully with the  Commission?s investigation and will now review its findings,? the firm said. ?The company has two months in which to submit an appeal.?
