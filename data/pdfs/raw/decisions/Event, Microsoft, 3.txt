BRUSSELS

Settlement talks between  Microsoft and European regulators collapsed yesterday, exposing the company to an anti-trust ruling that could limit it in one of the largest and richest markets in the world.

TD
The end of the talks followed two days of meetings between  Microsoft's chief executive, Steven Ballmer, and the European Union's anti-trust chief, Mario Monti. A formal ruling is not expected until Wednesday, but Monti unexpectedly appeared at the noon briefing yesterday at the  European Commission to announce: "A settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible."

The 5-year-old European case accusing  Microsoft of abusing its global dominance in operating software - in particular, its bundling of its Media Player, the video and music-playing software, into Windows - has been the last major legal challenge dogging the company since the landmark settlement of the Justice Department's anti-trust lawsuit in 2001.

The case also contended that  Microsoft unfairly withheld technical information from competitors, making it difficult for them to create software for business servers that works well with Windows.

A ruling against the company, if held up in court, could mean a  fine of as much as $3 billion U.S. against Microsoft. More importantly, it could force the company to make fundamental changes in the way it sells software in the European Union, the world's largest trading bloc. And the ruling could become a precedent for future anti-trust litigation against the company.

Microsoft said yesterday that it would appeal such a ruling in the European courts and file a motion to
halt the imposition of sanctions while an appeal proceeds. The appeal process itself could take four to five
years, unless the two sides choose to settle later, which is a possibility.

Both regulators and the company said yesterday that they had made significant strides toward a settlement before negotiations broke down. "I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case," Ballmer said.
But the two sides were unable to agree on a new demand Monti added in the final days of talks. Emboldened by the unanimous support of national regulators from the 15 member nations of the
European Union, Monti wanted  Microsoft to sign a pledge not to bundle other software programs into
Windows to the detriment of competitors as the price of averting a ruling next week, one person close to
the talks said.

If Microsoft refused to make a legal commitment not to  abuse the dominance of Windows by bundling in other software then "the public and  competition would be better served by a decision setting a strong

Page 5 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
legal precedent which establishes clear principles for a company that is so dominate in the market," Monti said.

Donald Falk, an anti-trust and appellate partner in the law firm of Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, said the European Commission "appears set on breaking the cycle of investigations and enforcement actions against Microsoft that have had little or no practical effect on  Microsoft's conduct or on the markets it dominates."

In addition to any penalty it faces in Europe, a ruling exposes  Microsoft to the risk that its strategy of bundling software applications with Windows will once again make it a legal target in the United States. Microsoft's power and financial success has since the early 1980s derived in part from its ability to integrate applications - including those in  competition with the products of other software companies - as free features of the Windows operating system.

During its bitter seven-year long legal fight with the U.S. Justice Department and state attorneys general, Microsoft successfully held firm on its principle of being able to add any feature to its products, and it was that insistence that led Monti and Ballmer to acknowledge they had failed to reach a settlement.
Although it has paid about $2 billion U.S. to settle class-action lawsuits filed in the wake of the federal
anti-trust case, the European ruling could have a direct impact both on the civil anti-trust lawsuits brought
by RealNetworks and Sun Microsystems, as well as future claims.

BRUSSELS, March 18 -- European regulators announced on Thursday that settlement talks with Microsoft had collapsed, leaving it virtually certain that an  antitrust ruling would be issued against the company that could limit its ability to add new features to its software in one of the largest and richest markets in the world.

The end of the talks came after three days of face-to-face meetings between  Microsoft's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, and the European Union's  antitrust chief, Mario Monti. A formal ruling
is not expected until Wednesday, but Mr. Monti unexpectedly appeared at the  European                     Commission's noon briefing to announce that ''a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible.''

TD
The five-year-old European case accusing  Microsoft of abusing its dominance in operating software
-- in particular, its bundling of Media Player, the video- and music-playing software, into Windows --
has been the last major legal challenge dogging the company since the landmark settlement of the
Justice Department's  antitrust lawsuit in 2001.

The case also contended that  Microsoft unfairly withheld technical information from competitors, making it difficult for them to create software for business servers that would work well with Windows.

A ruling against the company, if upheld in court, could mean a  fine of as much as $3 billion. More important, it could force the company to make fundamental changes in the way that it sells software in the European Union, the world's largest trading bloc, where  Microsoft now generates about a third of its $11 billion in annual global sales from Windows.

More generally, Microsoft would face new obstacles in its efforts to expand its business to consumer video and audio services and to incorporate additional features, like searching the Web, directly into its operating systems.
The ruling could also become a reference point for future  antitrust litigation against the company.

Microsoft said on Thursday that it would appeal in the European courts and file a motion to halt the imposition of sanctions while an appeal proceeds.

The appeal process itself could take four to five years, unless the two sides choose to settle. Both regulators and the company said on Thursday that they had made significant strides toward a settlement before the negotiations broke down.
''I believe we reached agreement on the issues of the case,'' Mr. Ballmer said in a statement. But the two sides were unable to agree on a new demand Mr. Monti added in the final days of
negotiations.

Emboldened by the unanimous support of national regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union, Mr. Monti wanted  Microsoft to sign a pledge not to bundle other software programs into Windows to the detriment of competitors, one person involved in the talks said.

If Microsoft refused to make a legal commitment not to abuse the dominance of Windows by adding in other software, Mr. Monti said, then ''the public and competition would be better served by a decision setting a strong legal precedent which establishes clear principles for a company that is so dominant in the market.''

Donald M. Falk, an antitrust lawyer for Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw in Palo Alto, Calif., said that the European Commission ''appears set on breaking the cycle of investigations and enforcement actions against Microsoft that have had little or no practical effect on  Microsoft's conduct or on the markets it dominates.''

Beyond any penalty it faces in Europe, a ruling exposes  Microsoft to the risk that its strategy of bundling software applications with Windows will once again make it a legal target in the United States.  Microsoft's power and financial success derive in part from its ability to integrate applications
-- including those in  competition with the products of other software companies -- as free features of the Windows operating system.

During its bitter seven-year legal fight with the Justice Department and state attorneys general over bundling features like Web browsers,  Microsoft successfully held firm on its principle of being able to add any feature to its products, and it was that insistence that led Mr. Monti and Mr. Ballmer to acknowledge they had failed to reach a settlement.

Although  Microsoft has paid about $2 billion to settle class-action lawsuits derived from the federal antitrust case, the European ruling could have a direct effect both on the civil  antitrust lawsuits brought by RealNetworks, which competes with  Microsoft's Media Player, and Sun Microsystems, as well as future claims.

''We've read the commission's statement and strongly support a decision that will give PC makers, enterprises and consumers a choice of media players,'' said David Stewart, deputy general counsel of RealNetworks.
Gary L. Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who was one of the first to raise anticompetitive claims
against Microsoft, said that the expected European ruling ''could potentially have a profound effect on
Microsoft in the United States,'' challenging its ability to bundle new features into future versions of
Windows.

For example, the company is now entering the search engine business where companies like Google and Yahoo currently have dominant positions.

If Microsoft were to add search applications to its next generation of Windows, known as Longhorn, it would almost certainly raise the same issues that have put  Microsoft in court over the bundling of Web browsers and media players.

Microsoft would not comment specifically on what it had proposed to settle the case, but a lawyer close to the talks said  Microsoft had agreed to allow competing digital media players to be included in Windows.

Under the settlement, Microsoft would have had to place two competing media players on Windows, with the European Commission determining which two. The two leading competing offerings are RealOne Player by RealNetworks and Quicktime by Apple. In addition, the commission could choose other competing media players, with  Microsoft having to include those on a compact disc shipped with Windows.
But Microsoft refused to yield to the European demand to offer a version of Windows without its own
Media Player, fearing it would set a precedent, the lawyer said.

''We were able to work things out in the current case, including the media player,'' said Bradford L. Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel. ''It would have taken effect immediately, it would have been worldwide and it would have had a significant effect.''

''But what we were not able to do,'' Mr. Smith added, ''was agree on a formula that would have addressed all future integration issues for all time.''

The commission contends that developers of content like record companies and Hollywood studios will increasingly tailor their releases for Media Player only, because of the added expense of making them suit all players.

Some industry analysts argue that Europe's proposed remedies will ultimately have a greater effect on future software products than on the market for media players.

The Justice Department declined to comment on Mr. Monti's announcement on Thursday. A spokesman said the department was considering whether to make a statement Wednesday after the ruling is made.
Shares of  Microsoft fell 24 cents Thursday, to $24.89.

MICROSOFT, the worldâs largest personal computer software company, is expected to be  fined up to
$404 million and given a deadline to permit rivals using its operating systems next week.

TD
This follows a last minute breakdown of anti-competitive negotiations between the US giant and EU
competition authorities in Brussels yesterday.

In a statement  Microsoft strongly hinted they will take the case to court and suggested the current impasse is just the latest step in a long running battle.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti decided to pull the plug on the negotiations yesterday in
Brussels when he could not get agreement on commitments for the future operation of  Microsoft.

The EU launched investigations into  Microsoft, in the early 1990s because of complaints from rivals that they were abusing their dominant market position.

They manufactured the Windows operating system in such a way that rival products for audiovisual, data and other add-ons could not be used easily or at all.

Last year Netscape Communications, now owned by AOL, won an anti-competitive case against them in the US where  Microsoft was fined $750m and forced to allow Netscape a niche.

Despite other actions and Court wins over  Microsoft in the US the Justice Department a few months ago said they were concerned that the giant corporation was still abusing its position by killing competition.

The European Commission was anxious to ensure the same did not happen in Europe and is determined that any agreement reached would build in principles for the future.
Commissioner Monti announcing that they failed to reach a settlement with  Microsoft said, "We
made substantial progress towards resolving the problems which have arisen in the past but we were
unable to agree on commitments for future conduct.

"In the end I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe. I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent.

"It is essential to have a precedent which will establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position in the market."

The expert committee will meet on Monday to agree the size of the fine normally it is 10% of sales which would amount to $500m and on what actions they want Microsoft to take.

They are also likely to agree to further action if  Microsoft refuses to meet the demands such as providing a stripped down version of Windows where rivals could easily have their products installed and share confidential information with rivals that would allow them make their product compatible with Windows.

The member states have already unanimously backed the action Mr Monti wants to take and the college of Commissioners is expected to adopt the decision at the meeting next Wednesday.

Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of  Microsoft made an emergency trip to Brussels for the latest round of talks with the Commission. In a statement afterwards the company said they believed their settlement offer would have resolved the case not just in Europe but around the world, and right now.

Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of  Microsoft said, "Even though we could not agree on a single formula for all future questions, settlement would have helped us work constructively to resolve future issues.

BRUSSELS - The European Union  antitrust chief says last-ditch settlement talks with  Microsoft Corp. have failed and he will propose that a precedent-setting ruling against the U.S. software giant be adopted next week.

"We were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct," EU  competition commissioner
Mario Monti said Thursday.

The dispute over "future conduct" included EU regulators' demands that  Microsoft not bundle multiple features into future products, including its next version of Windows, due in 2006.

That edition of Windows is expected to contain a search engine and other features that could compete with rival products.

Microsoft's chief counsel, Brad Smith, agreed that the talks broke down over the EU's attempt to regulate the company's behaviour. He reiterated  Microsoft's determination to take any negative decision to court.

"We were not able to reach agreement on a formula that would solve all future questions with respect to other issues," he told reporters. "It's clear that we'll all benefit from the clarity that the courts can bring to these questions."

Monti said he would also propose a fine -- expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars -- when his draft decision goes to the full European Commission, the EU's executive branch, on Wednesday.

Microsoft is accused of unfairly grabbing market share from rival companies by "bundling" its own version of their products with Windows -- the operating system in the majority of personal computers worldwide.

Microsoft says that benefits consumers, but rivals claim it's unfair  competition intended to drive them out of business.

BRUSSELS - The  European Commission and Microsoft Corp. failed to settle  antitrust charges yesterday, removing the last obstacle to a landmark ruling next week branding the company an abusive monopolist.

"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference after three days of top-level talks with the world's biggest software firm.

TD
A Microsoft spokesman said it would issue a statement soon.

The EU decision, to be adopted next Wednesday, will require  Microsoft to supply a second version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system stripped of built-in audiovisual software.

Brussels will also order the company to share proprietary information with rival server makers and levy a fine running to hundreds of millions of euros.
Most importantly,  Microsoft will be formally ruled to have abused its dominant market position in the
European Union, as it was in a 2001 final appeals court ruling in the United States.

That decision could open the way for further legal action against  Microsoft in all European Union countries -- 25 of them after May 1 -- if the company is seen to be competing unfairly.
The Commission is probing two other cases against  Microsoft.

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer negotiated with Mr. Monti for four hours on Tuesday, and again on Wednesday and yesterday, to avoid the formal decision.

Sources close to the case said he made a last-ditch offer on Wednesday to compel computer makers to carry rival audiovisual software alongside  Microsoft's dominant Windows Media Player.

Mr. Monti praised  Microsoft's efforts, but said they fell short because the company was unwilling to make commitments to change its future business practices.

A centerpiece of the Commission inquiry has been to go beyond the specifics of this case and focus more broadly on Microsoft's use of its market dominance to crush smaller rivals.

"The aspect of setting a clear and strong legal precedent is indeed of key importance," Mr. Monti said. "It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either there or on the horizon."

Microsoft reached settlements with the Commission in 1994 and 1997. It has headed off other EU investigations by agreeing to change its behaviour towards particular companies. But in Mr. Monti's view, none of those settlements prevented the recurrence of similar  competition problems.

"I therefore intend to propose to my colleagues ... to adopt a decision that has already received the unanimous backing of the member states," Mr. Monti said.

An antitrust lawyer representing some of  Microsoft's rivals praised the decision. "This is a great victory for European consumers," said Thomas Vinje of Clifford Chance.

Microsoft is certain to appeal against a Commission decision in the European courts. Litigation
could take several years and  Microsoft is very likely to seek a suspension of the remedies against it
during that time.

Another  antitrust expert and former Commission official said a last-minute deal would have been a major error.

"If the Commission were to end the case without a formal decision, it would fly in the face of everything they've said so far about the strength of their case," said David Wood of Howrey Simon.

The Commission draft proposal calls on  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows to computer makers, one with Windows Media Player embedded and one without it. The exact size of the  fine will be approved by a meeting of member states on Monday.

HD         Software giant's  very civil war is not yet done - THE FUTURE. BY         By DANIEL DOMBEY

Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel, is a veteran of many legal battles. After the breakdown of his company's attempt to prevent the  European Commission from branding it as an abusive monopolist, he sees more fights ahead.
The Commission wants to talk to  Microsoft about putting its ruling against the company into effect.

TD
But Mr Smith makes clear that the next date between the two sides will be in court. "We will all have the opportunity to benefit from the clarity that the courts will provide," he tells the Financial Times.

The company will appeal the Commission's finding that  Microsoft has illegally used its Windows monopoly to elbow competitors out of other markets.

Mr Smith indicates that only then will discussions resume: "Perhaps with some additional clarity from the court at some future point, it may be possible to sit down again. . .to work things out."

He goes out of his way to praise what he calls "an extremely constructive process" and "the very good discussions" with Mario Monti, Europe's  competition Commissioner.

Now, however the talks have concluded without a settlement. The reason is that "we ultimately were able to resolve all the issues raised by this case but we were not able to reach agreement on a single formula for all future questions".

The Commission is scheduled to issue its ruling on March 24. On that date, it will call for  Microsoft to share more information with its rivals, offer computer makers a version of Windows without its Media Player and pay a fine.

Microsoft's first step will probably be to ask the EU's Court of First Instance to suspend such measures on the grounds that they cause "irreparable harm".

The longer battle will be over whether the precedent that the company abuses its dominant position will stand. That legal fight could take five years to resolve, but during that time the Commission is likely to proceed on many other issues against  Microsoft, citing its findings in the present case.

The Commission yesterday signalled that it has greater appetite to pursue  Microsoft than has the Bush administration. Mr Smith knows only too well that there are years of litigation ahead.

UTV'sradio stations in Cork and Limerick made combined profits of Â£2.8mlast year, while Dublin station Q102, formerly Lite FM, made a loss of Â£350,000. Thethree stations had a turnover of just over Â£10m (â¬14.8m), and saw revenues increase onan average like-for-like basis by 5.5pc.

This week, the group reported that pre-tax profits were down 15pc to Â£9.5m, hit by aninterest bill on borrowings following its acquisition trail.

SHAREHOLDERS in the educational software company Riverdeep approved a debt restructuring less than a year after the company was taken private by Barry O'Callaghan and founder Pat McDonagh. The two men are each spending $36m to buy out equityinjected into the company during the buyout by PC billionaire Michael Dell and venturecapital group Alchemy.

BALTIMORE Technologies is selling its remaining stake in Baltimore TechnologiesJapan to Betrusted for Â£2.25m (â¬3.3m) in cash. The proceeds will be used for generalcorporate purposes, Baltimore said. It completed the sale of its core internet security business last year.

REAL  competition in the banking sector would boost national output by as much asâ¬700m, a new report commissioned by Bank of Scotland claimed. The study also found that greater  competition could lead to personal and business bank customers saving up to â¬524m in interest payments.

ON THE economic front, new estimates from the OECDsuggest the US contributedmore than half the growth in the developed world last year as the eurozone continued to stagnate. The Paris-based OECD said output in the economies of its 30 member nationswas 2.7pc higher in the last three months of 2004 than in the same period in 2003.

AT HOME, sales in shops and bars plunged almost 7pc during January, according topreliminary figures from the Central Statistics Office . Final figures for December show an underlying rise of just
0.4pc, when the Christmas shopping spree is allowed for,confirming reports from retailers of a sluggish Christmas.

MICROSOFT faces a likely European Commission fine of hundreds of millions of euronext week after the failure of settlement talks.

HD       At Cebit, doubts  on Microsoft case impact

HANNOVER, Germany:

At the annual Cebit technology trade fair here, visitors and exhibitors alike seemed largely skeptical that the European Commission's expected ruling next week in the  Microsoft antitrust case would have much of an impact on consumers or companies.

TD
Microsoft will be punished, but then they will just continue doing the same thing, said Bernhard Hollaus,
23, a computer science student from Schwaz, Austria, who took time off from his studies on Thursday to
stroll through the cavernous halls of the 355,000- square-meter, or 3.8-million-square-foot, exhibition site.

If Microsoft is ordered to remove its audio-video software, Media Player, from its Windows operating system, he said, I don't think anyone is going to notice the difference.

His classmate, Nikolai Speed, 28, agreed. If they are  fined, so what? he said. It is not as if you are suddenly going to have any more choice in operating systems. Shuky Garibi, who was tapping away on his Windows-based laptop at a cafe inside one of the exhibit halls, said, I agree that  Microsoft is a monopoly, of course. Garibi, 45, who works for an Israeli graphic arts company, said that he had once considered installing an alternative operating system for his home computer but then wavered after considering the prospect of abandoning what he called an ingrained habit.

But even if he did opt for a system like Linux, he would not be able to escape Windows. At work, I have no choice because it is the IT department that decides, and they still choose  Microsoft, he said.

The sentiment of technology industry leaders was harder to come by, perhaps because most of them do business with Microsoft in one fashion or another.

The market needs alternatives and wants to have choices, said Guy Dubois, the European executive vice president for PeopleSoft, a leading U.S. business-software company exhibiting at Cebit. Though he would not comment on the case specifically, Dubois did say, It is important to ensure that whatever the industry, we maintain a fair and competitive environment for all actors in the market.

Erkki Liikanen, the European commissioner for enterprise and information society, was alerted to the breakdown in EU negotiations with  Microsoft via his Nokia Communicator while briefing journalists on technology industry trends at the trade fair. He ended the briefing early, explaining that he could make no public comment until the final verdict was announced.

On the show floor, Jorg Lentsch, in charge of network administration and security at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, said he believed that the commission should both force  Microsoft to unbundle the Media Player and levy  fines against the giant U.S. software company.

Bundling gives them a dominant position, and no other company has the chance to do the same, Lentsch said.
He said he used RealPlayer, the media player produced by  Microsoft's rival RealNetworks.

Dominik Grunnek, a technology manager at a German financial institution and another user of RealPlayer, said he also thought Microsoft should be fined. A company like RealNetworks has invested in creating an innovative product, and Microsoft's response was 'O.K., we will bundle our player with Windows and you're dead,'" he said.

LONDON

Microsoft Corp. software designed for, of all things, cash registers and slot machines played a persuasive role in the European Union's landmark  antitrust case labelling it an abusive monopolist.

TD
The European Commission is expected to  fine Microsoft hundreds of millions of euros next week and order it to offer a version of its ubiquitous Windows operating system without Windows Media Player audio-visual software installed.

If Competition Commissioner Mario Monti succeeds in getting  Microsoft to reconfigure future versions of an operating system that runs more than 95 per cent of all personal computers -- still considered a longshot by some industry observers -- a piece of  Microsoft software known as Windows XP Embedded could be the reason.

The commission says that by bundling Windows Media Player with its operating system,  Microsoft is stifling  competition in a market that is rapidly becoming a favourite method for consumers to listen to music and watch movies.

Microsoft argues that removal of Windows Media Player will limit, if not make impossible, the ability to play songs and film clips on a PC.
For now, the commission isn't buying the argument.

Microsoft competitor RealNetworks, makers of rival audiovisual software Real Player, used XP Embedded to respond to  Microsoft's contention that removing Windows Media Player damages Windows.
In November, RealNetworks demonstrated a PC running on Windows XP -- minus the Windows Media
Player -- at a closed hearing of the  European Commission on the Microsoft case.
The computer appeared to function normally. It was configured with Windows XP Embedded. Windows XP Embedded is sold to manufacturers of relatively uncomplicated machines such as cash
dispensers and cash registers.

The manufacturers use the software to design a scaled-down version of Windows XP to run their hardware, excluding non-essential functions such as Outlook Express and Media Player.
RealNetworks gave Reuters a demonstration this week on a similarly scaled-down machine.

To demonstrate that removing Windows Media Player will not affect the PC's multimedia features, Real played a ColdPlay CD and a trailer from Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones on the PC through RealPlayer.
Page 22 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"We believe this demonstrates clearly it is technically feasible to separate Windows Media Player from Windows and have a stable operating system. And  Microsoft has done a substantial amount of work to enable that," said Dave Stewart, deputy general counsel for RealNetworks.

Microsoft dismissed the demonstration as "misleading."

A company spokesman said it is impossible to strip Windows Media Player entirely from the Windows operating system and have basic playback functionality remain intact on the computer.

"To remove Windows Media Player, you would actually have to rip out the underlying code. And if you do that, you hobble the system completely," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

Throughout the lengthy EU investigation, claims and counter-claims about the guts of the Windows operating system and whether it can function without the Windows Media Player have dominated the proceedings.
"It's an issue of semantics," said David Smith, a Gartner Research analyst and specialist on  Microsoft
software.

"What  Microsoft is claiming is that some things won't work out of the box the way it is packaged and delivered to people today. That is true. But it would not be a huge effort to change it," he said.

Microsoft responds that is simply not the case.

MICROSOFT Corp has failed to reach a deal with the  European Commission, setting the stage for a landmark anti-trust ruling next week that will brand the software giant an abusive monopolist.
It will be  fined and ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows
Media Player to encourage computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.

TD
Microsoft shares fell 1 per cent to $US24.89 ($A33.23) in Nasdaq trading on Thursday.

The decision comes after a decade of probes and legal battles, including several cases in which the commission took action to prevent  Microsoft from using its dominant position to crush smaller rivals.

This time the commission wanted a binding promise from  Microsoft to change the way it does business in Europe, putting an end to a pattern of bringing one case after another and getting new settlements each time.

"I'd just like to inform you that a settlement on the  Microsoft case has not been possible," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said as he made a surprise appearance at the EU executive's daily news briefing.
Mr Monti met Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer three days in a row, once for four hours. "We were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future," Mr Ballmer
said.

A major issue in the case had been  Microsoft's efforts to damage rival makers of audio-visual software by tying its Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system.

Microsoft was willing to sell information to rival makers of server software so their products, which run on Linux and Unix operating systems, could work more easily with Windows.
But in Mr Monti's view, the heart of the case went deeper than today's problems.
Two more Microsoft cases are already under investigation, again focusing on the question of  abuse
of monopoly power.
Next Wednesday,  Microsoft will be formally held to have abused its dominant market position in the
European Union, as it was in a 2001 final US Appeals Court ruling.

Late on Thursday, the US Department of Justice issued a statement stressing its good relations with the European Commission but also making clear it believes the US settlement with  Microsoft contains the appropriate remedies. Mr Monti said setting a clear and strong legal precedent was
very important.

BRUSSELS -  Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has been unable to reach an  antitrust
settlement with the European Union, as regulators prepare to impose limits on the Windows
program that runs 95 per cent of personal computers.
Talks broke down over whether an accord would apply to future conduct, said chief executive Steve
Ballmer.

TD
The EU accuses the company of abusing its hold on PC operating systems to dominate computer- networking software and audio and video players.

``Competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent,'' said  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in Brussels.

``It is very important to have such a precedent to guide the conduct of such a dominant company in cases which are either already there or on the horizon.''

The EU, which also is probing complaints on programs for handheld computers and some mobile phones, wants  Microsoft to disclose secret programming information to rivals and offer PC makers the option of dispensing with the Windows Media Player.

``The ongoing stream of legal news is like walking through a thorn bush - it's like death by a thousand cuts,'' said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles & Co in Boston. ``It begins to wear on people's attitude about the company.''
Another worry was the growth of Linux, a free operating system that rivals Windows.

Shipments of Linux for servers that run networks will grow more than twice as fast as Windows in the year ending June 30, according to  Microsoft's forecasts.

Hewlett-Packard will begin selling PCs running Linux in 12 Asian countries, according to software maker Turbolinux.
``That might actually be more important,'' said Henry Asher, president of Northstar Group in New
York. ``Are the computer manufacturers able to assist the movement of Linux to the desktop?''

Microsoft said it expected to appeal any EU decision and raised the possibility of a future settlement.

``Microsoft and the European Commission reached agreement on the case, but we were unable to agree on principles for new issues that could arise in the future,'' Ballmer said.

The US State Department would not say whether it would raise objections to the decision, saying it was premature to speculate on what specific actions the EU would take.

The collapse of talks with the European Commission, the EU's regulatory arm, may lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines.

Page 26 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Representatives from the bloc's 15 member states will meet on Monday to discuss the level of the penalty.
EU antitrust fines can be as high as 10 per cent of sales.

Microsoft had US$52.8 billion ($80.5 billion) in cash and short-term investments as of December
31.
``The EU's teeth are sharpening,'' said James Macmillan, head of European equities at Merrill Lynch
& Co. in London.

``It's important for Europe to have a credible approach to these issues, whether they're about market dominance or mergers and acquisitions.''

The EU has said a 2001 settlement in the US did not go far enough to restrain anti-competitive practices.

In the US, the company agreed to give computer makers the option to promote rival software and hide user access to Media Player or other applications, and to disclose some information to enable competing server software to operate on Windows. -BLOOMBERG

European competition regulators are set this week to go dramatically further than their US counterparts in imposing hard-hitting sanctions on the world's biggest software company,  Microsoft.

Bill Gates' titan, whose products power 90 percent of personal computers, will suffer its first serious regulatory setback when the European Union announces the findings of a five-year anti-trust investigation on Wednesday.

TD
The Seattle-based company, denying that it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors, has already vowed to appeal the verdict to the European Court of Justice.

Following the failure of last-ditch settlement talks last week, EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti will almost certainly announce hefty  fines against Microsoft.

Monti, whose term as  competition commissioner ends in October, has stuck to his guns in the face of claims by Microsoft that his verdict will do nothing for  competition and everything to block innovation.

"It is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market," he said last Thursday.

The cash-rich company can well afford the  fines, which under EU law could reach as high as three billion euros but are more likely to be in the hundreds of millions of euros.
The exact level of the financial penalty will be decided in talks Monday between Monti and  competition
experts from EU member states.
However, Microsoft will find the other part of its widely trailed punishment much harder to stomach. Monti is expected to order the company to detach its multimedia program Media Player from its
all-conquering Windows operating system, to give rival products a more level playing field.

He will also direct Gates' firm to share programming code to enable rivals to make software that can work with its low-end servers. These enable computers to hook up to a network and are a key battleground in the IT industry.

Media Player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for PC users in the multimedia age.

Rival companies such as RealNetworks and Apple complain that their media players cannot compete fairly because of  Microsoft's practise of attaching ("bundling") its player to Windows.

But the bundling strategy has been at the heart of  Microsoft's supremely successful business model of offering consumers an all-in-one suite of applications.

In the United States,  Microsoft was accused of similarly unfair practices notably in bundling its Internet browser program with Windows.

But after a four-year anti-trust probe, the US Justice Department reached a hotly contested deal with
Microsoft in 2001 that forced the firm to share some technical data with rivals but stopped short of  fines.
Page 29 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The agreement was upheld by a US judge a year later, leaving competitors to transfer their hopes for redress to the  European Commission's own investigation.

A coalition of anti-Microsoft companies, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), applauds the prospect of a European comeuppance for its bete noir.

"It will be a first step to restoring consumer choice and innovation in multiple markets subject to the stranglehold of a monopolist," CCIA chief executive Ed Black said last week.

Wednesday's verdict will not be the end of Microsoft's regulatory troubles. The CCIA has lodged a complaint with the European Commission demanding wholesale changes to the firm's flagship operating system, Windows XP.

HD            Microsoft steady despite EU action

Microsoft shares were little changed last week despite the bombshell decision of the  European         Commission to press ahead with its anti-trust action against the software giant.

TD
The breakdown in talks paved the way for a landmark legal ruling this Wednesday when the
Commission is expected to give details on  fines running into millions of euro.

Microsoft shares have had a torrid time since 2001 when they bounced 53 per cent after the US dropped a similar antitrust case against the company. In 2002, the company's shares fell 22 per cent and also lagged behind rivals on the Nasdaq last year amid growing concerns about the company growth rate.
The EC accuses Microsoft of abusing its hold in personal computer operating systems to stifle
competition. Microsoft's operating system powers about 95 per cent of PCs worldwide.

Its shares have dropped almost 10 per cent since the start of this year and have shed 5 per cent in the past 52 weeks despite the rebound in the US economy and improved prospects for world economic growth.
Led by Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, the software g iant re ache d an agreement with the
European competition commissioner Mario Monti on paying a  fine.

Ballmer was unable to agree on how to address concerns on the company's 'bundled' products, and on whether the  fines will be the end of the matter.

Microsoft's business model

Microsoft is built on bundling new applications such as web browsers, e-mail programs and music players into its software.

It has so far resisted attempts in both the US and Europe to force it to change. Ongoing EU restrictions and regulations on new software and applications will probably make the software company nervous.

Monti wants  Microsoft to disclose secret programming information to competitors and to give PC makers the option of stripping  Microsoft's media player technology from the Windows operating system. The EC is pushing for a verdict in the case that can be used to restrain anti-competitive practices in the future, Monti said.

"Competition and consumers in Europe will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent," he said.

The ceiling for EU fines is 10 per cent of a company's global sales, which would be upward of $3 billion in Microsoft's case. It is unlikely that the  fine would be anywhere near that figure.The biggest fine the EU has imposed was &euro;462 million, or 2 per cent of sales, on Swiss phar maceutical company Roche Holding in 2001. A similar  fine against Microsoft would amount to more than
&euro;500 million.

Page 31 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The executive body's decision will end the five-year  antitrust case, but not  Microsoft's headaches.

The EC is also investigating a complaint lodged last year by an alliance of over 30 companies, including Oracle, Nokia and Time Warner, that claims  Microsoft is stifling  competition in software for handheld computers, wireless phones and e-mail.

The company also faces legal challenges in the US from anti-trust lawsuits taken by RealNetworks and Sun Microsystems, bitter rivals who have lobbied the EU to sanction  Microsoft, and a consumer antitrust case, which went to trial last week in Minnesota.

HD     EU panel to consider potentially record-setting fine against Microsoft as antitrust case nears end

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union  antitrust officials gather Monday to review what could be a record-setting  fine against Microsoft Corp., the final step before issuing a long-awaited decision against the U.S. software giant.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments were to consider a proposal from EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti behind closed doors ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the European Commission, the EU's executive body.

TD
That's where Monti's ruling and  fine -- expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars -- is expected to be adopted.

EU rules allow the Commission to  fine antitrust violators as much as 10 percent of annual global revenue. The largest ever actually imposed on a single company, however, was less than 2 percent -- euro462 million (US$568 million) -- against Roche Holding AG, one of several companies caught fixing the prices of bulk vitamins in 2001.

Even a fine set at 2 percent would amount to around US$700 million for a giant like  Microsoft, which expects to take in nearly US$36 billion this year.

Monday's meeting comes two weeks after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the 5-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly to unfairly gain market share in software for playing digital media and running office network servers.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals and sell a discounted version of Windows without its Media Player software, at least to computer makers in Europe.

Settlement talks collapsed last week over what both sides described as  Microsoft's reluctance to accept provisions that could have prevented it from adding features to future versions of Windows -- a key element of its business strategy.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the EU's decision, meaning the case could be tied up in legal wrangling for years.

The U.S. Justice Department, which settled its own  antitrust action against  Microsoft in 2001, said last week it was "premature to speculate" about the EU decision. But it said it believes the U.S. consent decree "provides the appropriate framework for marketplace  competition in this important sector."

Microsoft rivals and consumer groups have derided the U.S. settlement as too lenient.

HD        Microsoft deal rejected over Longhorn worries. BY        BY DANIEL DOMBEY IN BRUSSELS

LP
Antitrust worries about Longhorn, the next generation of the Windows computer operating system, played a key role in last week's European Commission decision to reject a deal proposed by Microsoft, it has emerged.

The Commission's battle with the software giant, which will lead to a formal ruling on Wednesday that the company broke European law, refers to complaints from 1998 and 1999.

TD
But Commission officials believe the biggest issue for  competition in the technology sector will be Longhorn - expected to be launched in 2006. The Commission will consult member state officials on Monday on the size of a  fine in the current case.

Microsoft is set to appeal, arguing that rivals are trying to lay claim to its intellectual property and prevent the company meeting consumer demand for new Windows functions.

People close to the case say the Commission hopes the development of Longhorn will be influenced by its ruling that  Microsoft unfairly used its Windows monopoly to displace competitors in the markets for computer servers and media player programs.

The Commission is worried that otherwise  Microsoft will "bundle" more features into Longhorn, shutting out rivals. But the company has maintained that any attempt at a general rule to prevent it incorporating new features would be much more radical than the current case. It argues that consumers and software developers benefit from product integration, a reason why the US looks at such issues on a case by
case basis.

The Commission already has a complaint pending about  Microsoft's current operating system, Windows XP and alleged bundling.

Mario Monti,  competition commissioner, will demand on Wednesday that  Microsoft offers computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Media Player program within 90 days and that it shares technical information with rivals within 120 days. .

In practice, such deadlines may not apply.  Microsoft will ask the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to suspend the demands on the grounds that they would cause "irreparable harm".

The mere request for a suspension can delay Commission demands from taking effect. And EU lawyers believe that Bo Vesterdorf, the president of the court, may not be able to pronounce on the request until up to September.

The European Commission declined Monday to reveal the amount of possible  fines it could impose on US software giant Microsoft in connection with an expected ruling that the company abused its dominant market position.
"We have a obligation to confidentiality," Amelia Torres, spokeswoman for European  Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti, told reporters.

TD
Torres said she would not give any information on what had taken place during a brief meeting of experts to study the matter.

European competition regulators appear set Wednesday to impose hard-hitting sanctions on the world's biggest software firm.

The Seattle-based company run by Bill Gates has denied it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors.

It has already vowed to appeal to the European Court of Justice against the expected decision by the commission - the European Union's executive arm.

The amount of possible  fines could in theory reach 10 percent of  Microsoft's annual sales, or nearly three billion euros (3.7 billion dollars)
More likely is an amount closer to 200 million euros, according to observers' forecasts. But one source close to the matter said that amount was an underestimation.
EU experts, who unanimously backed the  competition authorities' analysis of the case last Monday, also agreed with the proposed level of  fines, the source added.
To date, the biggest  fine levied by the commission on a single company for infraction of  competition
rules was the 462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001.
The company was sanctioned for joining a cartel in the vitamin sector.

The biggest  fine for abuse of dominant market position was levied in 1991 against the Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak for 71 million euros.

In addition to the expected  fine, Microsoft is likely to be handed a list of "remedies" it must enact to satisfy EU  competition authorities.
Among them is expected to be a requirement that  Microsoft distribute its Windows operating system in
Europe without its multimedia program Media Player, to give rival products a better chance of competing.

Monti's service will also direct  Microsoft to share programming code to enable rivals to make software that can work with its low-end servers. These enable computers to hook up to a network and are a key battleground in the IT industry.

Media Player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for computer users in the multimedia age.

"It is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market," he said Thursday.

European regulators plan to levy a record  fine of more than $600 million against  Microsoft as part of what is expected to be a strongly worded rebuke of the company's business practices.

The ruling, which is set to be announced on Wednesday, is expected to include a  fine approaching $617 million (500 million Euros), according to a source. In addition, the commission is expected to endorse its preliminary finding that  Microsoft abused its monopoly power and to order the company to offer a
version of Windows without Windows Media Player.  Microsoft would also be required to make it easier for rivals to interact with its server software.

TD
The European Commission could have fined Microsoft up to 10 percent of its annual revenue, or
more than $3 billion. Even the proposed fine, which is said to be $613 million, would be a record penalty
for European regulators.

Microsoft, which sought to settle the case, said it feels a  fine of that magnitude is unwarranted.

"Microsoft and the commission worked very hard and in good faith to try and resolve the very complex legal issues around this case," said spokesman Jim Desler. "It's hard to see how a  fine of this magnitude could be warranted under these circumstances."

Ahead of the ruling,  Microsoft indicated it is likely to appeal the commission's decision. The company would first seek a stay of any penalties from the European Court of First Instance and could eventually appeal to the European Court of Justice.

"Obviously we do not agree with the commission in several key areas," Desler said. "It's very likely we will seek review by the courts." Any appeal would also seek a reduction or elimination of the  fine.
Even if the appeals were rejected,  Microsoft would have no problem paying a  fine. The company held
$52.8 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Dec. 31.

"It's a dent in quarterly earnings," said Directions on  Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff. "It's not going to significantly affect  Microsoft's future business."
The fine, Rosoff noted, is less than the $750 million that  Microsoft agreed to pay AOL Time Warner
(now renamed Time Warner) last year to settle that company's private  antitrust suit.

The real issue, Rosoff said, is whether European regulators should be able to affect  Microsoft's future ability to add features into Windows.

Microsoft has indicated it may have agreed to settle the current issues raised by the EU, but was not prepared to agree to similar limits in the future.

"I think the problem here is the EU is determined to restrict  Microsoft's future behavior. They want to say what Microsoft can and cannot do when it comes to bundling future features," Rosoff said. "Microsoft's core belief is that they are the only one with a right to determine what goes in Windows."

Regulation: Watching Europe's Lilliputians try to strap down another great American company reminds us of a prediction we hoped wouldn't come true.

TD
The date was June 8, 2000, a day after a federal judge, having already found  Microsoft in violation of antitrust laws, ordered the software giant broken up.

"Now that another scimitar has dropped in the government's jihad ... the company likely will face years of appeals, wasted resources and depressed stock prices," we said in this space.

It took 2 1/2 years for  Microsoft to settle its differences with the U.S. Justice Department. But Europe's antitrust arm is still twisting. This week, following the breakdown of settlement talks, the European Commission is expected to levy  fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars and order changes in the way Microsoft does business.
Yes, the company can appeal. First to the "Court of First Instance" in Luxembourg, then to the
"European Court of Justice." And how long will that take? You guessed it - "years."

Meantime,  Microsoft's stock, by far the biggest on a Nasdaq that has recovered 77% in 18 months, still can't get off the mat.
Like we said, we wish we hadn't been so prescient. It pains us to think of how many millions of
Americans, directly or indirectly, depend on  Microsoft at least in part for their financial well-being.
But it wasn't like we hadn't seen it before. Millions were invested in the greatest tech company of
the previous generation - International Business Machines - when the government decided that that
firm, too, couldn't be left to its own success.

That antitrust vendetta - many called it a "fiasco" after the government finally concluded it didn't have a case - lasted 13 years.
All we can say is thank goodness for a free-enterprise system that keeps turning out new IBMs and
Microsofts. If we didn't have that, and if we kept eating our own like we do, no telling where we'd be.

Last week, negotiations broke down between  Microsoft and European Commission antitrust regulators -- led by competition czar Mario Monti -- to settle the European antitrust case. This week, it is all but certain that the commission will declare Microsoft in violation of competition laws, fine the company and impose enormous restrictions on how Microsoft does business. At the heart of the ruling, the commission is essentially telling  Microsoft that any further improvement of its flagship Windows operating system is illegal.
---

TD
Simply put, this ruling is bad for technology, bad for the competitive marketplace, bad for European-U.S. relations and bad for consumers. While there have been signs pointing to this impasse, the EU has now made it very clear that it will put the interests of  Microsoft's competitors above the interests of consumers, competition and economic growth. Does this also mean that a major producer like Nokia cannot add new features to its cell phones if a competitor complains? Can we see our way out of this quagmire?

The European  antitrust case against Microsoft runs parallel to the U.S. case in many regards, though there are crucial differences. Both cases primarily involve U.S.-based companies --  Microsoft and Netscape (now part of Time Warner's AOL division) in the U.S. case;  Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks in the European case. Both examined how  Microsoft shared its software code with rivals and how Microsoft integrated new functions into Windows.

In spite of these similarities, there is one striking difference between the two cases: The U.S. case is over. Since November 2001,  Microsoft has been operating under a series of sanctions outlined in a settlement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice and several states. In November 2002, that settlement earned the approval of the U.S. District Court, which continues to oversee compliance. Earlier this year, the supervising federal judge said the settlement was working "as envisioned."

In most respects, the U.S.-approved sanctions address the  European Commission's concerns. Microsoft has been placed under stringent requirements to share and license software code and other technical information so that other companies' products can better "interoperate" with Windows. (Never mind that thousands of programs worked just  fine with Windows before the case.) The agreement also forced Microsoft to modify Windows so that access to certain functions can be hidden and replaced with rival products. For instance, manufacturers and computer end-users can hide  Microsoft's Web browsing tool (Internet Explorer) or music/video tool (Windows Media Player) and instead use competing products like Netscape Communicator or RealNetworks' RealPlayer.

As these settlement terms suggest,  Microsoft made large concessions to bring the U.S. case to a close. The company has altered how it develops, markets and licenses its products. At the same time, Microsoft has not been prevented from competing or improving the Windows operating system. Consumers can continue to benefit from  Microsoft's innovations, and rival software companies must continue to compete to win customers. Ideally, the U.S. settlement should be a model for a global resolution to  antitrust challenges to Microsoft.


Page 42 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But now the company essentially faces double jeopardy in Europe. In fact, one trade group made up of Microsoft's fiercest rivals -- the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) -- has advocated harsher penalties on both sides of the Atlantic. In other words, rather than compete in the marketplace, other companies have shopped their complaints to different jurisdictions to see where they could take the biggest bite out of  Microsoft. The European Commission has become a de facto court of appeals for parties dissatisfied with the decision reached in the U.S. The commission listened to Microsoft's rivals, but it is clear that they did not fully consider how their effort to manage competitive markets will affect consumers.

The ruling by the commission's  competition regulators would have greater credibility if Europe-based companies had a central stake in the dispute. But the case is largely an American affair, which is all the more reason for the ruling of the U.S. courts to take precedence. In addition, the U.S. and the EU have in place an agreement that codifies the age-old diplomatic principle of "comity" between nations when it comes to enforcing  antitrust. Under this principle, the commission should defer to the U.S. decision to avoid conflict.

While Microsoft agreed to a tough settlement at home, in Europe the company has wisely decided that enough is enough. Instead of agreeing to a settlement that would undermine the U.S. settlement and impinge on the company's fundamental ability to operate,  Microsoft will likely appeal the commission's ruling to Europe's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Microsoft has a good chance to succeed with the Court of First Instance, which has struck down several other recent rulings from Commissioner Monti's office. An appeal also serves notice that companies cannot easily disrupt the competitive marketplace just by invoking the wrath of EU regulators. Unfortunately -- for consumers, the global economy, and the tech sector -- the next ruling in the case could be another three years off.

In spite of the global move toward more-open trade policies, contradictory  antitrust regulations are creating roadblocks -- and adding expenses -- for international companies. In May, the make-up of the European Commission will change when 10 new nations are admitted to the EU. Primarily former Soviet bloc countries, these new members strongly support free markets, a lesson learned from decades of suffering under command economies.

With a new commission in place -- and a new  competition commissioner taking office in the fall -- the U.S. should seek ways to find common ground with Europe on  antitrust. Without systemic change, history will repeat itself: Another U.S.-based company will be stymied in Europe; another U.S. court decision will be effectively trumped by EU regulators; and mercenary companies will continue to seek competitive advantages in the political arena -- all at the expense of consumers.

HD     Source: EU panel backs fine against Microsoft as antitrust case nears end

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union  antitrust officials won backing Monday for a reportedly record-setting  fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could also force far-reaching changes on how the U.S. company sells Windows.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the fine proposed by EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case told The Associated Press they agreed to it but declined to elaborate.

TD
Another source told Dow Jones Newswires late Monday the  fine would be euro497 million (US$611 million). The German business daily Handelsblatt reported for its Tuesday editions the fine would be euro500 million (US$615 million), citing unidentified sources in the European Commission.

Either would be a record for the EU in an  antitrust case but far below the maximum of around US$3.5 billion in Microsoft's case and easily absorbed by a company with cash reserves in excess of US$50 billion.

Other sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, had estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling Wednesday.
Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres refused to comment on the meeting or the reports.

EU rules allow the Commission to  fine antitrust violators as much as 10 percent of annual global revenue. In practice they have been far lower. The largest ever imposed was less than 2 percent -- euro462 million (US$568 million) -- against Roche Holding AG, one of several companies caught fixing the prices of bulk vitamins in 2001.

The record penalty for charges similar to those  Microsoft faces -- abusing a mononpoly position -- is euro75 million (US$92 million) imposed on Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak AB in 1991.

Monday's meeting came a week after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the 5-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

The EU is expected to require  Microsoft to make the stripped-down version available at some kind of discount, although analysts say any order that smacks of price-setting would be vulnerable to a court challenge.
"That's something that all regulators strive to avoid," said David Smith, an analyst at research firm Gartner
Inc.

Page 44 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Attempts at a settlement failed last week over  Microsoft's reluctance to accept provisions that could have prevented it from adding features to future versions of Windows -- a key element of its strategy for selling upgrades.

Monti has indicated he wants a legally binding precedent that can be used to wrap up other cases still pending against  Microsoft and possibly help ward off more.

The EU is already looking into charges from Microsoft competitors that its latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

And Microsoft's next version of Windows, due in 2006, is expected to include a Web search engine that would challenge Google and Yahoo.

The impact of the EU decision could be delayed for years if  Microsoft wins an emergency suspension from the courts pending its promised appeal.

But analysts say it could indirectly hurt  Microsoft's attempts to counter the open-source Linux operating system, which is poised to become a strong competitor to Windows in Asia, especially in the government sector.

"Microsoft has been trying to improve relationships with governments worldwide and an adverse ruling in the EU could hamper those efforts," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

Microsoft, European Officials End Talks

Antitrust settlement talks between Microsoft Corp. and the  European Commission broke down last Thursday, and European competition officials this week plan to ask the commission to rule that Microsoft has abused its desktop operating system monopoly. The regulators will also propose a series of restrictions on  Microsoft's future business conduct. The software vendor said it will appeal the expected decision.

3Com Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., reported that it remained in the red during its third quarter and that revenue fell 21% year over year. The company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be similar to the total from the third quarter, which ended Feb. 27.
SEC Fines Lucent

Lucent Technologies Inc. said it will pay a $25 million  fine to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as part of a deal signed early last year to settle an accounting investigation. Lucent initially wasn't fined, but the company said the SEC's staff has decided that it should be penalized for a lack of cooperation during the investigation. Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent added that it doesn't plan to contest the fine.
Short Takes

Dallas-based i2 Technologies Inc. said it plans to lay off an undetermined number of workers as part of a restructuring aimed at reducing operating expenses by about 10%. . . . IBM said it was tapped by the U.S. Department of Defense to help develop policies for the use of RFIDdevices by military suppliers.

THE THEORETICAL maximum  fine the European Commission can impose for violations of European Union  antitrust laws is 10% of a company's global revenue for the fiscal year preceding the commission's decision. In some editions Friday, a front-page article concerning  Microsoft Corp. incorrectly said the  fine could be higher.

This week, it is all but certain that the EC will declare Microsoft in violation of competition laws, fine the company and impose enormous restrictions on how Microsoft does business. At the heart of the ruling, the EC essentially is telling  Microsoft that any further improvement of its flagship Windows operating system is illegal.

TD
Simply put, this ruling is bad for technology, bad for the competitive marketplace, bad for European-U.S. relations and bad for consumers. While there have been signs pointing to this impasse, the EU has now made it very clear that it will put the interests of  Microsoft's competitors above the interests of consumers, competition and economic growth. Does this also mean that a major producer like Nokia cannot add new features to its cell phones if a competitor complains? Can we see our way out of this quagmire?

The European  antitrust case against Microsoft runs parallel to the U.S. case in many regards, though there are crucial differences. Both cases primarily involve U.S.-based companies --  Microsoft and Netscape (now part of Time Warner's AOL division) in the U.S. case;  Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks in the European case. Both examined how  Microsoft shared its software code with rivals and how Microsoft integrated new functions into Windows.

In spite of these similarities, there is one striking difference between the two cases: The U.S. case is over. Since November 2001,  Microsoft has been operating under a series of sanctions outlined in a settlement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice and several states. In November 2002, that settlement earned the approval of the U.S. District Court, which continues to oversee compliance. Earlier this year, the supervising federal judge said the settlement was working "as envisioned."

In most respects, the U.S.-approved sanctions address the EC's concerns.  Microsoft has been placed under stringent requirements to share and license software code and other technical information so that other companies' products can better "interoperate" with Windows. (Never mind that thousands of programs worked just fine with Windows before the case.)

The agreement also forced  Microsoft to modify Windows so that access to certain functions can be hidden and replaced with rival products. For instance, manufacturers and computer end-users can hide Microsoft's Web browsing tool (Internet Explorer) or music/video tool (Windows Media Player) and instead use competing products like Netscape Communicator or RealNetworks' RealPlayer.

As these settlement terms suggest,  Microsoft made large concessions to bring the U.S. case to a close. The company has altered how it develops, markets, and licenses its products. At the same time, Microsoft has not been prevented from competing or improving the Windows operating system. Consumers can continue to benefit from  Microsoft's innovations, and rival software companies must continue to compete to win customers. Ideally, the U.S. settlement should be a model for a global resolution to  antitrust challenges to Microsoft.

But now the company essentially faces double jeopardy in Europe. In fact, one trade group made up of Microsoft's fiercest rivals -- the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) -- has advocated harsher penalties on both sides of the Atlantic. In other words, rather than compete in the marketplace, other companies have shopped their complaints to different jurisdictions to see where they could take the biggest bite out of  Microsoft. The European Commission has become a de facto court of appeals for parties dissatisfied with the decision reached in the U.S. The commission listened to Microsoft's rivals, but it is clear that they did not fully consider how their effort to manage competitive markets will affect consumers.

The ruling by the commission's  competition regulators would have greater credibility if Europe-based companies had a central stake in the dispute. But the case is largely an American affair, which is all the more reason for the ruling of the U.S. courts to take precedence. In addition, the U.S. and the EU have in place an agreement that codifies the age-old diplomatic principle of "comity" between nations when it comes to enforcing  antitrust. Under this principle, the commission should defer to the U.S. decision to avoid conflict.

While Microsoft agreed to a tough settlement at home, in Europe the company has wisely decided that enough is enough. Instead of agreeing to a settlement that would undermine the U.S. settlement and impinge on the company's fundamental ability to operate,  Microsoft will likely appeal the commission's ruling to Europe's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Microsoft has a good chance to succeed with the Court of First Instance, which has struck down a number of other recent  competition rulings from the commission. An appeal also serves notice that companies cannot easily disrupt the competitive marketplace just by invoking the wrath of commission regulators. Unfortunately -- for consumers, the global economy, and the tech sector -- the next ruling in the case could be another three years off.

In spite of the global move toward more-open trade policies, contradictory  antitrust regulations are creating roadblocks -- and adding expenses -- for international companies. In May, the make-up of the European Commission will change when 10 new nations are admitted to the European Union. Primarily former Soviet bloc countries, these new members strongly support free markets, a lesson learned from decades of suffering under command economies.

With a new commission in place -- and a new  competition commissioner taking office in the fall -- the U.S. should seek ways to find common ground with Europe on  antitrust. Without systemic change, history will repeat itself: Another U.S.-based company will be stymied in Europe; another U.S. court decision will be effectively trumped by EC regulators; and mercenary companies will continue to seek competitive advantages in the political arena -- all at the expense of consumers.

HD         Ruling on Microsoft May Come Too Late --- EU's Antitrust Decision  Isn't Targeted Directly At
New Operating  Systems

BRUSSELS -- An expected  antitrust ruling in Europe this week would be a defeat for  Microsoft Corp. and a victory for two of its fiercest foes. But the ruling may come too late to affect the course of competition in the two technology markets it addresses -- especially if  Microsoft makes good on threats to appeal the decision.

The European Union decision, following the failure of settlement talks last week, is expected to set important precedents about  Microsoft's ability to integrate software into its operating systems, and what information it must disclose to competitors in the market for computer servers.

TD
Those legal principles, for example, could affect what features  Microsoft will be able to include in the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn, which is expected to go on sale in 2006. Longhorn is a vital part of  Microsoft's strategies for penetrating such markets such as home entertainment and Internet searching.

The EU ruling is particularly important to the two companies most affected by  Microsoft's tactics -- Sun Microsystems Inc., which makes large computers called servers, and RealNetworks Inc., which pioneered the market for software that is used to play audio and video on the Web. Besides finding that Microsoft engaged in illegal conduct, the EU is expected to issue orders that are aimed at countering the impact of that behavior.

But the remedies aren't likely to reverse  Microsoft's invasion of those two markets, partly because they are targeted at past behavior and older products. The commission also is investigating a separate complaint related to newer products.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti on Wednesday intends to demand that  Microsoft stop bundling its Windows Media Player audio-visual software for industrial customers, who want a
slimmed-down versions of Windows. In a second part of the case, Mr. Monti plans to ask  Microsoft to cough up more details about its networking software to prevent it from expanding an advantage over companies that need the information to compete in a world where 95% of desktop computers run Windows. He also is expected to impose a stiff  fine likely to be more than 100 million euros.

The approximately 300-page decision by the European Commission, the EU's chief  antitrust authority, would set the stage for an almost-certain Microsoft appeal to the union's second-highest court, the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance. The Redmond, Washington, software company also likely would ask for an emergency injunction allowing it to continue with business as usual until its possibilities for appeal are exhausted -- a process than typically takes three to five years.

"The fundamental issue is how do you know where to draw the line" on what kinds of new features Microsoft can add to Windows without repeatedly landing itself in court, said one person on Microsoft's European defense team.  Microsoft thinks the line must be drawn on a case-by-case basis and would like the court to say so. The company also hopes an EU court decision might help bridge differences between European and U.S. regulatory traditions that make life difficult for companies whose businesses straddle the Atlantic.

The commission, for its part, hopes the EU court will uphold the decision, thus establishing guidance that applies not only to the case at hand but to similar cases. Both Microsoft and Mr. Monti cited the failure to agree on sufficiently forward-looking principles regarding Microsoft's business practices as the main reason the commission proceeded to a formal decision rather than agreeing to a settlement.

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer met with Mr. Monti three days last week in an effort to clinch the deal. But while other commission officials appeared eager to settle, Mr. Monti insisted that  Microsoft agree to more general restrictions on its ability to add new features to Windows.  Microsoft refused, and Mr. Ballmer flew home Thursday after a brief but cordial farewell with Mr. Monti shortly before the EU's antitrust chief announced talks had broken down.

Now Microsoft will have two months and 10 days to explain in written submissions why judges should overturn the decision and ask the EU court's Danish president, Bo Vesterdorf, for a temporary suspension of the commission's order. At the same time,  Microsoft has to begin making contingency plans in case its request for an injunction is refused. In that case, the company would have to begin implementing the commission's orders as soon as this summer.

The case was originally brought by Sun, which contends that  Microsoft used knowledge of the workings of its dominant Windows operating system on personal computers to its advantage in software for servers, which help manage networks of personal computers. Sun, of Santa Clara, California, filed the EU complaint in 1998 to force  Microsoft to provide sufficient technical information about Windows on PCs to help its server software match features of  Microsoft's server programs.

To attack RealNetworks,  Microsoft began including media-player software with each version of Windows. The tactic was nearly identical to the strategy the company used against Netscape Communications Corp. in Web browser software, which prompted a long-running antitrust case by the U.S. Department of Justice that was settled in 2001. RealNetworks, of Seattle, resisted Microsoft more effectively than Netscape, but its once-dominant media software is now running behind Microsoft's Windows Media Player.

When settlement talks between  Microsoft and the EU broke down last week, Sun and RealNetworks applauded the EU's resolve to set legal ground rules for the software giant's behavior in their markets. But the direct impact of any EU order on their sales, or  Microsoft's, is much less clear.

In the case of Sun, for example, the original complaint focused on technologies needed for servers to communicate with the Windows 2000 operating system and its predecessors. The EU is expected to order Microsoft to release more technical information to help rivals develop server products that work with those PC operating systems, as well as with Windows-based servers.

"We expect to be able to do a lot more than we could in the past," said Lee Patch, a Sun vice president for public affairs.

But the ruling won't apply directly to more recent PC operating systems, such as Windows XP, that are part of a separate  antitrust case before the EU. The ruling also would do nothing to counter an even more important drag on Sun -- the appeal of low-priced servers based on chips made by Intel Corp., Santa Clara, California.

Those machines, which can be used with either Windows or the Linux operating system, are selling quickly. In the fourth quarter of 2003, for example, world-wide sales of servers running Windows grew
16% to $3.9 billion (3.18 billion euros) while Linux server sales surged 63% to $960 million. Sales of servers based on Unix, of which Sun is one of the largest sellers, were flat at $5.1 billion.

If Microsoft wins a stay of any court order pending appeal, the stay may defer imposition of any new disclosure requirement for three or four years.

RealNetworks also would be affected by any stay of a court order. Regardless of the timing, the EU faces an uphill battle in aiding competing makers of media-player software, which also include Apple Computer Inc., of Cupertino, California.

The forthcoming EU order is expected to take a different tack, forcing  Microsoft to deliver a version of Windows in Europe that doesn't have the disputed software. Getting PC makers to use stripped-down software, however, is a tall order. In the U.S. Justice Department's settlement with  Microsoft, PC makers were given latitude to remove access to  Microsoft's Internet browser software, but none chose to do so.

The EU is expected to compel  Microsoft to offer a lower price on versions of Windows that don't have Media Player. But it isn't clear how large that discount could be, or whether it would be enough to influence PC makers or their customers.
Page 53 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Some analysts believe a discount of $5 to $10 -- a large percentage of the $45 to $50 they pay Microsoft for Windows -- would be enough to attract PC makers, since profit margins are so small in that business. But Dan Kusnetzky, an analyst at the research firm IDC in Framingham, Massachusetts, was skeptical. "If I'm buying a $1,000 personal computer, and I'm getting a $10 discount, that is not going to make a significant difference," Mr. Kusnetzky said.

Whatever the short-term impact on software sales, the computer industry will be closely analyzing language in the ruling to see how it addresses issues that will figure in future cases. The EU, for example, could set an important precedent by defining what types of software shouldn't be bundled by Microsoft, and what techniques for integrating programming code are permissable.

Microsoft argues that closely combining the code of additional products with Windows brings technical benefits to consumers. That is an issue as the company develops the Longhorn version of Windows. The forthcoming product is expected to add technology for searching the Internet as well as finding files on a user's computer, affecting such companies as Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc.

Broad statements by the EU about the legality of integrating such features could throw  Microsoft's plans for Longhorn into doubt, as could broad requirements regarding the amount of technical information  Microsoft must give to competitors about such operating systems. Such disclosures will be important to companies that try to make products that exchange information with Windows PCs, including handheld computers, mobile telephones and consumer appliances.
(MORE)

Microsoft, meanwhile, has strong grounds to ask judges for an injunction that would delay imposition of any order, said Stephen Kinsella, a Brussels-based  antitrust partner with law firm Herbert Smith.
The company could argue that its "business model would suffer to an extent that's very hard to quantify and that nobody else would have the money to compensate for any losses," said Mr. Kinsella, who isn't involved in the case.  Microsoft also could complain of "disproportionate" treatment, citing its concessions during settlement negotiations.

But such suspensions don't come easily.  Microsoft has to show "serious and irreparable harm" for Mr. Vesterdorf, the EU court president, to grant a stay of execution beyond mere financial loss, said one person familiar with his policy on granting injunctions. "It won't be easy for  Microsoft to get this relief," said Jacques Lafitte,  Microsoft's former director of corporate affairs for Europe and now managing director of Brussels-based consulting firm Avisa.

If it fails to get an injunction,  Microsoft can seek a "fast-track" court procedure that could produce a judgment within a year or so. But under that procedure,  Microsoft would have to restrict its appeal to a few narrowly defined issues.

HD            Microsoft may lose case, but win time on appeal. BY           By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, March 22 (Reuters) -  Microsoft (MSFT.O) will win one thing after it loses a landmark EU antitrust case this week - months and possibly years before it must do what the European Union executive orders, experts said on Monday.

The European Commission is scheduled to rule on Wednesday that  Microsoft is an abusive monopolist which used the power of its dominant Windows operating system to damage competitors.

TD
As soon as the ruling is issued, the U.S. software giant will go to court and be assured of months of delay.

Microsoft will be ordered to pay a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros, the topic of an advisory committee of EU member states on Monday.
The Commission will order the company to sell a version of its operating system without Windows
Media Player and to encourage computers makers to provide other audiovisual software.

And it must license information at a reasonable rate to make the low-level servers of rivals, used for printing and file services, more compatible with Windows desktop machines.

But as Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said last week soon after settlement negotiations ended in failure: "Today is just another step in what could be a long process."

Microsoft has always made maximum use of courts to assert its rights and this will be no exception, experts say.
"There are enormous possibilities open to  Microsoft to buy time," said David Wood, an  antitrust
lawyer for Howrey Simon.

The company will appeal the Commission ruling and ask the Court of First Instance to suspend remedies until the underlying case is decided. Until the court decides that first question the remedies are suspended.
BACK BURNER

"If they lose the application to suspend they can appeal that to the European Court of Justice. During that period - the better part of a year - it is likely the substantive case will be put on the back burner," Wood said.
The court case itself could take two or three years and an appeal will take an equal amount of time.

The Commission is expected to argue such a long delay will make its remedies irrelevant, because the market will have moved on and it will be too late to stop damage to other companies and to
consumers.

Microsoft is expected to argue that if it is forced to carry out the remedies ordered by the Commission it cannot undo them and will suffer irreparable harm.

Page 58 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Some cases move on fast track, if one party agrees to narrow the issues and the Commission agrees to suspend the remedies. But that would pose no advantage for  Microsoft.

"Microsoft clearly wants to have the issues examined as fully as possible. This seems to make it unlikely that they would wish to use the fast-track procedure," Wood said.

The worst case for  Microsoft is that the remedies would begin to bite once an appeals court ruled they may not be suspended, which could take seven months or more.

The best case is that the remedies would be suspended until the case is finished, which could be seven years or more.

Even if the issues are suspended, the Commission is expected to move full steam ahead on two other investigations of  Microsoft for business practices similar to those that got it in trouble this time.
And although the remedies may be suspended, the precedent set by the Commission in labelling
Microsoft for its abuse of dominance will not disappear.

"You can expect the Commission to apply the precedent they have in their own decision in comparable cases regardless of whether the court delays the entry into force of their remedies," said Sven
Voelcker, an  antitrust lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering in Brussels.

As soon as the ruling is issued, the U.S. software giant will go to court and be assured of months of delay.

Microsoft will be ordered to pay a  fine of hundreds of millions of euros, the topic of an advisory committee of EU member states on Monday.
The Commission will order the company to sell a version of its operating system without Windows
Media Player and to encourage computers makers to provide other audiovisual software.

And it must license information at a reasonable rate to make the low-level servers of rivals, used for printing and file services, more compatible with Windows desktop machines.

But as Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said last week soon after settlement negotiations ended in failure: "Today is just another step in what could be a long process."

Microsoft has always made maximum use of courts to assert its rights and this will be no exception, experts say.
"There are enormous possibilities open to  Microsoft to buy time," said David Wood, an  antitrust
lawyer for Howrey Simon.

The company will appeal the Commission ruling and ask the Court of First Instance to suspend remedies until the underlying case is decided. Until the court decides that first question the remedies are suspended.
BACK BURNER

"If they lose the application to suspend they can appeal that to the European Court of Justice. During that period - the better part of a year - it is likely the substantive case will be put on the back burner," Wood said.
The court case itself could take two or three years and an appeal will take an equal amount of time.

The Commission is expected to argue such a long delay will make its remedies irrelevant, because the market will have moved on and it will be too late to stop damage to other companies and to
consumers.

Microsoft is expected to argue that if it is forced to carry out the remedies ordered by the Commission it cannot undo them and will suffer irreparable harm.

Some cases move on fast track, if one party agrees to narrow the issues and the Commission agrees to suspend the remedies. But that would pose no advantage for  Microsoft.

"Microsoft clearly wants to have the issues examined as fully as possible. This seems to make it unlikely that they would wish to use the fast-track procedure," Wood said.

The worst case for  Microsoft is that the remedies would begin to bite once an appeals court ruled they may not be suspended, which could take seven months or more.

The best case is that the remedies would be suspended until the case is finished, which could be seven years or more.

Even if the issues are suspended, the Commission is expected to move full steam ahead on two other investigations of  Microsoft for business practices similar to those that got it in trouble this time.
And although the remedies may be suspended, the precedent set by the Commission in labelling
Microsoft for its abuse of dominance will not disappear.

"You can expect the Commission to apply the precedent they have in their own decision in comparable cases regardless of whether the court delays the entry into force of their remedies," said Sven
Voelcker, an  antitrust lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering in Brussels.

HD     E.U. REGULATORS MEETING TODAY ON MICROSOFT BY      By PAUL GEITNER

European Union  antitrust officials gather today to review what could be a record-setting  fine against
Microsoft, the final step before issuing a long-awaited decision against the American software giant.

Representatives from the 15 E.U. governments were to consider a proposal from E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti behind closed doors ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the European Commission, the E.U.'s executive body.

TD
That's where Mr. Monti's ruling and  fine, anticipated to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, is expected to be adopted.

E.U. rules allow the commission to  fine antitrust violators as much as 10% of annual global revenue. The largest ever actually imposed on a single company, however, was less than 2%, or $568 million, against Roche Holding AG, one of several companies caught fixing the prices of bulk vitamins in 2001.

Even a fine set at 2% would amount to around $700 million for a giant like  Microsoft, which expects to take in nearly $36 billion this year.

Today's meeting comes two weeks after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Mr. Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the 5-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly to unfairly gain market share in software for playing digital media and running office network servers.

The E.U. is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals and sell a discounted version of Windows without its Media Player software, at least to computer makers in Europe.

Settlement talks collapsed last week over what both sides described as  Microsoft's reluctance to accept provisions that could have prevented it from adding features to future versions of Windows, a key element of its business strategy.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the E.U.'s decision, meaning the case could be tied up in legal wrangling for years.

The U.S. Justice Department, which settled its own  antitrust action against  Microsoft in 2001, said last week it was "premature to speculate" about the E.U. decision.
But it said it believes the American consent decree "provides the appropriate framework for marketplace
competition in this important sector."

HD             Microsoft appeal fails over Longhorn fears: EU concerned new software  to freeze out rivals further

BRUSSELS -  Antitrust fears about Longhorn, the next generation of the Windows operating system, played a key role in last week's  European Commission decision to reject a deal proposed by Microsoft Corp., it emerged this weekend.

The commission's battle with the software giant, which will lead to a formal ruling on Wednesday that the company has broken European law, refers to complaints dating from 1998 and 1999. But commission officials believe the biggest issue for  competition in the tech sector will be Longhorn, expected to be launched in 2006.

TD
The commission will consult member state officials today on the size of a  fine in the current case. Microsoft is set to appeal, arguing that rivals are trying to lay claim to its intellectual property and prevent the company meeting consumer demand for new Windows functions. Talks broke up after the two sides failed to agree to constrain the company's conduct across a range of sectors.
People close to the case say the commission hopes the development of Longhorn will be influenced
by its ruling that  Microsoft unfairly used its Windows monopoly to displace competitors in the markets
for computer servers and media player programs.

The Brussels body is worried that otherwise  Microsoft will "bundle" more features into Longhorn, shutting out rivals.

The commission has a complaint pending over  Microsoft's current operating system, Windows XP, and its alleged bundling of such features as Instant Messenger and Media Player.

Ed Black, head of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which filed the complaint, said: "We view Windows XP as an important case and it is certainly relevant to Longhorn."

Mario Monti, the  competition commissioner, will demand on Wednesday that  Microsoft offers computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Media Player program within 90 days and it shares technical information with rivals within 120 days.

The company would also have to nominate an independent "monitoring trustee" to oversee compliance within 30 days.

In practice, such deadlines may not apply.  Microsoft will ask the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to suspend the commission's demands on the grounds that they would cause "irreparable harm" to the company.

The mere request for a suspension can delay commission demands from taking effect. EU lawyers believe Bo Vesterdorf, president of the court, may not be able to pronounce on the request until July or September.

The talks between  Microsoft and the Commission broke up after the two sides failed to agree on a formula that would have constrained the company's conduct across a range of sectors.

According to people close to the case, the Commission now hopes that the development of Longhorn will be influenced by its ruling that  Microsoft has unfairly used its Windows monopoly to displace competitors in the markets for computer servers and media player programs.

The Brussels body is worried that  Microsoft will "bundle" still more features into Longhorn, shutting out rivals for individual programmes.

The Commission already has a pending complaint about  Microsoft's current operating system, Windows XP, and its alleged bundling of features such as Instant Messenger, Outlook Express and Movie Maker. "We view Windows XP as an important case and it is certainly relevant to Longhorn," said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, the anti-Microsoft grouping that filed the complaint.

In practice, such deadlines may not apply.  Microsoft will ask the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to suspend the Commission's demands on the grounds that they would cause "irreparable harm" to the company. For instance, the company maintains that it has invested enormous sums in developing the code that it would have to share with rivals and that without Media Player, Windows may not be able to function normally.

ATTENTION - ADDS quotes ///
US software giant  Microsoft said Monday EU regulators were unjustified in proposing a record  fine of
497 million euros (613 million dollars) in connection with an expected ruling that the company abused its
dominant market position.

TD
"It's very difficult for  Microsoft to see how a fine of this magnitude could be warranted under these circumstances," company spokesman Lou Gellos told AFP.

"It's certainly unwarranted because we think it comes only from the inability to reach a settlement on one issue after we essentially agreed on every other issue," he said.
Sources close to the case in Brussels said the European Union's Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti is proposing the  fine, and that it was approved by EU competition regulators Monday.
If the  European Commission approves the fine, Gellos said "we certainly will appeal."

Gellos said the only stumbling block between EU regulators and  Microsoft was "our capacity to innovate" with applications like Media Player, which plays video and music.

If approved on Wednesday, it would be the highest fine ever imposed by the EU's executive branch against a single company for contravening competition regulations.

To date, the biggest  fine levied by the commission on a single company for infraction of  competition rules was a 462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001. The company was sanctioned for joining a cartel in the vitamin sector.

The European Union's  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has proposed a record  fine of 497 million euros (613 million dollars) on US software giant  Microsoft in connection with an expected ruling that the company abused its dominant market position, sources close to the case said Monday.

Monti's spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, would not comment on the information, citing the need for confidentiality.

Microsoft said EU regulators were unjustified in proposing such a large  fine as agreement had been reached on nearly all issues.

"It's very difficult for  Microsoft to see how a fine of this magnitude could be warranted under these circumstances," company spokesman Lou Gellos told AFP.

"It's certainly unwarranted because we think it comes only from the inability to reach a settlement on one issue after we essentially agreed on every other issue," he said.
The proposal was approved by EU  competition regulators Monday, the sources said.
If the  European Commission approves the fine on Wednesday Gellos said "we certainly will appeal." If approved on Wednesday, it would be the highest fine ever imposed by the EU's executive branch
against a single company for contravening competition regulations.

To date, the biggest  fine levied by the commission on a single company for infraction of  competition rules was a 462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001. The company was sanctioned for joining a cartel in the vitamin sector.
The biggest  fine for abuse of dominant market position - 71 million euros - was levied in 1991 against the
Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak.

Microsoft, the world's biggest software firm, has denied it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors.

Gellos said the only stumbling block between EU regulators and  Microsoft was "our capacity to innovate" with applications like Media Player, which plays video and music.

Media Player is likely to the subject of one the "remedies" it must enact to satisfy EU  competition authorities, with the Seattle-based company run by Bill Gates expected to be ordered to distribute its Windows operating system in Europe without Media Player to give rival products a better chance of competing.

Media Player handles sound and visual data, such as radio and TV streams and MP3 files - a function that has become all the more important for computer users in the multimedia age.

Monti's service will also direct  Microsoft to share programming code to enable rivals to make software that can work with its low-end servers. These enable computers to hook up to a network and are a key battleground in the IT industry.

Monti, whose term as  competition commissioner ends in October, has stuck to his guns in the face of claims by Microsoft that his verdict will do nothing for  competition and everything to block innovation.

"It is essential to have a clear principle for the future conduct of a company which has such a strong dominant position in the market," he said last Thursday.

US software giant  Microsoft is expected Wednesday to face a record  fine of 497 million euros (613 million dollars) for breaking EU  competition law.

The fine, if confirmed by the  European Commission, will dwarf the previous biggest  fine for abuse of dominant market position - 75 million euros - levied in 1991 against Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak.

TD
Herewith the 10 biggest  fines levied to date against companies by the EU executive, which all concerned illegal cartel-type activities:

1. 462 million euros: levied against Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001 for leading a vitamins price-fixing cartel.
2. 296 million euros: Germany's BASF  fined in 2001 for joining the same vitamins cartel.

3. 249.6 million euros: against French cement group Lafarge in 2002 for fixing prices of plasterboard with other companies.

4. 184 million euros: European paper group Arjo Wiggins  fined after probe into carbonless paper sector in 2001.

5. 149 million euros: Japan's Nintendo  fined in 2002 for rigging distribution of its computer consoles and games in Europe.
6. 138.6 million euros: British cement firm BPB  fined in same plasterboard probe that hit Lafarge in 2002.
7. 118 million euros: German chemicals maker Degussa punished for fixing prices of animal feed.

The European Commission accuses US software giant  Microsoft of abusing its market dominance by squelching competitors to its Windows Media Player and to its low-end servers.

Herewith details of the EU executive's case against  Microsoft, along with its proposed remedies, to be unveiled Wednesday by  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

TD
The company is also expected to be  fined 497 million euros (613 million dollars), EU sources say, the highest amount ever levied by the commission in an anti-trust case.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the commission's verdict, which would suspend the  fine and remedies.
MEDIA PLAYER

Microsoft pre-installs Media Player on personal computers (PCs) using the Windows operating system - nine out of 10 of all PCs in use - which the EC says unfairly hinders rival programs such as RealPlayer and Apple QuickTime.

The EC last year surveyed about 50 corporate users of the Media Player, which allows music and video to be played on a Windows PC. The respondents were typically contents owners and providers.

The replies of the respondents "highlighted that the ubiquity of Windows Media Player on PCs artificially skews their development incentives in favour of  Microsoft", the Commission said.

"This confirms the Commission's preliminary conclusion that  Microsoft's tying of Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system weakens  competition... stifles product innovation, and ultimately reduces consumer choice."
SERVERS

In its survey last year, the EC also sought responses from more than 100 companies across Europe that use Microsoft's low-end servers, which allow the firms to connect their staff's PCs to a corporate network.

The key issue here is "interoperability". The Commission says that Windows cannot "talk" to low-end servers made by competitors because  Microsoft refuses to reveal programming code to its rivals.

"An overwhelming majority of customers responding to this market enquiry highlighted that Microsoft's non-disclosure of interface information... did indeed artificially alter their choice in favour of Microsoft's server products," the  European Commission said.
"This behaviour is detrimental to  competition on the merits." PROPOSED REMEDIES
MEDIA PLAYER

The Commission has proposed two alternatives to head off its complaints about the music and video program.


Page 75 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The first and more likely would be for  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without Media
Player ("untying"), which Brussels has said is "the normal remedy for a tying infringement".
The second would be a "must-carry" provision, obliging  Microsoft to offer competing media players with
Windows.
SERVERS

Microsoft must give its competitors in the low-end server market the necessary programming
("interface") information to enable them to make their products work with Windows PCs.

This would enable rival vendors of low-end servers "to compete on a level playing-field with  Microsoft", Brussels says.

US stocks swung higher Tuesday after a three-session losing streak as investors shifted their focus away from geopolitical fears and were encouraged by upbeat earnings news.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 27.40 points, or 0.27 percent, to 10,092.15 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.60 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,912.50 at 1630 GMT.

TD
The broad-market Standard and Poor's 500 index edged up 1.58 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,096.98.

The modest snapback came a day after Wall Street averages hit a three-month low Monday, as the Dow blue-chip index tumbled 1.20 percent and the Nasdaq sank 1.57 percent.

"It's a technical rebound after two or three lousy days," said Jay Suskind, director of trading at Ryan, Beck and Co.

"People are maybe thinking this is perhaps a good entry point into the market ahead of the first quarter earnings season."

Analysts said a better-than-expected earnings report from Palm One was helping to shift investor attention away from terrorism and geopolitical concerns. Goldman Sachs also reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, while Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria's Secret store chain, raised its first-quarter outlook.
Still, few analysts were ready to predict the correction had bottomed out.

"Wall Street remains boxed in by geopolitical uncertainties on one side and the absence of dramatic economic and earnings news on the other," said Larry Wachtel at Prudential Securities. "Help is coming in April with first-quarter earnings, but that is light years away."

Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg said there were other concerns as well and that it was not clear how quickly Wall Street could bounce back from three "ugly" sessions.

"Risk aversion is clearly mounting," he said. "While most cite terrorism, lack of job growth and soaring oil prices as the key reasons underlying the recent distribution, it actually looks like investors have come to the realization that the economy will no longer surprise to the upside."

Retailers were in focus after a report showing a 0.2 percent rise in weekly chain-store sales and other developments in the sector.

The biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, edged up eight cents to 58.18 after formally launching its music download service for 88 cents per song.
Limited Brands climbed 39 cents to 19.68 after lifting its monthly sales and quarterly earnings outlook. Jones Apparel Group rose 29 cents to 35.95 after announcing a 297 million dollar hostile cash bid for
Maxwell Shoe, up 43 cents to 22.52.

Goldman Sachs rose 1.37 to 102.67 after reporting a net quarterly profit that surged 95 percent from a year ago.


Page 77 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Elsewhere in the sector, Bank of America added 51 cents to 79.42 after announcing a new financial director as part of a management shakeup.

PalmOne surged 4.10 or nearly 30 percent to 17.94 after the handheld computer maker said it sharply cut its losses in the latest quarter.

Microsoft drifted down a penny to 24.49, extending its losses after reports that the  European                   Commission was preparing to impose a record  antitrust fine on the software titan.

Motorola added 53 cents to 16.71 after announcing an alliance with electronics retailer RadioShack on consumer products.

The bond market was steady, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond easing to 3.722 percent from 3.724 percent Monday and that on the 30-year bond to 4.672 percent from 4.674 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Wall Street shares faded after a promising start Tuesday, leaving the major indexes flat-to-lower as anxiety over geopolitical tensions took the shine off positive earnings news.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back early gains and ended marginally lower, down 1.11 points
(0.01 percent) to 10,063.64 and the Nasdaq composite drifted down 8.10 points (0.42 percent) to
1,901.80.

TD
The Standard and Poor's 500 index edged down 1.45 points (0.13 percent) to 1,093.95.

The markets opened with moderate gains, and then bounced in a narrow range with a late rally attempt fading at the close for a fourth consecutive losing session on Wall Street.

Analysts said investor concerns over an unstable geopolitical situation offset positive corporate news, with analyst-beating earnings from Goldman Sachs and better-than-expected results from PalmOne.

"People are getting nervous again that terrorism is and should be a concern day to day, with economic and earnings numbers taking a back seat mainly by virtue of the fact that there are so few of them at the moment," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates.

Nolte said strong earnings from Goldman Sachs sparked some buying, particularly from overseas investors, but it was not enough to sustain a rebound across the board.

Ralph Acampora at Prudential Securities said the correction of the past few weeks is not yet over, but sees some stabilization ahead.

"Though we do not see prospects, immediately ahead, for termination of the current intermediate correction, we suspect that the recent persistent wholesale liquidation of stock may set the stage for another period of temporary stabilization," he said, adding that he sees "selling exhaustion" by mid-week.
European stocks closed mainly flat, with the London FTSE ending at session lows.

The British FTSE 100 fell 0.35 percent to 4,318.5. The German DAX 30 closed down a marginal 0.01 percent at 3,728.82, while the French CAC 40 also ended flat, but with a rise of 0.02 percent to 3,539.91.
The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone edged up 0.06 percent at 2,713.68.

On Wall Street, retailers were in focus after a report showing a 0.2-percent rise in weekly chain-store sales and other developments in the sector.

The biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, edged up 11 cents to 58.21 after formally launching its music download service for 88 cents per song.
Limited Brands climbed 40 cents to 19.69 after lifting its monthly sales and quarterly earnings outlook. Jones Apparel Group rose 12 cents to 35.78 after announcing a 297-million-dollar hostile cash bid for
Maxwell Shoe, up 50 cents to 22.59.

BRUSSELS -- Microsoft is accusing the European Union of going too far in seeking a record  fine
against it for alleged antitrust abuses.

The software giant says the 615 (m) million dollar U-S proposal penalizes it for behaviour permitted in the United States.

TD
Microsoft's chief European lawyer says the fine appears to have been doubled from what it would have been under the European Commission's own guidelines.

The European Commission is to issue its ruling against  Microsoft -- including the fine -- tomorrow.

The E-U's executive body won't confirm the level of the proposed  fine, or comment on  Microsoft's complaints.

Sources familiar with the five-year-old case say the E-U ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision.

BRUSSELS

European Union states Monday backed a proposal to  fine Microsoft Corp. a record $814.6 million Cdn for abusing its dominance of PC operating systems, an EU member state source said.

TD
Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the proposal from EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

Monti has indicated he wants a legally binding precedent that can be used to wrap up other cases still pending against  Microsoft and possibly help ward off more.

If the full  European Commission backs the fine as expected on Wednesday it would exceed the $759 million penalty imposed on Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for being ringleader of a vitamin cartel.

Microsoft associate general counsel for Europe Horacio Gutierrez said in a statement the  fine was unjustified.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government and the conduct at issue has been permitted by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. courts," he said.

Microsoft reiterated plans to appeal.

As well as the  fine, Microsoft is to be ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software.
It must also license information
to make the servers of rivals more compatible with Windows desktop machines.

The fine amounts to slightly more than one per cent of  Microsoft's roughly $53 billion US cash on hand and did not impress analysts and critics.
"This is a traffic ticket for  Microsoft," said Thomas Vinje of Clifford Chance, who represents  Microsoft
critics.
Neil Macehiter, an analyst with London-based technology research firm Ovum, said even a $3 billion
fine would have been "an irritant to  Microsoft but certainly wouldn't break the bank."

A source close to  Microsoft argued that the size of the  fine was unprecedented and inappropriate because it took into account operations in the U.S. instead of just in Europe.

Page 82 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission noted its rules on such  fines are pegged to a company's worldwide turnover.

The absolute limit on a  fine is 10 per cent of annual turnover for the year before the decision, which for Microsoft would amount to $3.43 billion. But the formula used for calculating a  fine means the limit is rarely reached.

In Microsoft's view there is no reason it should be  fined. Commission regulations say a company must infringe rules "either intentionally or negligently" to warrant a  fine and Microsoft says it did neither.

The two sides held months of talks to find a settlement.  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said the very fact that the Commission rejected such a deal with the firm, in part to obtain a legal precedent, shows no precedent existed before, meaning such behaviour had not in the past been found to be anti-competitive. In a case like this a symbolic  fine or none would be justified, Brookes said.

Microsoft continues to generate cash at a rapid rate, and on January 22 projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current quarter.

HD           EU endorses  record fine in Microsoft antitrust case; But $600-million penalty may be less important than changes in practices

Brussels BELGIUM
European antitrust officials backed plans to slap  Microsoft Corp. with a record  fine of more than
$600-million (U.S.) as the company sought fresh support for a settlement that had already been
rejected last week.

TD
Regulators from the European Union's 15 national competition authorities threw their support behind the record fine yesterday, just two days before the European Commission is expected to hand down a formal decision finding the Redmond, Wash., company in violation of EU antitrust law.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has been circulating details of its settlement offer to some EU officials who weren't given a chance to accept it initially, according to people familiar with the situation. European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti rejected the same settlement offer last week, insisting that he wanted a formal commission decision to set a precedent for the future.

People familiar with the  European Commission's plans said the EU's chief  antitrust authority intends to seek a fine of 497 million euros ($613.4-million U.S.), which would be a record for EU
anti-competition cases but well below the 3 billion euros, or 10 per cent of a company's annual sales, that would be authorized by EU law in  Microsoft's case.

The fine would be about twice the amount  Microsoft expected, and more than four times the previous European record of 75 million euros in a case involving similar  antitrust offenses. That  fine was imposed on Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak AB in 1991 for abusing its dominance in the market
for filling machines for beverage cartons.

Microsoft immediately said such a  fine would be unwarranted.

âWe believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government and the conduct at issue has been permitted by both the [U.S.] Department of Justice and a U.S. court,â said Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief counsel in Europe.

Analysts say even a large  fine is less important for a company with more than $32.2-billion in revenue than lasting changes that it might be forced to make in its business practices.  Microsoft's continuing contacts with EU officials after Mr. Monti announced talks had broken down last week also underline
its determination to find a settlement, even though Mr. Monti is expected to formally charge the company with antitrust violations tomorrow.

Microsoft's defence team says it has little chance of convincing Mr. Monti's 19 fellow commissioners on the EU's executive body to overrule his decision when they are asked to rule against  Microsoft tomorrow.

Page 89 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Instead, people familiar with the case say the most likely time for renewed settlement talks would be after the first court issues its ruling two to three years from now, particularly if the court voids part of the commission's case during the company's expected appeal. That would match the strategy Microsoft pursued in the United States, where it reached a settlement with the government after an order by a district court judge that would have broken up the company was set aside by an appeals court in 2001.

The same panel of European national  antitrust authorities that recommended a  fine against Microsoft yesterday already has given Mr. Monti its unanimous backing for a formal commission finding that  Microsoft abused the virtual monopoly of its Windows operating system for personal computers to leverage its way into related markets for networking and multimedia software.

A decision by the commission tomorrow would set the stage for a lengthy appeal by  Microsoft to the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance. Such appeals normally take two to three years, but could take as many as five years if either  Microsoft or the commission appealed the first court's ruling to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court.
Time could work in Microsoft's favour.

In circulating details of its proposed settlement to EU officials who weren't consulted before Mr. Monti rejected it,  Microsoft contrasted the âimmediate effectâ of a settlement with the possibility of delayed implementation of any remedy at least âfor several yearsâ pending an appeal.

"ETERNAL VIGILANCE is the price of supremacy", wrote Mark Twain, the celebrated American author. Bill Gates, chairman of  Microsoft, is beginning to know what he meant. Only in  Microsoft's case, it's not so much eternal vigilance that's required, as a constant back to the wall, fists and boots flying, fight against a seemingly endless onslaught of knife-carrying challengers.  Microsoft is proving an extraordinarily resilient and determined fighter, but this is not a battle it can ultimately win.

The general assumption to date has been that regulators pose the biggest threat to  Microsoft's monopoly of desk-top operating systems and many of the applications they carry, but a change of Administration ensured that the US Justice Department backed off before any serious damage could be done.

TD
The European Commission looks a rather more serious threat. Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, failed in talks with Mario Monti last week to sweet talk the European  Competition Commissioner into a compromise solution on the two main areas of concern - providing more information on Windows to rival server providers and producing a version of Windows that is free of the
Microsoft Media Player. The EU now seems certain to proceed in a ruling tomorrow to a heavy  fine and a generalised ruling that  Microsoft has been abusing its dominant market position.

Yet with  Microsoft equally certain to appeal, years of legal wrangling loom - a stand-off which guarantees few concessions are made in the meantime.

Microsoft is good at fighting anti-trust regulators, as it proved in the US, and perhaps remarkably, it's been pretty good at defending its position in the market place while these distractions take place. Yet it is from increased competition that the biggest long term threat to the  Microsoft monopoly comes. As our story on page 36 illustrates, there is growing customer resistance to and dissatisfaction with Microsoft. Major users don't like the licensing system through which they are charged, and they increasingly don't trust the systems they are buying.

The difficulty has been that until quite recently there's been little in the way of viable alternatives. The rapid growth of "open source" operating systems such as Linux is changing all that. Nothing will happen overnight, but even with monopolies as new and mighty as  Microsoft there comes a tipping point of dissatisfaction and competitive innovation which can have a sudden and dramatic effect.

We are already witnessing the first stages of that process.  Microsoft's now almost monthly need to update its Windows operating system to repair some newly discovered flaw in security or mechanics has become a growing source of frustration to all concerned. Security is an issue for all software, not just Microsoft, but the damage to public trust in the product is much greater when you happen to be the dominant supplier.  Microsoft is as vigilant a supremacist as they come, but ultimately it will prove no match for the power of innovation and white hot pace of technological change.

BRUSSELS -- Europe's top  antitrust regulator received backing from European Union member states to slap Microsoft Corp. with a record 497 million euro ($610 million)  fine. But the software giant continued to push for a settlement that would avert an open-ended legal battle.

Microsoft has been circulating details of its settlement offer to some EU officials who weren't given a chance to accept it initially, according to people familiar with the situation. European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti rejected the same settlement offer last week, insisting that he wanted a formal commission decision to set a "precedent."

TD
The European Commission Wednesday is expected to hand down a formal decision finding the
Redmond, Wash., company in violation of EU  antitrust law.

Though a record, the proposed fine against Microsoft is well below the 10% of the company's annual sales that the European Commission is authorized to seek. That size  fine would come to about 3 billion euros.

Antitrust authorities for the EU member nations already have given Mr. Monti their unanimous backing for a formal commission finding that  Microsoft abused the near monopoly of its Windows operating system for personal computers to leverage its way into related markets for networking and multimedia software.

Microsoft immediately said a fine of any size would be unwarranted. "We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government and the conduct at issue has been permitted by both the [U.S.] Department of Justice and a U.S. court," said Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief counsel in Europe.

Microsoft's defense team acknowledges it has little chance of persuading Mr. Monti's 19 fellow commissioners on the EU's executive body to overrule his decision when they are asked to rule against Microsoft.

Instead, the company is expected to continue pressing for a settlement even as it appeals the commission's decision in EU courts.

Initial appeals can take two or three years, and as long five years if further appeals by either side are pursued.

Legal settlements often aren't reached until after court rulings, which can clarify the stakes to both sides of a case. Microsoft's long-running battle with U.S.  antitrust regulators wasn't settled until the fall of
2001, after an order by a district court judge that would have broken up the company was set aside by an appeals court.




Page 93 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The EU case against  Microsoft, which was brought by rival Sun Microsystems Inc. in 1998 and later expanded to encompass RealNetworks Inc., claims the company is making inroads into their markets by abusing its Windows monopoly.

"Perhaps with additional legal clarity there'll be other opportunities for renewed attempts to settle the case," said one person familiar with the case.

Several national competition authorities confirmed Monday that they had received the settlement details from Microsoft. "There might be further discussions with the commission [about a settlement] after the decision," said one national  antitrust official. "There have been many comments to the commission from [EU] member states in this case on the settlement," despite the fact member states weren't formally consulted on the settlement, this person added.

Time could work in Microsoft's favor. The company is likely to ask the Court of First Instance, the first stopping place for an appeal, to freeze the commission's orders related to changes in its business practices pending the outcome of an appeal. Many Brussels-based  antitrust lawyers unconnected with the case say Microsoft has a fighting chance of winning that request.

If that happens, some of the companies most directly affected by the commission's decision, including Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks, wouldn't see any regulatory relief for years, and could find themselves marginalized in their markets, according to one person familiar with the commission's thinking.

"RealNetworks is here to stay," said Dave Stewart, deputy general counsel of RealNetworks, "but given the considerable harm  Microsoft's bundling causes to competition, an effective remedy should be imposed as soon as possible to bring the benefits of competition to European consumers." He was referring to  Microsoft's practice of continuously adding new features to Windows, sometimes to the detriment of companies that produce competing products.

In circulating details of its proposed settlement to EU officials who weren't consulted before Mr. Monti rejected it,  Microsoft contrasted the "immediate effect" of a settlement with the possibility of delayed implementation of any remedy at least "for several years" pending an appeal. Moreover, the company emphasized that its settlement offered remedies that went well beyond changes the commission has the authority to demand.

The commission decision, for example, would require  Microsoft to make available to computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software. The commission argues that this would allow PC makers to choose to install a different media player, depriving Microsoft of the unfair competitive advantage of having the only player preinstalled on millions of new PCs world-wide.

The commission's jurisdiction for such an order is limited to Europe,  Microsoft argues in the document being circulated to EU officials, while the company offered an alternative solution that would have applied world-wide. The document suggested  Microsoft could ensure that three alternative media players could be preinstalled on some 300 million new PCs a year in Europe and "in many other parts of the world," thus "ensuring that European and other consumers have ready access to a broad variety of media players without having to download them from the Internet." The commission's proposed solution, by contrast, "is unlikely to have any impact," the document says.

Microsoft said its settlement also offered increased support for non-Microsoft audio-visual file formats world-wide, which would benefit companies such as RealNetworks and Apple Computer Inc. that promote their own file formats.

HD            EU may fine Microsoft record 497 mil. euros over Windows  sales. WC           249 words

Officials from European Union (EU) member states backed Monday a proposal to  fine Microsoft
Corp. a record 497 million euros (about $613.5 million) for what they deem anticompetitive behavior in
selling personal-computer operating systems, EU sources said.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, is to hand down a final ruling Wednesday on whether to slap the fine or not.

TD
Some U.S. and European news organizations said the commission is highly likely to rule that
Microsoft impinged upon EU law for ensuring businesses engage in fair  competition.
But the size of the  fine may be revised by the commission, they said.

If the commission approves the proposed sum, it would eclipse the 462 million euro penalty imposed on Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for being the ringleader in a vitamin cartel.

Earlier, the commission decided that the marketing technique  Microsoft used to integrate Windows Media Player audiovisual software into its Windows operating systems contravenes fair marketing rules.
Then, the commission required  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows - one with Windows Media
Player and the other without it - to computer makers for installation in computers sold in Europe.

The commission believes integrating the software in Windows has made Windows excessively attractive, putting its competitors at a disadvantage.

On March 18, talks between  Microsoft and the commission broke down over the commission's request that  Microsoft offer the two versions.

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - European  antitrust regulators will fine Microsoft 497 million euros, or $613 million, on Wednesday, when it rules that the company abused its monopoly in computer operating systems, people close to the company said on Monday.

TD
The fine, which was set late last week after settlement talks with  Microsoft broke down, was endorsed by national regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union on Monday.

Microsoft said the fine was too big. "In view of the absence of a clear legal standard under EU law, a
fine of this size isn't warranted," said Tom Brookes, the company's spokesman in Brussels.

On Tuesday, the fine is to be discussed by senior aides to all 20 commissioners before being brought up at the European Commission's final meeting on the case Wednesday morning.

Microsoft would then be officially notified of the  fine and sent a summary of the ruling by fax, shortly before Mario Monti,  competition commissioner, announces the decision.

Under EU antitrust laws, the commission can set a  fine of as much as 10 per cent of a company's global sales -- in Microsoft's case more than $35 billion. European  antitrust regulators, however, have never fined a company 10 percent, and Brussels-based lawyers and officials had expected the  fine against Microsoft to total between 100 million euros and 1 billion euros.

The biggest previous  fine imposed by the commission was 462 million euros, or about $406 million at the exchange rate at that time, against Roche of Switzerland in 2001 for its role in a number of cartels that fixed prices and market shares of vitamin products in the 1990s. (Seven other vitamin makers were fined lesser amounts in the case.)

Still, some people close to  Microsoft had been speculating over the weekend that the commission would not issue any  fine at all.

But Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Monti, said, "We have already told  Microsoft many times that a negative ruling will incur a  fine.
"A small company could claim it didn't know the rules, but not one the size of  Microsoft."

Microsoft abused the monopoly position of its Windows operating system in two different ways, the commission is expected to rule on Wednesday. By withholding vital information about Windows from rival makers of software for PC network server computers, the company gained an unfair advantage in the separate market for server software. It also competed unfairly by including its Media Player
audio-video software as part of Windows. The commission is expected to announce remedies to restore

competition in these markets, requiring  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to PC makers in
Europe, one of them with Media Player stripped out.

It would also have to share more secret Windows code to allow rival server software makers to compete with Microsoft server software more fairly, according to people close to the case. Computer servers drive networks of PCs.

These remedies would have more of an impact on  Microsoft than a fine, because the company has more than $50 billion in cash reserves and has already set some of that aside for covering legal costs incurred fighting this case.

After negotiations toward a settlement of the charges collapsed last week,  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, said the company would appeal any ruling at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

HD         EU to fine Microsoft a record euros 500m: Firm likely to appeal against 'unprecedented' penalty

The European commission is preparing to fine Microsoft a record-breaking euros 497m (pounds
333m) for abusing its dominance of the personal computer software market.

Representatives of national  competition authorities from the 15 European Union governments took less than an hour yesterday to approve the proposed penalty put forward by the EU  competition commissioner, Mario Monti. The meeting had been scheduled to last all day.

TD
The penalty was far higher than had been expected. The commission has the power to levy a  fine equal to up to 10% of sales, which would in  Microsoft's case mean a fine of $3.5bn (pounds 1.9bn), but penalties rarely reach the 10% limit.
The fine tops the previous high of euros 462m levied against the drugs maker Hoffman- La Roche in
2001 for being the ringleader in a vitamins cartel.

The 20 European commissioners meet tomorrow to give final consideration to the proposal. The members are expected to give their overwhelming backing.

Microsoft's associate general counsel for Europe, Horacio Gutierrez, responded to the widely leaked figure in a statement last night.

He described the penalty as "unprecedented and inappropriate". Commission regulations say that a company must infringe rules "either intentionally or negligently" and  Microsoft argued that it did neither and could not have known it that it was breaking anti-monopoly rules.

But critics of the company noted that Microsoft, which is sitting on a $53bn cash pile, could easily absorb the fine. "This is a traffic ticket for Microsoft," said Thomas Vinje of the law firm Clifford Chance, which represents some of Microsoft's rivals.

Mr Monti issued a draft ruling last week which found that  Microsoft had abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software. The EU is expected also to set limits on the bundling of  Microsoft software, demanding that the company offer a version of its Windows operating system without its Media Player software to help competing products on to desktops. It will also order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals in the server market.

Microsoft is expected to appeal the ruling in a case that has already dragged on for five years. Settlement talks between  Microsoft and the commission broke down last week. The company was reluctant to accept a provision that would have curbed new features on Windows.

Microsoft's Windows operating system is on 90% of the world's personal computers, which means it has the power to make or break rival software firms.

The two companies likely to benefit most from the ruling are Sun Microsystems, which makes servers, and RealNetworks, which pioneered software to enable audio and video on personal computers.

Microsoft was found to have abused its monopoly by a US court in 2000, although the tough remedies the judge originally proposed were substantially watered down on appeal. It reached a landmark settlement with the US government in 2002.

Microsoft faces fresh EU inquiries into allegations that its Windows XP system is allowing it to extend its dominance into other technologies such as mobile phones.

Microsoft is also under scrutiny because the next version of Windows, in 2006, is expected to include a search engine that would challenge the likes of Google.

BRUSSELS:

The European Commission will fine Microsoft a record 497 million on Wednesday for abusing its monopoly in computer operating systems, people close to the company said Monday.

TD
The fine, the equivalent of $613 million, which was set late last week after settlement talks with Microsoft broke down, was backed on Monday by national  competition regulators from the 15 Union member states.

People close to  Microsoft were speculating over the weekend that the commission would not issue any
fine at all.

In previous antitrust cases, the commission has waived a  fine in cases where the company involved didn't know it was breaking European  antitrust law, the person said, adding:  Microsoft could argue that it didn't know until now that its behavior broke the rules.

We have already told  Microsoft many times that a negative ruling will incur a  fine, said Amelia Torres, Monti's spokeswoman. A small company could claim it didn't know the rules but not one the size of Microsoft.

BRUSSELS, March 23 (Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) faces an unprecedented  European        Commission decision on Wednesday that will brand it an abusive monopolist, order it to change the way it does business and  fine it a record 497 million euros ($612.7 million).

After a decade of investigating  Microsoft and making deals on narrow licensing issues without any formal findings against the U.S. computer software giant, the European Union executive has decided that more sweeping action is needed to restore  competition.

TD
The 20-member Commission will formally decide the case on Wednesday, but by now the essential details of its ruling have become public.

Microsoft will be ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media
Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software.

The Redmond, Washington-based company must also license information to make the servers of rivals more compatible with Windows desktop machines. Windows runs more than 95 percent of all personal computers.

Microsoft has announced plans to appeal the decision to the courts and will try to get the remedies delayed until the final court appeals are over, a process that could take years.
That limits the immediate impact of the Wednesday decision.

"This is an important first step but from here on it gets more complicated. There are more cases waiting in the wings and implementation of the principles has to be uncertain pending the court judgments," said David Wood,  antitrust lawyer for Howrey Simon.

A U.S. appeals court ruled unanimously in a final 2001 decision that Microsoft broke antitrust rules, but critics say the remedies there failed to encourage vigorous competition.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti explained to reporters last week that his decision was based on what was needed for the European marketplace.

"In the end, I had to do what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he said. "I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."

FINE IS EU'S BIGGEST

The Commission will underscore the seriousness of its ruling by fining the company a record amount that will exceed the 462 million euro penalty imposed on Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel.

The fine amounts to slightly more than one percent of  Microsoft's roughly $53 billion cash on hand. On January 22 it projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current quarter.

Page 105 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft has three months to pay the fine but may instead give a bank guarantee during the appeal. If it ends up losing, it would owe the fine plus interest.

Microsoft argues that it should not have to pay because it did not infringe the rules intentionally and that it should not be  fined for its worldwide turnover because the United States has already acted in the case.

European Union law says that  fines are based on the worldwide turnover of companies. The absolute limit is 10 percent of annual turnover for the year before the decision, which for  Microsoft would amount to $3.43 billion.
In addition to the  fine, two remedies requiring  Microsoft to change its behaviour will be approved on
Wednesday.

One will require that  Microsoft's licenses at a reasonable fee more information so that rival makers of low-end servers can make their software as compatible with the Windows operating system as Microsoft's own servers.

The other will require it to sell two versions of its Windows XP operating system to computer makers, one stripped of audiovisual software.
The Commission argues that  Microsoft has bundled an audiovisual player to damage such rivals as
RealNetworks (RNWK.O) RealPlayer and Apple Computer (AAPL.O) Quicktime.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON, March 23 (Reuters) - The European Commission hopes for a wide-open digital media market after its proposed ruling that Microsoft cannot bundle its music player with Windows.

Ironically, the move is likely to inflict short-term pain on consumers, the very people the EU is trying to protect, observers say.

TD
The ruling, scheduled for Wednesday, could mean consumers will have to deal with a more fragmented market where they have to be very careful to check the conditions before buying or storing music or film.

Over the last two years, music retailers have started selling songs on the Internet, and many of them have selected their own technology that works only with specific devices.

Songs from Connect will play on Sony walkmans, iTunes Music Store works with an Apple iPod portable jukebox and MSN Music Club from  Microsoft works with Rio, iRiver or Creative Nomad digital music players.

Consumers who buy their songs on the Internet, cannot swap the track to devices linked to rival shops. It is like buying a compact disc that plays only on consumer electronics from Matsushita's Panasonic or Samsung.
NEW DEMANDS

The European Commission, in an antitrust ruling due Wednesday is expected to demand that Microsoft strip its Media Player from its dominant Windows operating system for personal computers and fine it 497 million euros ($611.20 million).

Analysts point out the irony of the European verdict: a ruling against  Microsoft could add to consumers' frustrations as it would support a fragmented media market and extend the ongoing format wars.

"What these investigations are saying is they want to encourage a level playing field. And by that, they mean multiple platforms from multiple companies," said David Smith, a Gartner Research analyst and specialist on  Microsoft software.

"No one ever said that these efforts - either by the United States or the European Union - is being conducted in the best interest of the consumer."

The limitations of where Internet music downloads can be played dominates many online forums. "I'll continue to buy CDs for now," one person wrote in a discussion group dedicated to the digital media format wars.
FRAGMENTATION OR MONOPOLY?

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti points that consumers are, in the end, worse off if one company like Microsoft dominates a market. That includes the gates to all digital content, ranging from personal pictures to music to home movies.

"In the end I had to decide what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," Monti said last week.

Microsoft has said it will appeal a negative ruling.

Rivals, meanwhile, hope to capitalise on  Microsoft's setbacks by opening new stores. There aim is to build a base of loyal customers for what is expected to be the primary way all consumers will view
films and listen to music in the future.

Last week, Sony announced the European launch of its Connect store in June. Fittingly, it will work only with Sony's own Atrac compression software and Open Music Gate anti-piracy protection.
RealNetworks opened its download shop in January. It uses the AAC format, the same used by
Apple's iTunes to compress songs, but combining it with Real's own Helix anti-copying software.

The balkanisation of the digital media landscape has left both electronics makers and consumers baffled. Their only hope is that the technology titans agree to work together so that one device will work with all digital media providers, analyst say.

Electronics makers are quick to point out they will have to pay up every time they include another decoding technology, while other technologies are not even available for licensing.

"We support many media formats. The question really is how much do you want to pay in license fees," said Frans van Houten, co-chief executive at Philips' consumer electronics arm.

Robert Ashcroft, Sony's European boss of Network Applications and Content Services, believes consumers will just have to learn to live with the scenario where they have to buy multiple devices if they want to buy from multiple shops.
"It's the way the world works," he said.

It will take years for market forces to determine a single technology platform - as the compact disc is to music and DVD is to film, Ashcroft added.

Doubts abound that public authorities can speed things up. "Can Brussels break this deadlock? I don't think so," said Jupiter Research analyst Mark Mulligan in London.

EU MEMBER STATES' antitrust regulators backed the  European Commission's plans to slap Microsoft with a record fine of nearly 500 million euros, as the software titan sought fresh support for a settlement the commission rejected last week. The commission is expected to hand down a formal decision Wednesday finding the company in violation of EU  antitrust law.

BRUSSELS yesterday signalled a new get-tough policy on anti-competitive practices as all 15 member states of the European Union backed a record Euro 497 million (Pounds 335 million)  fine for Microsoft for abusing its monopoly in the software market.

The fine beats the Euro 462 million penalty meted out by the  European Commission to Hoffman-La Roche in 2001. It comes in addition to "remedies" already proposed by Mario Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner. But analysts said it would represent little more than a "parking ticket" to Microsoft, which has $53 billion in the bank. Of more concern to the software group will be the precedent that the ruling sets for its future business practices.

TD
Last week, after  Microsoft failed in an eleventh-hour attempt to settle the dispute, Signor Monti admitted: "We were unable to agree on commitments for future conduct."

The European Commission has focused on two lines of inquiry in its long running battle against Microsoft. The first is whether  Microsoft has illegally exploited the monopoly of Windows by bundling its Media Player software into the operating system, thereby stifling  competition from Apple Computer's Quicktime and RealNetwork's RealPlayer.

The second is whether the software group has attempted to gain a stranglehold on the server software market by designing its software to work better on Windows NT server software than on operating systems of rivals such as Linux and Sun Microsystems.
The ruling is expected to force  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows in Europe -one with Media
Player and one without.

Microsoft is likely to appeal against the ruling and has two months in which to do so. Any appeal would be heard in the European Court of First Instance. Either party can then appeal to the European Court of Justice.
The appeal process could take up to seven years. Commentary, page 23

HD     MARIO MONTI KEEN TO SET PRECEDENT BY CONDEMNING MICROSOFT WC    471 words

On the point of condemning  Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position,  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti aims to set a precedent in combating unfair  competition in the high stakes high technology sector. The  European Commission will probably adopt its decision in this case at its weekly meeting on March 24, ending an investigation lasting more than five years by ordering the American giant to change
its practices and imposing a heavy  fine. Announcing on March 18 the failure of eleventh hour negotiations with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in an attempt to reach an amicable settlement, Mario Monti signalled his desire to "set a firm precedent" establishing "clear principles for future behaviour by businesses" with similar dominant positions. Since once the current  Microsoft enquiry is finished, the Commission will be called to settle other complaints against the American software giant.

TD
The CCIA, an association set up by  Microsoft's competitors, notably called on Brussels in February2003 to consider the latest version of Windows XP and the risk of an extension of the group's dominant position on such markets as text message and image (photographs and video) management software for mobile phones and pocket computers. Mr Monti and Mr Ballmer did go some way towards reconciling their views in last-minute negotiations, even on the most sensitive point in the on-going enquiry, namely the integration of Media Player in Windows, software for reading audio and video films, the presence of which crushes the opposition. The American group, which refuses to dissociate Windows and Media Player, did come up with a possible solution: permitting the installation of competing software alongside its own. This offer was deemed attractive by Commission services but Mr Monti demanded a further effort from Microsoft, a future policy pledge to integrate new products in Windows. The American group rejected this demand and the two sides parted, their positions irreconcilable.

On March 24, the Commission is likely to order  Microsoft to make interfaces available to all its competitors permitting their software to communicate with Windows. In particular, it will also order Microsoft to market a new version of Windows without Media Player, a demand likely to please the American giant's competitors, disappointed when authorities in the United States reached an amicable settlement in an anti-trust enquiry into  Microsoft in 2001. The Commission "goes further than the United States since the American authorities did not address the issue of related sales of new software with Windows, according to a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs.  Microsoft does not propose to let the matter rest. The group has already announced its intention to challenge any sanction before the European courts. A protracted legal battle is therefore likely, an eventuality for which the Commission is of course prepared. (see Section V)

BRUSSELS -- European Union  antitrust officials won backing yesterday for their proposed  fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could force far-reaching changes on how the U.S. company sells Windows.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the proposal from EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case said they agreed to a fine but declined to elaborate.

TD
Other sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, have estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling tomorrow. Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres refused to comment.

Yesterday's meeting came a week after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the 5-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals in the server market, and deliver a discounted version of Windows without the Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

Attempts at a settlement failed last week over  Microsoft's reluctance to accept provisions that could have prevented it from adding features to future versions of Windows - a key element of its strategy for selling upgrades.

Monti has indicated he wants a legally binding precedent that can be used to wrap up other cases still pending against  Microsoft and possibly help ward off more.

The EU is already looking into charges from Microsoft competitors that its latest desktop operating system, Windows XP, is designed to help extend Microsoft's dominance into new markets such as instant messaging and mobile phones.

And Microsoft's next version of Windows, due in 2006, is expected to include a Web search engine that would challenge Google and Yahoo.

The impact of the EU decision could be delayed for years if  Microsoft wins an emergency suspension from the courts pending its promised appeal.

But analysts say it could indirectly hurt  Microsoft's attempts to counter the open-source Linux operating system, which is poised to become a strong competitor to Windows in Asia.

Microsoft Corp faces an unprecedented  European Commission decision on Wednesday that will brand
it an abusive monopolist, order it to change the way it does business and  fine it a record 497 million euros
($612.7 million). After a decade of investigating  Microsoft and making deals on narrow licensing issues
without any formal findings against the U.S. computer software giant, the European Union executive has
decided that more sweeping action is needed to restore  competition. The 20-member Commission will
formally decide the case on Wednesday, but by now the essential details of its ruling have become public.
Microsoft will be ordered to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media
Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software. The Redmond,
Washington-based company must also license information to make the servers of rivals more compatible
with Windows desktop machines. Windows runs more than 95 percent of all personal computers.

TD
Microsoft has announced plans to appeal the decision to the courts and will try to get the remedies delayed until the final court appeals are over, a process that could take years. That limits the immediate impact of the Wednesday decision. "This is an important first step but from here on it gets more complicated. There are more cases waiting in the wings and implementation of the principles has to be uncertain pending the court judgements," said David Wood, antitrust lawyer for Howrey Simon. A U.S. appeals court ruled unanimously in a final 2001 decision that Microsoft broke antitrust rules, but critics say the remedies there failed to encourage vigorous competition. EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti explained to reporters last week that his decision was based on what was needed for the European marketplace. "In the end, I had to do what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he said. "I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."  FINE IS EU'S BIGGEST The Commission will underscore the seriousness of its ruling by fining the company a record amount that will exceed the 462 million euro penalty imposed on Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel. The  fine amounts to slightly more than one percent of  Microsoft's roughly $53 billion cash on hand. On January 22 it projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income
of $3.1 billion for the current quarter.  Microsoft has three months to pay the  fine but may instead give a bank guarantee during the appeal. If it ends up losing, it would owe the  fine plus interest.  Microsoft argues that it should not have to pay because it did not infringe the rules intentionally and that it should not be fined for its worldwide turnover because the United States has already acted in the case. European Union law says that  fines are based on the worldwide turnover of companies. The absolute limit is 10 percent of annual turnover for the year before the decision, which for  Microsoft would amount to $3.43 billion. In addition to the  fine, two remedies requiring  Microsoft to change its behaviour will be
approved on Wednesday. One will require that  Microsoft's licenses at a reasonable fee more information so that rival makers of low-end servers can make their software as compatible with the Windows
operating system as  Microsoft's own servers. The other will require it to sell two versions of its Windows XP operating system to computer makers, one stripped of audiovisual software. The Commission argues that Microsoft has bundled an audiovisual player to damage such rivals as RealNetworks RealPlayer and Apple Computer Quicktime.

BRUSSELS --  European Commission antitrust regulators on Monday won backing to  fine               Microsoft a record $618 million for abusing its near-monopoly of desktop PC software.

Representatives from 15 nations met behind closed doors and approved the  fine proposed by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, according to an executive with knowledge of the proceedings.

TD
The penalty would exceed the $571 million that Monti imposed on Hoffman-La Roche in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel. In recommending the record-setting  fine, Monti likely took into account Microsoft's worldwide sales.

Microsoft criticized the decision.

"It is unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine that takes into account global operations," says  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler.

Microsoft's largest market -- the USA -- permits the business practices Europe is seeking to restrict, Desler said.

The proposed fine is more than three times as high as some analysts expected.  Microsoft's shares closed at $24.50, down 13 cents.
Settlement talks between Monti and  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer fell apart last week. On
Wednesday, the commission is expected to approve extensive remedies in addition to the  fine.

Monti has called for restrictions on how  Microsoft can bundle Windows Media Player, needed to play video and music, into new Windows PCs sold in Europe.

He also wants Microsoft to divulge technical information that will allow competitors to more easily design server software to link together Windows PCs.

Microsoft has said it will appeal any judgment. An appeal would take years. With $52 billion cash, it can afford the  fine.

But the software giant could be forced to adhere to the restrictions if Europe's Court of First Instance does not stay the remedy pending any appeal.

Longer term,  Microsoft could find it harder to implement its strategy of bundling more functions -- such as an Internet search engine -- into its Windows operating system, which runs 94% of desktop PCs, analysts say.
Monday, a tech suppliers' trade group warned that the impending judgment could hurt consumers.

"If the  European Commission is truly interested in protecting consumers, it should rethink its insistence on regulating the future of Windows innovations," says Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology. "Consumers benefit from more innovation, not less."

Paul Geitner BRUSSELS -- European Union  antitrust officials won backing yesterday for their proposed fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could force far-reaching changes on how the U.S. software giant sells Windows.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the proposal from EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case, but speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press they agreed to a  fine, but declined to elaborate.

TD
Other sources, also speaking on condition they not be identified, have estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling tomorrow.
One report said the  fine could approach 500 million euros. Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres refused to comment.
EU rules allow the commission to  fine antitrust violators as much as 10 per cent of annual global revenue, although in practice they have been far lower. The largest ever imposed was less than two per cent -- 462 million euros or $568 million US -- against Roche Holding AG, one of several companies caught fixing the prices of bulk vitamins in 2001.
The record penalty for charges similar to those  Microsoft faces -- abusing a monopoly position -- is
75 million euros imposed on Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak AB in 1991. Analysts say even the
maximum fine would be easily absorbed by Microsoft, which expects to generate nearly $36 billion in
revenue this fiscal year and is sitting on cash reserves of more than $50 billion.

Yesterday's meeting came a week after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the five-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

The impact of the EU decision could be delayed for years if  Microsoft wins an emergency suspension from the courts pending its promised appeal.

But analysts say it could indirectly hurt  Microsoft's attempts to counter the open-source Linux operating system, which is poised to become a strong competitor to Windows in Asia, especially in the government sector.

"Microsoft has been trying to improve relationships with governments worldwide and an adverse ruling in the EU could hamper those efforts," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

NEW YORK (AFX) - Microsoft shares turned positive in late Monday trade amid reports that the European Commission has decided to fine the software giant 479 million euros, or $613 million, for market abuses. The shares initially dipped on the news before recovering to trade up 4 cents at $24.67. Traders said the news clears some of the uncertainty surrounding the company's problems with European competition regulators. This story was supplied by CBSMarketWatch.

WASHINGTON (AFX) - The European Union is expected to  fine Microsoft a record $613 million for market abuses concerning its Window software, according to published reports. Competition authorities from EU's member states backed the  fine at a meeting Monday. The full European Commission is expected to vote on the fine Wednesday.  Microsoft shares closed Monday down 13 cents to $24.50. It would be the biggest fine imposed since Hoffman-La Roche AG was found to have illegally set vitamin prices in 2001. In addition, the EU is expected to force  Microsoft to offer its Window operating system to computer makers without its Windows Media player. It's also expected to make Microsoft share coding with rival server vendors. Talks to settle the case broke down last week over Microsoft's future ability to bundle applications in its Windows platform.  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer met with EU competition authorities in Brussels last week.

TD
Microsoft is likely to contest the commission's decision in a European court, starting a process that could take years. Given  Microsoft's huge cash reserves, the  fine isn't expected to affect the Redmond,
Wash.-based company, Wall Street analysts have said. This story was supplied by CBSMarketWatch. For further information see  www.cbsmarketwatch.com.

Brussels, 22/03/2004 (Agence Europe) - The CCIA (Computer & Communications Industry Association), the trade group that brings together and defends the interests of around 13,000 members and which sought to denounce  Microsoft's trade practices to the  European Commission, is overjoyed at the decision the European Executive is preparing to submit next Wednesday (EUROPE 19 March p 7). The CCIA considers, however, that this decision is only "the tip of the iceberg" and is only the beginning of a much vaster awareness of the multiple abuses committed by the  Microsoft monopoly in other sectors. According to the president of the CCIA, Ed Black, the decision "sends a strong message both to companies who have suffered from  Microsoft's abuses and to anti-trust authorities world-wide. It encourages the former to come forward with information and evidence on alleged abuses and the latter to act decisively".

A final meeting of the consultative meeting of Member State experts took place on Monday to set the amount for the  fine on Microsoft before the official publication of the decision on Wednesday. Commissioner Monti's spokesperson Amelia Torres, refused to comment on the results of the meeting, indicating the need for confidentiality but committee members, it appears quite quickly reached a general consensus.

HD      Microsoft attacks proposed EU fine as 'inappropriate' in light of U.S. settlement

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union on Tuesday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about euro500 million (US$615 million) for alleged  antitrust abuses.

With the EU decision due Wednesday, trans-Atlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants in the ill-fated GE-Honeywell merger.

TD
"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

The software giant's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's fine appeared to have been doubled from what it should have been under the European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.

Microsoft does about 30 percent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behavior would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.
Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Monti would address questions
Wednesday at a news conference after the Commission adopts the ruling.

Sources familiar with the five-year-old case say the EU ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behavior in the U.S.  antitrust case but settled in late
2001 with the Bush administration. A U.S. appeals court is currently considering whether that landmark
deal was adequate to restore  competition.
U.S. firms that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the
Commission to levy fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 percent of a company's global revenue.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments approved the  fine Monday. A source familiar with the case, but speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday it was around euro500 million (US$615 million).



Page 128 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Given Microsoft's cash reserves in excess of US$50 billion, experts say the  fine is less significant than the changes Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows, which runs most personal computers worldwide.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying Windows code to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

Antitrust lawyers call Microsoft's latest arguments unsurprising.

"It's unprecedented but not necessarily wrong," said Martin Baker, chief  antitrust partner at Taylor Wessing in London. He noted the U.S. case focused largely on Internet browsers, while the EU case deals with media and server software.

"The absence of a precedent can be a mitigating factor," he added. "But the bundling of Media Player and the leveraging of market power from operating systems into servers, that's not rocket science. Those are well tried and tested principles."

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any  fine or remedies.
Murray called on the Bush administration to "engage" the EU in settling the case.

"The EU has now directly attacked the authority of the United States and our economy in general," she said in a statement late Monday. "American jobs and economic interests are threatened."

The EU weathered similar charges in 2001 when it blocked General Electric Co.'s bid for Honeywell International Inc., even though the merger had been cleared in Washington. That decision is currently under appeal in EU courts.

Monti, who has stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation, said last week that his ultimate concern had to be "what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe."

Observers say Monti, a Yale-educated economist, believes increased  competition would eventually create growth and jobs.
"They may not be  Microsoft growth and Microsoft jobs, but in the economy as a whole," Baker said. (pfg-pa)

HD     EU ruling  on Microsoft could affect marketplace

SEATTLE (AP) - By the time  Microsoft Corp. settled its  antitrust case with the U.S. Justice Department, the Internet browser war that precipitated it had already been fought -- with  Microsoft the victor.

In the ensuing years, technology has moved so fast -- and the legal process so slowly by comparison -- that the software behemoth similarly won other market battles before legal challenges could be resolved.

TD
That may not be so with the  European Commission's expected ruling against  Microsoft on Wednesday.

The European Union's executive body was expected to  fine Microsoft and order the company to offer a version of its flagship operating system in Europe that has been stripped of Windows Media Player.

And that gives European regulators a rare chance to influence  Microsoft's current behavior, rather than trying to make amends for alleged wrongdoing against already sunken competitors.

Microsoft is just one of the companies battling over how people will hear and see music and videos online when a market now in its infancy matures.

"The EU decision comes when the media wars, if you could call it that, are ongoing," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

About 34 percent of U.S. Internet users played a song or watched video using  Microsoft's Windows Media Player in February, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. That compares to about 20 percent who used rival RealNetworks' format, and about 9 percent who used Apple's Quick Time.

Other media players also are snagging smaller audiences, and some people likely used more than one player.

That wasn't the case in the browser battle between Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator. By the time the courts ruled that Microsoft abused its monopoly when it included its browser with Windows, Netscape was virtually vanquished.

Experts say Microsoft still holds about 90 percent of that market -- about the same as its desktop operating system share -- and that's unlikely to change.

The potential for competitors to benefit from a negative ruling in the European Union case is particularly strong if Microsoft is forced to sell a version of Windows without the media player at a slightly cheaper price, said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.

That would allow other media player companies such as RealNetworks to offer computer manufacturers their players for free, improving computer makers' slim profit margins and giving a competitor the immediate consumer access that  Microsoft has enjoyed until now.
"Without a doubt it will create an opportunity for (competitors)," Leigh said.

Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company believed it was premature to speculate on any potential market impact.

If Microsoft were forced to ship a version of Windows without its media player, that could also mean it would have to start persuading users to download its player from the Internet -- just like its competitors.

Even in that case, analyst Ted Schadler of Forrester Research says,  Microsoft's dominance may again give it an advantage.

"Microsoft has incredible brand recognition," Schadler said. "It's easier to convince people (to download the Windows Media Player) than to convince people to download the Real player."

Schadler said the overall market for music and video online could suffer as many people opt not to download any media player at all. He thinks the best option for all involved would be to include a number of players with Windows.
Wilcox disagrees, saying most Internet users know how to download media and software. RealNetworks, which also is suing  Microsoft for antitrust violations in U.S. federal court, says an EU
ruling against Microsoft would help it but isn't critical for survival.

"We have a plan to succeed in this space with or without an (EU) ruling," said Bob Kimball, Real's general counsel.

Microsoft has defended its business conduct and accused RealNetworks of using its lawsuit to try to gain market share.

Regardless of how the legal battles play out, some people, even those at Microsoft, say this may never be a winner-take-all market. Will Poole, a senior vice president at Microsoft, told journalists in February that the media player market is "not a VHS/Beta thing," in reference to the war over video formats, in which VHS eventually dominated.

Wilcox, the Jupiter analyst, said he believes the online media battle may eventually be more about the format in which online content is recorded and delivered than which media player is easiest to find.

For example, he says, Apple has succeeded with its music store because people like the variety of songs available -- not because of what player they use. Also, most players can deliver songs and video in some competing formats.

That the market remains so competitive may even raise the question of whether the courts should intervene at all, Wilcox said.
"If there is plenty of  competition," he asked, "is there a need for an enforcement action in the first place?"

ROBERT SIEGEL, host:

The European Union is expected to rule tomorrow that Microsoft abused its power in a way that harmed consumers and competitors. The EU is expected to fine Microsoft several hundred million dollars, limit what features the company can include in its Windows operating system and also require that it give more information to competitors.  Microsoft was vowed to appeal. NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports that some experts say the appeals process could delay any remedy for years.

TD
WENDY KAUFMAN reporting:

The antitrust concerns raised by the Europeans echo those raised by US  antitrust officials. In 2001, after protracted litigation, a settlement was reached between Microsoft, the US Department of Justice and several states. But in Europe, which has more expansive antitrust laws, the company and European regulators could not reach an agreement. And tomorrow, the Europeans are to issue a ruling that goes well beyond what US regulators required. The European Union is expected to impose a record  fine of more than $600 million.  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler wouldn't confirm the penalty amount, but says the EU has gone too far.

Mr. JIM DESLER (Spokesman,  Microsoft): Given the lack of a clear legal standard on these issues, it's just hard to see how a  fine of this magnitude could be warranted under any circumstances, particularly these circumstances.

KAUFMAN: The company's chief European lawyer says, quote, "It is unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's US operations when those operations are already regulated by the US government. The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the US Department of Justice and a US court," closed quote. But Mark Schecter, an  antitrust expert with the Howrey Simon
law firm, says that  Microsoft does substantial business in Europe, and the EU has its own regulatory authority.

Mr. MARK SCHECTER (Howrey Simon): What's important about the case is that the Europeans have investigated it, that the  European Commission has extensive jurisdiction and extensive power and it can alter the way major international companies do business.

KAUFMAN: The Europeans contend that  Microsoft violated the law in two areas: first, by bundling software to play audio and video into the Windows operating system. To address this, European regulators are expected to force  Microsoft to provide computer makers with a version of Windows that doesn't have its media player in it. Technology analyst Rob Enderle suggests that what's most troubling for Microsoft isn't the elimination of the media player; it's the issue of control.

Mr. ROB ENDERLE (Technology Analyst): They really don't like another entity, particularly a government, directing them with regard to what they can or cannot put into a product. They like to control their
offerings. It's their products. If they needed to respond to a competitive threat or an opportunity, they don't want to have to ask anybody else for permission.

KAUFMAN: The second legal contention raised by the Europeans is that  Microsoft used its knowledge of the inner workings of the Windows operating system on PCs to give it an edge in producing software
for servers. To resolve this, the Europeans are expected to require that  Microsoft release more technical

information that will help rivals, including Sun Microsystems, compete in developing server-related products.

But the remedies may be put on hold. Some legal experts believe that given the enormous implications of the case and the proposed remedy,  Microsoft may well convince a judge that the company is entitled to
a delay before any penalty is imposed. Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Seattle.

HD   E.U. to Slap Microsoft with Hefty Fine; Goldman Breezes Past Street Expectations; Should Bush
Rethink Mideast Policy?,  CNNfn

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: The key question in the 9/11 hearings concerns accountability. Top officials from the Clinton and Bush administrations prepare to face tough questions today in Washington.

The European Union is about to slap  Microsoft with a hefty  fine. But the software giant hopes to drag this one out in the courts.

TD
And just a few months ago, palmOne was trying to survive. Now the company says it`s close to thriving with a smart acquisition.

Good morning, and welcome to MARKET CALL. I`m Rhonda Schaffler. It is Tuesday, March 23. We`re about 30 minutes away from the opening bell on Wall Street. Stock futures are pointing to a bounce this morning.
First the headlines.

Microsoft is less than 24 hours from judgment day. The European Union will officially announce how much it is fining the company for antitrust violations. Wall Street is more worried about the impact of those sanctions on upcoming Microsoft products than the size of the  fine, which is expected to be a record $613 million.

Six major public pension funds demanding to meet with Disney`s entire board of directors. Some of the funds still want CEO Michael Eisner to step aside. But for now, they hope to focus on the company`s performance at that meeting.

And Goldman Sachs blows past Wall Street profit forecasts. Goldman helped in its fiscal first quarter by strong revenues from stock and bond trading, as well as its top position in advising on mergers and acquisitions.

The E.U.`s competition commission has issued a statement of objections outlining the potential charges against Microsoft. The commission is setting the stage for levying a record  fine against the software maker later this week.
CNN`s Jim Boulden joins us from London with the latest. Hello, Jim.
JIM BOULDEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Rhonda.

As you said, in just under 24 hours, the  European Commission will reveal how it plans to penalize Microsoft for abusing its market dominance. The reports say the  fine will be over $600 million. Now that`s a record for the E.U. But  Microsoft says that`s too much, since it claims it did not know it was breaking
E.U.  competition rules. And as one analyst says, it`s a parking ticket for a company with  Microsoft`s bank account.

Now more importantly, the E.U.  antitrust chief Mario Monti will tell  Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows XP, one without its free media player add on. And also to make it easier for server software from companies like Sun Microsystems to work with Windows NT.

Page 140 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now most people are focusing on the media player decision. Rival RealNetworks made the formal complaint here and is also suing  Microsoft in the States. It claims  Microsoft does not give consumers enough choice for downloading music and watching video clips. It`s a small market now, but these players could be a route to control digital media coming into the home one day.

But there are some who see this as the E.U. taking its turn to beat up on  Microsoft. After all, Mario Monti is on his way out in October. But he does say that tomorrow`s formal declaration will tell  Microsoft how it should behave when it comes to adding on free bits to its next operating system, which I believe is due out in 2006, Rhonda.
SCHAFFLER: Jim Boulden joining us from London. Appreciate that, Jim.

We kick off the "Roundtable" now where we give you all the news and analysis you need to keep a step ahead of the action on Wall Street and Main Street. By my side, our guest host Michael Holland, chairman of Holland & Company; and in D.C., Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Charles Schwab Washington Research Group.
Good to see you guys with me.
Mike, we had quite a sell-off yesterday. Looks like we`re in for a little bit of stability today at least. MICHAEL HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN, HOLLAND & COMPANY: Yes, a bounce. This market has shown
resilience over the last few weeks in the face of bad headlines, which I`m sure Greg will talk about. But the
PalmOne numbers this morning helped, as did Goldman Sachs just recently. So I think we`ve got some
reason to look for a bounce this morning.

SCHAFFLER: Greg, let`s talk about which bad headline we should talk about first. There are quite a few, aren`t there?

GREG VALLIERE, CHIEF STRATEGIST, CHARLES SCHWAB WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP: Yes. There`s no shortage. I mean, obviously, the big story in this town this morning is Mr. Clarke, Richard Clarke. "The Washington Post" has a very unflattering story about him. All of the long, long, long knives are out, Rhonda, to try to get this guy as being unstable, partisan, out of the loop. But the fact is this hurts the Bush administration. And I think some of the testimony before the 9/11 Commission will hurt the Bush administration. I suspect this will not be a good week for the White House.

SCHAFFLER: You know it`s interesting with this 9/11 Commission hearing, Mike, do you think that this is going to be something that Wall Street gets fixated on as well or is that something in the past from Wall Street`s perspective?

HOLLAND: You know it`s interesting, as I`m listening to Greg, and, Greg, I`d be interested in your comment on this, I think Rhonda just asked about Wall Street, and I think even larger, the voting public. I think we are so far from the November elections, I think that people overall have formed their opinions about what George Bush did or didn`t do with 9/11.

Is this really an effective political tool? I`m sure that it`s important to us who pay attention to it, but for the voting public and for -- I think for Wall Street, for example, I don`t think a lot of people are going to have any stock decisions changed as a result of this. And I think Mr. Clarke is someone -- he`s like O`Neill, people don`t pay attention to him.

VALLIERE: Yes, that`s a very good point. I think if there`s one politician for whom attitudes have not solidified, it`s Kerry. And the Bush administration now is beginning that process, to talk about his inconsistencies, to talk about his flip-flops on issues like national security. So you`re absolutely right, Mike, I think that for Bush, for all his warts, people pretty much have attitudes firmed up.

The other point I`d make quickly is that, ironically, while national security has been an impact on the market and is a huge story globally, the big story for Americans still really is the economy and jobs. And that`s a story where I think Bush has plenty of upside. Maybe starting on April 2 with the jobs report, you could start to see things look a little bit better there.
SCHAFFLER: Let`s try to figure out what they are thinking about the economy this morning, at least in
Chicago. We check in with Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading who is at the CBOT, as always.
Hello, Phil, good morning.
PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING: Hey, good morning, Rhonda.



Page 141 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The market hopes Greg is right, because the bond market would like something to trade off of. You know so far all they have been trading off of lately has been high anxiety because of the concerns about terrorism. Those concerns seem to be easing just a little bit.

You know traders that I talked to were concerned that possibly Hamas would respond a lot more quickly to the attack yesterday. That hasn`t happened. But nerves are still on edge. Traders are very, very nervous to try to step in front of this bull market right now because of the concerns of terrorism.

So we`re seeing some very, very tight ranges. Nobody wants to step in front of this thing to stop, you know, try to stop the market with all the concerns. But if we get good economic news, if the Dow continues to
rally, we might see some courage start to increase. But right now, traders are kind of sitting on their hands right now.
SCHAFFLER: Phil, we`ll be back to you in a moment.

We stay in Chicago, Alan Rottman, president of Fusionary Trading. He is at the Chicago MERC, joins us now.
Hello, Alan, good to see you.
ALAN ROTTMAN, PRESIDENT, FUSIONARY TRADING: Good morning, Rhonda, thanks. SCHAFFLER: So was that it as far as all the selling goes, that was a big washout yesterday, or are we
going to be fooled today?

ROTTMAN: You know, Rhonda, it certainly looks like 10,000 held pretty good in the Dow. And I think we have a couple of things. One, we have the year end for Japan, the end of March. And the other is we have the end of our quarter. And I think there are a lot of people that were just nervoused out of the market yesterday morning, and I think it was a washout. I look for the market to recover probably 10,300 in the Dow over the next few days. And I`m not bearish on the economy, I`m bullish. It looks really, really good numerically.

SCHAFFLER: At this point, do you think Wall Street at all going to get any help from some of the corporate news? Wal-Mart`s news yesterday didn`t help, but there are some very strong profits from Goldman Sachs today.
ROTTMAN: Rhonda, you know, great point, absolutely. I mean corporate America has -- it looks just
exactly like everybody wants to watch the bottom line in corporations. And they are fighting so hard to keep
their books in order and earn a profit and that`s showing up in the market. And corporate America, I think,
is the story that`s not being talked about right now. It`s a good point to bring up.
SCHAFFLER: Alan Rottman, good to see you. Thanks so much.
Let`s go to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange now, find out what they`re talking about there. Linda
Jay from LaBranche & Company is standing by.
Linda, Mike Holland missed you yesterday.
LINDA JAY, LABRANCHE & COMPANY: I know. I`m sorry. I was a little under the weather yesterday. SCHAFFLER: Well we missed you, and what a good day to be off, by the way, terrible sentiment on the
trading floor. Is it better today?

JAY: Yes, I think it`s better today. I actually think we might have gotten a better day yesterday, but I think the only thing that anyone really focused on was, you know, geopolitically what`s going on over, you know, in Europe.

SCHAFFLER: Well, at this point, what does that mean, that once something else occurs somewhere the market is going to be all nervous again, or is that nervousness behind the market?

JAY: I think that for the next couple of days, I think that nervousness will sort of take a back seat. I think that -- you know you guys were just talking about the washout, and I think we sort of got it yesterday. The market is really up pretty good, and it was up pretty good ahead of the Goldman earnings.

So you know we`re rallying -- we were rallying on virtually no news. And now you got those great Goldman earnings and you know, Target , hopefully, counteracts Wal-Mart`s news yesterday. They had good
same-store sales. So I think we`re OK. I think we`re poised for, you know, a good -- a nice run to the upside.

Page 142 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCHAFFLER: Linda Jay, LaBranche & Company, glad you`re feeling better. We`ll see you later. Thanks so much.
JAY: OK. Bye-bye.

SCHAFFLER: "Roundtable" continues. By my side, our guest host Mike Holland, chairman of Holland & Company. In D.C., Greg Valliere, chief strategist, Charles Schwab Washington Research Group. In Boston, joining us now, is Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. Phil Flynn, as always, hanging out at the CBOT.

Art, good to see you. Question for you, we`re hearing from a couple of traders so far that it looks like the markets are going to be on firmer footing today. What`s your sense, based on how that market performed yesterday, what it`s going to be up to today?

ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Well it`s amazing how many times we have turned around on a Tuesday, but here we go again. You know, the market certainly acts or overreacts and the pendulum swings too far. We`re clearly going to get an oversold or short-term oversold bounce today. But I think a lot of the issues at hand are still going to be with us for a couple of weeks. I think the largest of these is the reawakening fears of terrorism. And you know that started in Madrid, and certainly matters weren`t helped at all yesterday.

But going forward, we`re really in a news vacuum. Corporate America really doesn`t let us know anything for a couple of weeks. The broker/dealers always come out first. So if you know Goldman Sachs wrapped up that. But we have to wait a couple of weeks before we hear from the bulk of the S&P 500 for first quarter earnings.

So you know the focus of investors, unfortunately, is, you know, the path of least resistance, is to sort of the macro in the geopolitical and that`s what`s happened this week. So we`re probably going to have a bumpy ride for a week or two before we can sort of level things off and use the first quarter earnings as a catalyst
to move forward.

SCHAFFLER: Goldman Sachs, great number today. I don`t think that`s too surprising, Mike, considering it`s Goldman Sachs and it`s been a pretty decent market. What are we expecting from the rest of these companies, though? Everyone is fairly upbeat heading into this reporting season.

HOLLAND: Well, we talked yesterday, Rhonda, about GM and 3M last week, Wal-Mart yesterday. You can`t get three better companies to take the pulse rate of the world economy. And starting with Wal-Mart, with the U.S. economy, as they represent 12 percent of all U.S. retail sales. We have as good a real time indicator with these three companies about what`s going on in the world.

To Art`s point, I think we have very solid economic performance indicated in corporate performance. Goldman Sachs is just off the chart in terms of their numbers, and we expect them to be off the chart. Lloyd Blankfein, who runs the place now, because he`s produced these incredible trading profits, continues to do his thing, but now he is being joined by the M&A people and other people as well. So I think that with the backdrop of negative news, we have incredibly positive news coming about. And so as Art was saying, you know you have this tug-of-war.

SCHAFFLER: Greg, let me go to you, let`s say the news continues to be positive. Let`s say we actually get decent jobs growth for the month, and we`ll find that in early April. Obviously, we are still waiting around for that. If everything with this economy is  fine, will that be enough politically for the Bush administration and enable voters to focus on that rather than some of this continuous turmoil overseas?

VALLIERE: It will make a big difference. I think if you look at the polls, Rhonda, it shows that people are far more concerned by domestic economic issues, like jobs, outsourcing, things like that. If we start to see 180,
200,000, maybe more, non-farm payrolls starting on April 2nd, it will certainly make a difference for the four of us, because we talk about this all day long. This disconnect between what all of us think and the public thinks still is there. But if we get month after month of good numbers, I think that would put Bush in pretty good shape in all of those key states, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, where he has to do well if he wants to win.

SCHAFFLER: We`ll be back to the "Roundtable" in a moment. We have to head now to the Big Board. Susan Lisovicz is back there with some stocks to watch.
Hey, Susie.
SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Rhonda.

And we actually have some earnings in the brokerage industry. We remember last week we had a trio of big performers. Bear Stearns , Lehman Brothers , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs continuing with the theme of well exceeding Wall Street`s expectations. Earning for the first quarter $2.50, well above the estimates and a year ago. Revenue up 41.5 percent, equity sales and trading, net revenues approaching an 80 percent increase. Goldman also said that the company ranked first in announced and completed transactions for mergers and acquisitions. That stock is up in the premarket.

So is Limited . We go to retail. It is the parent company of Express and Limited. It raised -- it is raising its quarterly earnings outlook. Why? Because of stronger-than-expected performances at its Bath and Body Works, as well as its Victoria`s Secret division.
And what specifically is doing it at Victoria`s Secret? Well, there`s been this high-profile launch of a new
bra. The campaign is fronted by Tyra Banks, who usually has the word "supermodel" in front of her name. It
has sizes up to 40 DD and it has all sorts of spring colors and it`s been going over big with consumers.
Limited says it expects March sales increases in the low double digits. That compares with its previous
expectation of a mid-single digit increase.

And finally, AMD , Advanced Micro Devices, there`s a Bloomberg report that says the company expects demand to rise in the second half of the year as companies buy new computers to replace those purchased in `99. According to that report, the company expects first quarter profits to be in line with the seasonality of the industry and below the fourth quarter. It`s the second half where business picks up.
We`ll see you at the opening bell, Rhonda. Back to you. SCHAFFLER: Susan, it`s amazing what a nice bra will do, isn`t it?
LISOVICZ: That`s right. All those spring colors in the freezing weather, women are going there in droves and perhaps, a few men, too.

SCHAFFLER: And we won`t even touch that subject or where it could lead. Susan, we`ll see you a little bit later.
Let`s look for some safety, we`ll find that at the Nasdaq market site, of all places. Hello, Greg Clarkin.
GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Rhonda. Sometimes it`s best just to toe the middle of the road, and that`s what I`ll be doing here this morning.

Let`s bring you up to date on what  Microsoft is doing. There we go, we`ll move over to technology. Microsoft, you know, as you have heard at the top of the show, the rumored  fine of $613 million, supposed to be levied tomorrow. The stock, at the moment, is actually trading higher by eight- tenths of 1 percent. Overall, the big cap tech stocks are trading higher by about that amount in premarket action. Again,  Microsoft expected to appeal this. And, really, this dollar figure is relatively minor for the company, based on their overall revenues.

What we do want to touch on, though, is a stock that is soaring this morning. It is palmOne . The stock is up about 19 percent in the premarket action. There`s the most recent earnings, a scorecard for the company, and you can see they blew away Wall Street estimates. They`re expected to lose 33 cents a share. They actually posted a penny in profit. These are the folks that sell those handheld devices. They say they sold
938,000 devices for the quarter with an average selling price of $233 versus $169 for the average selling price for the year-ago period. The company says especially strong were the sales of the Trio 600, that is the combination phone and digital organizer.
Now Todd Bradley is the CEO of palmOne, and you will find him right here on CNNfn at 9:40 this morning. And, Rhonda, in case you`re wondering, aren`t their other stocks on the Nasdaq besides those tech
stocks? Well, yes, Applebee`s , the restaurant chain, upgraded this morning at Wachovia. Applebee`s in
the summer will be rolling out a Weight Watchers brand in menu selection. They believe that the 13 million
Weight Watchers members are potential customers. And so Wachovia getting ahead of that move for the
summer rollout and upgrading the stock this morning - Rhonda.
SCHAFFLER: Very exciting.
Greg, we`ll see you soon. Thanks so much. CLARKIN: Sure.

SCHAFFLER: A commission investigating the September 11 terrorist attacks begins two days of hearings today. The independent council will hear from top officials in the Bush and Clinton administrations. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his predecessor, William Cohen, among those scheduled to testify today.

For more on what members of the commission are hoping to learn, Louise Schiavone joins us now from Washington. She had the opportunity to sit down with one of the men in charge of the commission late yesterday.
Hello, Louise.

LOUISE SCHIAVONE, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Rhonda. It was very interesting talking to Lee Hamilton, the vice chairman of that commission.

Now, the report is due out in July. The witness list for the 9/11 Commission is getting down to key national military and security policy decision makers, secretaries of state, past and present, secretaries of defense, past and present, the CIA chief and national security officials. And eventually in private session the commission will it hear from President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, and their predecessors, Commissioner Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton tells us that a clear picture of the events leading up to 9/11 is emerging, but still uncertain are the calculations of those at the helm in the years, months, and days leading up to that tragic event.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

LEE HAMILTON, VICE CHMN. 9/11 COMMISSION: I think there are a lot of things we don`t know. And the principle things we don`t know is kind of the mind set if you would, of these top officials during these critical weeks and months prior to 9/11. What information did they have? What information did they not have? How did they see the choices in front of them? And why did they make the choices they did?
(END VIDEO CLIP)

SCHIAVONE: While the 10-member commission is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. And while the panel`s leaders are eager to take the political finger pointing out of the process, it has been a challenge, especially in this election year. But Hamilton says if the final report is seen as a political document it will be worthless. Rhonda.
SCHAFFLER: Louise Schiavone in Washington thanks so much Louise. We will see you later. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SCHAFFLER: Welcome back. "Roundtable" continuing as we count you down to the opening bell. Lets go out to Chicago and Phil, got a question for you Phil about what`s going on with steel prices here. Sort of an interesting story that GM and Chrysler are bartering with steel suppliers.

Some concerns there about the rising steel costs. Tell me a little bit about what we`re seeing with steel and are we going to see more of this, do you think, in the industries?

FLYNN: I do, I definitely do. This is something we`ve been talking about from the beginning of the year. Who would have thought a year ago when Bush was putting on steel tariffs that we would have had steel shortages this year? But that`s exactly what has happened. This is an industry that got caught flat-footed by the economic recovery, not just here in the U.S. but though out the world.

China demand has been through the roof. And to be honest with you, we`re going to probably see tightness in this market for some time to come. That`s very good for these producing countries that make steel because they`ll be able to show profits they haven`t been able to show for many years. For the consuming countries such as China, it`s going to be a little bit of a drag. But this is issue that`s not going to go away anytime soon.

SCHAFFLER: Art question for you, we`ve talked a lot about this show, on rising prices of commodities. Yesterday, and this sell off of course gold stocks moved higher. The price of gold was soaring, are these companies in essence, good stock picks at this point if prices are going up, or is it more complicated than that?

HOGAN: A little more complicated, unfortunately. And as you look at some of the commodity prices that have risen there are different ways to play it. And if you were to take the price of a barrel of oil which has been stubbornly high, above $30. Certainly above the OPEC bench mark and closer to $40, than it has been to $30 for most of the year. You would think that the fully integrated oil companies like ExxonMobil and British Petroleum , etc. would be great investments.


Page 145 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But that`s not always the case. And typically, it`s a better play, a more leveraged player, further down stream, the folks that transport the oil, the folks that actually drill for it the service companies, and they have really outperformed and we`d really like to sort of push people on that direction. As far as the metals and mining companies, a lot of this demand for both gold, silver, all precious metals, and certainly for copper
and steel has been priced into the equities.

So it is difficult there is not a real hand and glove relationship with increasing commodity prices and the equities that fall behind. And there have certainly been good investments for the past 12-month, but it is difficult to gauge how much demand growth we`re going to have in the next 12 months. So that is a very, very dangerous investment on a going forward basis.

SCHAFFLER: Mike, we need to find the stocks and the good news that`s not priced in to Wall Street already.
HOLLAND: Oh, buy low. SCHAFFLER: Buy low, sell high? HOLLAND: Yeah, yeah.
SCHAFFLER: I`ve heard that somewhere.

HOLLAND: Art Hogan has this right, I think that watching the commodities. Just the way it has been going. China is the marginal factor, demand factor in every one of these physical commodities.

SCHAFFLER: You know China`s an interesting topic on a political level, Greg. Let`s go to you on that one. You know there have been some concerns about China`s human rights record. Obviously, the trade story is always there. Potentially, how much of a problem will China be?

VALLIERE: I don`t think that big, Rhonda. I think they want to be sure the 2008 Olympics are going to be held there. So I think they`ll be on their best behavior until then. Very quick point, responding to what Art said. We have a former fed governor on our staff, Lyle Gramly. Lyle thinks in the last month or two we probably finally turned the corner on inflation, not that inflation is going to take off, because unit labor costs are still low. But if you look at steel, it you look at oil, things like that. I think you could make a definitive call that the deflation scare is over.

HOLLAND: Yes, Greg to that point, I was in Taiwan last week. And, in fact, a number of the companies are talking about these increasing prices that they`re seeing on cost side, like steel. They`re now beginning to be able to pass them through for the first time.
VALLIERE: Exactly.
HOLLAND: A very important point, it`s a transition point. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
SCHAFFLER: A couple seconds away from a new trading day. Getting set to open the Nasdaq marketSite, executives from Autobytel. The big board opening bell being rung by executives from "Fortune" magazine celebrating the 50th list of the Fortune 500. New trading day under way. First words from the floor now and Susan.
LISOVICZ: Good morning Rhonda.

Well, one trader said to me this morning, the world is in turmoil. And you could see how fears about global instability has really spooked the market. The Dow Jones industrials down eight of the past 11 sessions, shedding triple digit losses in each of the past two sessions and closing just 64 points off of Dow 10,000 at the close yesterday. That may be a key support level.

In the meantime, we`re sort of in an economic news vacuum. The March employment report doesn`t come out for another 10 days and the first quarter results really don`t come out in great numbers for a couple of week. But the futures and early trading show that we will and are having a bounce.

Some stocks to watch quickly, Disney, a Dow component. Late yesterday a group of large public pension fund and state treasurers sent a letter to Disney`s new chairman, the former Senator George Mitchell, to request a meeting. The group wants to discuss the performance and future of the company. CalPERS says specifically "we`ve remain deeply concerned that our investments and the future of the company are in jeopardy."


Page 146 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Not in jeopardy is Goldman Sachs, out with its numbers. Indication the stock`s going to get a pop, 102 to
104 is the indication. The last was 101.30. It`s way exceeded, as we saw at brokerages last week, the Wall
Street estimate. Revenue up 42 percent to $5.9 billion. Earnings nearly doubled on improvements in
financial markets. And a big pick up in mergers and acquisition.

Limited, in the retail sector, also the beneficiary of good news. It`s raising its quarterly earnings outlook, specifically by its Bath and Body Works. And, as we mentioned earlier, a new bra launch just earlier this month that has been bringing a lot of customers in.

Finally, just want to mention some news that just crossed. Gillette is acquiring the privately held Rembrandt brand of teeth whitening products. No details disclosed. But joining a growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble , getting into that cosmetic oral care business.
And we have a bounce in the first few minute of trading. Back to you, Rhonda. SCHAFFLER: All right, Susan, thanks so much.
The Nasdaq bounces higher as well - Greg. CLARKIN: Hi there, Rhonda.
We are, indeed, looking at a bit of a pop on the composite. Take a look at the numbers for yourself. Right now a gain of about 0.8 percent. It is up 15.5 points. 1925 is where things stand.

We`ve been telling you about the  Microsoft news, $613 million expected to be the  fine against the company. What we`re looking at, in term of the share price, there`s little reaction, up 0.4 percent. A number of reasons why, one, the expected appeal of the decision from the European anti-trust regulators. And on top of that, even that dollar figure is relatively small for  Microsoft, given its overall revenue.

One stock that is absolutely soaring is morning is shares of CytRx . It is up almost 40 percent. This company`s been develop (AUDIO GAP). Now the FDA has designated this as an investigational new drug that basically clears the way to begin clinical trials. And on that news the stock right now gaining very, very well. It`s up 71 cent at 2.42.

A little bit earlier in the show you were talking about steel and commodity prices. We`ll take a look at Steel Dynamics . It is up 4.6 percent. These folks operate what is known as a mini mill and they have raised their guidance this morning. The company now expecting earning somewhere in the range of 50 to 60 cents, not
35 to 45, and that is due to improving demand for what`s known as flat rolled and structural steel. So, again, demand picking up there. And Steel Dynamics stock up 5.7 percent.

A couple other stocks we`re following this morning, Cisco Systems . It is up 1.5 percent at the moment. We saw an upgrade of Cisco from Janney Montgomery Scott. They believe that the recent decline in share price, as well as the growth prospects, which they believe remain in tact, all that equals a buying
opportunity for Cisco.

And then finally PalmOne, a gain of 23 percent at the moment. The big news there we`ve been telling you is that the handheld computer maker blowing away estimates for the quarter. A penny is what they posted. They were expected to lose 33 cents and they sold 938,000 of those handheld devices. They say especially strong were sale of the Trio 600. Now we mentioned Todd Bradley`s the CEO of PalmOne. He will be here in just a matter of moments, Rhonda, to tell us more about that quarter.
And right now the composite up 14 points, 1923. Back to you.

SCHAFFLER: All right. That is the first word on stocks. It`s back to the "Roundtable" for us. Our guest host is Mike Holland, chairman of Holland & Company. In Washington, Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Charles Schwab Washington Research Group. In Boston, Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. From the Chicago Board of Trade, Alaron Trading`s Phil Flynn.
Phil, we aren`t looking at interest rates at zero yet, just checking?
FLYNN: They aren`t. Nothing`s moved here. They`re going to stay here forever. Not much going on. SCHAFFLER: And, again, we`re waiting for economic news. But, Phil, tell me a little bit if that`s really going
to matter this week. We keep going back to that jobs report, right, and all this geopolitical worry.

FLYNN: I think it is. I think when it comes to these geopolitical incidents, like what happened when they killed the Hamas spiritual leader, that has an immediate impact on the market. And it`s the immediate impact and then the waiting to see if there`s some type of a response. And the longer we go without any type of a response, the market seems to gain its leg, gain its confidence a little bit. That`s what we`re
Page 147 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
seeing here today. Buyers are coming back into the stocks ever so slightly. Bond traders are taking a little bit of profits but it`s a very, very cautious road.

SCHAFFLER: And, of course, if the markets are worried about geopolitical events, oftentimes they might ignore what`s going on in Washington. Some say it might be something to worry about.
Greg, we`re going to find out if any of us will be able to retire, right? Social Security, Medicare. Tell us a
little bit about how that`s going to go as far as any ripple effects in D.C. It seems that anytime we talk about
these issues, Wall Street doesn`t pay as much attention to it as some worry it should.

VALLIERE: Well, first of all, I know you and I are going to work into our 90s, so we don`t have to worry about that.
SCHAFFLER: You know, I so look forward to that, Greg. Let`s hope we`re still doing MARKET CALL then. VALLIERE: There you go. But there`s going to be all this angst this week because the Social Security
Commission will be out with its report, talking about bankruptcy in 2047 or whatever. You`ll get predictable
sound bites. The Democrats will blame the Bush tax cut. The Republicans will say we`ve got to privatize.

But two important points I`d make. Number one, there are not going to be any benefit cuts anytime soon or any tax hikes to pay for it. Number two, if you have trouble sleep at night, get out the actuarial report, go to the appendix and look at the assumptions. These are the damnedest thing, Rhonda. They`re assuming GDP growth averaging 1.8 percent a year from 2020 to 2080. I would argue that`s a little low. I`d also
argue that we`re basing this great fear of bankruptcy on a flawed premise.

SCHAFFLER: Boy, Art, why is it the numbers are so hard to figure out in Washington? We thought they were hard enough on Wall Street, right? The analysts always seem to get those estimates wrong.

HOGAN: I know. If you want to take another look at a Washington number that was hard to figure out, we had to wait 27 days for the PPI and that was just January`s. We`re still waiting for February`s to come out. So we spoke earlier about inflation. It`s really hard to say how much of the commodity prices have been passed through until we get a good read on February`s PPI and we`re still waiting for that, so maybe this week we`ll get another peak at that and see what that environment looks like.
SCHAFFLER: You never know. In the meantime, we`ve got to wrap things up with "Last Call." We head to
Chicago and Phil.

FLYNN: Talk about flawed premises, I still think the budget surplus was based off a flawed premise. But, hey, that`s me. What can I say?
But, anyway, I think the main thing here - hey, let`s talk about a commodity nobody`s talking about. It`s
been the best bull market in a long time, milk. Milk has been on the rise. We never get to talk about milk but
it`s been flying lately and that`s good for those milk farmers that have had a few tough years. Let`s hope it
keeps going for those old farmers.

SCHAFFLER: Boy, I thought you were going to talk about soybeans again, Phil. I`m glad we switched gears on that.
FLYNN: Tomorrow, soybeans.
SCHAFFLER: Let`s go to Washington and Greg.

VALLIERE: I say nothing lasts forever. This interminable winter is about to end. It`s going to go warmer in the east. And I think the oil price move, which maybe is a little overdone, also may end. We`re awash in oil. Iraq is producing 2.5 million barrels a day. And I think the next time we talk, Rhonda, the price will be closer to $30 a barrel than to $40.
SCHAFFLER: To Boston and Art.

HOGAN: Springtime does bring a lot of thing, not the least of which the beginning of the baseball season. We can talk about that next week, obviously.
SCHAFFLER: I knew you were going to go there, Art, I could just tell.

HOGAN: We had a market that went unidirectionally for a year without a 5 percent correction. We`ve gone through that correction and then some. Another week or two we`ll be in corporate earnings reporting season. I think that`s the catalyst for the leg up.
SCHAFFLER: Mike.

Page 148 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
HOLLAND: Even in this correction, the market has been, to my unbiased view, incredibly resilient, including this morning. So I`m believing that the market is focusing on the fundamental, the Wal-Marts, the PalmOne`s, the GE`s, the 3M`s and it`s taking into account all the things that were just previously
discussed as saying, it`s going to be OK.
SCHAFFLER: Mike Holland sticks around here as our guest host. We say good-bye and thanks to Phil
Flynn in Chicago, Greg Valliere in DC, Art Hogan in Boston. We`ll see everyone again soon.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Let`s run down to Wall Street, see what`s going on with stocks at this hour. The Dow Jones Industrial average up by 42. Nasdaq is ahead by 13.
Here`s a check on the broader markets for you. We`re seeing gains across the board in the S&P, Big
Board composite and Russell.

In the Treasury market, as we`ve been telling you, pretty quiet on the economic front the last couple of days. Five-year note drifts lower, as does the 10-year.
Here`s a look at the dollar now against some of the major currency. Against the euro it`s at 1.23. Our guest host, Mike Holland, chairman of Holland & Company.
You know it`s interesting when you watch sort of technology march on. There`s always such a fear that technology is going to be halted or this particular product isn`t going to make it. And there`s always something new out there, it`s just that it might take us longer to get to it than we
first realized.

HOLLAND: Yes, it was interesting to listen to the answer to your question that Bradley gave from palmOne about what`s his biggest fear. It was clear that he incorporates just what you`re thinking, which is obsolescence for him, and that`s true whether it`s IBM or Apple or anyone else over the years or digital equipment, names from the past. They have to stay ahead of the curve.

And, in fact, as he said, innovation is accelerating and you have more smart people doing more smart things with better technology. And it`s coming from China now, it`s coming from India, and it`s coming from the U.S. and in other places in the world. So I think that we, as consumers, are big beneficiaries of this. Businesses are beneficiaries. Anyone who has an organization is a beneficiary. Consumers continue to get lower price and better products. But for the companies, it`s a real rat race.

SCHAFFLER: Just want to touch on  Microsoft once again. We`ve talked about it the last two days. And, again, the money involved, as Jim Boulden said, very wisely, it`s like a parking ticket for  Microsoft. This is a company with billion of dollar. But is there any fear here that innovation at  Microsoft is going to be slowed down a bit, if you will, by some of the problems that company`s been having?

HOLLAND: Quick, short term answer, no, because the company is doing everything legally to make sure that over the next several years, even with the worst outcome from the E.U., that it won`t happen. Far more important, Mario Monti, who is just an incredible bureaucrat, bad, is out of there in October. Perhaps his successor won`t be so - you have the E.U. essentially penalizing the company, Microsoft, for what it does in the U.S., which has already been reviewed. So you have stupid stuff going on with the European Commission and Mario Monti showed his hand back with the Honeywell -GE thing.
SCHAFFLER: Yes, I remember.

HOLLAND: He made silly, silly judgements and they`re very punitive to U.S. companies. So I don`t want to get into a word war about the thing but it`s just nonsense. So I think  Microsoft is committed, as Bradley from palmOne is, to staying, they understand that without innovation, without rebirth, they go out of business.
SCHAFFLER: One quick question, does that mean technology`s the place to be?
HOLLAND: With the people who have shown the ability to stay ahead of the curve. And Gerstner at IBM
showed how important it is because he took a dinosaur and revived it.

SCHAFFLER: Yes, it`s a fascinating story in and of itself. Mike Holland, it`s always great when you are here.
HOLLAND: Thank you, Rhonda.

Page 149 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SCHAFFLER: You`ll have to come back soon.
HOLLAND: I`ll do that.
SCHAFFLER: We`ll be in a new location soon. HOLLAND: Yes.
SCHAFFLER: You`ll love it there. HOLLAND: Yes.
An update on 9/11 commission hearing on Capitol Hill. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is giving her opening statement. As we`ve reported before, Secretary of State Powell and the current and former Secretaries of Defense also set to testify.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

SCHAFFLER: Welcome back. The White House took a little longer than its allies to openly criticize Israel`s actions yesterday. But after some initial hesitation, the State Department called the assassination of the founder of Hamas deeply troubling. The criticism reflects growing concern that American policy in the Middle East is failing. And what`s more, there are new fears that Palestinian militants are threatening the United States.

In our "Tough Call" today, does President Bush have to significantly adjust his Mideast policy? And is the Mideast conflict threatening to envelop the U.S.? Joining us is Shibley Telhami from the University of Maryland and Geoffrey Aronson, director of the Foundation for Middle East Peace.
Good to have you both with me. Appreciate your time.

Jeffrey, let me start with you. In light of what has happened in Israel and in the response from other countries, the reaction to the killing of the Hamas founder, is it time for the U.S. to rethink its Middle East strategy?

GEOFFREY ARONSON, FOUNDATION FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE: Well, this and other reasons suggest that the United States needs to rethink its potion in this part of the world not only because of the assassination but because of the evident failure of its diplomatic plan, which is known as the road map, which together have created a diplomatic vacuum, which people are rushing in to fill, both through diplomacy, in the case of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon`s decision to disengage from Gaza and also through non-diplomatic means. And we see the evidence of that with the assassination of Sheik Yassin and Palestinian efforts to respond to that.
SCHAFFLER: Shibley, same question for you.

SHIBLEY TELHAMI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Well, first, when you look in this particular phase, in the next days and weeks we`re going to see an escalation, no doubt. And when you have an escalation,
it`s very difficult to have effective diplomacy, particularly when there is a lot of blood shed. And realistically, this is an election year. In general, presidents don`t like to engage in this kind of diplomacy, which require tremendous effort to succeed and they don`t like to fail. And failure is something that is politically not feasible.

So I don`t expect realistically a real effort. But I think the conclusion to draw here is that there has been an understanding in Washington, which I think is flawed. That is the Arab/Israeli conflict isn`t so central for our interest in the Middle East. And I think it`s been obvious that the Middle East Arabs continue to look at the U.S. through the narrow prism of this particular conflict. And we have to make it a higher priority in our diplomacy.
SCHAFFLER: Shibley, let`s move away from the diplomacy issues for a minute and talk about war. The
U.S. is engaging in a war on terror. Has that war just resulted in a breeding ground for more terror?

TELHAMI: Well, I think that we always had to be called (ph) - the war on terror is very important, must stop. I think you have - it must continue. You`ve got to have the confrontational strategy with al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is U.S. number one enemy today.
However, at the same time, what you don`t want to do is lose all of the moderates in the region. You have
to have to win the hearts and minds. You have to have allies to succeed. If you lose them, you can succeed
because, in essence, you don`t want to make available more recruits to them. You don`t want people to
root against you, you want people to root for you. So if you have a strategy that alienates people, that

Page 150 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
drives them away from you, it makes it harder for you to succeed and the priority issue for us, which must remain a priority issue, and that is confronting al Qaeda and its threat.

SCHAFFLER: Geoffrey, it`s an interesting point. Are we losing those moderates here? And how do we continue to fulfill the goal of the war on terror and al Qaeda, at the same time not alienating others who might have some sympathy for at least some of the Arab causes?
ARONSON: Well, certainly, there`s a great reservoir of sympathy and identification with the U.S. in the
Arab world. Young people listen to U.S. music. They want to come here to study and so forth. They buy our
goods. So there`s a tremendous reservoir of support there.

The alienation comes in to play when they see U.S. policy being implemented in a fashion that they feel does not represent their authentic desires. And to the extent that the U.S. pursues these policies, we`re eroding this reservoir of good will, which can work in our favor, certainly, as we try to push the trends in that part of the world in a more specific direction.

Unfortunately, what we see now is we see a broadening of this front against the United States, with a suggestion by Hamas yesterday that the U.S. is now within its circle of first enemies, alongside of Israel. This is an important development because Hamas has been very disciplined since its inception in restricting its operations against Israel, to Israel and the occupied territories. And if we see the circle of our
enemies widening here, we need once again to begin to rethink the direction of our policy in that part of the world.
SCHAFFLER: Shibley, Israel has said its prepared for retaliation. Is the U.S. prepared?

TELHAMI: Well, I think the U.S. must prepare itself in a way because these kind of threats have to be taken seriously. But I say, at the same time, that I think it`s not in the interest of these groups to broaden the
circle of enemies to target the U.S. That`s one reason why they haven`t done it in the past. What they`re saying now may be at a moment of passion but you have to take it seriously.

At the same time, I think what I worry about is, with the killing of Ahmed Yassin, who was probably the only one within Hamas that could impose discipline on the group, you have a vacuum of leadership and individuals of factions may go on with their own actions without discipline and that spells trouble.
SCHAFFLER: Shibley, very briefly, are you more or less optimistic than you were six months ago about the
Middle East?
TELHAMI: Oh, I`m definitely less optimistic than I was and I think continue to be less optimistic every day. SCHAFFLER: Geoffrey, same question for you.
ARONSON: Yes, unfortunately, I have to agree with Shibley here. While there are some shimmerings of light here. It seems we`re, once again, at the beginning of a decent into the abyss.
SCHAFFLER: Geoffrey Aronson, Shibley Telhami, thanks for joining me as we make the "Tough Call" on
Mideast policy.
That wraps it up for MARKET CALL today. Thanks for watching. You have a great day.

-- Joo Ong, a professor of biomedical engineering and orthopedic surgery at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, has been named to hold the first J.R. Hyde Chair of Excellence in Rehabilitation Engineering.

Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics and the Hyde Family Foundation endowed the chair with $1 million over five years. The chair is named for J.R. 'Pitt' Hyde, who founded the Memphis Biotech Foundation and is chairman of GTx Inc., the Men's Health Biotech Co., which went public in February.

Ong joined the UT College of Health Science Engineering in January. He formerly served as professor and assistant director of the Center for Clinical Bioengineering at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.

Ong will establish an implant and biomaterials laboratory in the Coleman Building and continue his work on spinal and bone joint implants. The lab will focus on bone-protein-biomaterial interactions.
UAW-Caterpillar members OK strike
-- Ninety-six percent of UAW-Caterpillar members at seven union locals, including Memphis, voted
Monday to authorize a strike if necessary.
The union's contract with the company expires March 31.

The strike authorization vote is a standard part of the negotiating process, and union officials said they are focused on achieving a fair settlement.
"This vote indicates strong support for our bargaining team and for our bargaining objectives," said UAW
vice president Cal Rapson, who directs the union's agricultural implement department.
Negotiations between UAW and Caterpillar began in December. The union represents more than 8,000 Caterpillar workers.
Tenn. companies in Fortune spotlight

-- Tennessee gets special attention in a 26-page insert in the April 5 issue of Fortune magazine, the 50th anniversary of the publication's Fortune 500 list of the largest corporations. Wal- Mart tops the list for the third year. Exxon Mobil is second, rising from the third spot last year. General Motors is third, dropping from No. 2. Those three companies are the only ones in the history of the list to be No. 1. Seven

Home Depot starts online gift registry

-- Home Depot is going the way of retailers like Crate & Barrel and Macy's by offering an online gift registry. Industry observers see it as a way for the Atlanta-based company to enhance its relationship with customers, even if it isn't a boon for the bottom line. The initiative will be formally launched today.

The home-improvement chain says it is banking on its research showing that more people are getting married later in life, perhaps for a second time, and already have small appliances,  fine china and cutlery. Instead, the company says, couples may be looking for power drills or other items they can use to upgrade the look of their homes.

Tyco jurors ask for testimony read-back
-- Jurors at the Tyco International trial asked Monday for a read- back of chief financial officer Mark
Swartz's testimony about a $12.5 million loan that was forgiven.

The jury, in its third day of deliberations in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, is weighing whether Swartz and L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, looted the company of $600 million. The read-back jurors requested was of Swartz's testimony regarding a $12.5 million loan he was given in lieu of part of a bonus he was due to receive.

Swartz and Kozlowski are charged with 32 counts of grand larceny, falsifying business records and violating state business laws. Each could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.
Justice expands Monsanto payoff probe
-- The Justice Department has expanded an investigation into issues related to Monsanto Co.'s
Indonesian affiliates, the company said Monday.

St. Louis-based Monsanto said the Justice Department is looking into whether a former Monsanto employee directed an outside consultant to make an improper $50,000 payment to an Indonesian government official in 2002.
The agricultural chemicals and biotechnology company notified the Securities and Exchange
Commission of irregularities with its Indonesian affiliates in 2002 after an internal audit.
House of Blues plans big expansion

-- House of Blues Entertainment Inc., which operates music clubs and concert venues nationwide, has completed a $110 million recapitalization that will allow it to open new clubs, the company said Monday.

The privately held House of Blues said investment firm Ares Management LLC will buy a $30 million stake in the company. Longtime investor JP Morgan Partners also has agreed to an unspecified additional investment. House of Blues also was able to secure a new bank line of credit from Banc of America Securities, the company said.

The money will be used to expand the number of clubs domestically and internationally as well as pursue additional hotel ventures, according to company chief executive Greg Trojan.

House of Blues, founded by former Memphian Isaac Tigrett, operates clubs in seven U.S. cities and operates a hotel in Chicago as part of the Loews Hotel chain. The company also owns or operates arenas and amphitheaters nationwide.
Interest rates mixed in auction
-- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed in Monday's auction.

The Treasury Department sold $18 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 0.930 percent, down from 0.945 percent last week. An additional $16 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 0.990 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
The three-month rate was the lowest since Feb.17, when the bills sold for 0.915 percent.

Page 154 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors - 0.945 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,976.50 and 1.008 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,950.00.

EU reportedly set to  fine Microsoft

-- European Union  antitrust officials won backing Monday for a reportedly record-setting  fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could also force far- reaching changes in how the U.S. software company sells Windows.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the fine proposed by EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case, but speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press they agreed to it but declined to elaborate.

Other sources, also speaking on condition they not be identified, estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling Wednesday.

FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, CNN MONEY MORNING: Good morning. It`s Tuesday, March 23rd. And you`re taking a look at north on 8th Avenue here in Midtown Manhattan as we head towards Central Park. You`ll be seeing that on the right hand corner of your screen soon. It looks like signs of spring today. It`s supposed to be getting warmer in Manhattan. Hit the mid 40s. There you see that Southwestern corner of Central Park. Still supposed to be getting warmer today after several below normal days here in Manhattan and the futures are looking up, too. I`m Fred Katayama in today for Kathleen Hays and you`re watching CNN MONEY MORNING.

TD
Now for some of today`s top headlines. The independent commission looking into intelligence lapses leading up to the 9/11 terrorist attacks begins two days of public hearings in Washington today. There will be high profile witnesses and one notable absence. Top officials of the Bush and Clinton administrations will testify. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and current Secretary of State Colin Powell are expected to testify this morning. The commission is supposed to hear from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former Defense Secretary William Cohen in the afternoon. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice has met with the panel in private.

Gas prices are rising once again after a week of slow decline, according to two national surveys. The average price per gallon is $1.74 for regular unleaded and some states are well above $2 a gallon.

And, finally, don`t be surprised if you get free music at McDonald`s . Sony is working out a deal to launch it`s downloading music service Sony Connect through the fast food chain. This according to "The Los Angeles Times." McDonald`s will commit about $30 in advertising in exchange for the licensing rights to some Sony songs. Those songs would be offered to customers for free with the purchase of certain menu items.

The European Commission tomorrow is expected to hand down a formal decision finding that software giant Microsoft in violation of European Union anti- trust law. Jim Boulden report now on the E.U.`s Italian anti-trust commissioner, Mario Monti.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Move over, Jean Claude Van Damme, someone else has been flexing his muscles in Brussels. Mario Monti may be coming to the end of his five years as Europe`s top  antitrust cop, but he`s not going quietly.

MICHAEL GRENFELL,  ANTITRUST LAWYER: I think people will remember it as a colorful period in antitrust enforcement, a period in which he was prepared to take risks. He lost some cases in the European court, but he bounced back and thus his decisions on GE -Honeywell and more recently on Microsoft have shown he wasn`t cowed. He was willing to be firm.

BOULDEN: Firm when he stopped General Electric taking over Honeywell, even after U.S. authorities agreed the two American firms could merge. Firm when he told  Microsoft how it should behave when adding new technologies to its Windows software.  Microsoft said no, Monti said, see you in court.

SIMON TOPPING,  COMPETITION LAWYER: I think Mr. Monti would like this to go down as part of his legacy. And certainly with a good commission decision against  Microsoft, he is leaving with his head held high when he leaves in October.

Page 156 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BOULDEN: Monti`s office also goes after cartels. It  fined companies that broke the cartel laws more than
$3 billion. And it forces open markets, such as the ones once controlled by French electricity giant EDF and
German phone company Deutsche Telekom . Monti has had more than a few cases overturned by the
European courts, but  antitrust lawyers say even that helped clarify exactly what his power was.

GRENFELL: What Monti has done throughout the five years is to try and push their bounds out, whether it`s in antitrust control of M&A or it`s in cartels or it`s in anti-competitive practices like he`s been looking at with Microsoft, and to test them. He`s lost some, but he`s certainly left his mark.

BOULDEN: But Monti`s legacy may only truly be felt come May 1. Europe`s new  antitrust laws come into force that day, giving his successor and companies an even clearer idea what steps the E.U. can and will take to stop corporate activity it doesn`t like.
Jim Boulden, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)
KATAYAMA: Here in the United States futures are pointing to a stronger open. Perhaps it`s getting a tip from Europe where the markets are rebounding. For more on the European markets and  Microsoft, let`s join Todd Benjamin in London.
Good morning, Todd.
TODD BENJAMIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Fred.

Really no surprise on Microsoft. I mean, yes, the formal announcement comes tomorrow but everybody knows what the decision`s going to be at this point. The expectation is it will be  fined close to 500 million euros. That will be the largest  fine the E.U. has ever put out in terms of anti- competitive practice. Not only involves their European operation but the U.S. operation, as well, and  Microsoft, of course, feels this is unfair.

Microsoft clearly not willing to play ball the way that the E.U. wanted because, in part,  Microsoft feels it would be giving away some of their trade secrets on the computer service side. The other issue, of course, is on the audio visual player that they bundle with their Windows system. Obviously,  Microsoft
undoubtedly will appeal this decision and that means this could drag on a few more years, even after tomorrow`s announcement.

In terms of what the markets are doing today, really I think the higher futures in the U.S. is helping to help these markets get back on track after taking a real drubbing yesterday on geopolitical security concerns following the assassination of the spiritual leader of Hamas. Right now we`ve got the FTSE in London up
0.33 percent. The DAX is Frankfort`s up 0.75 percent. The CAC in Paris is up just over 0.5 percent.

In the currency markets today, the dollar is strengthening a little compared to Monday`s levels when it got hit following the developments in the Mideast. Right now we`re right around that 1.84 level on sterling against the greenback. And we`re back below 1.23 on the euro. We`re at 1.2270.

And, Fred, a few minutes ago you were talking about the cost of gasoline. $1.74 a gallon in some places, more than $2. Boo-hoo. Because I`ve got to tell you, here, you know what we pay for a gallon of gasoline? I crunched the numbers the other day.
KATAYAMA: Let me guess $4 or something. BENJAMIN: $5.38 a gallon.
KATAYAMA: Wow! BENJAMIN: $5.38 a gallon.
KATAYAMA: That`s tough for you and me. We`re both in California.

BENJAMIN: That is tough for both of us. But I`ll tell you, it`s a sight more expensive than what you pay in the U.S. but, of course, the U.S. is a car culture. A lot of people in Britain use their cars quite a bit. But if you work within London, more often than not you`re taking some form of public transportation to work be it trains, tubes, or buses. And if you choose not to, you have to be a congestion charge of five pounds a day to come within certain boundaries within the city of London. So they`re pretty tough here. Back to you.

KATAYAMA: Then again, Todd, having visited Rome before, I`m not sure I`d want to drive around Rome myself.

Page 157 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BENJAMIN: Well, that`s true. Rome will test your mettle but some of the roundabouts here in the U.K., they can be quite frightening too. But most people do respect the rules of the road and give the right of away.
Back to you.
KATAYAMA: All right, Todd, anyway I was in California a little while ago, paid $2.48 a gallon. Take care. Todd Benjamin in London.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KATAYAMA: Do Americans really think the country has an energy problem and are they worried about conservation? Let`s find out from Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll.
Good morning, Frank.
FRANK NEWPORT, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GALLUP POLL: Good morning, Fred.

A few mixed signals here from the public but investors indeed are worried about energy. In fact, as you know, our UBS Index of Investor Optimism came out yesterday. It was down. In the same survey we asked investors with $10,000 or more of investable assets to rank a bunch of reasons as to why or how important they were in causing the poor investment climate.

And look what ended up number one. I`ve selected some out of the long list here but 64 percent said that energy prices were indeed a very important cause of the poor investment climate. Actually above outsourcing and some of the other ones that you see there. So investors think energy prices are negative for the markets.

However, when we asked the average American how serious is the energy situation right now? It`s just at about 29 percent who say very serious. Put that in context after the California great problems, Enron`s involvement and all of that back in `01, we`ve got 58 percent who said that energy was serious. And back in the `70s with the gas lines, it was 47 percent. So we`re not nearly where we were at that point.

Politics, of course, very much involved with energy in an election year. This is fascinating. Will we have a shortage of energy in the next five years? About half of Americans say, yes. That`s pretty substantial in and of itself. But look at the differences by politics. Only 41 percent of Republicans but 58 percent of Democrats say yes. That because there`s a Republican in the White House. Democrats more negative on Bush`s performance.

And, in fact, Bush`s performance handling energy is down anyway you look at it. He started off his administration in March of `01 with a 58 percent "good job handling energy policy." Notice how that`s gone down since then. Now our most recent poll just finished, only 34 percent credit Bush doing a good job with energy. So clearly he`s got some problems all in all.

One final question. You mentioned it, Fred. What should we do? How do we solve the energy problem? Well, increase production, opening up ANWR, allowing people to drill more freely? Gather more coal out of the ground? No, say the American public. First instance on the right hand there should be conservation. This hasn`t changed. We`ve asked this numerous times. This is our most recent asking just a week or two ago, 59 percent of Americans, Fred, say conservation should be the number one way to handle the energy situation - Fred.

KATAYAMA: Frank, it`s amazing how Americans are still so high-minded on conservation, yet we seem to be so happy to drive those gas-guzzling SUVs.

NEWPORT: Yes, the human being is full of contradictions. You see the giant SUVs tooling down the highway at the same time they`re telling pollsters we need to conserve, you`re right. If you want to conserve, you can. You can get the hybrid autos but so far most Americans seem to be opting for higher mileage automobiles. So I can`t explain the contradiction but it`s there.
KATAYAMA: And still pay those high gases prices. Thanks a lot, Frank. Frank Newport.
Well, it`s time now for the morning buzz on Wall Street. Susan Lisovicz is at the New York Stock Exchange where the Dow is just about 64 points way from the 10000 level.
Susie, after two back-to-back session of triple digit declines, what does it look like for today?


Page 158 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: It looks like we`re going to have a bounce. You were probably wearing a hard hat on the floor yesterday because it was rough, Fred.

To recap the action, 29 of the Dow 30 stocks lower on the day. The Dow getting ever closer to the 10,000 level. Actually, over the past two weeks, the Dow has been down about eight of the past 11 sessions. The decliners swamping advancers by more then a three to one margin. Volume kind of light, though. Hugh Johnson quoted as saying that the world is clearly a very unsettled and dangerous place. And that`s demoralizing to investors.

And we also are waiting - sort of in a dead zone in terms of economic data. We don`t get the March employment report for another 10 days. We don`t really get the first quarter earnings for another few weeks. We don`t get them out in full force in any case.

And so what`s investors focusing on? The world and, of course, yesterday with the assassination of the Hamas spiritual leader and threats of more violence. And against the U.S., I might add, taking it out on Wall Street. The Dow, by the way, is now down 6 percent off of its highs. The S&P off 5 percent. But the arrows say green. That we`ll get a bounce at the open.

What stocks are we watching? Well, we have more brokerage earnings. Last week we had Bear Stearns and Lehman , Morgan Stanley . We have, this morning, Goldman Sachs coming out with $2.50 per share for its first quarter. The First Call estimate at $1.66. So continuing that theme of robust earnings among the big brokerages. Year-ago, Goldman Sachs earned $1.29. Revenue up 41.5 percent. Equity sales in (ph) trading, net revenues rose nearly 80 percent.

Motorola is also a stock we`re be looking at today. The world`s number two mobile phone maker unveiling a mobile phone it says consumers will be able to use almost anywhere in the world at a wireless industry show taking place in Atlanta this week. Both Goldman and Motorola are up in the pre-market, as is Limited. We go to retail now.

Limited is the company behind Express and Limited. It`s raising its quarterly earnings outlook. And you`re looking at the famous Victoria`s Secret so-called fashion show. And it`s Victoria`s Secret, as well as Bath and Body Works contributing to that more optimistic outlook. Victoria`s Secret has a new underwire full coverage bra that launched earlier this month. It`s fronted by Tyra Banks. It`s available in very generous sizes. You can just take my word for it. And it expects March sales increases in the low double digits compared with its previous expectation of a mid single digit increase.
And I`m sure you enjoyed the video, Fred, back to you.
KATAYAMA: So I guess, what, a new bra is lifting the outlook, huh? LISOVICZ: It is.
KATAYAMA: There are so many things you can say about Victoria`s Secret video. LISOVICZ: And that was a very good comment on that.
KATAYAMA: I`m trying to be good, it`s Lent. But, Susie, you know, you`ve been covering the brokerage sector closely. Goldman Sachs came with stellar earnings. A big earnings surprise. And it certainly has carried today Wall Street, last week too with those other brokerages. But has it helped the stock prices of those companies?

LISOVICZ: Well, I mean we`re seeing Goldman lifted in terms of what we`re seeing in the pre-market. But in terms of what they have been doing over the last year, what they`ve been doing this year, how they`ve been compared to the overall market, they have been outperforming. I don`t have numbers right in front of me but I remember doing this last week, doing some research on it, and substantially outperforming the broader market, the S&P 500. So the numbers have been - we`ve seen that the bull market began last March. It`s faltered recently but it`s really helped their earnings, of course. And that has also translated to the stock price, what they`ve been doing.

KATAYAMA: All right. Thanks, Susie. I hope you don`t have to wear my hard hat today while you`re out there.

All right. Let`s go now over to the Nasdaq marketSite in Times Square. The Nasdaq`s about 11 percent off its recent peak in January. Carrie Lee is there watching all the pre-market action.
Carrie, what`s the buzz today?
CARRIE LEE, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Fred.

Page 159 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Well, I don`t have any fancy video like Susan did but I think I can show you a stock chart just to give you some of the Nasdaq action that we`ve seen lately. Obviously selling is really been the name of the game. The Nasdaq composite down about 3.5 percent. In the past three days alone for the year right now, the Nasdaq, like the other major market indices, is at the lows of the session, down 4.7 percent for 2004 so far. And we are down 11 percent, a little over 11 percent in fact, since the late January peak.

So we`ve seen a lot of selling. We are expecting a bit of a bit of a rebound today. Futures pointing to a higher open, as you can see in the corner. We`ll see if the gains can hold or if it`s just maybe a one-day bounce. A lot of people thinking that more selling could come down the pike before we start to retrace some of these losses. So that is the latest for the markets overall.

Microsoft in focus today. The company, of course, very influential here, as well as the Dow.  Microsoft shares up about 1 percent this morning. Europe`s top anti-trust regulator has received backing from European Union members to slap  Microsoft with a $610 million  fine. Perhaps there`s some relief that this wasn`t a $3 billion  fine. There was some talk about that fine being as high as that amount. Of course, we`ll get the official decision tomorrow. But that`s the latest on Microsoft so far.

Also interesting to note that palmOne and PalmSource are both moving much higher in the pre-market. PalmOne up 18 percent. PalmSource up 4.4 percent. PalmOne now, of course, the hardware end of Palm. They split a couple of months ago. They posted a narrower third quarter loss on strong sales of the Trio
600 phone and digital organizer. Net losses coming in at 9.3 million or 20 cents a share, much lower than the $5.93 loss a year ago. Interesting because PalmSource had such a robust recent quarter. The stock really took a hit last week but it looks like it`s rebounding right now.

And then quickly, Fred, Petco moving fractionally higher. They`re buying 20 former Kids `R` Us stores from Office Depot . A $45 million deal. Trying to expand their presence. Everyone likes to go shopping for their pets.
Back to you. That is the latest.
KATAYAMA: Thanks, Carrie. Carrie Lee at the Nasdaq marketSite. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
KATAYAMA: Another big issue for the U.S. is the rising cost of health care. 44 million Americans do not have basic health insurance. The problem doesn`t just impact the unemployed, but also middle class professionals. Lisa Sylvester has this report.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

LISA SYLVESTER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Forty-six-year-old Pat Lawrence runs her own catering business. She makes enough money to cover food and rent, but cannot afford the $600 a month for health insurance.

PAT LAWRENCE, UNINSURED WORKER: A lot of people have more month at the end of their money than they do money at the end of their month. And I kind of fall into that same category.
SYLVESTER: For most of her adult life, she has not had health coverage.

LAWRENCE: I don`t have the annual Pap smear or the mammogram or I don`t even go in and have my blood pressure checked.

SYLVESTER: She is among 44 million uninsured Americans, many of them professionals, small business owners and freelancers. The Census Bureau says the number of uninsured has increased by 10 percent in the last two years. Rising health care costs and shrinking wages have put health care coverage out of
reach for more middle-class Americans. Four out of five people without insurance are in working families.

RON POLLACK, FAMILIES USA: They tend not to have coverage because their employer doesn`t provide coverage or their employer provides coverage and is charging the worker too much money that they can`t afford and they`re ineligible for any public safety net program.

SYLVESTER: Employers are increasingly asking their workers to shoulder more of the cost of health insurance. Those unable to afford the higher premiums often end up dropping their coverage.

STUART SCHEAR, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION: So, even if you are employed and you have health coverage, it`s very likely that in the last two years you`ve seen an increase in the co-payment you pay when you get a prescription at the drugstore, that you pay more on a monthly basis for your health premiums.

Page 160 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SYLVESTER: Those without insurance do what Pat Lawrence does, play the game of medical roulette, hoping nothing happens.

(on camera): A major part of the problem is rising health care costs. The general inflation is 2 percent a year, but health care premiums are up on average 14 percent.
Lisa Sylvester, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)
KATAYAMA: What will traders be watching at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today? Let`s find out now from Nina Cooper. She`s president at Pendragon Research.
Good morning and welcome to CNN MONEY MORNING.
NINA COOPER, PRESIDENT, PENDRAGON RESEARCH: Good morning.

KATAYAMA: Well, Nina, Todd Benjamin in London earlier reported to us that the European markets turned around after taking a cue from the U.S. futures market. Futures looking positive. What`s behind the optimism this morning after all the losses we saw in the past few days?

COOPER: I think it`s really a matter of just a little bit of profit taking. The people who have been selling this market have got a pretty nice profit and it`s time to book some of that. I think it`s corrective, though. The bounce that we see may be not as strong as you would hope.

KATAYAMA: So it`s not an easing of global insecurity concerns? Rather it`s more of a technical bounce today?

COOPER: Yes, I think that`s a good description, a technical bounce. The market is in a period when it`s going down. We`re going to see more selling. But first we have to have a little bit of a break and I think that`s what`s ahead of us.

KATAYAMA: So, Nina, does this mean then that the correction has not yet run its course? We did see a spike in volume in the Nasdaq yesterday but perhaps not capitulation then that some traders are looking to see?

COOPER: That`s exactly right. I don`t think we`ve seen capitulation yet. We need to spend a little bit of time here distributing and then another drop. That`s a better chance for a bottom.

KATAYAMA: And, Nina, what are some of the key support levels that traders will be looking for this morning? For example, say on the S&P 500?

COOPER: On the S&P, the important level is whether or not we can get back above the 1100 mark. I think that`s a really tough level. It`s been good support on the way down and on the way back up again it`s going to play another role. The real risk is that we see a probe down towards the 1070 area. That`s an important bottom.
KATAYAMA: OK. We`ll be looking for those levels. Nina Cooper, thanks for joining us. COOPER: My pleasure.
KATAYAMA: And thank you all for joining us this morning. Stay tuned for more on today`s trading market action. MARKET CALL is next.

BRUSSELS

European Union anti-trust officials won backing yesterday for their proposed  fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could force far-reaching changes on how the U.S. software giant sells its Windows operating system.

TD
Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour to review the proposal from EU
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

A source familiar with the case, but speaking on condition of anonymity, said they agreed to a  fine but declined to elaborate.

Other sources, also speaking on condition they not be identified, have estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling tomorrow.
One report said the  fine could approach 500 million euros, or about $617 million U.S. Commission spokesperson Amelia Torres refused to comment.
EU rules allow the commission to  fine anti-trust violators as much as 10 per cent of annual global revenue, although in practice they have been far lower. The largest ever imposed was less than two per cent - 462 million euros or $570 million U.S. - against Roche Holding AG, one of several companies caught fixing the prices of bulk vitamins in 2001.

The record penalty for charges similar to those  Microsoft faces - abusing a monopoly position - is 75 million euros ($92.5 million U.S.) imposed on Swedish packaging giant Tetra Pak AB in 1991.

Analysts say even the maximum  fine would be easily absorbed by Microsoft, which expects to generate nearly $36 billion in revenue this fiscal year and is sitting on cash reserves of more than $50 billion.

Yesterday's meeting came a week after the same advisory panel unanimously backed Monti's draft ruling, which sources familiar with the 5-year-old case say finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to make public more of the underlying code for Windows to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

HD       Europe's  Slap on Microsoft's Wrist?

LP
United States, 2004 Mar 23 (NB). Word leaked out yesterday that is going to be slapped with a roughly
$613 million fine for unfairly wielding its might in the European software marketplace -- chump change
compared to the more than $50 billion in cash the company has sitting in the bank.

Sure, European  antitrust head honcho is expected to outline other  antitrust remedies when the formally announces its final ruling on  Microsoft tomorrow. But the peanut gallery is already chiming in. Bottom line: Many observers (Filter included) don't think Microsoft will fundamentally change its ways over this ruling. Nonetheless, the remedies European antitrust regulators are pushing for could at least rock the boat for Microsoft's business strategy.

TD
The Los Angeles Times noted that news of the $613.5 million  fine set "the stage for a sweeping antitrust ruling this week that could limit how the company builds and sells software in one of its most lucrative markets." And the newspaper did one of the better jobs today of putting the fine into perspective: "Although the  fine would be the largest imposed by the European Commission, it is considerably less than the $3 billion it could have levied against Microsoft, which has spent years battling lawsuits around the world alleging anti-competitive behavior. ... Microsoft has more than $50 billion in cash reserves. It would take the company, which had global revenue of $32.2 billion last year, less than a month to earn $613.5 million." The Seattle Times carried this witty observation on the  fine: "One analyst said it's merely a 'rounding error' for a company with more than $53 billion in cash."

According to The Financial Times, the 20 European Commissioners could still change the  fine when they meet tomorrow. "Commission  fines are based on factors such as the gravity of the offence, the turnover of the company concerned and the time for which it continued -- five years and five months in the case of Microsoft. But the Commission has the discretion to adjust the amount of the penalty. Some people said the fine had been doubled to take account of the company's global operations, including those in the US. The company's appeal against the  fine is likely to object to such considerations," the paper said.
Reuters provides more nitty gritty on how the fine fits with  Microsoft's overall financial picture: "The  fine
amounts to slightly more than one percent of Microsoft's roughly $53 billion cash on hand. On January
22 it projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current
quarter.  Microsoft has three months to pay the fine but may instead give a bank guarantee during the
appeal. If it ends up losing, it would owe the fine plus interest.  Microsoft argues that it should not have
to pay because it did not infringe the rules intentionally and that it should not be  fined for its worldwide
turnover because the United States has already acted in the case. European Union law says that  fines
are based on the worldwide turnover of companies. The absolute limit is 10 percent of annual turnover
for the year before the decision, which for  Microsoft would amount to $3.43 billion."

Of course,  Microsoft has already said it will appeal the ruling. "In view of the absence of a clear legal standard under E.U. law, a  fine of this size isn't warranted," said , the company's spokesman in Brussels, according to The New York Times. Company spokesman told Agence France-Presse: "It's certainly unwarranted because we think it comes only from the inability to reach a settlement on one issue after
we essentially agreed on every other issue."

While the record EU  fine has made Microsoft's blood boil, it's the  antitrust remedies that European regulators are expected to impose that Microsoft (and its many business foes) are most interested in. The company is expected to be required to sell two separate versions of its operating system in Europe

-- one with the and another without. The company "would also have to share more Windows code to
allow rival makers of server software to compete with  Microsoft more fairly, according to people close to
the case. Computer servers drive networks of PC's. These remedies would have more of an impact on
Microsoft than a fine, because the company has more than $50 billion in cash reserves and has already
set some of that aside for covering legal costs," The New York Times reported.

"[A]nalysts say the ruling could indirectly hurt  Microsoft's attempts to counter the freely available operating system, which is becoming a strong competitor to Windows in Asia, especially in the government sector," the Associated Press reported. analyst said: "Microsoft has been trying to improve relationships with governments worldwide and an adverse ruling in the EU could hamper those efforts."
The San Jose Mercury News said "Wednesday's expected decision may reverberate far beyond Europe.
... [T]he European case looks ahead at newer markets and technologies, such as digital media and
server software." The EU decision, 's said, "calls into question what features are going to be added to
Windows. It's potentially a bad precedent. ... If I have a technology similar to what could be built into
Windows, I'm going to sue." The Merc added: "Such a decision could potentially throw a wrench into
Microsoft's plans for enhancing its next version of Windows, dubbed , with new technologies for search,
security, voice recognition and digital music and videos."

The Wall Street Journal reported that  Microsoft is passing around details of the settlement deal it tried to get EU officials to endorse. "The commission's jurisdiction for such an order is limited to Europe, Microsoft argues in the document being circulated to EU officials, while the company offered an alternative solution that would have applied world-wide. The document suggested  Microsoft could
ensure that three alternative media players could be preinstalled on some 300 million new PCs a year in Europe and 'in many other parts of the world,' thus 'ensuring that European and other consumers have ready access to a broad variety of media players without having to download them from the Internet.' The commission's proposed solution, by contrast, 'is unlikely to have any impact,' the document says."

The EU Microsoft ruling is expected to continue dominating headlines this week, as Wall Street and other interested observers wait to dissect Europe's  antitrust ruling after it is officially unveiled tomorrow. Stay tuned for more details. And also don't forget that any ruling will be tempered by  Microsoft's plans to appeal. The Times of London reminds us that the appeals process could take up to seven years.

The Boston Globe today effectively endorses the EU's expected decision in an editorial. Excerpt: "Rather than appealing the decision,  Microsoft ought to use it as a guide in future product introductions. ... If Microsoft appeals, the matter could remain in court for years. And in no circumstances would the decision apply to the United States, where the  antitrust decision in a different Microsoft case is far milder. The European action, if it is sustained, would set useful limits on Microsoft in a vast market. Microsoft would still be free to develop add-on programs, but they would have to compete on their
merits without the unfair boost of an innate connection to Windows."

No surprise here: Microsoft critics are already lauding the planned  fine. "We think a very large  fine is appropriate for a company with this much money," , general counsel of Seattle-based , told The Los Angeles Times.

If you missed it on Sunday, the New York Times took a close look at RealNetworks, noting that the EU "ruling, if upheld on appeal, may make it easier for RealNetworks to get its software on more personal computers. But it will not undo the damage already done to the company's business." The Times went on to look at RealNetworks's overall business strategy and prospects, concluding that the company is not likely to go the way of Netscape, despite vigorous  competition from Microsoft and a host of new online music services.

The trade show in Atlanta this week is already spawning interesting announcements. The theme of the show so far from exhibitors? Bells and whistles will help sell more wireless gadgets.

used the show to unveil plans for a new wireless voice service. Starting this spring, the company said it will start selling its first wireless product "with a complete bundle of applications on a handheld device including email, voice calling and Internet browsing, all sold, supported and provisioned by EarthLink." According to Reuters, the Atlanta-based ISP "said it has not decided who will make its first voice and data device, but the wireless device made by . is under consideration."
Also on tap at CTIA, lots of talk about next-generation 3G wireless networks. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution noted that " introduced wireless broadband that will be available in Seattle, San
Francisco and two other unnamed U.S. cities this year. ... Also, said Monday it will use equipment from
and to support its new high-speed wireless Internet service."
The Financial Times has more on Verizon's 3G deal. The contracts to Lucent and Nortel are worth nearly
$700 million. "In January, Verizon said it planned to spend $1bn over the next two years to upgrade its
Page 165 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
existing network with (Evolution-Data Optimised) technology that will enable wireless business users in the main US metropolitan areas to send and receive data at broadband speeds averaging 300-500 Kbps (kilobits per second) -- 10 times as fast as a standard dial up connection. Together, Lucent's three-year deal, worth more than $525m in the first two years, and Nortel's two-year agreement, worth $167m, form the bulk of the new investment and mainly cover upgrading the equipment at Verizon's existing wireless cell sites in 100 top metropolitan areas."

Meanwhile, Motorola unveiled plans for a device that "would allow many U.S. travelers to use their phones throughout Western Europe, vast parts of Asia and Latin America without a hiccup. also showed off a similar phone that it says will be available this spring. That would be a big improvement for the more than half of U.S. cellphone users who currently can't use their phones most places abroad because of incompatible technologies. About 75 million U.S. cellphone subscribers use so-called CDMA technology, whereas most of the rest of the world has opted for a technology referred to as GSM," The Wall Street Journal reported. Motorola's Web site has a PDF picture and a fact sheet on the phone.

More from Reuters: "The biggest U.S. mobile provider Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications, said recently it expected to offer its customers a dual-standard phone by April this year. Verizon, which runs its network on CDMA technology while its part owner operates on GSM, is
expected to offer a world-phone from Motorola's smaller rival Samsung Electronics. Motorola did not say which providers would sell its phone."
Motorola chairman and chief executive is slated to give a keynote address at CTIA today.

Washington Post reporter Yuki Noguchi was on the floor of the CTIA show yesterday, prompting her to file a story that offers a glimpse at why wireless companies are hawking certain products and technologies. Excerpt: "Faced with slouching profit margins and slowing growth, leaders of the wireless phone business have frantically embraced content -- the wireless delivery of entertainment -- as the answer. The industry hopes to sell the next generation of cell phones as marked-up multimedia gadgets reliant on pricey high-speed wireless transmission. Makers of cell phones and software, along with
service providers, are trying to pump up the $81 billion that U.S. mobile phone customers spent last year. More than half the population now carries a cell phone -- more than 156 million people, according to the CTIA -- but a majority of those users still use it just to talk."

The show is expected to fuel further conversations about the consolidation trend in the wireless industry, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said. "What's overhanging CTIA this year is the consolidation in the industry and the merger of and AT&T Wireless and how that's going to play out," , senior director of wireless services at , told the paper.

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission is about to unplug the music- and movie-playing service from Microsoft's Windows operating system after the failure Thursday of last-minute  antitrust talks with the software giant.

The European Commission--the European Union's executive authority--is due Wednesday to formally announce the measures against  Microsoft as well as fines that could exceed $300 million.  Microsoft will have to distribute two different-priced versions of Windows: one with and one without the Windows Media Player system (HR 3/19).

TD
The move comes after European  competition commissioner Mario Monti and  Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer failed to bridge their differences in two days of talks in Brussels on how to format new versions of Windows.

The commission's move represents the end of a five-year EU probe called by such rivals as RealNetworks and Apple, which said Windows Media Player had an unfair advantage over other movie, music, radio and television streaming software because Microsoft bundled it onto all sales of the regular Windows system. The commission had called on Microsoft to distribute a version of Windows without
the media player at a reduced price.

Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said the company would almost certainly appeal the decision in the
EU courts.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti will announce the  European Commission's ruling in its antitrust probe into Microsoft Corp at around 1.15 pm tomorrow, according to EU spokesperson Amelia Torres.

Torres declined to respond to  Microsoft's comment last night that the commission was unjustified in proposing a record fine of â¬497m in connection with an expected ruling that the company abused its dominant market position.

Microsoft accused the EU today of going too far in seeking a record  fine of about â¬498m against it for alleged antitrust abuses, saying it was being penalised for behaviour permitted in the United States.

The Seattle based software giantâs chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, said the level appeared to have been doubled from what it would have been under the  European Commissionâs own guidelines to account for the companyâs global operations.

TD
Microsoft does about 30% of its business in Europe.

"We believe itâs unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a companyâs US operations when those operations are already regulated by the US government," Gutierrez said in Brussels. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the US Department of Justice and a US court."
The EC is to issue its ruling against  Microsoft, including the  fine, tomorrow.

Sources familiar with the five-year-old case say the EU ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behaviour in the US  antitrust case but settled with the Bush administration. A US appeals court is currently considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore  competition.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met yesterday to approve the level of the  fine proposed by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case, said it was around â¬498m.

That would be a record for the EU in an  antitrust case but far below the maximum of around â¬2.8bn that could be imposed in  Microsoftâs case.

ROBERT SIEGEL, host:

The European Union is expected to rule tomorrow that Microsoft abused its power in a way that harmed consumers and competitors. The EU is expected to fine Microsoft several hundred million dollars, limit what features the company can include in its Windows operating system and also require that it give more information to competitors.  Microsoft was vowed to appeal. NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports that some experts say the appeals process could delay any remedy for years.

TD
WENDY KAUFMAN reporting:

The antitrust concerns raised by the Europeans echo those raised by US  antitrust officials. In 2001, after protracted litigation, a settlement was reached between Microsoft, the US Department of Justice and several states. But in Europe, which has more expansive antitrust laws, the company and European regulators could not reach an agreement. And tomorrow, the Europeans are to issue a ruling that goes well beyond what US regulators required. The European Union is expected to impose a record  fine of more than $600 million.  Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler wouldn't confirm the penalty amount, but says the EU has gone too far.

Mr. JIM DESLER (Spokesman,  Microsoft): Given the lack of a clear legal standard on these issues, it's just hard to see how a  fine of this magnitude could be warranted under any circumstances, particularly these circumstances.

KAUFMAN: The company's chief European lawyer says, quote, "It is unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's US operations when those operations are already regulated by the US government. The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the US Department of Justice and a US court," closed quote. But Mark Schecter, an  antitrust expert with the Howrey Simon
law firm, says that  Microsoft does substantial business in Europe, and the EU has its own regulatory authority.

Mr. MARK SCHECTER (Howrey Simon): What's important about the case is that the Europeans have investigated it, that the  European Commission has extensive jurisdiction and extensive power and it can alter the way major international companies do business.

KAUFMAN: The Europeans contend that  Microsoft violated the law in two areas: first, by bundling software to play audio and video into the Windows operating system. To address this, European regulators are expected to force  Microsoft to provide computer makers with a version of Windows that doesn't have its media player in it. Technology analyst Rob Enderle suggests that what's most troubling for Microsoft isn't the elimination of the media player; it's the issue of control.

Mr. ROB ENDERLE (Technology Analyst): They really don't like another entity, particularly a government, directing them with regard to what they can or cannot put into a product. They like to control their
offerings. It's their products. If they needed to respond to a competitive threat or an opportunity, they don't want to have to ask anybody else for permission.



Page 170 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
KAUFMAN: The second legal contention raised by the Europeans is that  Microsoft used its knowledge of the inner workings of the Windows operating system on PCs to give it an edge in producing software
for servers. To resolve this, the Europeans are expected to require that  Microsoft release more technical information that will help rivals, including Sun Microsystems, compete in developing server-related products.

But the remedies may be put on hold. Some legal experts believe that given the enormous implications of the case and the proposed remedy,  Microsoft may well convince a judge that the company is entitled to
a delay before any penalty is imposed. Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Seattle.

SOFTWARE giant  Microsoft is facing a record European Union  fine of Â£340 million for abusing its domination of the computer market.

Bill Gates' empire will also be forced to tell rivals more about how its products work in long list of punitive 'remedies' handed out by EU commissioner Mario Monti.

TD
The massive fine beats the Â£309 million penalty handed out by the  European Commission to Swiss drugs giant Hoffman-La Roche three years ago for its part in a vitamins cartel.

But it has already been slammed by  Microsoft's critics as fairly insignificant to the US giant, representing less than 2 per cent of the company's Â£17 billion annual sales.

Microsoft, which is set to appeal against the decision, also has Â£29 billion in the bank. 'This is a traffic ticket for Microsoft,' said Thomas Vinje of lawyers Clifford Chance, who represents  Microsoft's opponents.

The case centres on  Microsoft's Windows Media Player, which allows people to play music and video clips on everyday PCs. Its main rivals are RealNetworks' RealPlayer and Apple's QuickTime.

Commissioners believe Microsoft illegally exploited its Windows monopoly by bundling Media Player with the operating system.
They also say the firm sought a stranglehold on the market by designing its workstation software to
work better with Windows NT network servers than with rival network software from companies such as
Sun Microsystems.
The EU took huge amounts of evidence and insiders believe the  fine, to be voted on by the full
European Commission tomorrow, has been doubled to take account of  Microsoft's global operations.

But Monti's list of 'remedies' to break  Microsoft's dominance are far more likely to hurt Bill Gates' executive team than the regulator's financial penalty.
Alongside the ruling, the EU will force  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows in Europe - one with
Media Player and one without. It also wants it to share information in the market for computer servers.

Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer met the EU commissioner last week in a last-ditch bid to avoid a tough ruling and the company is widely expected to fight the verdict in an appeal that could last several years.

Horacio Gutierrez, chief European legal counsel for  Microsoft, is expected to argue that the  fine is inappropriate - as the case sets a precedent, and the firm cannot not have known it was breaking EU competition law.

Last year, Microsoft reached a settlement with the US government to open up to competitors - avoiding a multi-billion dollar fine and the possible break-up of its business.

BRUSSELS, March 22 -- Antitrust regulators will fine Microsoft 497 million euros ($613 million) on Wednesday, when the European Commission formally rules that the company abused its monopoly in computer operating systems, people close to the company said on Monday.

The fine, which was set late last week after settlement talks with  Microsoft broke down, was endorsed by regulators from the 15 member nations of the European Union on Monday.

TD
Microsoft said the fine was too big. ''In view of the absence of a clear legal standard under E.U. law, a
fine of this size isn't warranted,'' said Tom Brookes, the company's spokesman in Brussels.

On Tuesday, the fine is to be discussed by senior aides to all 20 commissioners before being brought up at the European Commission's final meeting on the case on Wednesday morning.

Microsoft would then be officially informed of the  fine and sent a summary of the ruling by fax, shortly before Mario Monti, the  competition commissioner, holds a news conference to announce the decision.

Under the European Union antitrust laws, the commission can set a  fine of as much as 10 percent of a company's global sales, which in Microsoft's case would be more than $35 billion. European antitrust regulators, however, have never fined a company the full 10 percent, and Brussels-based lawyers and officials had expected the fine against Microsoft to range from 100 million euros to 1 billion euros.

The biggest previous  fine imposed by the commission was 462 million euros, or about $406 million at the exchange rate at that time, against Roche of Switzerland in 2001 for its role in several cartels that fixed prices and market shares of vitamin products in the 1990's. (Seven other vitamin makers were fined lesser amounts.)

Still, some people close to  Microsoft had been speculating over the weekend that the commission would not impose a  fine at all.

But Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for Mr. Monti, said: ''We have already told  Microsoft many times that a negative ruling will incur a  fine. A small company could claim it didn't know the rules, but not one the size of  Microsoft.''

The commission is expected to rule that  Microsoft abused the monopoly position of its Windows operating system in two ways. By withholding vital information about Windows from rival makers of software for servers, the company gained an unfair advantage in the separate market for server software. It also competed unfairly by including its Media Player audio-video software as part of Windows. The commission is expected to announce remedies to restore  competition in these


Page 175 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
markets, requiring  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows to PC makers in Europe, one of them with Media Player stripped out.

It would also have to share more Windows code to allow rival makers of server software to compete with Microsoft more fairly, according to people close to the case. Computer servers drive networks of PC's.

These remedies would have more of an impact on  Microsoft than a fine, because the company has more than $50 billion in cash reserves and has already set some of that aside for covering legal costs.

After negotiations toward a settlement of the charges collapsed last week, Brad Smith, the chief lawyer for Microsoft, said the company would appeal any ruling at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

HD       EU to slap record fine on Microsoft. WC      313 words

BRUSSELS, March 23 (Xinhua) - The European Commission (EC), the executive arm of the European Union (EU), is set to slap a record fine of nearly 500 million euros (about 600 million US dollars) against the US software giant  Microsoft, said an online newsletter EUobserver Tuesday.

The EC said last week that it would slap sanctions on Microsoft because it believes that the company is abusing its dominant market position and break EU competition laws. The last decision would be announced by EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti on Thursday.

TD
The fine is expected to be 497 million euros (about 597 million dollars), significantly larger than the 460 million euros (about 540 million dollars)  fine imposed on German pharmaceutical company Roche for its part in a price-fixing operation in the Vitamin market.
However, the  fine is not likely to cause too much pain for the software giant, which holds 50 billion euros
(60 billion dollars) in cash.



But additional "remedies" for the unfair
competition situation
are likely to affect the company more.
The EC is expected to demand that Microsoft offer two different

versions of its Windows operating system - one without its media player - which allows users to download music and videos from the internet.

This will satisfy the EU's concern that  Microsoft's practice of "bundling" its media player with the operating system is unfair to competitors.

In a further blow to the company's business model,  Microsoft will likely have to reveal its secret source code, which will reduce its dominance over rivals in the market for servers.

This will not be the last chapter in this lengthy saga, which has been in progress for five years.  Microsoft, which said the fine was inappropriate, is widely expected to appeal against the decision, which could
drag the case out for up to two more years.

EU reportedly sets record  Microsoft fine

TD
European Union  antitrust officials won backing Monday for a reportedly record-setting  fine against Microsoft Corp., the last hurdle before adopting a decision that could also force far- reaching changes in how the U.S. software company sells Windows.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments met for less than an hour behind closed doors to review the fine proposed by EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. A source familiar with the case, but speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press they agreed to it but declined to elaborate.

Other sources, also speaking on condition they not be identified, estimated the  fine would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars when the  European Commission, the EU's executive body, issues its ruling Wednesday.

Biomet acquires Merck interest in venture

Orthopedic company Biomet said Monday it had completed the acquisition of Merck's 50 percent interest in the Biomet-Merck joint venture.
The Warsaw-based company announced in December its plan to buy Merck's share of the venture for
$300 million in cash.

According to Biomet, the transaction has been completed subject only to clearance by European authorities; Merck is a German company.

The partnership between Biomet and Merck was formed in 1998, and, as a European orthopedic company, has annual sales of about $330 million, Biomet said.
Biomet stock closed at $38.11 per share Monday on the Nasdaq, down 11 cents per share. NEW YORK
Tyco jurors review testimony about loan

Jurors at the Tyco International trial asked Monday for a read- back of chief financial officer Mark Swartz's testimony about a $12.5 million loan that was forgiven.

The jury, in its third day of deliberations in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, is weighing whether Swartz and L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, looted the company of $600 million. The
read-back jurors requested was of Swartz's testimony regarding a $12.5 million loan he was given in lieu of part of a bonus he was due to receive.

Swartz and Kozlowski are charged with 32 counts of grand larceny, falsifying business records and violating state business laws. They each could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

HUD withdraws plan for single-cost closing

Federal housing officials are withdrawing a proposal they said could have saved consumers hundreds of dollars on mortgage closing costs, the Bush administration's top housing official said Monday

A "significant number of questions" have been raised about the proposed changes to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, acting Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson said in a letter to the Office of Management and Budget.

The HUD proposal, in the works for two years and submitted to OMB in December, would have encouraged lenders to offer one price to cover all closing costs, such as broker fees, title searches and appraisals. Currently, those costs are itemized.

HUD officials said many home buyers were confused by all the numbers and that offering one price for closing costs would make it easier to shop around.

Walgreen Co., the nation's largest drugstore chain, rode the continuing surge of prescription drug sales to a

Microsoft says that EU regulators are unjustified in their proposed record  fine of E497m  fine in relation to an expected ruling that the company allegedly abused its dominant market position.

"It's very difficult for  Microsoft to see how a fine of this magnitude could be warranted under these circumstances," company spokesman Lou Gellos told Agence France-Presse.

TD
"It's certainly unwarranted because we think it comes only from the inability to reach a settlement on one issue after we essentially agreed on every other issue," he said.

Sources close to the case in Brussels said the European Union's Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is proposing the fine, and that it was approved by EU competition regulators Monday. If the European Commission approves the fine, Gellos said "we certainly will appeal." Gellos said the only stumbling block between EU regulators and  Microsoft was "our capacity to innovate" with applications like Media Player, which plays video and music.

BRUSSELS -- Europe's top  antitrust regulator received backing from European Union member states to slap Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) with a record 497 million euro ($610 million)  fine. But the software giant continued to push for a settlement that would avert an open-ended legal battle, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported.

Microsoft has been circulating details of its settlement offer to some EU officials who weren't given a chance to accept it initially, according to people familiar with the situation. European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti rejected the same settlement offer last week, insisting that he wanted a formal commission decision to set a "precedent."

TD
The European Commission Wednesday is expected to hand down a formal decision finding the
Redmond, Wash., company in violation of EU  antitrust law.

Though a record, the proposed fine against Microsoft is well below the 10% of the company's annual sales that the European Commission is authorized to seek. That size  fine would come to about three billion euros.

Antitrust authorities for the EU member nations already have given Mr. Monti their unanimous backing for a formal commission finding that  Microsoft abused the near monopoly of its Windows operating system for personal computers to leverage its way into related markets for networking and multimedia software.

Microsoft immediately said a fine of any size would be unwarranted.

Microsoft's defense team acknowledges it has little chance of persuading Mr. Monti's 19 fellow commissioners on the EU's executive body to overrule his decision when they are asked to rule against Microsoft.

BRUSSELS -  Microsoft Corp. faces a  fine of 497-million ($818-million) the highest penalty imposed on a company by the European Union after EU member states backed the  European Commission's drive to punish the software giant for alleged  abuse of its Windows monopoly.

The fine will be in addition to "remedies" proposed by Mario Monti,  competition commissioner. National competition authorities yesterday supported the Commission's call to make  Microsoft pay a record fine.

TD
Until now, the record for the biggest  fine in EU competition issues was the 462-million imposed on
Hoffmann-La Roche for its part in a vitamins cartel.
The fine could still be revised by the 20 European commissioners when they meet tomorrow. The Brussels body will also call for  Microsoft to put concrete remedies into effect to correct its
alleged abuses of EU law.

The company, which will appeal, maintains that a  fine is inappropriate since, as the case sets a precedent,  Microsoft could not have known it was breaking EU  competition law.

Microsoft worries that the proposed "remedies" could cause irreparable harm to its business.

Mr. Monti wants the company to share more information with its rivals in the market for computer servers and offer computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Media Player program.

The company argues that its rivals seek to lay claim to its intellectual property, so taking advantage of years of its research and development, and that Windows may not be able to function properly without Media Player.

The Commission's decision to proceed with the remedies and  fine follows the breakdown of talks with Microsoft last week.

Still,  Microsoft will win one thing after it loses a landmark EU  antitrust case -- time. Months and possibly years may expire before it must do what the European Union executive orders, experts say
"There are enormous possibilities open to  Microsoft to buy time," said David Wood, an  antitrust
lawyer for Howrey Simon.

The company will appeal the Commission ruling and ask the Court of First Instance to suspend remedies until the underlying case is decided. Until the court decides that first question the remedies are suspended.

"If they lose the application to suspend they can appeal that to the European Court of Justice. During that period -- the better part of a year -- it is likely the substantive case will be put on the back
burner," Mr. Wood said.
The court case itself could take two or three years and an appeal will take an equal amount of time. The worst case for  Microsoft is that the remedies would begin to bite once an appeals court ruled
they may not be suspended, which could take seven months or more.

HD         Microsoft's full Monti: Consumers, competition and economic growth  will suffer because the EU
refused to accept the U.S. model for antitrust challenges to Microsoft

Last week, negotiations broke down between  Microsoft and European Commission antitrust regulators -- led by competition czar Mario Monti -- to settle the European antitrust case. This week, it is all but certain the commission will declare Microsoft in violation of competition laws, fine the company and impose enormous restrictions on how Microsoft does business. At the heart of the ruling, the commission is essentially telling  Microsoft any further improvement of its flagship Windows operating system is illegal.

TD
Simply put, this ruling is bad for technology, bad for the competitive marketplace, bad for European-U.S. relations and bad for consumers. While there have been signs pointing to this impasse, the EU has now made it very clear that it will put the interests of  Microsoft's competitors above the interests of consumers, competition and economic growth. Does this also mean that a major producer like Nokia cannot add new features to its cellphones if a competitor complains? Can we see our way out of this quagmire?

The European  antitrust case against Microsoft runs parallel to the U.S. case in many regards, though there are crucial differences. Both cases primarily involve U.S.-based companies --  Microsoft and Netscape (now part of Time Warner's AOL division) in the U.S. case;  Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks in the European case. Both examined how  Microsoft shared its software code with rivals and how Microsoft integrated new functions into Windows.

In spite of these similarities, there is one striking difference between the two cases: The U.S. case is over. Since November, 2001,  Microsoft has been operating under a series of sanctions outlined in a settlement reached with the U.S. Department of Justice and several states. In November, 2002, that settlement earned the approval of the U.S. District Court, which continues to oversee compliance. Earlier this year, the supervising federal judge said the settlement was working "as envisioned."

In most respects, the U.S.-approved sanctions address the  European Commission's concerns. Microsoft has been placed under stringent requirements to share and license software code and other technical information so that other companies' products can better "interoperate" with Windows. (Never mind that thousands of programs worked just  fine with Windows before the case.) The agreement also forced Microsoft to modify Windows so that access to certain functions can be hidden and replaced with rival products. For instance, manufacturers and computer end-users can hide  Microsoft's Web browsing tool (Internet Explorer) or music/video tool (Windows Media Player) and instead use competing products such as Netscape Communicator or RealNetworks' RealPlayer.

As these settlement terms suggest,  Microsoft made large concessions to bring the U.S. case to a close. The company has altered how it develops, markets and licenses its products. At the same time, Microsoft has not been prevented from competing or improving the Windows operating system.


Page 189 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Consumers can continue to benefit from  Microsoft's innovations, and rival software companies must continue to compete to win customers. Ideally, the U.S. settlement should be a model for a global resolution to  antitrust challenges to Microsoft.

But now the company essentially faces double jeopardy in Europe. In fact, one trade group made up of Microsoft's fiercest rivals -- the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) -- has advocated harsher penalties on both sides of the Atlantic. In other words, rather than compete in the marketplace, other companies have shopped their complaints to different jurisdictions to see where they could take the biggest bite out of  Microsoft. The European Commission has become a de facto court of appeals for parties dissatisfied with the decision reached in the United States. The commission listened to  Microsoft's rivals, but it is clear they did not fully consider how their effort to manage competitive markets will affect consumers.

The ruling by the commission's  competition regulators would have greater credibility if Europe-based companies had a central stake in the dispute.

But the case is largely an American affair, which is all the more reason for the ruling of the U.S. courts to take precedence. In addition, the United States and the EU have in place an agreement that codifies the age-old diplomatic principle of "comity" between nations when it comes to enforcing  antitrust.
Under this principle, the commission should defer to the U.S. decision to avoid conflict.

While Microsoft agreed to a tough settlement at home, in Europe the company has wisely decided that enough is enough. Instead of agreeing to a settlement that would undermine the U.S. settlement and impinge on the company's fundamental ability to operate,  Microsoft will likely appeal the commission's ruling to Europe's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Microsoft has a good chance to succeed with the Court of First Instance, which has struck down several other recent rulings from commissioner Monti's office. An appeal also serves notice that companies cannot easily disrupt the competitive marketplace just by invoking the wrath of EU regulators.

Unfortunately -- for consumers, the global economy, and the tech sector -- the next ruling in the case could be another three years off.

In spite of the global move toward more open trade policies, contradictory  antitrust regulations are creating roadblocks -- and adding expenses -- for international companies. In May, the makeup of the European Commission will change when 10 new nations are admitted to the EU. Primarily former Soviet bloc countries, these new members strongly support free markets, a lesson learned from decades of suffering under command economies.

With a new commission in place -- and a new  competition commissioner taking office in the fall -- the United States should seek ways to find common ground with Europe on  antitrust. Without systemic change, history will repeat itself: Another U.S.-based company will be stymied in Europe; another U.S. court decision will be effectively trumped by EU regulators; and mercenary companies will continue to seek competitive advantages in the political arena -- all at the expense of consumers.

Microsoft faces a fine of Euros 497m (Pounds 334m) - the highest penalty imposed on a company by the European Union - after EU member states backed the  European Commission's drive to punish the software giant for alleged  abuse of its Windows monoply.

The fine will be in addition to "remedies" proposed by Mario Monti,  competition commissioner. National competition authorities yesterday supported the commission's call to make  Microsoft pay a record fine.

The record for the biggest  fine for an individual company in EU competition history was the Euros
462m imposed on Hoffmann-La Roche for its part in a vitamins cartel. The Microsoft fine could still be
revised by the 20 European Commissioners when they meet tomorrow.

Some people said the  fine had been doubled to take account of the company's global operations - including those in the US.

Horacio Gutierrez, chief European legal counsel for  Microsoft, which will appeal, said: "We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's US operations when those operations are already regulated by the US government."
The company maintains that a  fine is inappropriate since, as the case sets a precedent,  Microsoft
could not have known it was breaking EU  competition law.

Many following the case argue that the  fine will have less practical effect on the company than the remedies. Microsoft fears the the proposed "remedies" could irreparably harm its business.

Mr Monti wants the company to share more information with its rivals in the market for computer servers and offer computer manufacturers a version of Windows without its Media Player program.

The company argues that its rivals seek to lay claim to its intellectual property, so taking advantage of years of its research and development, and that Windows may not be able to function properly without Media Player.

ATTENTION - ADDS quotes from draft commission judgement ///

European Union regulators were expected Wednesday to impose a record  fine of nearly half a billion euros on US software giant  Microsoft for illegally squelching competitors.

TD
The EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, was set to go dramatically further than his US
anti-trust counterparts in punishing Bill Gates' titan at the end of a five-year investigation.

The Italian commissioner this week won the backing of EU member states to  fine Microsoft 497 million euros (613 million dollars) for breaking EU anti-trust law, sources said.

Monti, provided his proposals are endorsed by the rest of the commission, was also set to order the company to detach its multimedia program Media Player from Windows to ensure fair  competition for rival products.
The commissioner was to announce his verdict at a press conference scheduled for around 1115 GMT. The unprecedented size of the financial penalty might not hurt  Microsoft, which has cash reserves of
some 53 billion dollars.

But enforced changes in Europe to its Windows operating system, which powers nine out of 10 of all personal computers, will.

The Seattle-based company, denying that it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors, has already vowed to appeal the verdict at the European Court of Justice.
After largely settling its anti-trust problems at home through a hotly disputed deal with the US Justice
Department,  Microsoft sees no reason why it should undergo a drastic product overhaul in Europe.

Being forced to unbundle Media Player would be the thin end of the wedge for a company that has placed an all-in-one suite of applications at the heart of its hugely successful business strategy.

To date, the biggest  fine levied by the commission on a company for breaking EU  competition rules was a 462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001, for orchestrating a vitamins cartel.

And the  Microsoft penalty will dwarf the previous biggest  fine for abuse of dominant market position - 75 million euros - levied in 1991 against Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak.

Monti was also expected to direct  Microsoft to share programming code to enable rivals to make software that can work with its low-end servers.
These enable computers to hook up to a network and are a key battleground in the IT industry.

In the United States,  Microsoft was accused of similarly unfair practices notably in bundling its Internet browser program with Windows.


Page 193 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But after a four-year anti-trust probe, the US Justice Department reached a hotly contested deal with
Microsoft in 2001 that forced the firm to share some technical data with rivals but stopped short of  fines.

The agreement was upheld by a US judge a year later, leaving competitors to transfer their hopes for redress to the  European Commission's own investigation.

According to a draft of the commission decision cited by the Financial Times newspaper,  Microsoft will be given 120 days to reveal the information needed by companies involved in "developing and distributing" rival server products.

Microsoft would also have to offer a version of Windows without Media Player within 90 days, though the decision notes that  Microsoft is still allowed to include Media Player in a separate version.

The European Commission accuses US software giant  Microsoft of abusing its market dominance by squelching competitors to its Windows Media Player and to its low-end servers.

Herewith details of the EU executive's case against  Microsoft, along with its proposed remedies, to be unveiled later Wednesday by  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

TD
The company is also expected to be  fined 497 million euros (613 million dollars), EU sources say, the highest amount ever levied by the commission in an anti-trust case.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the commission's verdict, and to ask the European Court of Justice to suspend the fine and remedies.
MEDIA PLAYER

Microsoft pre-installs Media Player on personal computers (PCs) using the Windows operating system - nine out of 10 of all PCs in use - which the EC says unfairly hinders rival programs such as RealPlayer and Apple QuickTime.

The EC last year surveyed about 50 corporate users of the Media Player, which allows music and video to be played on a Windows PC. The respondents were typically contents owners and providers.

The replies of the respondents "highlighted that the ubiquity of Windows Media Player on PCs artificially skews their development incentives in favour of  Microsoft", the Commission said.

"This confirms the Commission's preliminary conclusion that  Microsoft's tying of Windows Media Player to the Windows operating system weakens  competition... stifles product innovation, and ultimately reduces consumer choice."
SERVERS

In its survey last year, the EC also sought responses from more than 100 companies across Europe that use Microsoft's low-end servers, which allow the firms to connect their staff's PCs to a corporate network.

The key issue here is "interoperability". The Commission says that Windows cannot "talk" to low-end servers made by competitors because  Microsoft refuses to reveal programming code to its rivals.

"An overwhelming majority of customers responding to this market enquiry highlighted that Microsoft's non-disclosure of interface information... did indeed artificially alter their choice in favour of Microsoft's server products," the  European Commission said.
"This behaviour is detrimental to  competition on the merits." PROPOSED REMEDIES
MEDIA PLAYER

The Commission has proposed two alternatives to head off its complaints about the music and video program.

Page 195 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The first and more likely would be for  Microsoft to offer a version of Windows in Europe without Media
Player ("untying"), which Brussels has said is "the normal remedy for a tying infringement".
The second would be a "must-carry" provision, obliging  Microsoft to offer competing media players with
Windows.
SERVERS

Microsoft must give its competitors in the low-end server market the necessary programming
("interface") information to enable them to make their products work with Windows PCs.

This would enable rival vendors of low-end servers "to compete on a level playing-field with  Microsoft", Brussels says.

EU regulators Wednesday  fined Microsoft a record 497 million euros (611 million dollars) and ordered it to offer a European version of its Windows operating system without the Media Player program.

At the end of a five-year investigation by the  European Commission, Microsoft was also ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data to enable rival companies to offer low-end servers that can work with Windows.

The world's biggest software giant was given 90 days to detach the popular Media Player from Windows in European markets, and 120 days to provide the server data.

The financial penalty was the highest ever levied by the EU executive against a company for abusing its market dominance.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the sanctions laid down a clear marker for the future conduct of the US titan, which escaped  fines in a US anti-trust investigation.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does nor harm consumers and innovation," he said in a statement.

"Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position."

Microsoft fined half a billion euros in landmark EU ruling
by Jitendra Joshi

TD
= (GRAPHIC)
ATTENTION - UPDATES with verdict ///

European regulators Wednesday went dramatically further than their US counterparts by imposing a record fine of 497 million euros and product changes on US software giant  Microsoft for stifling competitors.

The European Union's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, announced at the end of a five-year investigation that he was fining the world's biggest software company for abusing its dominant market position.
The Italian commissioner also ordered Bill Gates' titan to offer a European version of its all-conquering
Windows operating system without the Media Player program within 90 days.

And Microsoft was ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data to enable rival companies to offer low-end servers that can work with Windows within 120 days.
The financial penalty of 497 million euros (611 million dollars) is the highest ever levied by the EU
executive against a company.

The Seattle-based company, denying that it abuses its overwhelming dominance to illegally crush competitors, has already vowed to appeal the verdict at the European Court of Justice.
Monti said the sanctions laid down a clear marker for the future conduct of  Microsoft, which escaped
fines in a US anti-trust investigation.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does nor harm consumers and innovation," he said in a statement.

"Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position."

The unprecedented size of the financial penalty might not hurt  Microsoft, which has cash reserves of some 53 billion dollars.

But enforced changes in Europe to its Windows operating system, which powers nine out of 10 of all personal computers, will.
After largely settling its anti-trust problems at home through a hotly disputed deal with the US Justice
Department,  Microsoft sees no reason why it should undergo a drastic product overhaul in Europe.

Being forced to unbundle Media Player would be the thin end of the wedge for a company that has placed an all-in-one suite of applications at the heart of its hugely successful business strategy.

Page 198 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
To date, the biggest  fine levied by the commission on a company for breaking EU  competition rules was a 462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001, for orchestrating a vitamins cartel.

And the  Microsoft penalty will dwarf the previous biggest  fine for abuse of dominant market position - 75 million euros - levied in 1991 against Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak.

In the United States,  Microsoft was accused of similarly unfair practices notably in bundling its Internet browser program with Windows.
But after a four-year anti-trust probe, the US Justice Department reached a hotly contested deal with
Microsoft in 2001 that forced the firm to share some technical data with rivals but stopped short of  fines.

The agreement was upheld by a US judge a year later, leaving competitors to transfer their hopes for redress to the  European Commission's own investigation.

ATTENTION - RECASTS, UPDATES with  Microsoft to appeal, reax ///

TD
European Union regulators Wednesday slapped a record  fine of half a billion euros on  Microsoft in a landmark anti-trust ruling that labelled the US software giant a predatory monopolist.

The EU sanctions, which also include potentially far-reaching changes to the Windows operating system, went dramatically further than a hotly contested settlement reached by US anti-trust authorities with Bill Gates' titan.

Microsoft, labelling the verdict a "setback for our entire industry", said it would appeal to the European
Court of Justice, and seek to have the sanctions suspended in the meantime.

The EU's  competition commissioner, Mario Monti, announced at the end of a five-year investigation that he was fining the world's biggest software company 497 million euros (611 million dollars).
The Italian commissioner also ordered  Microsoft to offer a European version of its all-conquering
Windows operating system without the Media Player program within 90 days.

And the Seattle-based company was ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data within 120 days to enable rival companies to offer servers that can work with Windows.

"The commission has taken a decision today which finds that  Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," Monti told a news conference.

In advance of the protracted legal battle at the EU's top court, he added: "We are not expropriating Microsoft's intellectual property... We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Microsoft's senior vice president and head lawyer, Brad Smith, hit back by arguing that the commission's verdict was "unwarranted and ill-considered".

The requirement to offer a stripped-down version of Windows in Europe that excludes Media Player could play havoc with the operating system and popular websites that rely on the player, he warned.

"Today's decision is a setback not only for  Microsoft but ultimately for our entire industry and especially for consumers," Smith told reporters in Brussels via a conference call.

"It will freeze technology, hobble the operating system and provide users with less value for their euro, rather than more."

The unprecedented size of the EU's financial penalty might not hurt  Microsoft, which has cash reserves of some 53 billion dollars.

But enforced changes in Europe to its Windows operating system, which currently powers nine out of 10 of all personal computers, will.

After largely settling its anti-trust problems at home through the 2001 deal with the US Justice
Department,  Microsoft sees no reason why it should undergo a drastic product overhaul in Europe.

Being forced to unbundle Media Player would be the thin end of the wedge for a company that has placed an all-in-one suite of applications at the heart of its hugely successful business strategy.

But critics argue that  Microsoft has ridden on the back of other companies that first developed software such as media players, then hijacked the technology by incorporating its own version into Windows.

In its verdict, the commission said this strategy "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take interest in and tie with Windows in the future".

It also found that  Microsoft refused to give Sun Microsystems and other companies vital data that would have enabled them to make servers for computer networks that could interface with Windows.
RealNetworks, which complained that its own media player could not compete with the bundled
Microsoft product, hailed the EU ruling.

"This decision is fundamentally significant because the  European Commission has formally declared that Microsoft's media player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, vice president and general counsel at RealNetworks.

Sun Microsystems said the EU's order for  Microsoft to reveal interface data for the servers, and to keep the disclosed information up-to-date, was "enormously significant".
The previous biggest  fine levied by the EU on a company for breaking  competition rules was a
462-million-euro penalty against the Swiss chemical firm Hoffman-Laroche in 2001, for orchestrating a
vitamins cartel.

The European Commission Wednesday found US software giant  Microsoft guilty of abusing its market dominance by squelching competitors to its Windows Media Player and to its low-end servers.

TD
The company was fined 497 million euros (611 million dollars), the highest amount ever levied by the commission against an individual company.
Herewith details of the EU executive's verdict against  Microsoft, along with product changes ordered by
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the commission's ruling, and to ask the European Court of Justice to suspend the fine and remedies.
WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER (WMP)

Microsoft pre-installs WMP on personal computers (PCs) using the Windows operating system - nine out of 10 of all PCs in use.

In a statement, the  European Commission said this gave Microsoft an illegal edge over rival programs such as RealPlayer and Apple QuickTime.

The ubiquity enjoyed by WMP "artificially reduces the incentives of music, film and other media companies, as well as software developers and content providers, to develop their offerings to competing media players", it said.

The commission added that  Microsoft's strategy of bundling applications like WMP into one Windows package caused it serious concern.

It said that "given  Microsoft's virtual monopoly in PC operating systems, (this bundling) deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take interest in and tie with Windows in the future".

The company was given 90 days to offer a version of Windows in Europe without the Media Player attached.
SERVERS

The commission found that  Microsoft refused to give Sun Microsystems and other companies vital data that would have enabled them to make low-end servers that could interface with Windows.

It said that "these non-disclosures by  Microsoft were part of a broader strategy designed to shut competitors out of the market" for the servers, which enable computers to hook up to a network.
The company was ordered to provide interface data for the servers within 120 days.

"This will enable rival vendors to develop products that can compete on a level playing field in the work group server operating system market," the commission said.


Page 202 of 206 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And the disclosed information will have to be updated each time  Microsoft markets new versions of its servers, the commission ruled.

If any of this interface information is protected by EU intellectual property law, "Microsoft would be entitled to reasonable remuneration", it added.

The disclosure order concerns the interface documentation only, and not  Microsoft's prized source code for Windows itself.

EU competition regulators Wednesday  fined US software giant  Microsoft a record 497 million euros (611 million dollars) and ordered changes to its Windows operating system after a five-year anti-trust probe.

TD
The world leader in software has already vowed to challenge the negative ruling. Here are the company's legal options:

- Microsoft can appeal the verdict in the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The appeal process would last at least two years although  Microsoft could ask for its case to be fast-tracked, which could in theory
halve the length of proceedings.

- In the meantime,  Microsoft can ask the EU's top court to suspend the  fine and product remedies, which concern its Media Player and low-end servers.

It would notably have to prove that the verdict's immediate application would cause "serious and irreparable damage".

The ECJ would be expected to rule within a few months. In 2003, the ECJ granted suspended sentences in just four cases out of 39, and in only one in 13 anti-trust cases.

- Once the ECJ reaches its verdict,  Microsoft and the European Commission will both have the possibility of appealing again.

ATTENTION - ADDS details, quotes ///

Microsoft's rivals lauded Wednesday's EU  antitrust decision, saying the record fine on the software giant and ordered changes to the Windows operating system in Europe will help competition.

TD
"This decision is fundamentally significant because the  European Commission has formally declared that Microsoft's media player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, vice president and general counsel at RealNetworks.

RealNetworks was a key firm in the EU case because it complained that Microsoft's "bundling" of its media software for audio and video within the Windows operating system was an abuse of the Microsoft monopoly position.

"This is the first legal review of Microsoft's media player bundling practice. While we have not yet seen the complete decision, we support the European Commission's efforts to provide European consumers with all the benefits of a competitive marketplace, including choice in digital media products," Kimball added.

"RealNetworks welcomes the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field, because when that is the case, consumers have the benefit of innovation, and products like our RealPlayer 10 win."

The EU ordered Bill Gates's firm to offer a European version of its all-conquering Windows operating system without the Media Player program within 90 days.

And Microsoft was ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data to enable rival companies to offer low-end servers that can work with Windows within 120 days.
Server hardware and software maker Sun Microsystems also hailed the EU decision.
"This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and
competition worldwide," said Lee Patch, Sun's vice president for legal affairs.

"The Commission's decision seeks to create a level playing field in the work group server marketplace, enabling competitors to deliver work group servers that can fully interoperate and therefore compete on the merits," Patch added. "This is enormously significant for consumers and for the industry."

Ed Black, of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group of  Microsoft rivals, said the EU decision is a "confirmation of  Microsoft's anti-competitive and illegal business tactics."

"This decision details the ways in which  Microsoft caused competitive harm, hurt innovation, and forced consumers to accept increased prices with less choice," Black said.

"The issues outlined today will prevent  Microsoft from controlling the platform for the delivery and subsequent control over digital content ... The decision prevents  Microsoft from "locking in" their media player and their proprietary format as the de facto standard, which would force developers and consumers alike to bow to whatever demands or taxes  Microsoft wishes to place on digital content."

Ken Wasch of the Software and Information Industry Association said the EU "has taken historic steps to benefit consumers in Europe and make sure that developers of innovative applications and services can compete globally."
