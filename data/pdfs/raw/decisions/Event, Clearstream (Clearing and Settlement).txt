HD         EC: Level the Playing Field

In its long-awaited strategy document on European clearance and settlement, the  European                 Commission last week appeared to side with a group of European central banks and securities regulators in recommending broad regulations based on a "functional approach" to post-trade processing.

While much of the white paper centers on the removal of legal and regulatory restrictions that have raised cross-border settlement costs in Europe to multiples of domestic , it also suggests that providers of clearance and settlement services be treated equally regardless of the type of institution-a stance promoted by international depository Euroclear and the joint group of the European System of Central Banks and the Committee of European Securities Regulators, among others.

TD
The ESCB-CESR committee is set to come out with its own recommendations for what it calls "systemically important providers" of clearance and settlement services-local custodian banks, national and international depositories-which the EC could adopt in the final version of its consultative document. Industry comments are due by July 31.

Unlike the ESCB-CESR group, the EC fell short of defining "systemically important" enitities or specifying any guidelines they should follow but, akin to ESCB-CESR, appears to have rejected proposals made by a group of local agent banks led by BNP Paribas Securities Services and Citigroup known as Fair and Clear. Concerned about growing competition in cross-border equities settlement from international depositories-particularly Euroclear-the group had lobbied the ESCB-CESR and other regulators for only national and international depositories to fall under any new oversight. It even went as far as to urge European regulators to require Euroclear Bank in Brussels to separate its clearance and settlement services from its banking services, but the EC's consultative document doesn't back up that stance.

Since the EC doesn't have rulemaking authority, its recommendations could take years to come to fruition. Not only must the EC review industry opinion, but the European Parliament in conjunction with the Council of Ministers-one from each EU country-must then draft and vote on any legislation. Elections for new EP officials set for the fall could easily throw a monkey wrench into the rulemaking agenda.

Yet, at the very least, market players say, Europe is now seeing a hint of progress toward creating a single framework to replace a badly fragmented market.

In its 33-page document, the EC said it wouldn't take sides in the longstanding heated debate over whether clearance and settlement systems should be user-owned-as in the case of Euroclear-or exchange owned, as in the case of Germany's  Clearstream  Banking Frankfurt. However, it reiterated calls made by the ESCB-CESR and others that, regardless of ownership structure, market players should have "freedom of choice" in selecting where they clear and settle their trades, and that clearance and settlement providers should allow open access to their systems. In so doing, it appeared to be
taking a stab at exchanges such as the  Deutsche Boerse and Borsa Italiana, which have required that post-trade processing of exchange-traded securities be handled only at their subsidiary depositories.

The German exchange recently agreed to ease its policy to allow entities other than  Clearstream  to settle Deutsche Boerse-traded transactions, but they would still have to meet stringent requirements which critics say would be cost-prohibitive. The EC previously accused  Clearstream  Banking Frankfurt

of abusing  its "dominant" position in Germany to prevent Euroclear Bank from gaining access to its Cascade settlement system for some registered German shares, and then charging "discriminatory prices" once it allowed entry.

BRUSSELS, June 2 (Reuters) - Clearstream  Banking, owned by  Deutsche Boerse, will escape a fine from the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against rivals in its settlement business, the Commission decided on Wednesday.

"The European Commission finds that Clearstream  Banking AG and its parent company Clearstream  International SA infringed competition rules by refusing to supply cross-border securities clearing  and settlement services and by applying discriminatory prices," the European Union executive said in a statement.

TD
"The Commission's investigation revealed that  Clearstream  refused to supply Euroclear Bank SA with certain clearing  and settlement services and applied discriminatory prices to the detriment of this customer," it said, adding:
"The Commission decided not to impose a fine."

The Clearstream  antitrust probe was part of a Commission investigation to open up competition in the clearing  and settlement business, lowering the price of trading shares across the EU.
Reuters already reported in March that  Clearstream  would escape a fine.

The Commission has said that  clearing  and settling securities across borders hampers the EU's capital market because it is more costly and inefficient than when done domestically.

The Commission investigated  Clearstream  for more than a year for  refusing to supply some settlement services, by which securities market transactions are completed, and setting higher prices for rivals.

Under German federal law,  Clearstream  Banking is the only firm recognised for settling German share deals, a position the Commission said opened the possibility of discrimination against rivals such as Belgium-based Euroclear.

Deutsche Boerse announced this year that German shares no longer had to be settled through its in-house Clearstream  unit, thus heading off possible EU action.

LONDON/BRUSSELS, June 2 (Reuters) - Clearstream  Banking, owned by Deutsche Boerse, will escape a fine from the European Commission despite allegedly discriminating against rivals in its settlement business, the Commission decided on Wednesday.

"The European Commission finds that Clearstream  Banking AG and its parent company Clearstream  International SA infringed competition rules by refusing to supply cross-border securities clearing  and settlement services and by applying discriminatory prices," the European Union executive said in a statement.

TD
"The Commission's investigation revealed that  Clearstream  refused to supply Euroclear Bank SA with certain clearing  and settlement services and applied discriminatory prices to the detriment of this customer," it said, adding: "The Commission decided not to impose a fine."

ANTITRUST

The Clearstream  antitrust probe was part of a Commission investigation to open up competition in the clearing  and settlement business, lowering the price of trading shares across the EU.

All infringements have ceased, the Commission said, adding that Wednesday's decision will clarify the legal situation at a time when cross border trade in securities is becoming more important in the EU.

"We welcome the decision not to impose a fine on  Clearstream,"  a Deutsche Boerse spokesman said. The spokesman said they wanted to see the ruling in full before commenting. Clearstream  is a key moneyspinner for Deutsche Boerse.
Euroclear said it was not surprised by the ruling.

"It was not entirely unexpected. We were asked to give evidence and provide information to the Commission and have always long believed there was an irregular application of the rules in regard to the German market." a Euroclear spokesman said.
HAMPERING EFFICIENCY

The Commission has said that  clearing  and settling securities across borders hampers the EU's capital market because it is more costly and inefficient than when done domestically.
The Commission probed  Clearstream  and the sector generally for over a year.

Under German federal law,  Clearstream  Banking is the only firm recognised for settling German share deals, a position the Commission said opened the possibility of discrimination against rivals such as Belgium-based Euroclear.

Deutsche Boerse announced this year that German shares no longer had to be settled through its in-house Clearstream  unit, thus heading off possible EU action, though making little difference in practice.

"New entry into this activity is unrealistic for the forseeable future. Therefore,  Clearstream  Banking AG
is an unavoidable trading partner," the Commission said.
NO MONTI MODEL

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti stressed that Wednesday's ruling was not a comment on how Europe's  clearing  and settlement industry should be organised.

"Today's decision does not favour one particular model, it is not directed against  Deutsche Boerse's business model or any other," Monti said in a statement.

Deutsche Boerse is vertically integrated, creating a one-stop trading to  clearing  and settlement group.

Market participants such as the London Stock Exchange have been vocal critics of this model, arguing for a horizontal set up whereby settlement and  clearing  systems are at arm's length to bourses to ensure equal access for all users.

The Commission said it did not impose a fine on Deutsche Boerse as it took into account there was no Community law or jurisprudence dealing with clearing  and settlement, and in light of the
wide-ranging debate in the industry.

The European Commission is expected to propose a new directive on  clearing  and settlement that would emphasise the use of competition powers to ensure that  clearing  and settlement houses can be used by all market participants.

European Union regulators found  Deutsche Boerse's Clearstream  trade-processing unit guilty of antitrust abuses in the securities industry but didn't impose a fine.The European Commission said Clearstream  'infringed  competition rules by refusing to supply cross-border securities clearing  and settlement services by applying discriminatory prices.'

While Clearstream  was found to have broken  antitrust rules, the commission did not impose a fine because there was no EU case law or jurisprudence regarding  clearing  and settlement.

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators found  Deutsche Boerse AG's  Clearstream  unit guilty of
antitrust abuses in the securities industry but didn't impose a fine.

The European Commission said Clearstream  "infringed  competition rules by refusing to supply cross-border securities clearing  and settlement services by applying discriminatory prices."

TD
While Clearstream  was found to have broken  antitrust rules, the commission didn't impose a fine because there was no EU case law or jurisprudence regarding  clearing  and settlement.

The commission brought formal charges against  Clearstream  in April 2003. It was the commission's first attempt at stamping out discriminatory behavior in the sector. Regulators accused  Clearstream of denying its rival Euroclear access to its German securities-settlement platform, and for overcharging Euroclear.

"Access was denied for over two years and this is too long," said EU spokesman Tilman Lueder. He added there was no evidence that  Clearstream  faced similar restrictions from other operators, which the company had argued as part of its defense.

Clearstream  already had ceased the practices in question. Even so, the case was important to EU regulators, who want to make settling trades across borders less costly and promote a unified European capital market. The commission's finding could help the EU impose tougher sanctions in future cases where settlement houses break  antitrust rules.

Clearstream  welcomed the decision not to impose a fine, but in a statement it said it "consistently rejected the accusations on which the proceedings were based and emphasized that these related to the past."

Settlement is the process of transferring ownership rights from the seller of a stock or bond to the buyer. As long as both are in the same country, the process remains relatively simple. But with cross-border trade, the process can be unwieldy and expensive because many European stock exchanges, such as Germany's, own their own settlement houses.

Since the euro started circulating at the start of 2002, EU regulators have targeted  clearing  and settlement as part of their efforts to create a seamless internal market across Europe. In May 2002, the commission opened a sectorwide  antitrust inquiry to investigate access and pricing, focusing its efforts on  Clearstream.

Earlier this year, the commission released a long-awaited policy document on the issue, saying every provider of clearing  and settlement services should have access to every other national market -- but left undecided how to implement this.

HD         Commission Rips Clearstream  Frankfurt

The European Commission (EC)'s widely expected decision to publicly condemn but not fine Clearstream  Banking Frankfurt (CBF) for  anticompetitive tactics against Euroclear Bank in the German market may have both sides claiming victory, but more importantly proves the EC's conviction to ban anticompetitive practices within Europe's post-trade processing industry.

In the first-of-its-kind move, the EC last week found CBF guilty of  abusing  its position as a "dominant provider" of settlement services in Germany by  refusing Euroclear Bank access, for more than two years, to its Cascade RS settlement platform for some registered German shares. Even after Euroclear Bank was granted a link to Cascade RS in November 2001, it was charged with "discriminatory pricing" by CBF-fees far higher than those of other depository systems, the EC contended.

TD
Clearstream's  action to block Euroclear meant that participants of Euroclear Bank could not settle their trades in registered German equities directly on the books of Euroclear Bank and had to go to CBF or rely on intermediary agent banks, which meant higher settlement costs.

Euroclear last week confirmed that CBF reduced its fees in January 2002, but it would not say by how much or whether it was the percentage requested. Euroclear officials said they were not surprised with the EC's ruling, but remained adamant that  Clearstream's  fees to link to the Cascade platform "remained too high."

Last week,  Clearstream  continued to deny any wrongdoing-a stance officials claim is bolstered by the fact that the EC's decision, albeit embarrassing to CBF, is essentially a slap on the wrist. A fine could have easily amounted to tens of millions of euros. "Clearstream  welcomes the decision of the European Commission's antitrust authorities not to impose a fine on the company.  Clearstream  has consistently rejected the accusations on which the proceedings were based and emphasized that these related to the past," said a statement issued by the  Deutsche Boerse, CBF's parent. But in a separate statement announcing its decision, the EC explained that it could not fine CBF because there was no precedent within European Community case law.

Operations officials at several European financial institutions told Securities Industry News that Clearstream  has claimed Euroclear was never denied access to the Cascade platform for registered shares, but requested a more advanced technological means of linking than other depositories that required infrastructure work by CBF and Euroclear. Hence, the link was merely "delayed" until November 2001.

The change in CBF's position on Euroclear Bank's request came eight months after the EC began its review of Europe's  clearing  and settlement business. Euroclear and Deutsche Borse officials declined to provide details on the Euroclear link with Cascade RS.

How far the EC's decision will go in changing  Clearstream's  market practice remains to be seen. The Clearstream  problem, as defined by the EC, has put EU depositories on notice that its  antitrust laws cannot be violated; settlement houses cannot abuse their dominant market positions to refuse access to other depositories and cannot charge "discriminatory prices."

In its ruling, the EC noted that since its discovery of the problem between CBF and Euroclear two years ago, a number of industry initiatives-including the Giovannini Report and standards set by the European System of Central Banks and the Committee of European Securities Regulators-have gone even further

in mandating open access between EU market infrastructure providers to create a level playing field in
Europe.

It's uncertain what the EC will finally decide in its own clearance and settlement directive-which could eventually translate into EU law; recent communiques indicate it is following ESCB-CESR's path.

In a conciliatory move to the EC, the Deutsche Borse has expanded the roster of entities that can settle German exchange-traded securities beyond CBF to any entity fulfilling the standards set for a Wertpapiersammelsbanken, although some say the criteria, set under German law, are too stringent and cost-prohibitive for anyone other than CBF to comply with.
