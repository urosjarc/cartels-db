BRUSSELS, Feb 25, Reuter - The  European Commission will fine Irish state airline Aer Lingus  on Wednesday for trying to kill a challenge by BBW Partnership Ltd subsidiary British Midland Airways against its virtual monopoly of flights between Dublin and London's Heathrow airport, Commission sources said.

It would be the first time an airline has been  fined for refusing to make its tickets interchangeable with those issued by another carrier on the same route, a standard but voluntary practice in the aviation industry, the sources told Reuters.

TD
Aer Lingus's  refusal to cooperate is considered a violation of the EC founding treaty's fair competition rules, they added.
The Commission will also order  Aer Lingus  to enable passengers with standard tickets to switch from
Aer Lingus  to British Midland, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.

Aer Lingus  terminated decades of cooperation with  British Midland in 1989 when the private British airline announced it was launching a regular service between Heathrow and Dublin.

British Airways, the only other competitor, pulled out of the Heathrow-Dublin route last year, leaving its smaller British rival to battle for a share of a fast-growing market which has long been dominated by  Aer Lingus.

Termination of so-called interlining by the Irish airline meant passengers were denied the flexibility they normally get on other routes with other carriers when they pay business class or standard fares, the sources said.

They declined to say how much the  fine would be but said the Commission, which can impose  fines of up to ten pct of sales for competition law infringements, would be lenient with  Aer Lingus.
"It's a case that sets a precedent and  fines are generally lower in such circumstances," said one official. Barring a last minute hitch, the  fine will be announced after a Commission meeting on Wednesday.

BRUSSELS, Feb 25, Reuter - The European Commission will fine Irish state airline  Aer Lingus  on Wednesday for trying to kill a challenge by British Midland Airways to its virtual monopoly of flights between Dublin and London, Commission sources said.

It will be the first time an airline has been  fined for refusing to make its tickets interchangeable with those issued by another carrier on the same route, a standard but voluntary practice in the aviation industry, the sources told Reuters.

TD
Aer Lingus  dominated the route and its refusal to cooperate with a new entrant in the market was considered a violation of EC Treaty competition rules (Article 86), they added.

The Commission will also order Aer Lingus  to change its ways so that passengers with standard tickets can use them to switch from Aer Lingus  to British Midland on either leg of the flight, said the sources.

They declined to say how much the  fine would be but said the Commission would be lenient. EC rules allow for fines worth up to 10 per cent of firms' annual sales revenue but such a high  fine has not even been imposed in more serious cases.

"It's a case that sets a precedent and  fines are generally lower in such circumstances," said one official.
Barring a last minute hitch, the  fine will be announced after the Commission's weekly meeting on
Wednesday.

The sources said there were no serious objections within the Commission to the decision Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan has proposed against  Aer Lingus  after more than a year of investigations.

Aer Lingus  terminated decades of cooperation with  British Midland in 1989 when the private British airline announced it was starting regular flights between London and Dublin.
British Airways, the only other competitor, abandoned the route last year.

Termination of so-called interlining by the Irish airline meant passengers were denied the flexibility they normally get on other routes with other carriers when they pay business class or standard fares, the sources said.

British Midland, now Britain's second biggest scheduled airline, made a pre-tax profit of 2.5 million pounds in 1991 compared with a loss of 11.9 million pounds in 1990.
It said this week it was launching a new London-Heathrow to Brussels service to compete directly with
British Airways and Belgian flag carrier Sabena SA.

A FINE on Aer Lingus,  the Irish national carrier, for refusing to grant reciprocal ticketing rights to  British
Midland, the UK airline, is to be announced by the  European Commission today.

The Brussels competition directorate believes  Aer Lingus's  move to scrap a long-standing 'inter-lining' agreement with  British Midland in 1989 - just when the latter started flying to Dublin - constituted an illegal abuse of the Irish carrier's dominant position on the London-Dublin route. Inter-lining agreements allow travel agents to issue passengers with a single ticket permitting them to change airlines on different legs of their journeys.

TD
Brussels favours such agreements because they give customers more flexibility and because they make it easier for airlines to pick up passengers on new routes, encouraging entry into the market.
Last year's withdrawal by British Airways from the London-Dublin route has helped both  Aer Lingus  and
British Midland since.

Inter-lining agreements are common between EC airlines, but not obligatory. However, according to the EC competition directorate, in reacting to direct route competition from  British Midland by scrapping the ticketing agreement it had had with the UK airline since 1964, the Irish carrier was abusing its dominant position in flights to and from the Irish capital.

In an earlier case involving Air Europe, the Commission defended the right of a smaller airline to an inter-lining arrangement with a bigger carrier.

BRUSSELS, Reuter - The European Commission fined Irish state airline  Aer Lingus  nearly a million dollars on Wednesday for trying to stop British Midland Airways from breaking its virtual monopoly on flights between London and Dublin.

It was the first time the Commission had  fined an airline for refusing to cooperate with a rival so that people with business class or other standard tickets could switch from one airline to another on a specific route.

TD
"This decision is evidence of the Commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions if they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition," European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in a statement.

British Midland has been Aer Lingus'  only rival on the London to Dublin route since British Airways stopped flying to Dublin for cost reasons last year.

Aer Lingus  had violated European Community rules on fair competition by terminating decades of cooperation with  British Midland when the private British airline started regular flights between London and Dublin in 1989, Commission officials said.

The Commission has sweeping powers to enforce EC law and could have fined Aer Lingus  up to 10 per cent of its annual sales revenue. A Commission spokesman said the fine was lenient because the case had set a precedent for the industry.

The Commission also ordered  Aer Lingus  to start a two-year "interlining" deal with  British Midland so that passengers could use either airline's tickets to fly with the other and allowing travel agents to sell tickets which could be interchanged.

Interlining is a standard but generally voluntary practice in the airline industry and it was not clear until now that the Commission would interpret refusal to interline as an anti-trust offence in certain cases.

The Commission said two years of cooperation would be long enough for  British Midland to establish itself on the fast- growing Dublin route and that  Aer Lingus  would not be obliged to keep up an interlining deal thereafter.

British Midland, the second biggest U.K. airline offering scheduled services, announced earlier this week it was starting regular flights to compete with British Airways and Belgium's Sabena between London and Brussels, one of the busiest business routes in Europe.

BRUSSELS, Reuter - Irish state airline  Aer Lingus  has been fined 750,000 European currency units ($938,200) for abusing its dominant position on flights between London and Dublin, the  European        Commission said on Wednesday.

The Commission, the European Community's executive, said the fine had been imposed because Aer Lingus  had refused to enter a ticket-swap agreement with British Midland Airways for flights between the British and Irish capitals.

TD
Such deals, known as interlining, are a standard practice in the airline industry under which passengers can use a standard ticket to switch from one airline to another on either leg of a given route.

"This decision is evidence of the Commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions, if they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition," said a statement from Sir Leon Brittan, the Commissioner in charge of the Commission's competition policy.

The Commission told  Aer Lingus  it now had to sign a two-year interlining agreement with its British rival.

It was the first time the Commission  fined an airline for refusal to enter such an agreement. The Commission said in this case the refusal amounted to an abuse by  Aer Lingus  of its dominant position on the Dublin-London route and a violation of the EC Treaty's competition rules.

Aer Lingus  ended decades of cooperation with  British Midland in 1989 when the private British airline announced it was beginning regular flights between London and Dublin.
British Airways, the only other competitor, abandoned the route last year.

BRUSSELS, Feb 26, Reuter - The  European Commission said it had fined Irish state airline  Aer        Lingus  750,000 Ecus for abusing its dominant position by refusing to enter a ticket- interchange agreement with  British Midland Airways for flights between Dublin and London.

HD         International Company News: KLM and BA act on BFr2bn Sabena debt

BRITISH AIRWAYS and KLM, the Dutch airline, have started legal proceedings in the Belgian courts over BFr1bn (Dollars 29.4m) of debts owed to each of them by Sabena, the Belgian state-owned carrier.

The cash was due to be repayed at the end of 1991, since when talks between the three airlines over the timing of the cash transfer have run into the sand.

TD
'We were no longer able to get a real answer from Sabena, so we went to court,' said KLM yesterday. BA said the action was 'to protect its position', but that talks were nevertheless continuing.

KLM and BA said they and Sabena would appear before a judge in Brussels on March 5 for a preliminary hearing.

Sabena said it had not been formally notified about the BA/KLM action, but that BA and KLM had said they intended to lodge a legal complaint.

It blamed its failure to pay on delays to a separate tie-up with Air France. That deal, which would probably involve a cash injection of about BFr6bn, was frozen when the Belgian government collapsed last October.

It also argued that the deal included a clause imposing interest charges on the loan at 8 per cent from the beginning of 1992. However, KLM replied that an extension to the loan was only allowed if all three airlines agreed to it, while BA said it had not received any interest payments.

BA and KLM invested the money as a prelude to taking a 40 per cent stake between them in a new operation, Sabena World Airways, intended as a Brussels-based operation flying to 75 European cities. The plan was scrapped in December 1990 and the investment converted into a loan.
The European Commission confirmed yesterday it had imposed a  fine of Ecu750,000 (Dollars
604,838) on Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, for refusing to grant reciprocal ticketing rights to British         
Midland, the UK carrier. It said  Aer Lingus  had abused its dominance of the London-Dublin route.

HD   COMPETITION - COMMISSION FINES AER LINGUS FOR WITHDRAWING BRITISH MIDLAND'S INTERLINING RIGHTS.

BRUSSELS, 26/02/1992 (AGENCE EUROPE) - At the conclusion of its investigation into a complaint lodged by British Midland, the European Commission has decided that Aer Lingus  has abused its dominant position, in breach of Article 86 of the EEC Treaty, and has fined the airline 750,000 Ecus. The Commission accuses this company, which is the dominant airline on the London-Dublin route, of terminating its interlining agreement with  British Midland after:
(a) the latter announced its plans in 1989 to compete with  Aer Lingus  on the same route;

TD
(b) a rate concertation was reached between the two airlines, which eliminated an often decisive factor of competition. Given the process of liberalising air traffic, the Commission tolerates this type of concerted behaviour - generally banned under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty - but only when the parties also have contractual interlining arrangements. This type of commitment, used widely among parties to the IATA agreement, is aimed at offering passengers and operators (airlines and travel agencies) a certain facility for routes, timetables, ticket delivery, etc. with a minimum of constraints.

In the present case, the Commission has decided that the action taken by  Aer Lingus  has had a negative impact on its competitor's ability to compete: its services became less attractive to travellers and travel agents, its operating costs rose and it was deprived of significant revenue. The Commission deemed these effects to be unwarranted and consequently decided to order  Aer Lingus  to resume its interlining relationship with  British Midland for two years - not counting the three years of operation of the
London-Dublin route - subject to review in the light of the development of competition on the relevant route. This period is necessary, the Commission explains, to allow new entrants to develop their own frequencies and services.

Following this decision, Sir Leon Brittan commented: "This decision is evidence of the Commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions if they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition. At a time when the European air transport industry is being liberalised, airlines making use of the new opportunities for competition should be given a fair chance to develop and sustain their challenge to established carriers."

BRUSSELS (News Services) -- The European Community Commission  fined Aer Lingus  750,000
European currency units ($925,125) for abusing its dominant position on the London-Dublin route.

The EC Commission also ordered Ireland's national airline to resume its so-called interlining pact with British Midland, which allows British Midland ticketholders to change to  Aer Lingus  flights. In a statement, the Commission said Aer Lingus'  decision to end the interlining relationship "made it more difficult for the U.K. company to compete.

TD
"British Midland was deprived of significant revenue and forced to incur higher costs in order to overcome the handicap imposed on it," the Commission said.

Aer Lingus  said it was surprised by the Commission's ruling, and immediately attacked it. "Aer           Lingus finds it strange that the EC Commission, which has consistently advocated increasing competition in air transport, is now forcing Aer Lingus  to collaborate with a competitor," the Irish
airline said in a statement.

Aer Lingus  said it would consider appealing to the European Court of Justice.

The European Commission has fined Irish state airline Aer Lingus  nearly $1-million (U.S.) for trying to stop British Midland Airways from breaking Aer Lingus's  virtual monopoly on flights between London and Dublin.

It is the first time the commission has  fined an airline for refusing to co-operate with a rival so that people with business-class or other standard tickets can switch from one airline to another on a specific route.

"This decision is evidence of the commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions if they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition," said Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.

British Midland has been Aer Lingus's  only rival on the London to Dublin route since British
Airways PLC stopped flying to Dublin for cost reasons last year.

Aer Lingus  violated European Community rules on fair competition by terminating decades of
co-operation with  British Midland when the private British airline started regular flights between
London and Dublin in 1989, commission officials said.
The commission has sweeping powers to enforce EC law and could have fined Aer Lingus  up to
10 per cent of its annual sales revenue. A commission spokesman said the fine was lenient
because the case set a precedent for the industry.

The commission also ordered  Aer Lingus  to start a two-year "interlining" deal with  British Midland so that passengers can use either airline's tickets to fly with the other. The deal will also allow travel agents to sell interchangeable tickets.

Interlining is a standard but generally voluntary practice in the airline industry and it was not clear until now that the commission would interpret refusal to interline as an antitrust offence in certain cases.

British Midland, the independent UK scheduled airline, yesterday announced a far-reaching marketing agreement with United Airlines of the US.

The agreement could present British Airways with yet more competition by strengthening United's presence in the transatlantic market and bolstering  British Midland's domestic services.

TD
The key feature of the accord is a code-sharing agreement between the two airlines that will allow
United to feed its transatlantic passengers straight onto  British Midland's UK flights and enable  British
Midland flights to link directly with United services from Heathrow to the US.
Meanwhile, the  European Commission yesterday upheld a complaint filed by  British Midland that
Aer Lingus  had abused its dominant position in the market and  fined the Irish carrier #25,000.

In 1989, when  British Midland opened its London-Dublin route in direct competition with  Aer Lingus, the airline immediately cancelled a long-standing arrangement with  British Midland whereby tickets on either airline were interchangeable.

The Commission has now ordered  Aer Lingus  to reinstate its interlining agreement with  British            Midland, but said in a statement yesterday that it accepts "new entrants should not be able to rely indefinitely on frequencies and services provided by their competitors". Thus the arrangement is to be phased out by 1994.

"The fine is small but just," said a Commission spokesman yesterday, suggesting that it reflected in part that Aer Lingus  has in general co-operated in the Commission's efforts to de-regulate the airline industry.

HD         EC COURT KILLS FINE ON PLASTICS FIRMS IN LANDMARK RULING. BY          By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Reuter - A European Community Court on Thursday quashed a multi-million dollar  fine
the European Commission imposed on 14 chemical companies in 1988.

The ruling could lead to challenges to countless other policy decisions the Commission takes daily as the executive body for the 12-nation Community.

TD
The EC's Court of First Instance, which hears cases relating to EC competition law, said the Commission had seriously breached legal procedures and declared the decision and action against the plastics firms invalid.

All the major European producers, including Shell, Imperial Chemical Industries, Solvay, BASF and Hoechst were let off the hook on a total  fine worth almost $30 million at current rates of exchange. Individual fines went as high as $4 million.

Lawyers said the ruling that the final text of the decision was not the same as the one first agreed by the Commisssion and that Commission President Jacques Delors had not personally signed the text in all its five languages, set a stunning precedent.

It could spark challenges to innumerable other actions by the Commission and not only in the area of industrial competition.

The Commission uses the same work methods criticised by the court in everything it does from proposals for new laws to handing out EC regional development funds.

"This could have implications so vast they're hard to even contemplate," said Catriona Hatton of international lawyers Stanbrook and Hooper.

Another lawyer said there was no way the Commission could accept the ruling and that it was sure to appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EC's highest court.

The Commission said it was examining the ruling and the possibility of an appeal but declined any further comment.

The ruling strikes at the heart of the Commission's working practices. Under the house rules, simplified in the late 1960s to help the Commission handle a mounting workload conducted in nine official languages, the text of a decision can be altered by legal translators after it has been approved.

In the chase of the  fines on the plastics firms, the court ruled that the modifications went beyond grammatical phrasing and led to irregularities which undermined the legal authority of the decisions.

The court also faulted the Commission on the grounds that Delors had not personally signed each of the texts of the decision in the five languages in which they had to be notified to the companies, which are of different nationalities.

Lawyers specialising in EC affairs said it was hard to tell so soon whether companies or governments would exploit the vast theoretical implications of the court's verdict to challenge past decisions by the Commission.

Those could include other fines such as one imposed this week on Irish airline  Aer Lingus  for trying to push rival carrier British Midland Airways off the London-Dublin route.

Any firm against which the Commission had taken a decision in the last two months still had time to appeal and might well find it could prove the same errors of procedure as committed in the plastics case, the lawyers said.

HD          Aer Lingus fined over competition with British Midland. WC         356 words

The European Commission yesterday showed its determination to support small airlines that take on big national carriers. It fined Aer Lingus  #532,000 for refusing to co-operate with  British Midland on flights between London and Dublin.

British Midland, which began flying on the route in 1989, complained to the commission that the Irish airline had refused to honour its tickets or to allow passengers to switch from one airline to the other. That made it difficult for  British Midland to establish itself on the route and to compete effectively.

TD
The commission's decision had been widely predicted but the size of the  fine was higher than Aer        Lingus  had expected. The airline said last night that it needed time to consider its response.

British Midland was delighted. Sir Michael Bishop, its chairman, said: "It shows clear evidence of the commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions where they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition."

He added: "The decision establishes an important precedent that dominant airlines should not seek to use the withdrawal of interlining facilities as a competitive weapon."

In the first year,  British Midland operated on the London-Dublin route, flown by 1.6m passengers a year, it took a fifth of the market; that rose to 26% when British Airways withdrew completely last year. In the past three months,  British Midland, which operates eight flights a day compared with 12 by  Aer Lingus,  claims its share has risen to 30%. It argues that if passengers were allowed to switch tickets, the figure would have been even higher.

Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for competition policy, said: "At a time when the European transport industry is being liberalised, airlines making use of the new opportunities for competition should be given a fair chance to develop and sustain their challenge to established carriers."

The commission said that the order forcing Aer Lingus  to co-operate with  British Midland should run for two years; by that time, British Midland should have become sufficiently well established on the route not to need protection.

HD          Airline  Industry: EC Commission Fines Aer Lingus  for Abusing Dominant  Position on

BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission  fined Irish national airline  Aer Lingus  750,000
European currency units ($925,125) for abusing its dominant position on the London-Dublin route.

The EC Commission also ordered Aer Lingus  to resume its so-called interlining pact with  British      Midland, which allows British Midland ticketholders to change to  Aer Lingus  flights. In a statement, the Commission said Aer Lingus'  decision to end the interlining relationship "made it more difficult for the U.K. company to compete."

TD
"British Midland was deprived of significant revenue and forced to incur higher costs in order to overcome the handicap imposed on it," the Commission said.

Aer Lingus  said it was surprised by the Commission's ruling, and immediately attacked it. "Aer            Lingus finds it strange that the EC Commission, which has consistently advocated increasing competition in air transport, is now forcing Aer Lingus  to collaborate with a competitor," the Irish airline said in a statement.

Furthermore,  Aer Lingus  said, British Midland's size is comparable to its own, flies eight trips a day between London and Dublin and possesses the slots necessary to increase its frequencies.  Aer           Lingus flies 14 flights daily between the Irish and British capitals.

Aer Lingus  said it would consider appealing to the European Court of Justice.

The Association of European Airlines, which represents Europe's major carriers, also charged the Commission with muddled thinking. "I do not understand how they (the  EC Commission) say we should be more competitive . . . but we should cooperate with our competition," AEA Secretary General Karl-Heinz Neumeister said.

Aer Lingus  terminated its ticket-exchange pact with  British Midland in 1989 after the U.K. carrier said it would start its own service on the London-Dublin route in competition with the Irish carrier. But the Commission said that ending the exchange accord made  British Midland flights less attractive to
travel agents and to business travelers who require flexible tickets.

"This decision is evidence of the Commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions, if they attempt to prevent the development . . . of competition," EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said. He said airlines must be prepared to compete strictly on the merit
of their services and shouldn't withhold facilities like interlining, which the airlines traditionally provide to one an other.

"At a time when the European air industry is being liberalized, airlines . . . should be given a fair chance to develop and sustain their challenge to established carriers," Sir Leon said.

However, the Commission said it accepts that new market entrants shouldn't be able to rely indefinitely on services offered by their competitors. It therefore ruled that the interlining accord between  Aer         Lingus  and British Midland be limited to two years, subject to review of competitive conditions on the route.

The issue of ticket exchanging has become increasingly sensitive to airlines as competition increases. Formerly, airlines would coordinate schedules and air fares, thus making ticket exchanges a logical extension of their collaboration.

But as governments have put restrictions on airline collaboration, the willingness of airlines to accept another airline's tickets has diminished. At one international conference on air fares, Lufthansa representatives left the room saying that if they didn't collaborate on fares they wouldn't be forced to accept other airline's tickets.

In fact, a Commission spokesman said that under the EC's rules on air-transport deregulation, companies that engage in price consultation with the competitors are obliged to accept the competition's tickets. He said the Commission was in favor of interlining pacts because they allow for increased flexibility on tickets.

But the issue has led to calls for the creation of a code of conduct governing interlining. "The question of interlining is so important that it deserves to be treated by itself," the AEA's Mr. Neumeister said.

HD         COMMISSION TO FIGHT RULING PUTTING ALL EC LAWS IN DOUBT. BY         By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Feb 28, Reuter - The  European Commission, facing the spectre of legal chaos in the European Community, said on Friday it would appeal against a court ruling which cast doubt on the legitimacy of every policy decision taken for the past 25 years.

The EC's Court of First Instance ruled on Thursday that a 1988 Commission decision to  fine 14 plastics firms for running an illegal cartel was invalid because of serious breaches of correct procedure in agreeing the fine.

TD
Lawyers and EC officials said the ruling set a dangerous precedent which could lead to a spate of challenges to the 8,000 acts and decisions the Commission adopts each year, often in nine languages, on behalf of the Community.
A Commission spokesman said the appeal would be lodged with the European Court of Justice in
Luxembourg, the EC's highest legal authority, within two months.

"The Commission does not share the (lower) court's interpretation of (the Commission's) own internal rules," he said. Other EC sources said the Commission was furious with the court verdict and would move fast to try and limit the damage.

The lower court said that in the plastics case the final text of the decision differed from the one first agreed by the Commisssion and that Commission President Jacques Delors had not personally signed the text in all its five languages.

The ruling on the merits of a particular decision struck at the heart of the work methods the Commission uses in everything it does from proposing new laws to and policing industry to handing out EC structural funds.

If the Court of Justice upholds the reasoning behind the Court of First Instance's judgment, it could wreak havoc in the Commission which has used simplified house rules since the late 1960s to handle a mounting workload.

It would mean Delors would have to personally sign 200 acts and decisions every day to satisfy the demands of the court, a Commission spokesman said.
The ruling "could have implications so vast they're hard to even contemplate," Catriona Hatton from the
EC offices of international lawyers Stanbrook and Hooper, said on Thursday.

Commission house rules allow for a decision taken in several languages to be altered after adoption by legal translators. But the court said changes made in the case of the plastics cartel had gone beyond grammatical phrasing and led to irregularities which undermined the legal authority of the decisions.

Lawyers say the ruling as it stands could mean other firms could challenge similar decisions such as one this week when the Commission  fined Irish airline Aer Lingus  for trying to push rival carrier British Midland Airways off the London-Dublin route.

But challenges might not be limited to industrial competition policy and a vast range of other trade and policy edicts issued by the Commission could be faulted for the same reasons, they said.

HD       Commission to appeal against court ruling  on decision-making

LP
THE European Commission is to appeal against Thursday's unprecedented court ruling which cast doubt on the validity of the EC executive's internal decision-making process and quashed  fines imposed on 14 chemicals companies for operating a cartel.

Several large EC groups are examining the judgment by the EC's Court of First Instance (CFI) to find out whether they, too, have grounds for challenging  fines imposed on them.

TD
The Commission will appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EC's supreme judicial body. '(The
Commission) does not share the lower court's interpretation of its internal rules,' said a spokesman.

There is still debate among EC lawyers about the scope of the judgment. At worst, Commission legal experts fear the ruling could undermine past decisions in all areas of its activity, not just competition, and allow aggrieved companies to challenge  fines going back years. Normally, complainants have only two months to appeal against a Commission decision.

The Dutch builders' federation, the SPO, had already intended to lodge an appeal against a  fine imposed by the Commission earlier this month for operating an illegal cartel. Mr Louis van Lennep, the federation's lawyer in Brussels, said yesterday the SPO was more interested in attacking the substance of the Commission's decision. But he added: 'We will look at (the ruling) of course, and if there is mileage in it we will use it.'

Aer Lingus,  the Irish airline  fined Ecu750,000 (Pounds 525,000) this week for operating a restrictive ticketing system on the London-Dublin route, said the judgment sounded 'extremely interesting'. The airline has not yet decided whether to appeal against Wednesday's Commission decision.

The Commission is particularly concerned about the CFI's suggestion that the official versions of all its decisions, which can appear in up to nine languages, should be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr David Williamson, the secretary general.
To ease the bureaucratic load, the president and secretary general usually sign only the minutes of the
Commission meeting in which the decision took place.

HD       When bureaucrats are brought to book: The implications of a legal challenge  to European             Commission rulings

As a headline, 'Brussels Slammed For Lack Of Bureaucracy' is from the same school as 'Man Bites Dog'
- unexpected, unbelievable and eminently newsworthy.

That was certainly the impact of last Thursday's unprecedented court decision condemning the European Commission for failing to apply all the red tape required by its own internal administrative rules.

TD
The EC's lower judicial body, the Court of First Instance (CFI), quashed the Ecu23.5m (Pounds 16.66m) fine levied on 14 of Europe's largest chemical companies in 1988 for operating a cartel in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

As Brussels' work-hungry lawyers have been quick to realise, that could be only the beginning. Some believe that competition decisions going back years - in particular,  fines imposed on cartels and on companies which abused their dominant position - could be overturned on the same grounds.

At the same time, the court judgment, the latest in a series of rulings criticising procedural faults, calls into question the way the increasingly powerful Brussels bureaucracy works.

As one competition official put it following Thursday's ruling: 'No act of the Commission in the past 25 years has followed the procedure that the Court of First Instance would like us to follow.'

Appeals based on Thursday's ruling would not be trivial. As the confidence of the Commission's competition directorate has grown under successive commissioners, Mr Peter Sutherland and Sir Leon Brittan, so have its punishments. They range from last week's Ecu750,000  fine on Aer Lingus,  for a restrictive ticketing operation, to last July's record Ecu75m  fine imposed on Tetra Pak, the
Swiss-Swedish packaging group, for abusing its dominant position in the EC market.

Since the 1960s, the Commission - now working at a rate of 8,000 decisions a year - has been taking short-cuts past its own strict internal rules. Those rules require official decisions, sometimes in all nine Community languages, to be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr David Williamson, the Commission's secretary general.

But to speed the process, Mr Delors and Mr Williamson routinely sign only the minutes of the meetings where such decisions are taken. Legally, according to the CFI, such decisions do not exist. The Commission, not surprisingly, is to challenge the CFI ruling in the European Court of Justice, the EC's highest judicial body.

Whether every company ever  fined by the Commission has a case is debatable. In theory, appeals against Commission decisions have to be lodged with the CFI within two months. But some lawyers argue that, if the original decision was 'non-existent', the deadline itself is meaningless.

Some appeals are already under way. The two largest  fines ever imposed by the Commission - the one on Tetra Pak, and the Ecu47m  fine levied on Solvay of Belgium and ICI of Britain in 1990, for operating a cartel in the soda-ash market - are being challenged.

Page 32 of 43 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Whether the latest CFI ruling becomes a factor in these cases will hinge on how far they have got. It will also depend on the extent to which the companies' lawyers are already using procedural arguments against the Commission.

Individual circumstances will play an important part. In the case of the PVC cartel, the wider implications of the companies' successful appeal have been clouded by certain specific criticisms of the procedure relating to this decision.

In an attempt to head off further appeals, the Commission is likely to seek a European Court ruling which supports its internal procedure even if it upholds criticisms specific to the PVC decision. There is no doubt, however, that for Sir Leon and the Commission's competition directorate - often attacked for their own legal nit-picking - this is an embarrassment.

In a speech last September on competition policy and procedures, Sir Leon, himself a lawyer, criticised companies for bringing complaints to the court which 'usually turn out on analysis to be no more than a procedural quibble', and urged them to concentrate on 'the substance of administrative justice'.

But in the last month, the competition directorate has found itself at the wrong end of a string of judgments overturning Commission decisions on procedural technicalities. Most notably, the Commission's attempt to force British Aerospace to repay 'sweeteners' it received from the government as part of the purchase of Rover, the UK car company, was overturned.

Such judgments have hinged more on the court's interpretation of the EC treaty's requirements. However, lawyers involved in the PVC case suggested last week that the CFI was equally fed up with Brussels bureaucrats flouting their own rules, even for good reasons such as efficiency and confidentiality.

As the CFI itself said in its ruling: 'All those formal requirements governing the drawing up, adoption and authentication of measures are necessary in order to guarantee the stability of the legal order and legal certainty for those subject to measures adopted by Community institutions.'

Competition officials in Brussels are exasperated by what they see as the court's pernickety attitude. 'We are talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin here,' said one. But as most EC lawyers are quick to point out, if the Commission cannot abide by legal technicalities, why should the companies which submit to its decisions?

The executive commission of the European Community on February 26th  fined Aer Lingus  a total of
750,000 European Currency UnitsDnearly $1 millionDfor abusing its dominant position on runs between
Dublin and London. Specifically, the commission said that  Aer Lingus  tried to stop  British Midland from
gaining a foothold in the market by terminating its interlining relationship with the carrier.

The commission ordered the Irish carrier to begin a two-year interlining arrangement with  British Midland, because that would give  British Midland enough time to establish itself on the route. "This decision is evidence of the commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions," said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. "At a time when the European air transport industry is being liberalized, airlines making use of the new opportunities for competition should be given a fair
chance to develop and sustain their challenge to established carriers."

TD
Aer Lingus  is the dominant airline on the Dublin-London route, having left only about 30% of the market to BMA last year.  Aer Lingus  responded to the complaint by claiming its action was simply a competitive response to "a formidable competitor," stating that it finds it "strange that the...commission, which has consistently advocated increasing competition in air transport, is now forcing Air Lingus to collaborate with a competitor.  Aer Lingus  did not prevent  British Midland from competing, but merely declined to help them," the airline added. "What we have set out to do is precisely what we thought the  EC commission wantedDto compete on the merits of our own service.

"We find it difficult to understand how the commission could impose any  fine, let alone a  fine of this severity,"  Aer Lingus  stated. "It seems entirely inappropriate to a situation where the law is new and the conditions in which there may be a duty to interline are far from clearly defined."

The issue of interlining within Europe has some history. In 1990, the now-failed Air Europe filed a complaint against Lufthansa and, under threat, the German carrier entered into an agreement. Litigation was pending against Alitalia and SAS when an IATA conference last discussed the issue at a seminar in Manchester. (Charles Goldsmith & Martin Noble)

The European Commission has fined Aer Lingus,  the Irish national carrier, ECU 750,000 ($936,420) for terminating its 'interlining' ticket agreement with British Midland after it started competing on the London/Dublin route.

The commission said that the withdrawal of the interlining - allowing passengers to change their airline on route - deprived British Midland of significant revenue and forced it to incur higher costs in order to overcome the handicap.

TD
Sir Leon Brittan, the European competition commissioner, said: "This decision is evidence of the commission's determination to act against airlines holding dominant positions, if they attempt to prevent the development or maintenance of competition.
The commission told  Aer Lingus  to resume its interlining with  British Midland, which was broken off in
1989. But the commission said the duty to interline was limited to two years from now because  British
Midland was established on the route.

The European Commission has set a controversial precedent by fining Aer Lingus  750,000 ECU (European Currency Units) for breaking its interlining agreement with British Midland Airways (BMA).

Accompanying the  fine was the significant judgment from EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan that airlines with a dominant position cannot withhold traditional airline facilities from new entrants until they become established competitors. After that, free competition between carriers is allowed.

TD
With European airline liberalisation on the horizon, Brittan is seeking to ensure new airlines are not deterred from starting new services or smothered at birth by the strength of existing competitors.

Aer Lingus  is considering whether to appeal the  fine to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The fine, the first of its kind assessed by the  European Commission for ending an interlining agreement, was levied under competition rules intended to keep companies from taking advantage of their dominant positions.  Aer Lingus,  as the dominant carrier on the Dublin-London route, abused its position by ending interlining in 1989 after BMA became a direct competitor on the Dublin-London route, the Commission said.

Aer Lingus's  action prevented BMA from offering flexible tickets, attractive to business passengers and travel agents, and forced it to spend more to compete.  Aer Lingus  said its decision not to interline was "a legitimate competitive response to a formidable competitor" coming onto the key Dublin-London route.

It labeled as strange the Commission demand that it collaborate with a competitor when it wanted to compete on the merits of its own service. The carrier offers 18 summer flights a day between Dublin and London, compared with BMA's eight.  Aer Lingus  claimed it did not abuse a dominant position because the two carriers are of comparative size.

British Midlands reported a net profit of $1.43 million, compared to a net loss of $5.74 million in 1990. The carrier is ending its five-a-day Liverpool to London service in order to use the slots for cut-rate Heathrow to Brussels service. (Conversion rate 1.74 pounds = $US1.00)

CAE Electronics of Montreal, Canada, has contracted to build a 747-400 simulator for All Nippon Airways for delivery in the fall of 1993, and signed a separate contract to update two additional 747-400 simulators and a 747-400 Level 7 Flight Training Device. The value of the two contracts is $9.7 million (C$11.5 million).
The European Commission has fined Aer Lingus  about $1 million for what it terms abusing its
dominant position in the London-Dublin market. It said  Aer Lingus  canceled its interlining agreement with
British Midland, thus delaying the latter's ability to gain a foothold in the market. Instead of increasing

Sabena and Air France will not get approval of their proposed partnership until a new Belgian government is formed, according to a senior political leader who has the responsibility of putting a new coalition together. Sabena has maintained its future would be in jeopardy unless there is governmental approval of a working partnership. The two carriers had hoped to conclude their agreement before the Belgian government collapsed in November.

HD    PHILIPPINE AIRLINES SALE WILL BE GOOD FOR ECONOMY WC    2,933 words

The privatization of Philippine Airlines was good for the economy, as it would end government subsidy and help reduce the deficit, says Philippines Finance Secretary Jesus P. Estanislao, contrary to charges by critics that taxpayers would continue to bear PAL's debt. Estanislao, head of the PAL privatization committee, issued the statement in reaction to criticism that the 9.78 billion peso ($369 million) sale of PAL to the AB Capital Bank of Commerce consortium on January 30th would not be to the good of the
economy.

"Critics should study very well the features of the government privatization program in general and the PAL privatization scheme in particular before they discuss these matters in public," he said. "The fact that the national government would no longer worry about subsidizing PAL's foreign obligations, which tax our meager resources, is clear enough that the deal was good for the country."

The national government last year assumed PAL's $512 million foreign loans to make the national flag carrier attractive to buyers, since it would be sold free of loans. The assumption of liabilities was made after interested bidders indicated concern over the airline's foreign exchange liabilities at a time when the worldwide airline industry was in deep financial trouble.

Air France President Bernard Attali has declared that Europe "is in the middle of a fabulous series of restructuring" of airlines and that he hopes the  European Commission will not block the regroupings in the name of "an ultra-liberalism that in fact kills liberalism," which he notes is what it has done in the United States to European airlines attempting to compete with domestic US carriers. Attali, indeed, asked European authorities to "show more firmness" with US airlines operating on the European continent.

"I have no desire to commit suicide," said Attali March 8th on a French TV newsmakers program, L'Heure de Verite ("The Hour of Truth"). "We can't be asked to make war with our hands tied behind our backs and take part in a race with lead in our shoes."

Meanwhile, Air France is holding talks with Aeroflot about setting up joint operations with the airline of the former Soviet Union, officials said. The arrangement would be linked, apparently, with the accord between Air France and Czech carrier CSA.

Creditors of US carrier Continental Airlines got bankruptcy court approval March 11th to sue former Continental chief Frank Lorenzo on charges he unfairly made millions of dollars in a stock deal just before the airline went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Lorenzo and business partner Robert Snedeker, a former Continental executive, are named as defendants in the suit seeking at least $290 million. Both have denied any wrongdoing.

The creditors say they want $90 million in actual damages from Lorenzo and Snedeker, $70 million in actual damages from their Jet Capital Corp., and $90 million in punitive damages. The creditors also seek to force Lorenzo and Snedeker to return at least $40 million they made by selling their stock in
Continental's parent company to Scandinavian Airline System several months before Continental landed in bankruptcy in December 1990.

US Bankruptcy Judge Helen Balick, who is overseeing Continental's bankruptcy case, agreed Wednesday to let the lawsuit proceed. Lorenzo and Snedeker did not object to that procedural ruling. Continental Airlines said it was taking no sides in the dispute.

The creditors say Lorenzo and Snedeker shirked their responsibility to Continental by selling off their own stakes in the company and pocketing the money rather than putting it back into the airline. Lorenzo and Snedeker have said the lawsuit is without merit.

Dan-Air, Britain's second biggest scheduled carrier, has begun operating the first of six 737-400s, all of which will be in service by mid-April. Additionally, the airline has done a deal with British Aerospace for four Category III 146-300s, plus an option on two more which will replace 146-100 equipment. Dan- Air was the original lead operator of the type.

Following its fine of 530,000 pounds by the  European Commission for failing to interline with British Miland, Aer Lingus  may now face civil court action from the UK airline. BMA argues that it lost millions of pounds over the past three years as a result of the Irish refusal to cooperate in the interchange of tickets.
A suit for damages, if successful, could potentially be more punitive than the EEC  fine which, officials said, is viewed in Brussels as "lenient."  Aer Lingus  would have been fined a maximum of 10% of its turnover.

Translift Airways, based at the Shannon Free Zone, will begin operating three DC-8s, one as a freighter and two in 235- seat configurations, in May. All three are ex-United Airlines aircraft and leased from Guiness Peat Aviation. A further four are on option for 1993 and 1994. The venture is backed by the 31 investment group and British Coal Board pension fund.

After six months' negotiations alongside other car rental organizations, Hertz has renewed its global contract with British Airways in a three-year deal believed to be worth 30 million pounds, and with an option for a further two years. Annual rentals are expected within this period to double to 100,000.

Seven European airlinesDAir France, Alitalia, British Airways, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa and Air Portugal D have protested to the Zurich city authorities against Swissair's monopoly on ground handling at Klten Airport. The seven say their traffic in and out of Kloten is sufficient to warrant their having their own facilities; until now only US carriers TWA, United and American Airlines, as well as El Al have had their
own check-in facilities. Swissair has handled all other regular flights and Jet Aviation, a local company, has handled charters.

An Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Balfour Beatty, construction arm of the BICC Group, has won the contract to draw up the masterplan study to build Kuala Lumpur's new international airport at a cost of $3.5 billion. The consortium also includes GEC Marconi, Trafalgar House Construction and Marubeni Corporation of Japan. It is expected to complete the study in about nine months. Winning the $3.54 million contract has put the consortium strongly in the running to build and develop the airport project. The British Airports Authority, the UK airport operator, has also been appointed lead consultant for the study. The Malaysian Government aims to open the new airport at Sepang about 50 km south of Kuala Lumpur, in
1997. BICC says the detailed engineering and first-stage construction would include two runways, terminals, associated infrastructure and a high-speed train link. The huge size of the project is likely to draw upon funds from both the private and public sectors to finance construction.

Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport had an overall 10% increase in cargo throughput in January compared to last January. A total 31,657 tons were exported (14.8% higher), with 23,292 tons imported (14% increase), while shipments were down 20%. Connecting shipments are almost entirely comprised of traffic destined for or originated from China.
Hong Kong company Righteous Holdings will lift its shareholding in Hanoi's first airport duty-free shop to
63% from 18%. The company announced March 6th that it would exercise an option to acquire the 45%
stake in Sundance Duty Free Sales Co. for HK$10 million (US$1.28 million). Sundance, which also
operates a drinks bar and souvenir shop in the international departure hall at Gia Lam Airport, had total
sales of US$544,000 last year with a net profit of US$16,000.

The Canadian government last week announced plans to privatize Terminals One and Two at Toronto's Pearson Airport. Terminal Three, which opened just over a year ago, was developed and built through the private sector and has considerably reduced congestion in the older facilities. The move to let renovation and long-term lease of the two terminals out to bid is not supported by the airlines, nor is it favored by the Ontario Provincial government. In fact, the Air Transport Association of Canada AGM in Vancouver in November passed a resolution calling on Ottawa to halt either privatization or further development of the older terminals until the industry raised the requirement, particularly in the light of reduced traffic.

While a recently initiated terminal improvement project is a welcome sign that the aviation authorities in Mexico are moving to prepare Mexico City Airport for the new era of growth, still unanswered are the critically important questions of slots and access during peak travel demand, ramp space and services for charters and itinerant commercial flights, control tower radar and technical handling capacity and, given the free trade agreement focus on trade, air cargo infrastructure capacity. All currently exist at
sub-standard levels that are increasingly worrying authorities and the users alike. Toluca Airport and

Puebla Airport have been partially developed as alternative solutions to Mexican congestion, but present the carriers and their users with insurmountable economic obstacles due to the significant access problems of distance and cost of surface links where air freight is concerned. The Mexican Department of Civil Aviation (DGAC) is making a valiant effort to encourage new applicants for traffic rights in scheduled and non-scheduled air cargo to use Toluca (TLC) but is finding that only the integrated operators like Federal Express and UPS are willing to base their operations there.

Under pressure from the Korean government, both of the country's major carriers, Korean Airlines and Asiana, will suspend inter-national payments this financial year for aircraft purchases as a means of reducing the country's balance of payments deficit. Unnamed airline sources say Korean Airlines has decided to delay an Airbus payment of approximately $77 million. Asiana, meanwhile, has postponed procurement until next year of two aircraft worth $65 million and instead will charter aircraft under
long-term contracts. A spokesman for the Korean Economic Planning Board said the government would not "force" the airlines to suspend overseas orders for fear of trade retaliation from trading partners.

Suspicions about the viability of Virgin Atlantic Airways have been allayed by the sale to Thorn EMI of a two-thirds stake in Virgin Music which makes Richard Branson 320 million pounds better off. Branson has indicate a significant proportion will be invested in expanding his airline interests.

Balair, the charter airline majority-owned by Swissair, has accused two of Switzerland's major banks of refusing to guarantee leasing costs of $100 million for two new A310 aircraft. Fred Notter, president of Balair, said Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse had refused the financing at the beginning of this year. He gave no reason. Swiss Bank Corp. and a combination of other financial sources finally came through with the money, Notter said. He said Balair could not raise the cash for the new planes because
its 1991 accounts, to be released in a few weeks, show it just about broke even and will not be able to pay a dividend for 1991. The company is also raising cash by selling one of its DC-10s, he said.

The Boeing Co. reported last week that the sale of its de Havilland subsidiary to Bombardier Inc. of Canada and the Province of Ontario was closed March 9th. Bruce Gissing, executive VP of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group and chairman of Boeing of Canada, described de Havilland in a statement as "a leaner, better equipped and more efficient organization than the one we acquired in 1986. We are pleased to have aligned de Havilland with buyers who can protect the long-term interest of its customers, employees and suppliers." Boeing bought the unit in 1986 from the government of Canada and announced its intention to sell it in July 1990.

The airline industry, along with the rest of the international trading community, will now find transferring money in and out of Korea much more efficient. On March 2nd, the Bank of Korea and the country's bank clearing institute inaugurated the link to "swift"-the Society for Worldwide Financial Telecommunication's global computer network, that electronically transfers funds between banks.

The Iberia-led consortium has failed to fulfill the terms of the Aerolineas Argentinas purchase, Argentine Economic Minister Domingo Cavallo said in a recent story in the Buenos Aires Herald. Charges against the consortium include failure to meet payment terms and investment commitments. According to other sources, Aerolineas lost $70 million in 1991. There are noises from other government sources about a "return of the airline to the state because of irregularities." However, in the same Herald story, Minister Cavallo is quoted as stating that he is in favor of granting the consortium a brief waiting period to comply with the terms of the acquisition. The whole Aerolineas subject has been further complicated because of the cholera incident and other negative operational investigation reports in the press.

Parker Bertrea Aerospace said it is heading a team that will design and build the primary control systems for the planned MD-12 long-range widebody, which McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it will officially launch later this year. Teijin Seiki, based in Gifu, Japan, will supply controls for the outboard aileron and elevator actuators, while Parker Bertrea will supply controls for the inboard aileron, elevator, rudder and spoiler actuators.

Fokker Aircraft said it has received orders for F100 aircraft from Aviacsa of Mexico, which ordered two of the aircraft under a long-term operating lease contract with GPA Fokker Ltd. Aircraft "will be delivered shortly," Fokker said. In addition, Bangkok Airways will begin operating an F100 "in mid-March," providing daily charter flights for tourists and United Nations officials between Bangkok and Phnom Penh. The F100 is the airline's first jet aircraft.

Goodyear said "a limited number" of its aircraft tires are to be used on Boeing's upcoming 777 long-range, twin-engine aircraft. Selection of the 49-inch bias-ply tires "permits the use of a lighter weight wheel
design, increasing the total available weight savings," Goodyear quotes Boeing engineers as saying. "The future for radial aircraft tires is bright," said Goodyear unit Air Treads, Inc. chairman and CEO Joseph M. Gingo, "but radials have not yet surpassed what bias tires offer in terms of weight savings, retreadability and operating costs."

Lucas Aerospace also won a contract for the 777, this for the design and production of a Powered Door Opening System, which opens the engine fan and thrust reverser cowls. Lucas said it teamed with Frisby Airborne of Long Island, New York.

The Garrett Auxiliary Power Division of Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. said it has successfully completed the first full engine run of the Garrett 331-500 APU designed for the 777, ahead of its March 1st target date. Production deliveries of the APU are scheduled for 1993. Approximately 3,000 hours of testing are expected this year.

CAE Electronics Ltd. of Quebec, Canada, said it has been chosen by All Nippon Airways to develop and produce a full flight simulator for its 747-400 crews. The simulator, to be produced to US Federal Aviation Administration Level D standards, will feature the company's exclusive, new-generation
six-degree-of-freedom motion system, and will utilize an IBM 6000 RISC system. Delivery is scheduled for fall 1993.

Kuwait Airways has chosen Allied-Signal's Bendix-King RDR-4A weather radar and communications, navigation and identification equipment for its fleet of Airbus aircraft, which are to begin deliveries later this year. A total of 15 aircraft are scheduled for delivery and equipage.

Allied-Signal also said it signed its first contract with a Russian airframe manufacturer, with Ilyushin, which manufactures large commercial transports, for equipping a bleed air system for the IL-96M, a new stretched version of the IL96-300. Ilyushin is developing the aircraft with four Pratt & Whitney PW2337 powerplants to carry a maximum passenger load of 375 with a range of 10,750 kilometersDabout 6,500 miles.

Page Avjet Corp. said it is installing the Bendix-King Mode Select and Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II on the first TAP Air Portugal A310 at its facility in Orlando International Airport. Page Avjet said it will design and produce the system and will apply for a supplemental type certificate on the A310.

Qantas Airways has selected Sierra Academy of Aeronautics, the academy said, to provide it with US FAA- approved dispatcher training for the airline. The dispatchers will be servicing Australian routes for Japan Airlines.
New Irish passenger and charter carrier Translift, based at Shannon, has named Mike Halper as
president, and Ron Neeham VP-marketing, with founder and major shareholder P.J. McGoldrick taking the
title of chairman and CEO.

Cho Yang-ho has been elected president of Korean Airlines. Cho is the eldest son of Cho Choong-hoon, chairman of the Hanjin Group that is the airline's main shareholder. Cho started his career in the Hanjin Group in 1988 when he became managing director of KAL. He is graduate of the University of Southern California and of the graduate school of INHA University, founded by Hanjin.
Rafael Ordozgoiti, 43, was named executive VP of Venezuelan carrier Viasa. Ordozgoiti was senior
VP-marketing of Iberia Intercontinental. In a statement, Iberia, which owns a 45% share of Viasa, said the
appointment "enhances Iberia's key objective to strengthen synergies among the Iberia Group
companies."
Turkish Airlines appointed Tezcan Yaramanci president and Erman Yerdelen chairman of the company.

After a dispute which resulted in  Aer Lingus  being heavily fined by the EC Commission, the Irish airline has decided to make peace with its UK rival on the London route, British Midland, and enter a co-operation agreement which will allow passengers to use tickets for each other's services. Facilities for servicing will also be shared.

Aer Lingus  had earlier indicated its intention to appeal to the European Court of Justice against the
#575,000 fine, imposed under the EC's competition rules, for suspending a so-called interlining
agreement with  British Midland, which had entered into increasingly sharp competition with it on the
Dublin-London route.

TD
However, Aer Lingus  announced yesterday that it had reached a comprehensive agreement with
British Midland, which included an interline arrangement on the Dublin/London route.

The possibility that the EC  fine could be substantially increased by periodic penalties for non-compliance may have been a factor in  Aer Lingus's  decision.

An Aer Lingus  spokesman said the decision to reinstate the interline agreement was part of a package which would see the airline doing business with  British Midland in a range of activities, including technical support by TEAM and Airmotive Ireland.
