BRUSSELS (AP) - European Union regulators on Wednesday  fined seven chemical companies euro61
million for fixing the price of calcium  carbide, a chemical used to make steel.
Akzo Nobel NV of the Netherlands escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel, the
European Commission said.

TD
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said industrial customers all over  Europe suffered from the cartel from 2004 to 2007. "The  Commission will not tolerate such economic damage to  Europe's industrial base," she said.

Slovakia-based Novacke chemicke zavody and 1.garantovana received the largest individual fine of euro19.6 million. Germany's SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its owner ARQUES Industries were fined euro13.3 million, HSE of Slovenia must pay euro9.1 million, German-Austrian group Ecka Granulate euro6.4 million and Germany's Almamet euro3.04 million.

Two companies saw their  fines reduced for cooperating with regulators. Austria's Donau Chemie's share was cut to euro5 million. Germany's EvonikDegussa also won a reduction to  euro4.68 million.

Regulators said the companies fixed prices and shared markets for calcium  carbide powder and granulates and magnesium granulates that operated across most European countries. The total European market is worth some  euro175 million.

The chemicals are essential for steel makers because they remove oxygen and sulfur from molten steel to make it stronger.  Calcium carbide granulates are also used to make the welding gas acetylene.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined nine chemical companies a total of EUR61 million for having operated a cartel between 2004 and 2007.
The companies that have been  fined are Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding
Slovenske elektrarne, Novacke chemicke zavody and its former parent 1.garantovana, SKW
Stahl-Metallurgie (SK1.XE) and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques Industries
(AQU.XE).

TD
Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA.AE) also participated in  price fixing  but wasn't  fined because it revealed the existence of the  cartel to the commission.
The commission found that the companies fixed prices and shared markets for calcium  carbide
products and magnesium granulates during the period in a substantial part of Europe.

The products are used in the steel industry for removing oxygen and sulfur impurities from molten steel to improve the quality of the final product.

AkzoNobel today confirmed it has received full immunity from a EUR17.4 million fine which would otherwise have been imposed by the EuropeanCommission following an investigation into price  fixing involving the
company's Calcium  Carbide business between November 2004 and November
2006.

The infringement was reported to the European  Commission by AkzoNobel at the end of 2006 and an application for immunity was made.

AkzoNobel regrets the inappropriate actions taken by certain individuals and stresses that the breach was reported internally through the company's intensified competition law compliance program. Immediate steps were then taken to report the infringement to the appropriate authorities and AkzoNobel has cooperated fully throughout the investigation.

A strict zero tolerance policy is in place throughout AkzoNobel for any anti-competitive behavior.

The European Union's top competition regulator announced Wednesday that it had  fined nine chemicals suppliers for price fixing  and operating a cartel.

"The European Commission has imposed a total of 61,120,000  euros in fines on nine companies... for violating the (EU) ban on cartels and restrictive business practices," the regulator, the  commission, said in a statement.

TD
It said the companies fixed prices and shared markets for calcium  carbide powder, calcium carbide granulates and magnesium granulates in a substantial part of Europe's economic area between 2004 and 2007.
Brussels named the nine as: Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske elektrarne
(for its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija), Novacke chemicke zavody and its former parent
1.garantovana, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques
industries.

Calcium carbide is a compound used to make acetylene gas, a common industrial gas used in metal work. It is also used as a dehydrating agent and in the manufacture of graphite and hydrogen.
Both it and  magnesium powder can be used to boost the quality of steel. loc/rlp

BRATISLAVA, July 22, (SITA) – Economic news released by SITA on Wednesday, July 22
Economy Ministry Reports: 18,000 Jobs Endangered Due to Crisis

TD
,The global economic crisis is currently threatening 17,775 jobs in Slovakia through planned layoffs. According to information provided by the Economy Ministry on the current development of impacts of the financial crisis on Slovak companies in the 29th week of this year, of the total number of endangered jobs by announced layoffs of 36,291 since January, 18,516 have been actually laid off. “No employer announced a mass layoff in the monitored week”, stated the ministry.
Late Component Supplies Cause Production Outage in PSA Plant

,The Trnava-based plant of the French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen is experiencing a paradoxical situation. On one hand it prolonged working time in the afternoon shift by one hour due to high demand for cars, while on the other hand it posts production outages caused by a lack of components. For example, they had to postpone production in a stamping shop, welding shop, paint shop and assembly shop during the morning shift on Monday. “Some suppliers have problems to manufacture and deliver ordered components in the required deadline as a consequence of the financial crisis,” explained Mr. Svec. It chiefly concerns operation of a welding shop. Therefore, the carmaker introduced an extraordinary
regimen when they announce employees in advance whether their operation manufactures and in what regimen. Employees will thus probably have paid overtime for hours during which the production was halted. “We will accommodate a working time so that the planned production volume was met,” said Mr. Svec.

Eurostat:  Drop in Industrial Orders in Slovakia among Worst in EU

New industrial orders in Slovakia decreased by 33.4 percent year-on-year in May, which was the sixth deepest y/y fall within the  European Union (EU). Estonia reported the biggest drop of 39.8 percent, followed by Finland (39.6 percent) and Lithuania (38.5 percent). Slovenia and Greece also posted bigger decrease than Slovakia. Nevertheless, all the EU countries that made their data available to  Eurostat,  the Statistical Office of the  European Communities, reported decline in industrial orders. Ireland had the lowest drop of 9.3 percent, followed by Great Britain (11.3 percent) and Poland (15.4 percent),  Eurostat informed on Wednesday. Industrial orders within the whole EU shrank 28 percent y/y in May, while the drop within the  eurozone reached 30.1 percent y/y.
Government Prepares Projects of EUR 3.5 Mln. for Eastern Slovakia

The Slovak Government is ready to help districts in eastern Slovakia with about EUR 3.5 million. The Cabinet prepared projects for the districts of Bardejov, Stropkov and Svidnik, which should improve their social and economic situation. The projects were submitted by the Economy Ministry as an analysis and the Cabinet was to have dealt with them already at its meeting in Svidnik last week; however, the Svidnik meeting was adjourned due to Prime Minister Robert Fico’s health problems. The government suggests also helping the region with regard to the increasing unemployment rate, which, for example, in the District of Svidnik, rose from 16.5 percent in January to 21.3 percent in May.
Procurement Office Finds Interior Ministry's Tender Discriminatory

The Public Procurement Office (UVO) has ordered the Interior Ministry to cancel its public tender to select a contractor for provision of translation and interpreting services worth over EUR 1 million. “The requirement for participation, regarding provision of recommendations, was defined in a discriminating
Page 8 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
manner and was inappropriate regarding the subject matter of the contract,” explained UVO spokeswoman Helena Fialova. “The office apparently found our requirements strict,” said the ministry’s spokesman Erik Tomas. According to him, the ministry would announce a new tender, but did not specify a date.
This Year’s Grain Harvest Expected Lower than last Year

This year’s grain harvest in Slovakia will be lower than last year. Head of the Union of Fodder Producers, Storage and Trade Companies (ZVKSaOS) Marian Uhrik told journalists that there are two factors behind the expected lower harvest: lower sown area and lower crop per hectare. Though wheat planted area increased by 5,900 hectares, or 9.5 percent from last year, barley planted area was reduced by 17,000 hectares., which is 10.7 percent less than last year. Maize planted area contracted by 14,600 hectares or
10 percent compared with 2008. Due to the expected lower crop per hectare this year, wheat harvest should drop 15.4 percent, or 280,000 tons compared with last year. In case of barley, a 25-percent y/y drop is expected, which means harvest 223,000 tons lower. Maize harvest should shrink 218,000 tons from a year ago, which accounts for a 17.3 percent drop. Estimated harvest of rape seed this year should fall to by about 47,000 tons or a 11-percent shortfall y/y. The only agricultural commodity, in case of which a moderately higher harvest is expected is sunflower. Its harvest should go up approximately 8 percent, i.e. 15,000 tons from a year ago.
PMU Confirms  Fine for Carcass Disposal Plants VAS and N-ADOVA

Slovakia's Antitrust Office (PMU) confirmed an aggregate  fine of nearly EUR 446,000 for the carcass disposal plants VAS, s.r.o. and N-ADOVA, s.r.o. for conclusion of a  cartel agreement, of this EUR
226,400 for VAS, s.r.o. and EUR 219,400 for N-ADOVA, s.r.o. The PMU agreed with the first-instance body and came to the conclusion that both companies breached the law, as at the beginning of 2007 both companies gradually terminated contracts with all producers of animal side products (slaughter houses, agricultural entities and meat processing companies), and the authorized representatives of these companies set up the company VAS-ADOVA, s.r.o. PMU spokeswoman Alexandra Bernathova informed that the joint company, operating under the trade name Asanacia, s.r.o. since May 1, 2008, was the only company to conclude new contracts with producers of animal side products. VAS, s.r.o. and N-ADOVA, s.r.o. are carcass disposal plants, which since the dissolution of the company Kafileria, a.s. Senec,
operate as the only ones in this area in Slovakia. The PMU decision took effect on July 21 of this year and no appeal can be lodged against it.
FOREX MARKET: Region Barely Moves Midweek

Regional currencies barely moved Wednesday. OTP Banka’s Juraj Mitosinka reported that the Czech crown was very stable as it “disregarded” the statements by the Czech Finance Minister, saying that the deficit of the Czech state budget would reach twofold projected levels. The Polish zloty and the Hungarian forint were calm as well. In the next few days, the Czech crown will move in a band from 25.700 CZK/EUR to 26.000 CZK/EUR. The Hungarian forint is expected to stay between 270.00 HUF/EUR and 275.00
HUF/EUR and the Polish zloty should be traded between 4.2500 PLN/EUR and 4.3000 PLN/EUR.
NCHZ Fined EUR 19.6 Mln. for  Cartel Agreement

The chemical company Novacke Chemicke Zavody, a.s. (NCHZ) and its former parent company 1. garantovana will have to pay a fine of EUR 19.6 million for cartel agreements with other  European chemical firms. The European Commission (EC) imposed fines of EUR 61.12 million in eight cases. The commission claims that penalized firms set prices and divided amongst themselves markets specialized
in pulverized calcium  acetylide, granulated  calcium  acetylide and granulated magnesium in a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA) between 2004 and 2007. Along with NCHZ, the commission further penalized the German firm Almamet, the Austrian firm Donau Chemie, the German-Austrian firm Ecka Granulate, the Slovenian energy company Holding Slovenske Elektrarne on behalf of its former affiliation TDR Metalurgija, the German company SKW Stahl Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques industries. The  cartel agreements also involved the Dutch-Swedish firm Akzo Nobel, but its fine of EUR 17.4 million was dropped as the company notified the commission of the cartel. NCHZ will pay the highest  fine.
Highway between Bratislava and Trnava to Be Extended by End of 2009

The D1 highway stretch between Bratislava and Trnava will be expanded to three lanes in both directions by the end of this year, said Prime Minister Robert Fico during an inspection day, on which he was informed about the course of the preparatory works. The investment, which required over SKK 1 billion, which is over EUR 33.2 million, should have been originally open in May of next year. As Prime Minister informed, the National Highway Company (NDS) reviewed the schedule of works in order to ensure that this highway stretch is handed over as soon as possible. The prime minister plans to soon visit the

Page 9 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
construction site of the D1 highway stretch near Povazska Bystrica, where the last missing highway stretch between Bratislava and Zilina is being built.
Taxpayers Submit over One Million Income Tax Returns

Tax entities submitted 1,084,407 income tax returns for last year as of mid-July of this year. For the first six months of last year, their number reached 981,900. According to the data released by Slovakia’s Tax Directorate, the most income tax returns were submitted by self-employed persons, namely 540,154. Private entities on employment contracts submitted 397,752 income tax returns, while the number of legal entities that submitted income tax returns for last year reached 146,501.
Interior Ministry Denies that Canceled Tender Was Tailored

The Interior Ministry denies that the annulled tender, at value of more than EUR 1 million for provision of translation and interpreting services, was tailor-made for one bidder. “We absolutely refute this," said the Interior Ministry spokesman Erik Tomas. The Public Procurement Office (UVO) ordered the Interior Ministry to cancel its public tender as a requirement for participation was defined in a discriminating manner, said spokeswoman of the UVO Helena Fialova.

BRATISLAVA, July 22, (SITA) – The chemical company Novacke Chemicke Zavody, a.s. (NCHZ) and its former parent company 1. garantovana will have to pay a fine of EUR 19.6 million for cartel agreements with other  European chemical firms. The European Commission (EC) imposed fines of EUR 61.12 million in eight cases. The  commission claims that penalized firms set prices and divided amongst themselves markets specialized in pulverized calcium  acetylide, granulated  calcium  acetylide and granulated magnesium in a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA) between 2004 and 2007. Along with NCHZ, the commission further penalized the German firm Almamet, the Austrian firm Donau Chemie, the German-Austrian firm Ecka Granulate, the Slovenian energy company Holding Slovenske Elektrarne on behalf of its former affiliation TDR Metalurgija, the German company SKW Stahl Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques industries.

TD
The cartel agreements also involved the Dutch-Swedish firm Akzo Nobel, but its  fine of EUR 17.4 million was dropped as the company notified the  commission of the cartel. NCHZ will pay the highest  fine.

NCHZ has not yet received the decision on the  fine, which is why the company is not going to comment on the issue for the time being. Neither NCHZ nor its legal representatives have received the official position of the  commission. Therefore, company representatives cannot provide a position to the verdict, according to company PR consultant Helena Hupkova. She added that NCHZ expects the verdict to arrive in the next few days. As Ms. Hupkova further added, the company would subsequently comment on the issue and inform the public as well as media of the steps it would take.

The cartel was damaging to industrial clients across Europe for several years. Commissioner for Economic Competition Neelie Kroes announced that the commission would not claim economic damages. The  commission launched probation into the case following unannounced inspections in January 2007, after the company Akzo Nobel filed for immunity pursuant to a leniency notice. The commission concluded that from April 2004 to January 2007, the  fined companies participated in a cartel across the entire EEA except for Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Great Britain.

The Cypriot firm Disor Holdings Limited became the 100-percent owner of NCHZ in the fall of 2008. The investor bought the Slovak exporter of chemical stuffs from companies clustered in the groups of 1. garantovana and Penta.

HD      EU Fines HSE Over Cartel Involvement of Subsidiary

Ljubljana, 22 July (STA) - The  European Commission on Wednesday imposed a
EUR 9.1m  fine on Slovenia's largest power producer, Holding Slovenske

TD
elektrarne (HSE), over the involvement of its former subsidiary TDR
Metalurgija in a cartel fixing of prices and sharing markets in the  calcium

carbide sector between 2004 and 2007.
The fine, which is part of a total penalty of around EUR 61m imposed on
nine European suppliers of calcium carbide and magnesium based reagents, is a result of an investigation which the  Commission launched in Austria,
Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia in January 2007.
"Industrial customers all over  Europe suffered from this  cartel for
several years. The  Commission will not tolerate such economic damage to

Europe's industrial base," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in
Brussels.
TDR Metalurgija is undergoing insolvency procedures and all of its 152 employees were laid off in April. Also insolvent is its current owner, W
& P Profil - Solarvalue Holding, which is why the  fine was imposed on
TDR's former owner, the HSE.
The HSE reacted to the news by rejecting the decision of the  Commission, saying the company had never and in any way been involved in the violations which it is being accused of.
Moreover, the  Commission has failed to prove that the HSE, as the majority owner of TDR, in fact exerted key influence on the business policies of its
subsidiary, which is why the HSE will challenge the decision at the

European Court of Justice.

BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The  European Commission on Wednesday said it has  fined nine chemical companies for fixing prices.

The European Union (EU)'s antitrust watchdog said in a statement that the total  fines amounted to more than 61 million  euros (87 million U.S. dollars) and targeted nine chemical companies, including Almamet, Donau Chemie and Ecka Granulate.

TD
Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands also participated in in the illegal cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the arrangements to the commission.
Investigations showed that between 2004 and 2007 the companies fixed prices and shared markets for
calcium carbide powder, calcium carbide granulates and magnesium granulates in the EU.

The combined markets of  calcium carbide powder, calcium  carbide granulates and magnesium granulates in the EU are estimated to be worth some 175 million euros (248 million U.S. dollars), according to the  commission.

(ADPnews) - Jul 22, 2009 - The  European Commission has imposed a EUR 13.3 million (USD
18.8m) fine on German steel firm SKW Stahl-Metallurgie Holding AG (ETR:SK1) over its involvement
in a calcium  carbide cartel.

The total  fine given to a group of nine  European companies in the calcium carbide sector, including also SKW's former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques Industries (ETR:AQU), is EUR 61 million.

TD
According to the European Commission, the companies fixed prices and shared markets for  calcium carbide powder, calcium  carbide granulates and magnesium granulates in a substantial part of the European Economic Area (EEA) between 2004 and 2007.

The fine for EvonikDegussa was increased by 50% because it had previously taken part in similar infringements.

SKW said that it would decide on whether to take legal action against the  fine after evaluating the written opinion of the EC.

BRUSSELS, July 22 (Reuters) -  European Union antitrust regulators imposed a combined  fine of 61 million euros ($87 million) on nine companies for forming a  calcium carbide cartel in breach of EU rules.

The cartel fixed prices and share markets for  calcium carbide powder and granules and magnesium granulates in a large part of the  European Economic Area between 2004 and 2007, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. The companies are Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske elektrarne, which formerly owned TDR Metalurgija), Novacke chemicke zavody and its former parent 1.garantovana, German steel industry supplier SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques industries.

Calcium carbine powder and magnesium granulates are used in the steel industry for desulphurisation or deoxidation purposes. Calcium carbine granulates are used for the production of acetylene, a welding gas.

Paint company Akzo Nobel was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the  cartel. EvonikDegussa saw its fine rise by 50 percent because of similar infringements in the past.
SKW Stahl-Mettalurgie was given a 13.3 million  euro fine. It shares were down 5.6 percent to 12.84
euros in mid-day trading. Akzo was 0.47 percent off at 33.73  euros. The DJ Stoxx chemicals index
<.SX4P> was 0.5 percent higher.

BRATISLAVA, July 23, (SITA) – The shareholder and the management of the chemical firm Novacke Chemicke Zavody, a.s. (NCHZ) are ready to bear the consequences of steps taken by the previous company management in 2004 and 2006. The company was  fined EUR 19.6 million by the  European      Commission for cartel agreements with other  European companies. Nonetheless, the introduced significant measures aim to preserve the company's position as an important chemical company in Slovakia and the EU, as the NCHZ assured its partners in its statement issued on Thursday. The management prepared thoroughly for the decision of the EC and adopted all measures so that no decision of the European Commission would threaten its uninterrupted operation, particularly the company's liabilities toward its partners and its ability to pay its creditors. The current management is distancing itself from the practices of  cartel agreements and has taken all possible steps to prevent the recurrence of such a situation.

TD
The chemical company Novacke Chemicke Zavody, a.s. (NCHZ) will have to pay a fine of EUR 19.6 million for a cartel agreement with other  European chemical firms. The European Commission (EC) imposed fines of EUR 61.12 million in eight cases. The commission claims that penalized firms set
prices and divided markets specialized in pulverized calcium  acetylide, granulated calcium  acetylide and granulated magnesium amongst themselves throughout a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA) between 2004 and 2007. Along with NCHZ, the  commission further penalized the German firm Almamet, the Austrian firm Donau Chemie, the German-Austrian firm Ecka Granulate, the Slovenian energy company Holding Slovenske Elektrarne on behalf of its former affiliation TDR Metalurgija, the German company SKW Stahl Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques industries. The  cartel agreement also involved the Dutch-Swedish firm of Akzo Nobel, but its  fine of EUR
17.4 million was dropped as the company notified the  commission of the cartel. NCHZ will pay the highest fine.

The Cypriot firm Disor Holdings Limited became the 100-percent owner of NCHZ in the fall of 2008. The investor bought the Slovak exporter of chemicals from companies clustered in the groups of 1. garantovana and Penta.

EU regulators yesterday  fined seven chemical companies a total e61 million (R681m) for fixing the price of calcium carbide, a chemical used to make steel. Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands escaped a  fine because it blew the whistle on the cartel, which included firms based in Slovakia, Slovenia and
Germany, the European Commission said. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said industrial customers all over Europe suffered from the  cartel from 2004 to 2007. Novacke got the highest  fine of E19.6m. – AP

Pfizer’s second-quarter profit plunged 19 percent, as the strong dollar hit revenue, and higher taxes and costs for its buying of rival Wyeth hurt the bottom line, the drug giant said yesterday. Still, Pfizer slightly raised this year’s profit forecast. Its net income was $2.26 billion (R17.7bn), compared with $2.78bn
from last year. – AP

HD      CHEMICALS : STIFF FINES FOR CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM CARTEL WC     389 words

Nine European companies have been fined a total of €61,120,000 for taking part for three years in a cartel that harmonised prices and divided up the market for  calcium carbide and magnesium reagents. These practices violate the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices under the EC Treaty (Article
81). Commenting on the  European Commission's decision, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes stated, on 22 July, that "industrial customers all over  Europe suffered from this  cartel for several years. The Commission will not tolerate such economic damage to  Europe's industrial base".
The following  fines were imposed:

TD
- Almamet (Germany): €3,040,000
- Donau Chemie (Austria): €5,000,000
- Ecka Granulate (Germany/Austria): €6,400,000
- Novácke chemické závody and 1. garantovaná (Slovakia): €19,600,000
- SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and ARQUES Industries (Germany): €13,300,000
- EvonikDegussa (Germany): €4,680,000 (of which €1,040,000 jointly with SKW Stahl-Metallurgie)(1)
- HSE (Slovenia): €9,100,000

- Although Akzo Nobel (Netherlands/Sweden) also took part, it was not  fined because the company came forward with information on the  cartel to the Commission (otherwise it would have been  fined
€17,400,000).

Between April 2004 and January 2007, the companies set prices and shared markets for calcium carbide powder and granulates as well as  magnesium granulates in a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA). These chemical products are used in metalworks to remove oxygen and sulphur impurities. In  Europe, the market is worth €175 million.

The Commission's investigation began with surprise inspections in January 2007, prompted by an application for immunity lodged by Akzo Nobel under the 2002 leniency notice.
In setting the amounts of the  fines, the Commission took into account the respective affected sales of
the companies involved as well as the very serious nature of the infringement and the geographical scope
of the cartel agreements. It increased the fines for Akzo Nobel by 100% and for EvonikDegussa by 50%
because these firms had already been fined by the Commission for previous cartels. It also took
account of the cooperation of Donau Chemie and EvonikDegussa during the investigation, reducing their
fines by 35% and 20%, respectively.
(1) EvonikDegussa's  fine was increased by 50% due to its earlier participation in similar arrangements.

Nine European companies have been fined more than €61m ($87m) for operating a price and market-fixing cartel over calcium  carbide power and other materials used in the steel industry.
The European Commission said the cartel covered calcium carbide power, calcium  carbide
granulates and magnesium granulates across "a substantial part" of the European Union.

TD
According to the regulator, the  cartel lasted from 2004 to 2007 and covered all the "European Economic Area" countries except Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the UK. The participants met at hotels and company premises in Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Slovenia.

Groups involved in the  cartel included Akzo Nobel; Germany's Almamet; Austria's Donau Chemie; Slovenia's Holding Slovenske Elektrarne in respect of its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija; Slovakia's Novacke chemicke zavody and its former parent 1.garantonvana; Germany's SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies, EvonikDegussa and Arques Industries.
Akzo Nobel will pay no  fine because it blew the whistle on the  cartel. Nikki Tait, Brussels

HD        EU busts cartel in steelmaking inputs

European steel companies may seek damages from suppliers of certain input materials after the
European Commission found they had been operating an illegal  cartel to fix prices and share markets.

The Brussels-based competition authority yesterday imposed fines totalling €61m ($87m) on nine companies for rigging the market in  calcium carbide and magnesium granulates. These are used in steelmaking for deoxidation and desulphurisation.

TD
Fines were imposed on Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (for its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija), Novácke Chemické Závody and its former parent 1.Garantovaná, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques Industries.

Akzo Nobel also participated in the  cartel but was not  fined because it revealed the existence of the lawbreaking to the authorities, prompting a series of surprise raids by  Commission officials on company premises in January 2007.
The Commission says that the  cartel operated between April 2004 and 2007 across  Europe except for
Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the UK. Participants drew up a  market-sharing table named “the Bible”,
and held meetings to collude on prices and allocate customers.

Any firm affected by this anti-competitive behaviour “may bring the matter before the courts of the (EU) member states and seek damages,” the  Commission said. Such damages may not be reduced on account of the  fines imposed yesterday, it added in a statement obtained by Steel Business Briefing.

Novaky, July 24 (TASR) - The current management of Slovakchemical enterprise Novacke Chemicke Zavody (NCHZ) hasn't gone alongwith the practice of concluding  cartel agreements in the past andthey have taken all the necessary steps to prevent such a situationarising again, reads a statement provided to TASR on Friday by thecurrent NCHZ management board.

NCHZ is one of nine European producers of calcium  carbide to befined earlier this week by the European Commission (EC) forinvolvement in a cartel agreement between 2004 and 2007. Claimingthat company representatives met at least 12 times in order to dividethe market among themselves and agree on increasing the prices fortheir products, EC  fined the companies by 61 million in total. NCHZand its former parent company 1. Garantovana has to pay 19.6 million.

TD
The managerial board stresses in its statement that sinceJanuary 2007, when EC carried out an inspection in NCHZ, theenterprise has been fully co-operating with the institution and hasprovided all the documents required.

According to the statement, NCHZ has prepared itself for EC'sdecision and adopted all the necessary measures, so that it could notendanger the operation of the company, and especially commitments tothe business partners and solvency toward all creditors.

The current, 100-percent shareholder of NCHZ - Cypriot investorDisor Holdings Limited - is ready to bear the consequences of theformer management's activities between 2004 and 2006. They assure alltheir business partners that the measures taken recently pursue theonly objective - to maintain NCHZ's position on the market.

SROT RESIGNS AS PIVOVARNA LASKO CEO; SUPERVISORS APPOINT ZORKO NEW BOSS
The supervisory board of beverage group Pivovarna Lasko accepted on Thursday, 23 July, the resignation of the company's CEO Bosko Srot and appointed Dusan Zorko the new boss. The company said that Srot had tendered his resignation because of business interests. According to dailies Finance
and Dnevnik, Srot's resignation was requested by the group's creditors as a condition for saving the healthy core of the group. Srot's term would have ended in November 2010.
Zorko, who previously headed the group's brewery Pivovarna Union, took over on Friday, 24 July. Lasko's new CEO told the 24ur.com news portal that he would probably sell off all of the company's investments that are not needed for business. "I am talking about certain stakes in Mercator, as
well as dailies Delo and Vecer," he said.
The chief supervisor of Pivovarna Lasko, Tone Turnsek, told STA on
Friday, 24 July, that the resignation of Srot was the only possible
solution given the developments around the company and the requests of the creditors.
Srot controls 55% of Lasko through a chain of holdings, and is to remain the majority owner, and the supervisors hope that cooperation with the owners will continue to be as successful, he told STA. Turnsek, like Zorko, would sell the companies which are not connected to the basic activity - Delo and Vecer, and would retain a non-controlling stake in Mercator. The latter would allow Lasko to sell its products through Mercator, he added.
MURA'S WORKERS DEMAND SALVATION OF COMPANY

Some 1,000 people gathered in front of the government palace on Thursday,
23 July, demanding that the troubled apparel maker Mura be saved. After a five minute silence the workers and supporters of the company clenched their fists and raised them above their heads. The protesters, hailing "for Mura" and "for victory in the battle for Mura", were joined by
representatives of other companies and Human Rights Ombudsman Zdenka Cebasek Travnik. The representatives of the government, which was in its regular weekly session at the time, did not meet the protesters, even
though such a meeting was on the agenda.
Economy Minister Matej Lahovnik meanwhile said after the cabinet session that the state-owned SOD fund had held intensive talks with potential investors in new Mura. He believes that a private investor could be found
by the end of the moth. He added that all potential investors had made it clear that they were not interested in investing into Mura in its present form, since this would bring no results long-term.
KRESAL DECIDES TO SACK INSPECTOR OVER JANSA WEDDING CASE Interior Minister Katarina Kresal reacted on Monday, 20 July, to the
launch of proceedings against Janez Jansa over the opposition leader's alleged use of an unlicensed private security company at his wedding by announcing the sacking of the chief inspector for interior affairs. Kresal told the press that chief inspector Mateja Rokvic would be replaced on 1
September, because the inspectorate's activities in the recent period had shown it was lacking a clear set of priorities.
The decision came only a day after the opposition Democrats (SDS) reported on their website that the ministry had launched proceedings against SDS president Jansa over the private security service he allegedly
used at his wedding on 4 July. While Jansa denied having used any security company, Kresal stressed today that she found out about the case from the media.
Rokvic also addressed the press, stressing that the proceedings were not directed against Jansa but against the private security company. She confirmed that the launch of proceedings was promoted by media reports, which suggested that "security agents were at the wedding, that they were rude to journalists, that they protected the church and, as some footage suggests, also the person of mister Janez Jansa".
PETROL SUPERVISORS APPOINT NEW MANAGEMENT

Tuesday, 21 July, four new members of the management board and chairman designate Aleksander Svetelsek the company's new CEO.

The European Commission on Wednesday, 22 July, imposed a EUR 9.1m  fine on
Slovenia's largest power producer, Holding Slovenske elektrarne (HSE), over the involvement of its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija in a  cartel fixing
of prices and sharing markets in the  calcium carbide sector between 2004 and 2007. The  fine, which is part of a total penalty of around EUR 61m
imposed on nine European suppliers of calcium carbide and magnesium based

reagents, is a result of an investigation which the  Commission launched in
Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Slovenia in January 2007.
The HSE, which now has three months to pay the  fine directly to the

Commission, rejected the decision, saying the company had never and in any
way been involved in the violations which it is being accused of, and announced it would challenge the decision at the  European Court of Justice. FIRST MASS SWINE FLU INFECTION IN SLOVENIA CONFIRMED

The decline of the Slovak economy in the first quarter of this year by 5.6 percent does not necessarily mean that the country's economy has already hit bottom, the latest edition of the journal Biatec of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) suggests. Officials of the central bank thus admit that this year’s economic development may be even worse than the latest NBS prognosis from June indicates. It expected a y/y drop in GDP by 4.2 percent. Biatec writes that the latest prediction was based on the most recent data from March that indicated that the fall would stop. However, further published monthly data for April showed that the economic development could be even worse than presented in the updated prediction, writes Biatec.
Kia Launches Serial Production of a New Kia cee'd Version

Carmaker Kia Motors Slovakia recently launched serial production of a new version of its car Kia cee’d. The company further informed that the manufactured cars will be exported from the plant near Zilina to forty European countries and seventeen countries outside  Europe. Local customers will have the opportunity to order the new model of the Kia cee’d car from the end of September of this year. “Production of the Kia cee’d model in our plant lasted more than two and a half years. During that time, we manufactured over
345,000 of these cars, which were placed on markets in all  European countries. We believe that the new version of the cee’d model will strengthen the sales of the Kia make and attract new customers,” stated the company’s spokesman, Dusan Dvorak.

Economy Ministry Reports: 18,000 Jobs Endangered Due to Crisis

The global economic crisis is currently threatening 17,775 jobs in Slovakia through planned layoffs. According to information provided by the Economy Ministry on the current development of impacts of the financial crisis on Slovak companies in the 29th week of this year, of the total number of endangered jobs by announced layoffs of 36,291 since January, 18,516 have been actually laid off. “No employer announced a mass layoff in the monitored week”, stated the ministry.

Eurostat:  Drop in Industrial Orders in Slovakia among Worst in EU

New industrial orders in Slovakia decreased by 33.4 percent year-on-year in May, which was the sixth deepest y/y fall within the  European Union (EU). Estonia reported the biggest drop of 39.8 percent, followed by Finland (39.6 percent) and Lithuania (38.5 percent). Slovenia and Greece also posted bigger decrease than Slovakia. Nevertheless, all the EU countries that made their data available to  Eurostat,  the
Statistical Office of the  European Communities, reported decline in industrial orders. Ireland had the lowest drop of 9.3 percent, followed by Great Britain (11.3 percent) and Poland (15.4 percent),  Eurostat  informed on Wednesday. Industrial orders within the whole EU shrank 28 percent y/y in May, while the drop within
the eurozone reached 30.1 percent y/y.
Government Prepares Projects of EUR 3.5 Mln. for Eastern Slovakia

The Slovak Government is ready to help districts in eastern Slovakia with about EUR 3.5 million. The Cabinet prepared projects for the districts of Bardejov, Stropkov and Svidnik, which should improve their social and economic situation. The projects were submitted by the Economy Ministry as an analysis and the Cabinet was to have dealt with them already at its meeting in Svidnik last week; however, the Svidnik meeting was adjourned due to Prime Minister Robert Fico’s health problems. The government suggests also helping the region with regard to the increasing unemployment rate, which, for example, in the District of Svidnik, rose from 16.5 percent in January to 21.3 percent in May.
Procurement Office Finds Interior Ministry's Tender Discriminatory

The Public Procurement Office (UVO) has ordered the Interior Ministry to cancel its public tender to select a contractor for provision of translation and interpreting services worth over EUR 1 million. “The requirement for participation, regarding provision of recommendations, was defined in a discriminating manner and was inappropriate regarding the subject matter of the contract,” explained UVO spokeswoman Helena Fialova. “The office apparently found our requirements strict,” said the ministry’s spokesman Erik Tomas. According to him, the ministry would announce a new tender, but did not specify a date.
This Year’s Grain Harvest Expected Lower than last Year

This year’s grain harvest in Slovakia will be lower than last year. Head of the Union of Fodder Producers, Storage and Trade Companies (ZVKSaOS) Marian Uhrik told journalists that there are two factors behind the expected lower harvest: lower sown area and lower crop per hectare. Though wheat planted area increased by 5,900 hectares, or 9.5 percent from last year, barley planted area was reduced by 17,000 hectares., which is 10.7 percent less than last year. Maize planted area contracted by 14,600 hectares or
10 percent compared with 2008. Due to the expected lower crop per hectare this year, wheat harvest
should drop 15.4 percent, or 280,000 tons compared with last year. In case of barley, a 25-percent y/y drop
is expected, which means harvest 223,000 tons lower. Maize harvest should shrink 218,000 tons from a
year ago, which accounts for a 17.3 percent drop. Estimated harvest of rape seed this year should fall to by
about 47,000 tons or a 11-percent shortfall y/y. The only agricultural commodity, in case of which a
moderately higher harvest is expected is sunflower. Its harvest should go up approximately 8 percent, i.e.
15,000 tons from a year ago.
NCHZ Fined EUR 19.6 Mln. for  Cartel Agreement

The chemical company Novacke Chemicke Zavody, a.s. (NCHZ) and its former parent company 1. garantovana will have to pay a fine of EUR 19.6 million for cartel agreements with other  European chemical firms. The European Commission (EC) imposed fines of EUR 61.12 million in eight cases. The commission claims that penalized firms set prices and divided amongst themselves markets specialized in pulverized calcium  acetylide, granulated  calcium  acetylide and granulated magnesium in a large part of the European Economic Area (EEA) between 2004 and 2007. Along with NCHZ, the commission further penalized the German firm Almamet, the Austrian firm Donau Chemie, the German-Austrian firm Ecka Granulate, the Slovenian energy company Holding Slovenske Elektrarne on behalf of its former affiliation TDR Metalurgija, the German company SKW Stahl Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques industries. The  cartel agreements also involved the Dutch-Swedish firm Akzo

Nobel, but its  fine of EUR 17.4 million was dropped as the company notified the  commission of the cartel. NCHZ will pay the highest  fine.
Highway between Bratislava and Trnava to Be Extended by End of 2009

The D1 highway stretch between Bratislava and Trnava will be expanded to three lanes in both directions by the end of this year, said Prime Minister Robert Fico during an inspection day, on which he was informed about the course of the preparatory works. The investment, which required over SKK 1 billion, which is over EUR 33.2 million, should have been originally open in May of next year. As Prime Minister informed, the National Highway Company (NDS) reviewed the schedule of works in order to ensure that this highway stretch is handed over as soon as possible. The prime minister plans to soon visit the
construction site of the D1 highway stretch near Povazska Bystrica, where the last missing highway stretch between Bratislava and Zilina is being built.

PSS Plans to Make up to almost 200,000 New Contracts this Year

Slovakia’s largest home savings bank, Prva Stavebna Sporitelna (PSS), plans to conclude 199,400 contracts this year. Their number would thus grow by 20.2 percent from last year when the company signed
165,862 deals. The total volume of target sums is estimated at EUR 1.96 billion on the expected average target sum of EUR 9,800. Clients’ deposits should achieve around EUR 478 million this year. PSS plans to provide almost 27,000 loans and interim loans and loans for corporate entities provided from sources other than the home saving fund.
Some Segments of the Economy in Slovakia Report Rising Demand

Some segments of the economy in Slovakia have already reported increased demand, stated members of the Economy Ministry’s monitoring committee. According to them, in particular the area of electrotechnical industry registers rising demand. Also, the demand for staff is growing related to increased production in automakers Volkswagen, Kia and PSA Peugeot in Slovakia. “The growth rate of unemployment is decelerating. It is not as fast as it was in January, February or March. Volkswagen [Slovakia], according to our information, is even hiring back the people it laid off earlier. Samsung and Sony are also reporting [existing] demand for TV sets at least until the end of the year. By that, I want to say that Slovakia has good crisis measures and the situation is balanced in the fight against crisis,” said the committees chairman Vojtech Ferencz.
Youth Unemployment in Slovakia is Higher than EU Average

Unemployment among young people aged 15 - 24 in Slovakia reached 22 percent in the first quarter of this year, which is more than the EU average of 18.3 percent and the  euro zone average of 18.4 percent. Nine EU countries had higher youth unemployment than Slovakia. The highest figure was reported by Spain (33.6 percent), Lithuania (28.2 percent) and Italy (24.9 percent). France, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia, Greece and Sweden reported higher youth unemployment than Slovakia, too, informed  Eurostat,  the Statistical Office of the  European Communities
Crisis May Hit Slovakia Harder than Neighboring Countries

The Slovak economy may be hit by the world economic crisis to a greater extent than the economies of other countries in the CEE region. “Estimates of economic growth already imply that the impact of the economic slowdown on Slovakia, as a small and export-oriented economy, may be deeper than on larger countries in the region,” stated director of Deloitte Slovakia financial consulting Maros Sokolovsky. He pointed out that Slovakia is a relatively small market in comparison to other countries, with a fewer number of companies that may be potentially interesting for private equity investors, for example. A slight change in investors’ perception of the situation is implied by the development of the private capital confidence index elaborated by the company Deloitte, which rose 30 points from the lowest level six months ago. “The rise in the confidence index indicates that from a period of high caution we have shifted to a period of increased activity aimed at evaluation of potential investment opportunities,” said Mr. Sokolovsky.
Slovak and Czech Power Markets to be Interconnected as of September

The national electric energy markets in the Czech Republic and Slovakia will be interconnected as of September. The interconnection of the day-ahead power markets will be carried out by the company Operator Trhu s Elektrinou (OTE), a.s. in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia by the Slovak electric energy transmission network operator SEPS, a.s. in cooperation with the Czech CEPS, a.s. As of August 31 of this year, it will be possible to satisfy the demand for purchase or sale of electricity of registered market players in both countries from the neighboring market spot on the following day. There will be no need to acquire transmission capacity representing the volume set for market transmission, informed the SEPS, a.s. The

registration of existing players on the daily power market in the Czech and Slovak Republic will be preserved.
Competition-Law Infringement Proceedings against Slovakia Halted

The European Commission (EC) closed the infringement proceedings against the Slovak Republic related to the Slovak law on the protection of economic competition. The  European Commission is satisfied with the amendments implemented by Slovakia and considers the legislation to be in order. It is satisfied that
the amendment of and changes to the law led to its absolute compliance with legal rules of the  European Union (EU). The law enables the Antitrust Office to apply the antitrust rules of the EU in e-communications, energy and postal services. The commission, therefore, closed its infringement proceedings against Slovakia, states a report by the EC. The commission initiated infringement proceedings because one provision in the law’s previous wording limited the competence of the Slovak Antitrust Office to apply rules banning cartel agreements and other restrictive business methods, including abuse of dominant market position. This provision was eliminated after the commission sent a reasoned opinion to Slovakia in accordance with steps taken if legal norms of the European Communities are violated, requesting the law to be amended. There are now no restrictions to the application of the EU's rules on economic competition by the Slovak Antitrust Office.

Slovenske Elektrarne Launched Other Investments along NPP EMO

Slovakia’s dominant electric energy producer Slovenske Elektrarne, a.s. (SE) has kicked off more investments projects in addition to the completion of the third and fourth units in the Mochovce nuclear power plant (EMO). SE spokesperson Juraj Kopriva told SITA news agency that the power producer is focusing on capacity increase in V2 Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear power plans and a project of biomass
co-burning on the Vojany thermal power plant. Renovation of Novaky and Vojany thermal power plants and construction of small hydropower plants are also under way, according to the spokesman. Slovenske Elektrarne, in which the Italian energy company Enel holds a 66-percent stake, plans to invest about EUR
3.3 billion in Slovakia.
Slovakia Used EUR 900 Mln. to Support 83 Investment Projects 2001-2009

Successive Slovak governments provided investment incentives to 83 projects between 2001 and May of this year. According to Economy Ministry’s report on provided incentives, their volume totaled SKK 27.135 billion (EUR 900.7 million). Cabinets under prime ministers Mikulas Dzurinda and Robert Fico also provided investment stimuli in  euros, in a volume of EUR 63.4 million. Thanks to the supported projects, 33,442 new jobs were created.
Bratislava Customs Office Collected over half of 2008 Tax Revenues

The Bratislava-based Customs Office collected more than half of taxes collected by the customs administration last year. The annual report of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (CR SR) says that customs offices in the Bratislava County collected EUR 2.273 billion in taxes which made up 53
percent of the overall collection at EUR 4.308 billion. This high portion on the overall collection relates to several factors and facts. The local Custom Office is among the biggest considering the number of its offices. Moreover, important production and trade companies such as the crude-oil refiner Slovnaft, the carmaker Volkswagen Bratislava and many other trade companies fall under its jurisdiction, reads the annual report.
U.S. Steel Kosice One of 'Dirty Thirty' CO2 Emitters in the EU in '08

One of the largest producers of greenhouse gasses in the  European Union (EU) is the company U.S. Steel Kosice (USSK) in eastern Slovakia. According to data released by the  European Commission, the company discharged into the atmosphere nine million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) last year, which placed
it in 23rd place on the chart of largest producers of greenhouse gasses in the EU. Nevertheless, the volume of CO2 emissions last year was lower than a year ago, when USSK discharged 9.7 million tons and ranked nineteenth on the chart. The reason behind the reduction was the economic and financial crisis, which affected the steelworks' output, informed the company’s manager for relations with media Lubomira Soltesova. She explained that during production of iron and steel, carbon is consumed, and thus CO2 emissions are directly related to the volume of production.
Analysts Expect GDP Contraction to Deepen Further in Q2

Bank analysts expect that the contraction of the Slovak economy in the second quarter of this year will be probably deeper than 5.6-percent reported in the first quarter. Their prognoses in a regular survey of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) confirm this, as they prognosticated in July an annual real contraction in
Page 59 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the second quarter by 5.9 percent on average. They thus further reduced their outlook from the previous month when they prognosticated a 5.7 percent GDP decline for the second quarter on average. However, the range of predictions by individual banks speaks about a high level of uncertainty in the prognoses. While the most optimistic bank analysts expects a drop by a mere 4.8 percent, the biggest pessimists predict the fall as deep as 7.7 percent Bank analysts’ outlooks for this year are gloomier as well for the whole year of 2009. The Slovak economy should contract by 5.3 percent according to the July round of the survey while in June analysts estimated a y/y 5.1 percent fall on average.
FOREX MARKET: Firming of Regional Currencies against  Euro Accelerates

The appreciation of regional currencies against the  euro accelerated on Friday. OTP Banka dealer Juraj Mitosinka told SITA that the Czech crown, Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty posted firming against the euro on Friday. The Czech crown already broke through the technical level of 25.50 CZK/EUR on Friday, which was not expected on the market on Thursday. “Similarly, the Polish zloty managed to firm below the psychological level of 4.200 PLN/EUR and the Hungarian forint below 270.00 HUF/EUR,” said the dealer. With regard to regional currencies, he expects “a positive sentiment” to persist on the market in the upcoming days. “Nevertheless, correction of exchange rates must come soon,” added Mr. Mitosinka.
State Health Insurers Report Lower Revenues than Budgeted

The state-run health insurance company Vseobecna Zdravotna Poistovna (VsZP) will have to cope with lower revenues than budgeted. Its revenues for the first six months of this year amounted to EUR 978.782 million, compared to the budgeted EUR 1.030 billion. The shortfall represents around 5 percent. However, revenues of VsZP grew by around 4.3 percent y/y. Another state-run health insurance company Spolocna Zdravotna Poistovna (SZP) posted H1 revenues equaling over 46 percent of the budgeted revenues.

After a 2-year enquiry, 9  European companies have been fined a total of EUR 61.12 M for violating European competition laws by operating a  cartel on the calcium  carbide market. The  Commission believes that the  cartel and restrictive commercial practices (such as price- and market-fixing) ran between 2004-2007.. The  European market for calcium carbide is worth EUR 175 M/y. Akzo Nobel, Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Novacke Chemicke Zavody, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and TDR Metalurgija were found guilty of carving up the European powdered calcium carbide market (except in
Portugal, Spain, Ireland and the UK). The cartel adversely influenced the market for granulated  calcium   carbide (used in acetylene production) and the market for granulated  magnesium (used as a substitute for calcium  carbide powder). TDR Metalurgija's former parent company Slovenske Elektrame and SKW Stahl-Metallurgie's former owners Arques Industries and Evonik were also  fined.

TD
Evonik's  fine was increased by 50% because of the German's group's participation in another  cartel concerning animal feed. Akzo Nobel (which had already been found guilty of taking part in several cartels) had its fine doubled to EUR 17 M, although this was waived because the group informed the
Commission of the cartel's existence. A bar chart illustrates the size of the  fine imposed on each of the companies.

European Steel chemical firms  fined

The European Commission has fined seven chemical companies a total of €61m ($87m) for operating price-fixing cartels in certain chemicals used by the steel industry. The firms, including Germany's Almamet, Ecka Granulate, EvonikDegussa, SKW Stahl Metallurgie and ARQUES Industries, Slovakia's Novacke Chemicke and 1.garantovana and Slovenia's HSE were found to have fixed prices and shared markets for calcium carbide powder, calcium  carbonate granulates and magnesium granulates between 2004 and 2007. Dutch chemical group AkzoNobel participated but was not fined because it informed the  commission about the  cartel's existence.

DuPont underlying Q2 net profit down by 48%

US chemical major DuPont's underlying second-quarter (Q2) net profits were down by 48% year on year to $558m (€391m) on 22% lower sales of $6.9bn as demand for key products remained depressed. Earnings per share (EPS) of 61 cents came in 8 cents ahead of Wall Street estimates. "Our aggressive actions to improve productivity and reduce costs across the company are paying off as we contend with continued weak demand in key segments," said CEO Ellen Kullman. The firm reaffirmed a 2009 EPS outlook of $1.70-2.10.
Wall Street offers mixed views on DuPont

Wall Street offered mixed outlooks following US chemical major DuPont's second-quarter earnings. JPMorgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas raised his 2009 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by five cents, to
$1.75, and his 2010 forecast by 10 cents, to $2.10. However, Jefferies & Co. analyst Laurence Alexander cut his 2010 EPS estimate by 50 cents, to $1.85, while maintaining his 2009 EPS forecast of $1.70. "Our revised estimate assumes a slower recovery in most end-markets," said Alexander.
HIP Petrohemija to lay off 852 employees
Debt-ridden Serbian petrochemical producer HIP Petrohemija will lay off 852 employees from its
2,300-strong workforce as part of its restructuring. The company had previously targeted 500
redundancies. It said that the extra job losses were necessary to encourage the state to provide soft loans
that would aid the company's survival.
Lyondell creditors get approval to sue execs

A US bankruptcy court approved a creditors' lawsuit against the lenders, former board members and officers of Lyondell Chemical, who are accused of driving the company into bankruptcy in roughly a year after its merger with Basell. The lawsuit names several prominent officers in the merged
Netherlands-based chemical firm LyondellBasell Industries, including Ed Dineen, chief operating officer; Alan Bigman, chief financial officer; and Bart de Jong, president of the North American operations. Also named are Leonard Blavatnik and his industrial group, Access Industries. Access owned Basell at the time of the merger.
Poland increases scope of privatization plans

Poland has expanded its 2009-2010 national privatization program, with major stakes in fertilizer, titanium dioxide and biofuel producers a key element of the plan, the Polish treasury ministry said. Analysts said

the extent of the program, with ministers now targeting receipts of up to zlotych (Zl) 30bn ($9.9bn, €7.0bn)
for 2009-2010, instead of Zl15bn-20bn, surprised the markets. A minority stake in the second-largest
Polish refiner and biofuels producer, Grupa Lotos, was among the assets newly announced as available to
investors.
Oltchim rescue plan cleared by council

The Romanian government's rescue plan for indebted state chemical producer Oltchim does not amount to unfair state aid, the country's Competition Council said. The ruling will go to the EU Competition Commission, which must now give its view on the crisis package, which is worth around €434m ($620m). Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc said Oltchim was a strategic company and large employer that
required assistance to help it "remain a powerful industry in Romania's economy."
Toagosei to focus on synthetic hCI

Japanese producer Toagosei has decided to close the ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinylidene chloride units at its Tokushima plant, as part of a shift to synthetic hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. "These businesses have been unprofitable for us, and they don't have a bright future," a company official said. Production will stop at the end of 2009. Toagosei has decided to use chlorine to produce more synthetic HCl instead of organic solvents. The firm is increasing its synthetic HCl capacity at Tokushima from
50,000 tonnes/year to 110,000-120,000 tonnes/year by September.
Air Products Q3 net falls 24%; to cut jobs
US-based industrial gases firm Air Products posted a 24% year-on-year decline in underlying earnings to
$225m on 28% lower sales of $2bn. Earnings per share of $1.05 came in 7 cents ahead of Wall Street
estimates. The company said it would cut about 1,150 jobs across the global workforce and close some
plants to reduce costs. "While we are still seeing the impact of the global recession on our volumes, we've
seen signs of improvement during this quarter in some of our end-markets, particularly in Electronics and
Asia," said CEO John McGlade.
Genencor eyes textile processing market

Dutch enzyme producer Genencor wants to expand into the $18bn (€12.7bn) textile and garment processing market by replacing other chemicals with its enzymes, said Glenn Nedwin, vice president, technical enzymes, who presented at the BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology and Bioprocessing in Montreal, Canada. "Enzymes account for just about 1% of the whole global textile chemical processing. This is a huge potential market for us," he said. Nedwin said Genencor's
<i>PrimaGreen</i> product line would benefit the textile-processing industry by replacing harsh chemicals, lowering temperatures for textile processing, decreasing water consumption and reducing waste and
water emissions.
Lonza net profit down by 56% in first half

Swiss fine chemicals firm Lonza posted a 56% drop in net profit for the first half of the year to Swiss franc (Swfr) 118m (€78m, $110m). Group sales dropped by 9% to Swfr1.33bn. The company attributed the weaker performance to the "nature of its Custom Manufacturing business model," along with a slowdown in parts of the Life Science Ingredients segment.
ADM to start two US bio-based plants in Q4

US agribusiness major Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) will start its new bio-based propylene glycol (PG) facility in Illinois, as well as a bioplastic facility in Iowa in the fourth quarter (Q4). Its new facility in Decatur, Illinois, will have the capability to produce 100,000 tonnes/year of PG made from glycerin, said Todd Werpy, vice president of ADM's advanced biofuels and chemicals business, at the BIO World Congress
on Industrial Biotechnology. The company's new bioplastic facility in Clinton, Iowa, meanwhile, will start producing polyhydroxyalkanoate plastic with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes/year. ADM is producing the bioplastic in a joint venture with biotechnology company Metabolix.
Shell continues sale talks on refineries

UK-based energy major Shell is continuing talks with potential buyers for two of its German refineries near Hamburg, but would not confirm a report that a sale could be concluded by early next year, said company spokesman Rainer Winzenried. Selling the refineries at Hamburg-Harburg and at Heide in Germany's northern Schleswig-Holstein state remained the priority, rather than closing them down. The two refineries employ over 1,000 workers in total.

natgas shortage chokes Argentina petchems

Several producers in an Argentine petrochemical complex are contending with natural gas cutbacks, as the government rations supplies during the southern hemisphere winter. "Even though the industry in general has not been working to its full extent - due to lower demand - and the winter season has not been very cold, the gas supply cutbacks continue to happen. This is a sign of the seriousness of the energy situation in Argentina," said Nestor Ramirez, general manager of local chemical producer Carboclor.
Bms to consolidate US polycarbonate units

German chemical firm Bayer MaterialScience (BMS) has decided to relocate US production of the company's polycarbonate (PC) and PC-blend films to Whately, Massachusetts, from its current facility in Berlin, Connecticut. The company expects the move to be complete by the end of 2009. The Berlin site employs about 20 people, and some of them will be offered positions at the Whately facility. The films are used in instrument panels, trade show displays, membrane switches, control panels and decals.
Bisphenol A is safe, says California government

A committee of California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment declined to put bisphenol A (BPA) on a list of chemicals that could cause reproductive harm. The judgment permits the continued use and sale of BPA in the most populous US state.

Sinopec H1 ethylene output dips by 10%

China's biggest oil refiner Sinopec produced 10% less ethylene in the first half of the year at 2.97m tonnes, with its crackers running at 94% capacity. Production may have declined due to cracker maintenance shutdowns, said analysts
Sinopec exec gets death sentence with reprieve

A former chairman of Asian refiner Sinopec has received a suspended death sentence from China for accepting about $28.66m (€20.35m) in bribes. Tonghai Chen was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in a verdict given by Beijing's No. 2 intermediate court. A suspended death penalty can be commuted to life in jail, and then 20 years in prison or less, if the court believes the person has repented.
dow highlights algae-based chemicals

Algae as a chemical feedstock looks promising, said Steve Gluck, scientific leader for US-based Dow Chemical's environmental technology center. Algae producers can turn low volumes into high-margin opportunities in chemicals like they did in the health food sector, he said at the BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology and Bioprocessing.
DuPont to oversee glycol plant closure

Lyondell Chemical said that US major DuPont would oversee the closure of their jointly held ethylene glycol (EG) plant in Beaumont, Texas, US. Lyondell is a US subsidiary of bankrupt Netherlands-based LyondellBasell Industries. The plans for the shutdown need approval from the bankruptcy court. Lyondell subsidiary Equistar and DuPont operated the plant under the PD Glycol joint venture. The plant ceased operations after Hurricane Ike made landfall in September 2008 and damaged the plant.
Pinnacle aims to strengthen PP brand
US polypropylene (PP) producer Pinnacle Polymers' new distribution agreements with four North
American resellers will strengthen the company's brand by ensuring that less material is sold as generic or
distributor-branded resin, said CEO Jerry Theys. "We have a much more advanced product list than our
competitors in terms of impact and random copolymer, and if we sell it through a known format, then our
customers will benefit," he said. Pinnacle previously sold resin through 10-15 resellers in North America,
but now it has narrowed the field through formal agreements with Pure Polymers, Entec Polymers,
Longhorn Polymers and SM Polymers.

European Steel chemical firms  fined

The European Commission has fined seven chemical companies a total of €61m ($87m) for operating price-fixing cartels in certain chemicals used by the steel industry. The firms, including Germany's Almamet, Ecka Granulate, EvonikDegussa, SKW Stahl Metallurgie and ARQUES Industries, Slovakia's Novacke Chemicke and 1.garantovana and Slovenia's HSE were found to have fixed prices and shared markets for calcium carbide powder, calcium  carbonate granulates and magnesium granulates between 2004 and 2007. Dutch chemical group AkzoNobel participated but was not fined because it informed the  commission about the  cartel's existence.

DuPont underlying Q2 net profit down by 48%

US chemical major DuPont's underlying second-quarter (Q2) net profits were down by 48% year on year to $558m (€391m) on 22% lower sales of $6.9bn as demand for key products remained depressed. Earnings per share (EPS) of 61 cents came in 8 cents ahead of Wall Street estimates. "Our aggressive actions to improve productivity and reduce costs across the company are paying off as we contend with continued weak demand in key segments," said CEO Ellen Kullman. The firm reaffirmed a 2009 EPS outlook of $1.70-2.10.
Wall Street offers mixed views on DuPont

Wall Street offered mixed outlooks following US chemical major DuPont's second-quarter earnings. JPMorgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas raised his 2009 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by five cents, to
$1.75, and his 2010 forecast by 10 cents, to $2.10. However, Jefferies & Co. analyst Laurence Alexander cut his 2010 EPS estimate by 50 cents, to $1.85, while maintaining his 2009 EPS forecast of $1.70. "Our revised estimate assumes a slower recovery in most end-markets," said Alexander.
HIP Petrohemija to lay off 852 employees
Debt-ridden Serbian petrochemical producer HIP Petrohemija will lay off 852 employees from its
2,300-strong workforce as part of its restructuring. The company had previously targeted 500
redundancies. It said that the extra job losses were necessary to encourage the state to provide soft loans
that would aid the company's survival.
Lyondell creditors get approval to sue execs

A US bankruptcy court approved a creditors' lawsuit against the lenders, former board members and officers of Lyondell Chemical, who are accused of driving the company into bankruptcy in roughly a year after its merger with Basell. The lawsuit names several prominent officers in the merged
Netherlands-based chemical firm LyondellBasell Industries, including Ed Dineen, chief operating officer; Alan Bigman, chief financial officer; and Bart de Jong, president of the North American operations. Also named are Leonard Blavatnik and his industrial group, Access Industries. Access owned Basell at the time of the merger.
Poland increases scope of privatization plans

Poland has expanded its 2009-2010 national privatization program, with major stakes in fertilizer, titanium dioxide and biofuel producers a key element of the plan, the Polish treasury ministry said. Analysts said

Page 67 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the extent of the program, with ministers now targeting receipts of up to zlotych (Zl) 30bn ($9.9bn, €7.0bn)
for 2009-2010, instead of Zl15bn-20bn, surprised the markets. A minority stake in the second-largest
Polish refiner and biofuels producer, Grupa Lotos, was among the assets newly announced as available to
investors.
Oltchim rescue plan cleared by council

The Romanian government's rescue plan for indebted state chemical producer Oltchim does not amount to unfair state aid, the country's Competition Council said. The ruling will go to the EU Competition Commission, which must now give its view on the crisis package, which is worth around €434m ($620m). Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc said Oltchim was a strategic company and large employer that
required assistance to help it "remain a powerful industry in Romania's economy."
Toagosei to focus on synthetic hCI

Japanese producer Toagosei has decided to close the ethylene dichloride (EDC) and vinylidene chloride units at its Tokushima plant, as part of a shift to synthetic hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. "These businesses have been unprofitable for us, and they don't have a bright future," a company official said. Production will stop at the end of 2009. Toagosei has decided to use chlorine to produce more synthetic HCl instead of organic solvents. The firm is increasing its synthetic HCl capacity at Tokushima from
50,000 tonnes/year to 110,000-120,000 tonnes/year by September.
Air Products Q3 net falls 24%; to cut jobs
US-based industrial gases firm Air Products posted a 24% year-on-year decline in underlying earnings to
$225m on 28% lower sales of $2bn. Earnings per share of $1.05 came in 7 cents ahead of Wall Street
estimates. The company said it would cut about 1,150 jobs across the global workforce and close some
plants to reduce costs. "While we are still seeing the impact of the global recession on our volumes, we've
seen signs of improvement during this quarter in some of our end-markets, particularly in Electronics and
Asia," said CEO John McGlade.
Genencor eyes textile processing market

Dutch enzyme producer Genencor wants to expand into the $18bn (€12.7bn) textile and garment processing market by replacing other chemicals with its enzymes, said Glenn Nedwin, vice president, technical enzymes, who presented at the BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology and Bioprocessing in Montreal, Canada. "Enzymes account for just about 1% of the whole global textile chemical processing. This is a huge potential market for us," he said. Nedwin said Genencor's
<i>PrimaGreen</i> product line would benefit the textile-processing industry by replacing harsh chemicals, lowering temperatures for textile processing, decreasing water consumption and reducing waste and
water emissions.
Lonza net profit down by 56% in first half

Swiss fine chemicals firm Lonza posted a 56% drop in net profit for the first half of the year to Swiss franc (Swfr) 118m (€78m, $110m). Group sales dropped by 9% to Swfr1.33bn. The company attributed the weaker performance to the "nature of its Custom Manufacturing business model," along with a slowdown in parts of the Life Science Ingredients segment.

HD      New Legal Framework  Proposed  For Motor Vehicle Distribution And Servicing Agreements
BY      Mr SJ Berwin's EU & Competition Team
WC     1,148 words

LP
The European Commission ("Commission") has set out its proposals for a new legal framework in relation to motor vehicle distribution agreements and repair and maintenance agreements. The current Block Exemption Regulation expires on 31 May 2010 and the  Commission has been assessing how this has performed and whether there is a need for reform.

Block exemptions create safe harbours for categories of agreements, relieving companies from the need to individually analyse whether agreements comply with Article 81 EC. The motor vehicle sector, which includes passenger cars and commercial vehicles, has been the subject of specific block exemptions since the mid 1980s.

TD
Overall, the  Commission considers that the objectives underlying the current block exemption remain valid however a distinction should be drawn between the markets for (i) the sale of new vehicles and (ii) repair and maintenance and spare parts.

No significant competition shortcomings have been found in the market for the sale of new vehicles. To the contrary, this market is identified by structural overcapacity and falling prices. The  Commission is therefore keen not to impose disproportionate regulatory constraints. In light of this, and to align its approach, the  Commission proposes that motor vehicle distribution agreements should be covered by the general block exemption for vertical agreements (which is also currently under review).

The specific motor vehicle block exemption would therefore be phased out; however, in order for a smooth transition, it is proposed that the current block exemption would be extended to 31 May 2013 as regards new vehicles. Specific sectoral guidance would also be provided.

The after sales market, which accounts for some 40% of consumer expenditure on cars, was found to be less competitive largely due to its brand-specific nature. Again the  Commission intends to apply the new general vertical competition rules to such agreements; however this will be in conjunction with sector specific guidelines and/or an additional more focused sectoral block exemption. Such specific provisions are considered necessary in order to address a number of problematic areas in the sector; such as ensuring that independent repairers have access to technical information and spare parts (in order to ensure that they can compete with the authorised networks). It would also tackle the misuse of warranties aimed at excluding independent repairers. This part of the new regime is proposed to apply from 31 May
2010.
Interested parties have until 25 September 2009 to submit observations.

Commission imposes €61 million fine on calcium carbide and magnesium cartel

In January 2007 the European Commission ("Commission") carried out dawn raids on the premises of a number of calcium  carbide and magnesium based chemical reagent producers. The raids were prompted by a leniency application from Azko Nobel under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice. Calcium carbide powder and magnesium granulates are the base ingredients for a number of products used in the steel production process with sales of the products within the EEA estimated at some €175 million.
The dawn raid led to evidence of three separate cartel arrangements which involved  market sharing
and allocation of customers in the calcium  carbide powder market, coordinated behaviour and exchange
Page 70 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of anticompetitive information in the  calcium carbide granulate market and collusion in the supply of magnesium granules, which may form a substitute for  calcium carbide powder. These cartels involved closely coordinated multilateral meetings across the EEA and appeared highly organised and specific.

The Commission imposed a total  fine of €61 million on nine companies: Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (for its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija), Novácke chemické závody and its former parent 1.garantovaná, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and ARQUES industries.
Akzo Nobel and EvonikDegussa's  fines were increased by 100% and 50% respectively to take account
of previous fines for breaches of Article 81 EC - in line with the  Commission's strict policy on recidivism,
which is viewed as a very serious aggravating factor (Akzo Nobel has been found to have been involved
in four prior cartels). Akzo Nobel however received full immunity from any  fines in light of its leniency
application. The most significant individual  fine was the €35 million imposed on Donau Chemie.

Commission issues proposals to improve security of gas supplies

The European Commission ("Commission") has issued proposals for a new regulation to improve security of gas supplies within the framework of the internal gas market.  Commission President, José Manuel Barroso noted that energy security will be one of the top priorities in the coming year. The proposed new regulation would require Member States to be fully prepared in the event of a disruption to the supply of gas through clear emergency planning. The  Commission would oversee this to ensure a coordinated approach.

The European gas market is fed by a relatively small number of pipelines and production fields and most Member States are connected to the same basic supply network. On this basis, a problem in one part of the EU may spread very quickly to other parts. It is hoped that the new regulation will alleviate this problem by making it easier for energy companies to plan ahead, leading to more investment in, for example, new cross-border interconnections, import corridors and gas storage.

The proposals respond to a specific request from the  European Council, the  European Parliament and the Energy Council which asked the EU Energy Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, to prepare new legislation to improve the EU emergency response framework for gas. With more than 25% of energy supply in the EU coming from gas and over 60% of all gas used in the EU being imported, legislation to deal with threats to gas supplies is considered a priority. The gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine in January 2009 also confirmed many of the weaknesses of the existing legislation.

Gas companies would continue to have the main responsibility for keeping gas flowing to customers, with public authorities only intervening as a last resort (particularly where companies are unable to deal with issues on their own). The proposals should also assist in avoiding the risk of unilateral measures by one Member State jeopardising the supply of gas in other territories.

The Energy Commissioner has encouraged the  European Council and Parliament to adopt the proposals as swiftly as possible.

LP
EC fines desulfurizer cartel: The European Commission has imposed a total of Eur61.12 million ($86 million) in fines on nine companies involved in the calcium  carbide powder and magnesium granulates markets for violating the EC Treaty's ban on cartels and restrictive business practices, the EC said last week. The nine companies are Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (for its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija), Novacke Chemicke Zavody and its former parent
1.Garantovana, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies EvonikDegussa and Arques Industries. The  fine for EvonikDegussa was increased by 50% because it had previously taken part in similar infringements, the EC said. Almamet of Germany was  fined Eur3.04 million; Ecka Granulate (Germany/Austria) was  fined Eur6.4 million and SKW of Germany was  fined Eur13.3 million.

TD
The EC finedAkzo Nobel for its involvement and increased the  fine by 100% for previous involvement in cartels, but Akzo's  fines were waived because it was the first to come forward with information about the cartel. The EC started its investigation with surprise inspections in January 2007.  Calcium carbide powder and magnesium granulates or reagent are used in the steel industry for desulfurization or deoxidation purposes. Between April 2004 to January 2007, Akzo, Almamet, Donau, Ecka, Novacke, SKW and TDR fixed prices and shared markets for calcium  carbide powder, calcium carbide granulates and magnesium granulates in a substantial part of the European Economic Area, except in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the UK, the EC found. The calcium  carbide producers colluded on market share and price increases in at least 12 multilateral meetings. In response, the EC found Almamet, Ecka
and SKW started colluding on the supply of  magnesium granulates, a possible substitute for  calcium     carbide. The EC said they organized at least five separate meetings near Salzburg, usually shortly after the calcium  carbide powder meetings. The mechanism for the calcium  carbide powder cartel served
as an example, including the use of a  market sharing  table. In setting the fines, the EC took into account the respective affected sales of the companies involved as well as the very serious nature of the infringement and the geographical scope, the EC said.

EU DEVELOPMENTS
New legal framework proposed for motor vehicle distribution and servicing agreements

TD
The European Commission ("Commission") has set out its proposals for a new legal framework in relation to motor vehicle distribution agreements and repair and maintenance agreements. The current Block Exemption Regulation expires on 31 May 2010 and the  Commission has been assessing how this has performed and whether there is a need for reform.

Block exemptions create safe harbours for categories of agreements, relieving companies from the need to individually analyse whether agreements comply with Article 81 EC. The motor vehicle sector, which includes passenger cars and commercial vehicles, has been the subject of specific block exemptions since the mid 1980s.

Overall, the  Commission considers that the objectives underlying the current block exemption remain valid however a distinction should be drawn between the markets for (i) the sale of new vehicles and (ii) repair and maintenance and spare parts.

No significant competition shortcomings have been found in the market for the sale of new vehicles. To the contrary, this market is identified by structural overcapacity and falling prices. The  Commission is therefore keen not to impose disproportionate regulatory constraints. In light of this, and to align its approach, the  Commission proposes that motor vehicle distribution agreements should be covered by the general block exemption for vertical agreements (which is also currently under review).

The specific motor vehicle block exemption would therefore be phased out; however, in order for a smooth transition, it is proposed that the current block exemption would be extended to 31 May 2013 as regards new vehicles. Specific sectoral guidance would also be provided.

The after sales market, which accounts for some 40% of consumer expenditure on cars, was found to be less competitive largely due to its brand-specific nature. Again the  Commission intends to apply the new general vertical competition rules to such agreements; however this will be in conjunction with sector specific guidelines and/or an additional more focused sectoral block exemption. Such specific provisions are considered necessary in order to address a number of problematic areas in the sector; such as ensuring that independent repairers have access to technical information and spare parts (in order to ensure that they can compete with the authorised networks). It would also tackle the misuse of warranties aimed at excluding independent repairers. This part of the new regime is proposed to apply from 31 May
2010.
Interested parties have until 25 September 2009 to submit observations.

Commission imposes €61 million fine on calcium carbide and magnesium cartel

In January 2007 the European Commission ("Commission") carried out dawn raids on the premises of a number of calcium  carbide and magnesium based chemical reagent producers. The raids were prompted by a leniency application from Azko Nobel under the Commission's 2002 Leniency Notice. Calcium carbide powder and magnesium granulates are the base ingredients for a number of products

Page 95 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
used in the steel production process with sales of the products within the EEA estimated at some €175 million.

The dawn raid led to evidence of three separate  cartel arrangements which involved  market sharing  and allocation of customers in the calcium  carbide powder market, coordinated behaviour and exchange of anticompetitive information in the calcium  carbide granulate market and collusion in the supply of magnesium granules, which may form a substitute for  calcium carbide powder. These cartels involved closely coordinated multilateral meetings across the EEA and appeared highly organised and specific.

The Commission imposed a total  fine of €61 million on nine companies: Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (for its former subsidiary TDR Metalurgija), Novácke chemické závody and its former parent 1.garantovaná, SKW Stahl-Metallurgie and its former parent companies Evonik Degussa and ARQUES industries.

Akzo Nobel and Evonik Degussa's  fines were increased by 100% and 50% respectively to take account of previous fines for breaches of Article 81 EC - in line with the  Commission's strict policy on recidivism, which is viewed as a very serious aggravating factor (Akzo Nobel has been found to have been involved in four prior cartels). Akzo Nobel however received full immunity from any  fines in light of its leniency application. The most significant individual  fine was the €35 million imposed on Donau Chemie.

Commission issues proposals to improve security of gas supplies

The European Commission ("Commission") has issued proposals for a new regulation to improve security of gas supplies within the framework of the internal gas market.  Commission President, José Manuel Barroso noted that energy security will be one of the top priorities in the coming year. The proposed new regulation would require Member States to be fully prepared in the event of a disruption to the supply of gas through clear emergency planning. The  Commission would oversee this to ensure a coordinated approach.

The European gas market is fed by a relatively small number of pipelines and production fields and most Member States are connected to the same basic supply network. On this basis, a problem in one part of the EU may spread very quickly to other parts. It is hoped that the new regulation will alleviate this problem by making it easier for energy companies to plan ahead, leading to more investment in, for example, new cross-border interconnections, import corridors and gas storage.

The proposals respond to a specific request from the  European Council, the  European Parliament and the Energy Council which asked the EU Energy Commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, to prepare new legislation to improve the EU emergency response framework for gas. With more than 25% of energy supply in the EU coming from gas and over 60% of all gas used in the EU being imported, legislation to deal with threats to gas supplies is considered a priority. The gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine in January 2009 also confirmed many of the weaknesses of the existing legislation.

Gas companies would continue to have the main responsibility for keeping gas flowing to customers, with public authorities only intervening as a last resort (particularly where companies are unable to deal with issues on their own). The proposals should also assist in avoiding the risk of unilateral measures by one Member State jeopardising the supply of gas in other territories.

The Energy Commissioner has encouraged the  European Council and Parliament to adopt the proposals as swiftly as possible.

OFT publishes GlaxoSmithKline/Pfizer HIV collaboration decision

Following its decision not to refer the anticipated joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline plc ("Glaxo") and Pfizer Inc ("Pfizer") to the Competition  Commission on 9 July 2009, the OFT has published the full text of its decision.

The proposed transaction will see Glaxo and Pfizer pool the entirety of their businesses for HIV treatment into a joint venture company ("JV") (with Glaxo having a controlling interest and Pfizer a material influence). The JV will focus solely on the research, development and commercialisation of HIV treatments - giving it a share of supply of between 20% and 30% by value in the HIV market, and triggering review under the Enterprise Act.

In assessing the proposed merger, the OFT considered the appropriate frame of reference: it considered fragmenting the market for those HIV drugs that were already marketed and those that were still in the pipeline, but, as the deal raised no serious competition concerns either way, the OFT did not conclude on this point.

Page 96 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Adopting its previous approach to pharmaceutical products, the OFT found that any market for pipeline HIV products could be at least EEA-wide in scope, but that the market for marketed products would be national, given the wide differences in relation to regulatory frameworks, pricing mechanisms, purchasing policies and marketing strategies across Member States.

The OFT concluded that any overlap between the parties, regardless of how the market was defined, was too small to raise any competition concerns, and the presence of strong competitors in both the marketed and pipeline markets would be a sufficient restraint on the JV. The OFT also considered that the JV would not be able (and would not have the incentive) to foreclose its rivals by, for example, bundling their products, as few HIV patients take a combination of drugs produced by the parties.

Finally, the OFT considered the likelihood of tacit or explicit collusion in the market. Given the transaction's impact on the overall market structure is very small, and taking into account features of the pharmaceutical industry, such as that manufacturers are awarded statutory monopolies for being the first to develop an innovative drug, the OFT considered that it was inherently difficult for parties to align their behaviour and incentives to those of their rivals. Accordingly, the merger was cleared.

The parties state that the joint venture is to have a degree of independence form its parents and it is hoped will accelerate drug development for the treatment of HIV. It remains to be seen whether ultimately the JV will become fully independent and whether this type of relatively innovative, focussed collaboration will be followed by others in this or in other sectors. The approval comes as Glaxo announced a waiver of certain patent restrictions to allow generic drug manufacturers to copy its HIV treatments for sale in the world's poorest countries.
GERMAN DEVELOPMENTS
Duales System Deutschland appeal dismissed by ECJ
Recently the ECJ confirmed the decision of the  European Commission ("Commission") of 20 April
2001 finding that Duales System Deutschland GmbH ("DSD"), the creator of the "Green Dot" (Der Grüne
Punkt) trade mark, had restricted competition by abusing its dominant position in the market for
organising the collection and recycling of sales packaging in Germany before 2001. DSD, which still
enjoys a dominant position in the market, appealed the Commission's decision to the CFI. The CFI, in its
judgment of 24 May 2007, rejected this appeal and confirmed the Commission's reasoning (see
Community Week Issue 325).
DSD appealed the CFI's decision based on the following reasons, all of which were all dismissed by the
ECJ:

DSD argued that the CFI's findings relating to its abuse under Article 82 were vitiated by error of law or fact. The ECJ rejected this argument and confirmed that DSD abused its dominant position by requiring its customers to pay a licence fee for all packages designated with the Green Dot logo irrespective of whether the customers fulfilled their obligations under the German Packaging Ordinance through DSD or through competing systems. The ECJ also confirmed that the  Commission had the power to order DSD to bring the infringement to an end and to order DSD to stop charging a licence fee for quantities of packaging put into circulation in Germany carrying the DGP logo for which the exemption service is not used and for which the obligations imposed by the German Packaging Ordinance have demonstrably been fulfilled in another way.

DSD stated that the CFI had infringed trade mark law by finding that the Green Dot logo could not be granted exclusivity. DSD argued that the Green Dot logo should only be used for packages that were disposed of by DSD. The ECJ rejected this arguing that the use of the Green dot logo by manufactures and distributors whose packaging is not taken back by DSD is attributable to DSD. DSD itself set up a system which requires that the DGP logo be affixed to all packaging even where some of the packaging is not recovered by the DSD system.

DSD contended that the CFI had breached the principle of proportionality. They argued that the CFI and the Commission had interfered disproportionally with its rights as they prevented DSD from requiring its customers to affix the Green Dot to packaging even when it is not processed by the DSD system. This notice effectively neutralised the distinctive effect of that logo. The ECJ rejected this argument as it is not possible to determine in advance what route will be taken by an item of packaging. It is therefore not possible, at the time at which a product bearing the packaging is packaged or sold, to distinguish products bearing the DGP logo and actually processed by the DSD system and those which bear the same logo but which will be processed by another system.

DSD asserted that the CFI had failed to hear the case within a reasonable period of time as the proceedings before the CFI lasted for nearly six years. The ECJ agreed that the length of the case could not be justified by any particular circumstances but refused to set aside the judgment on that basis. The
Page 97 of 199 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ECJ argued that the length of the proceedings had no effect on the outcome of the dispute. In addition, it highlighted the importance of the Community competition law. An appellant could not be allowed to reopen the question of the existence of an infringement, on the sole ground that there was a failure to adjudicate within a reasonable time, where all of its pleas directed against the findings made by the CFI concerning that infringement and the administrative procedure relating to it had been rejected as
unfounded. The failure on the part of the CFI to adjudicate within a reasonable time could only give rise to a claim for damages brought against the Community.
DSD considered that the CFI had infringed its duty to state reasons and had distorted evidence. The ECJ
rejected these arguments.
SJ Berwin LLP advised two German waste management companies (Landbell AG and BellandVision
GmbH) in these proceedings and in the proceedings before the  Commission.
ITALIAN DEVELOPMENTS
Class action law approved in Italy

On 9 July 2009 the Italian Parliament approved a law (legislative decree S1995B, the "Law") which introduces a damages compensation class action for consumers and final users who are victim to unfair trade practices or anticompetitive conduct.

Only eleven Tribunals will constitute competent courts for the purposes of the action. While the action will become enforceable before such competent courts from January 2010, under the Law, damages may be claimed in respect of infringements following the measure's publication in the Official Gazette in early August 2009. Some scholars have questioned the legality of the Law due to its retroactive powers. The legislator may amend the Law to clarify this issue.

The action, structured as an "opt-in" action, can be brought individually by any consumer, user, member of a class, through an appointed consumers' association or committee. At the first hearing, the court will decide on the admissibility of the action. The action may be declared inadmissible in four cases: (i)
conflict of interest; (ii) action manifestly not grounded on points of law; (iii) the court not deeming sufficient homogeneity between the individual rights of the members of the class adhering to the class action; and (iv) the court not deeming the plaintiff able to properly represent the interests of the class' members.

Before declaring the action admissible, the court may decide to suspend the proceeding where a case on the same facts relevant to the decision is pending a proceeding before the Italian Competition Authority or is pending the relevant appeal before the competent administrative courts. If the action is declared admissible, it is required to be properly published in order to allow the opt-in procedure. The maximum term for the opt-in procedure is 120 days. Members of the class adhering to the class action expressly waive the right to bring any similar individual action against the same defendant. Equally, no other class action against the same defendant and on the same facts is allowed once the first class action brought is declared admissible.

At the end of the proceeding, the judge exercises discretion as to whether to award the damages compensation due to all the members of the class action, according to a provision of the Italian civil code which provides for this possibility in cases where the exact amount of damages cannot be proven. Alternatively the judge may establish a common criterion of liquidation of the damages due.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Bratislava, August 7 (TASR) - Investment company 1. Garantovana(1G) wants to appeal the decision of the EU Commission, according towhich the company is to pay a  fine of 19.6 million for creatinga  cartel with another eight firms including its company NovackeChemicke Zavody (NCHZ).

"Before we appeal the decision, we'll ask the  Commission topostpone the  fine's maturity," a board member of 1G Igor Rataj saidat a press conference in Bratislava on Friday. Rataj indicated that1G will appeal the decision before the  European Court of Justice inLuxembourg.

TD
The company, which received the decision July 22, has twomonths in which to appeal the decision, but it must pay the  finewithin three months regardless of the appeal court's decision. "Wedon't have problems with the penalty ... what we are appealingagainst is its sum. A  fine in the EU  Commission's view should havea preventive and discouraging effect, not a liquidating one," saidshareholder Roman Murar.

Rataj said that 1G has a portfolio of 30 million at present,and such a whopping  fine means the liquidation of the company, whichalso wants to turn for help to the Slovak Economy Ministry and PrimeMinister Robert Fico.

"It's a national issue. It concerns over 30,000 shareholdersand 2,000 employees of Novacke Chemicke Zavody," said a member ofcivic association called Protective Society of Minority Shareholders(OSMA) Milan Hosek.

The cartel was active between April 2004-January 2007. Thecompanies Akzo, Nobel, Almamet, Donau Chemie, Ecka Granulate, NCHZ,SKW Stahl - Metallurgie and TDR Metalurgija took part in the cartelin all EU states except Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Great Britain.They divided the market, portioned out customers and agreed toincrease the prices of  calcium carbide.
