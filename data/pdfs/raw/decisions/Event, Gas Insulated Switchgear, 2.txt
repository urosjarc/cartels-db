TOKYO (XFN-ASIA) - Hitachi  Ltd said it is considering appealing a  fine imposed by the European          Commission for price-fixing over alleged cartel activity in power generation equipment.
The company used to supply gas insulated switchgear (GIS) equipment but "has never sold GIS
equipment in Europe," it said in a written statement.

TD
And the company "believes that it is not in violation of European anti-trust law with regard to tenders for GIS products," and "will carefully review the substance of the Commission's decision and consider a number of options including the filing of an appeal with the European Court of First Instance," it said.

Earlier, the European Commission announced its second-biggest  fine against cartels, seeking 750 mln eur from 11 European and Japanese manufacturers of power-generation equipment.

Toshiba Corp responded that it would appeal to the  European Court of Justice against a  fine over alleged cartel activity.

"Our company has cooperated with the  European Commission in the investigations of the case. But our own investigation has shown that our company has not committed any act in violation of the  European Competition Law,"  Toshiba said in a statement.
"We intend to contest the decision in the  European Court of Decision hereafter," the company said. The EU competition regulator targeted ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems,
Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech for price fixing  and illegally dividing
up the market.

Mitsubishi was told to pay 118.6 mln  euros, Toshiba 90.9 mln eur and Hitachi  51.7 mln eur, according to media reports.

Brussels, 24/01/2007 (Agence Europe) - On 24 January, the  European Commission decided to levy a fine of €750,712,500 on a cartel operating on the  European gas insulated switchgear market. This is the highest fine ever imposed on a single cartel in the history of the  Commission, according to Jonathan Todd, the spokesperson to European Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes. 10 European and Japanese companies took part in the cartel: Alstom  (France), Areva (France),  Fuji (Japan), Hitachi (Japan), Japan AE Power Systems (Japan), Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (Japan), Schneider (France), Siemens (Germany), Siemens (Austria) and  Toshiba (Japan). The apparent intention of these companies was, firstly, to divide up the European market for this item, which is used to control energy flows in electricity grids and, secondly, to exclude their Japanese rivals for a total of sixteen years.

TD
An eleventh company (ABB, Switzerland) was granted total immunity from the  fines under the Commission's leniency programme, because it was the first company to have provided information on the cartel.

In a press release, Neelie Kroes stressed that this decision was not only a signal that the  Commission "will not tolerate cartels in  Europe", but also that it "can and will bring down such cartels, even if the companies concerned use sophisticated technology to cover their tracks".

DG Competition carried out surprise inspections in the business premises of the companies involved in May 2004 and, having examined the documents which were seized on that occasion, sent them a communication one year later, which detailed the illegal actions which it had identified and which motivated the decision taken on Wednesday.

The very high total of the  fines is justified, Ms Kroes's spokesperson explained, by the "very long" duration of the cartel and the fact that the companies involved in it represent practically all of the market. In particular, he added, the unprecedented  fine imposed on Siemens (Germany) (nearly €400 million, or
over half of the total) is "due to the fact that they played a leadership role (...), as well as the very large size of the company".

In a press release, Dr Udo Niehage, President of  Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution (PTD), the Siemens Group that manufactures GIS systems, said “the  fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts". In a telephone interview with EUROPE, the spokesperson stated the company's intention to appeal against the decision, before the Court of First Instance. (cd)

The European Commission has levied a fine totaling EUR 750.7 mln (CZK 21.06 bln) on 10 firms for a power gear price-fixing cartel. This is the second highest cartel fine ever levied. The largest sum, EUR
396.6 mln, will be paid by Siemens, which the commission alleges headed the  cartel. Siemens intends to appeal the  fine. The commission has not levied a fine on the ABB concern, which got away with a warning. Grid operators from various  European countries were affected by the agreement. (CIA, HN 13) Czech grid operator CEPS did not register the existence of the  cartel during its tenders. (CIA)

Entrepreneur Tomas Pitr and Agrofert holding owner Andrej Babis met twice in recent weeks. According to Pitr they theorized about the sale of Setuza. Babis took part in the meeting to discuss rape deliveries and payments. Current Setuza head Frantisek Janu was also present. According to Babis, they also discussed the future of methylester production. According to M.L. Moran, which acquired a majority in Setuza last year, Pitr has not been entrusted with negotiating the sale of the Ustecko firm. Pitr had allegedly called on Babis before Christmas, offering to sell him Setuza for CZK 1.15 bln. According to his own words, Pitr is currently taking part in the negotiations because of the money that he is entitled to once Setuza's ownership issues are resolved. (MfD B2)
According to Agriculture Minister Petr Gandalovic, Setuza, on which the state has a claim worth more
than CZK 4 bln, would have to offer significantly more than CZK 850 mln in a settlement. The firm made a
settlement offer at the end of last year arguing that it was the maximum it could bear economically.
Gandalovic would prefer a settlement with Setuza's owners to bankruptcy. The crucial factors are the
price of the claim as well as the requirement that operations be continuous and employees maintained.

The bankruptcy administrators of the assets of Vaclav Fischer and former Fischer Air (later known as Charter Air) want to sell or rent out two Boeing 737-300 planes. Their new owner will mostly likely be Norwegian Air Shuttle but other firms from Great Britain, Greece, the United States, and Germany are also interested. According to Fischer, the airplanes cannot be rented out or sold without the approval of Hamburg-based AMF, which Fischer continues to co-own. Czech Airlines has been taking care of the planes at the Ruzyne Airport as per an agreement with the acquirer. (HN 15)

Dutch investment firm K+ Venture Partners (K+ VP), which has taken the Czech Republic to arbitration court for failing to protect its investments in Czech Venture Partners (CVP), has agreed to a settlement with the Finance Ministry. The firm had wanted the Czech state to pay out CZK 140 mln. The two parties signed a settlement agreement on 21 December 2006 and the arbitration was halted. The amount of compensation that K+ VP obtained as part of the out-of-court settlement was not made public. (CIA, HN

State-owned Diamo, which extracts uranium in the Dolni Rozinka municipality of the Vysocina district, is considering expanding its extraction activities. It is currently negotiating investments into geological surveys, which could make additional deposits in Dolni Rozinka accessible. Diamo has not ruled out extraction in other localities, such as Hamr, Brzkov in Western Moravia, or Osecna in the Liberecko district. Investors are increasingly interested in Czech deposits as the price of uranium continues to grow on world markets. (HN 1,13)

The Moravia Steel group, which includes Trinecke Zelezarny and the Barrandov Film Studios, expects last year's gross profits to total CZK 6 - 6.3 bln (roughly the same as in 2005). According to the firm's largest shareholder, Tomas Chrenek, the profits of Trinecke Zelezarny should surpass those of 2005, for which the firm posted CZK 2.7 bln in gross profits. (HN 13)
According to the Czech Association of Insurers, the clients of domestic insurers have already reported
38,000 insurance events worth almost CZK 900 mln related to the hurricane that affected a significant
portion of the country last week. According to estimates, damages will exceed CZK 1.1 bln. Ceska
Pojistovna had received reports of 23,000 insurance events as of yesterday; Kooperativa reported
roughly 10,000 events with damages of CZK 200 mln. (HN 15)

JAGUAR EXPECTED TO LOSE £278M IN 2007

TROUBLED Jaguar lost more than £361m last year and is expected to lose £278m in 2007, according to reports from the Detroit home of its parent company Ford.

TD
The British luxury car-maker, at the centre of sale speculation, is also projected to lose more than
£151m in 2008 and is not expecting a profit for several years.
The fate of Jaguar remains uncertain with much hanging on its next generation mid-sized saloon. The general view is that Jaguar has won itself a breathing space during which Ford will decide its
future - and also that of its luxury sibling Land Rover.

The figures were revealed in the USbased Detroit News which said they came from an internal analysis presented to Ford executives in Mo'town last week.
Ford does not detail Jaguar's financial performance in its financial reports. BOWDEN BID PROVES LOWER THAN EXPECTED
HOPES of a knock-out bid for Wilson Bowden were fading after it emerged final round offers for the housebuilder came in at between £22 and £23 a share.

A bid at this level would be much lower than City expectations of a takeover priced at £25 a share, which would value Wilson Bowden at £2.4bn.

Shareholder Mirabaud Investment Management yesterday reduced its stake from 3.94pc to 2.83pc, signalling it too believes the take-out price is unlikely to be much higher than the current share price, down 5p at 2315p.

Sources close to the talks said Barratt Developments, George Wimpey and Scottish tycoon Sir Tom Hunter had all put forward proposals. Hunter is thought to have tabled an all cash deal, whereas Barratt and Wimpey have offered a mixture of cash and equity.
EC HITS PRICE-FIXERS WITH £500M  FINES
THE European Commission has hit 10 makers of electricity network equipment with  fines totalling
£494m for price fixing.

It is the second biggest penalty levied by the EC, only marginally behind £521m a vitamin  cartel was forced to stump up in 2001.

Germany's  Siemens bore the brunt of the punishment and will have to hand over £261m. It said it would appeal.

Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering  ABB escaped a £142m fine because it turned whistle blower. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said we have 'put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years'.

HD          Siemens Chief Promises  Full Explanation of Bribery  Scandal

Managers at Siemens faced angry shareholders at the annual meeting here on Thursday, as the venerable German electronics giant battles a crisis over a string of corruption allegations.

Chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld and supervisory board chief Heinrich von Pierer sought to placate shareholders over the collapse of  Siemens' former mobile phones division and allegations of widespread bribery and embezzlement.

TD
Von Pierer, who had been CEO during the period when the events were alleged to have taken place, admitted that the "essential anti-corruption measures," which the company introduced during his term, were not successful.
"I find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful," Pierer said. With regard to the mobile phones business, which  Siemens sold to Taiwan-based BenQ and which has
subsequently collapsed, von Pierer insisted that the German company had done everything that could
be expected for the activities.

The role of  Siemens in the collapse of BenQ Mobile has been criticised, with critics saying the German company did not do enough to save the business.
Unlawful practice

Referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the German engineering and electronics giant, von Pierer's successor, Klaus Kleinfeld, told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully.
"When I first heard of it, I was speechless," Kleinfeld said.

At the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros ($543 million), which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the Munich-based Siemens.

"We are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident," Kleinfeld said. "There is no place for dubious business practices in our company."

Claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in November on company office and the homes of several former and present employees.

On Wednesday, the EU Commission in Brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on Siemens and its Austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division. Siemens is appealing against the  fine, but must nevertheless pay it initially.
First-quarter results affected

Siemens' annual shareholders meeting on Thursday coincided with the publication of the group's first-quarter results, which showed its bottom-line profits hit by the  European Commission fine.


Page 9 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Siemens, which runs its business from October to September, said in a statement that its net profit amounted to 788 million  euros in the three months to December, down 16 percent from the year-earlier period.

Analysts had been penciling in net profit of around 973 million  euros for the three-month period, but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 418 million  euros booked at the last minute.
A strong start, nonetheless

Underlying earnings improved in the October-December period, however, with operating profit jumping by 51 percent to 1.631 billion  euros, boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and automation divisions.

First-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion  euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion  euros.

"In terms of our underlying performance, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," Kleinfeld said.

"While it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past, we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year," he said.
Looking ahead

Overnight,  Siemens announced that it had agreed to buy US software maker UGS for 3.5 billion dollars including debt.

In addition,  Siemens would float its automotive supply business,  Siemens VDO Automotive (SV), on the stock exchange, with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake.

"This move will give SV the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth," the company said in a statement.

Looking ahead, the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter, after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter.

the year-earlier quarter, when it posted a profit of Y21.9 billion, analysts said. This would keep  Toshiba
on track for its most profitable year in over a decade.

TD
But some analysts have concerns about parts of  Toshiba's business.

"The main concerns for this quarter are their digital products and semiconductor operations," said Daiwa Institute of Research analyst Masaharu Sato, who recently initiated coverage at the second-highest rating on a five-point scale.

Toshiba is slated to release its fiscal third quarter results Jan. 31 at 0400 GMT.

Toshiba's semiconductor business, which increasingly centers around NAND flash memory products, is a mainstay for the company as it reshuffles its other businesses. In the first six months of this fiscal year ending March, semiconductors brought in around 85% of the company's operating profit.

NAND flash memory can store data even when not powered, and is good at transferring large amounts of data at relatively high speeds, making it suitable for portable digital products like Apple's iPod music players, as well as cell phones and cameras. The booming popularity of such devices has kept demand high, but stiff competition among memory makers has sent prices sharply lower.

This is what has analysts like Sato worried, though the company is investing heavily - over Y250 billion this fiscal year alone - on ramping up mass production of next-generation 56-nanometer memory. This gives it an edge over rivals such as the No. 1 maker, Samsung Electronics Co. of Korea, which has yet to start mass production of memory that dense.  Finer grade memory allows for more storage on a single chip, which lowers physical size and costs per memory.

Another concern analysts cite is  Toshiba's digital products group, which lost Y7.6 billion over the first half of this fiscal period as it faced tough competition in the mobile phone business and heavy price declines in the PC market.

In the longer term,  Toshiba is investing heavily in its nuclear power operations - about Y330 billion over the next three years - because this business brings in steady maintenance and repair revenues.

The company has the top share of reactors in operation in Japan, where boiling-water technology is most common. But this has limited it abroad, where a technology called pressurized-water reactors is more common.

Mainly for this reason, in October  Toshiba and two partners completed a $5.4 billion acquisition of British reactor maker Westinghouse Electric Co., which is strong in PWRs. The three-month period through December will be the first quarter in which Westinghouse's earnings are included, and analysts expect the impact to be favorable, though it will probably only increase revenues by a few percent.

Another cloud emerged overnight, when  Toshiba was hit with a EUR90 million  fine by the European    Commission for taking part in a  cartel for switchgear products, which are used to disconnect parts of large power grids. The company said it won't change its earnings outlook and will appeal to the European court.

While its NAND flash memory and nuclear reactor businesses are still developing,  Toshiba looks to be on solid financial footing.

Toshiba is "clearly headed in the right direction," said Daiwa's Sano.

HD          UPDATE:Japan Cos To Mull Legal Action  Vs EU Antitrust Fine

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Three major Japanese electronics makers said Thursday they will consider taking legal action against a huge antitrust  fine levied by the European Commission and that they have no plans to change their earnings outlooks.

The three companies - Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO),  Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO) and  Hitachi  Ltd. (6501.TO) - were among 12 multinationals  fined a total of almost EUR751 million for their participation in a cartel for gas-insulated switchgear products.

TD
Mitsubishi Electric was  fined EUR118.6 million,  Toshiba EUR90 million and  Hitachi  EUR51.8 million.

"We are considering measures including an appeal to the  European court," after reviewing the full text of the decision, Mitsubishi Electric said in a press release.

The fine could have a big impact on Mitsubishi's bottom line, equivalent to about 16% of its projected group net profit for this fiscal year ending March. But a Mitsubishi spokeswoman said the company has no plans to revise its earnings outlook for this business year.

Toshiba also said it won't change its earnings outlook, as the impact of the fine is unclear at this stage. It said it hasn't violated EU antitrust regulations and will appeal the fine to the European court.

Hitachi  said it hasn't sold any gas-insulated switchgear products in  Europe in the past and that is unaware of any violation of antitrust regulations there.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange at 0422 GMT, Mitsubishi shares were up 0.1% at Y1,097.  Toshiba
shares were down 0.5% at Y806, while  Hitachi  shares were 1.1% lower at Y831.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

MUNICH (Dow Jones)--Siemens AG (SI) Thursday posted a strong rise in quarterly operating profits after a turnaround at its information technology unit - but its bottom line was badly damaged by a European Commission fine.

The company posted a 51% rise in operating profits to Dec. 31 and strong orders growth even though four of its units are still falling short of its self-set profitability targets.
At 0842 GMT,  Siemens shares were up EUR4.06, or 5.8%, at EUR82 on an unchanged benchmark
DAX index.

The quarterly results were disclosed just hours after the German engineering and technology giant announced a sweeping portfolio revamp: it agreed to buy U.S. software firm UGS Corp. for $3.5 billion, while planning to sell a minority stake in its  Siemens VDO Automotive car parts division through an initial public offering.
Group profit from operations in the three months to Dec. 31 rose to EUR1.63 billion from EUR1.08
billion in the year-ago quarter, ahead of analysts' expectations of EUR1.44 billion.  Siemens' IT services
unit SBS swung to a profit of EUR24 million from a loss of EUR232 million, while earnings also climbed
at other units such as medical equipment and transportation systems.

Sales in the first quarter rose 6% to EUR19.07 billion from EUR17.98 billion, also ahead of analysts' expectations of EUR18.62 billion, while new orders edged up 4% to EUR24.58 billion whereas analysts had penciled in a decline of 4%. Sales and new orders were boosted by double-digit percentage growth at the Power Generation and Transmission and Automation and Drives unit.

"Siemens reported solid first-quarter operating figures," HVB analyst Roland Pitz wrote in a research note, adding that the company seems to succeed with restructuring its problem units. HVB rates Siemens stock at buy.

Siemens Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld has disposed of the loss-making cellphone arm, unveiled job cuts and made several big purchases since taking the helm in early 2005. He also vowed to bring profit margins in line with peers such as General Electric Co. (GE) by April of this year.

Meanwhile, Siemens has been haunted by several issues, with Wednesday's EUR423 million penalty imposed by the E.U. Commission for price-fixing among providers of gas-insulated switchgear as the latest example. The company is also targeted by investigations by Munich prosecutors in a
wide-ranging bribery probe, with several former executive board members of the company among the suspects.
First-quarter group net profit was weighed down by Wednesday's E.U.  Commission penalty, as it fell
16% to EUR788 million, from EUR939 million a year earlier. Last year's earnings were weighed down
by a EUR315 million negative effect related to a cash settlement option on a convertible bond.

Page 21 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Net profit attributable to shareholders was EUR739 million against EUR886 million.

And Kleinfeld still has his work cut out to raise the profitability of four of the conglomerate's 10 divisions in the current quarter in order to meet the April-deadline for its profit margin goals.

"In terms of underlying performance of our business, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," Kleinfeld said, adding that  Siemens remains committed to achieving the divisional profit margin targets by April.

Meanwhile, the CEO continues to overhaul  Siemens' industrial holdings that manufacture items including steam turbines, medical scanners, high-speed trains and light bulbs, in his drive to boost the company's profitability.

It is still in the process of transferring its telecommunications equipment unit into a joint venture with Finnish Nokia Corp. (NOK), as the initial JV starting date was delayed due to the bribery investigations. Kleinfeld Thursday said that he continues to expect the deal to be completed in the current quarter.

Siemens earlier Thursday said it has agreed to buy UGS from its U.S. private equity owners Bain Capital Inc., Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus LLC, for $3.5 billion, including the assumption of debt, to boost its industrial automation unit Automation and Drives.

Siemens also said it will sell a minority stake in its Siemens VDO Automotive car parts unit, through an
IPO for which it will immediately start preparations. Siemens VDO, which has a global workforce of
53,000, posted a first-quarter profit of EUR146 million, down 6% on a year earlier, while sales fell 1% to
EUR2.41 billion.

Kleinfeld added that the aim is to float "significantly more than 25%" of  Siemens VDO's shares later this year.

HVB's Pitz said he values  Siemens VDO at around EUR5 billion, based on its first-quarter performance.

RECORD fines were yesterday imposed on leading engineering companies after the  European        Commission found that they were part of a  cartel that "cheated'' public companies and consumers for 16 years.

Ten European and Japanese companies were fined a total of  euro750.7m ( pounds 494.4m), the largest for a single  cartel, while Siemens received the biggest ever individual penalty, of euro396.56m. The German company said it would appeal.

TD
Two French companies, Alstom  and Areva, and Japan's Mitsubishi and  Toshiba were also found to have been part of the price fixing  of switchgear used to control electricity to homes, offices and factories.

The commission said companies "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information'' between 1988 and 2004.

Brussels' competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "The  commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years. The commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business.''

Ms Kroes has been cracking down on cartels since taking over from Mario Monti in 2004. Last year the commission handed out fines of euro1.84bn on seven cartels. In 2001 the EC  fined vitamin companies euro790.5m for price fixing,  though that involved several cartels.
Mitsubishi and Toshiba received a combined penalty of euro209.4m. The  commission also fined
Austria's VA Technologie, which  Siemens bought in 2005, euro22m.

The EC probe started in 2004 when officials raided  cartel members' offices while price-fixing meetings were being held. The Commission was tipped off about the long-running cartel by engineering giant  ABB, which escaped a fine of euro215m for its role in the price fixing.

Munich-based Siemens said it planned to appeal against the  fine at an EU court, calling the penalties "completely exaggerated''.

A spokesman for  Alstom  said he had no immediate comment. Areva said: "The  European                Commission should issue details on these alleged  fines' amount and their justification. Without these elements, we avoid to provide any comment.''
The commission said it put the largest  fine on Siemens because it "played a leadership role in the
cartel, their duration in the  cartel, as well as their size''.

An EC spokesman said later: "The  commission regards this cartel as totally unacceptable behaviour.''

The allegation is that the companies effectively carved up the Japanese and  European markets.

Competition expert Peter Willis, of law firm Dundas & Wilson, said the heavy  fines were due to the duration of the  cartel and that it looked to have been "carefully orchestrated to prevent it being disclosed''. He said appeals were often successful in reducing the size of  fines by about 30pc-40pc.

Czech and Hungarian authorities also probed the  cartel. Czech regulators said in January that they sent "statements of objections'' to unidentified companies last month. In 2005, the Hungarian Competition Authority  fined Alstom,  Siemens and others.

HD         EU imposes  record fine over cartel with secret code

Siemens has been hit with the  European Commission's biggest single  fine for helping to lead a  cartel that used secret codes and encrypted e-mails to conceal its efforts to rig the market in electrical switchgear.

The Commission has levied a record fine of Euro 750 million (Pounds 493 million) against 11 power equipment firms, of which  Siemens will suffer the biggest penalty. The German electronics group is fined Euro 396 million, a penalty that is increased by 50 per cent for its role as a ringleader in the cartel for gas-insulated switchgear (GIS).

TD
The penalty's size caused shares in  Siemens to dip on the Frankfurt bourse, but the company said that it would appeal against the sum, which will hit its first-quarter profits. The company had made no provision for the  fine.

However, ABB, of Switzerland, another conspirator, has escaped a  fine altogether for blowing the whistle on the cartel to the Commission in 2004.

The Commission's competition directorate said that between 1988 and 2004 the  cartel carved up markets and rigged tender prices for GIS - equipment to control energy flows in electricity grids.

In addition to  Siemens and ABB, the conspirators were  Alstom,  Areva and Schneider, the French groups, and five Japanese companies:  Fuji, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric,  Toshiba and Japan AE Power Systems. The switchgear suppliers informed each other of tender offers by customers, and co-ordinated bids to ensure that business was won in line with a quota for each cartel member. In addition, markets were sliced up geographically, with the Japanese agreeing not to sell in Europe, while European companies avoiding Japan.

Cartel members used high-tech methods to keep sham bids secret, the  Commission said. "Code names were used for both companies and individuals...they relied on anonymous e-mail addresses for communication and used encryption for sending messages," it said.  Siemens supplied the encryption technology.

Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, said that the  cartel had been cheating public utilities and consumers for more than 16 years.

ABB's whistleblowing cut its fine from Euro 215 million to nil.  Siemens said it is to challenge its  fine's size because it was not in the cartel for all 16 years.

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee raised interest rates earlier this month by a 5-4 vote, minutes of the meeting have shown. It was the first time that Mervyn King, the Governor, had used his casting vote to raise rates. The pound fell back and the FTSE 100 climbed to a six-year high above
6,300 as traders reduced their earlier bets of two more interest rate rises this year. However, analysts said that the outlook was now extremely uncertain. Page 40

LP
TOKYO --  Toshiba Corp. is shifting its focus to its lucrative semiconductor and nuclear-power operations, and the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings, due next week, will likely reflect its continued success.

The Tokyo company's net profit for the quarter ended in December was likely up about 50% from a year earlier -- when it posted profit of 21.9 billion yen ($181 million) -- analysts said, keeping Toshiba on track for its most profitable year in more than a decade.

TD
Some observers have concerns about parts of  Toshiba's business. "The main concerns for this quarter are their digital-products and semiconductor operations," said Masaharu Sato, a Daiwa Institute of Research analyst who recently initiated coverage at the second-highest rating on a five-point scale.
The company is scheduled to release its results Wednesday.

Toshiba's semiconductor business, which increasingly centers on so-called NAND flash-memory products, is a mainstay for the company as it shuffles its other businesses. In the first six months of the fiscal year ending in March, semiconductors accounted for around 85% of the company's operating profit.

The popularity of NAND flash-memory products, such as mobile phones, cameras and Apple Inc.'s iPod music players, has kept demand high. Competition among chip makers has sent prices sharply lower.

That is what has analysts worried, although  Toshiba is investing heavily -- more than 250 billion yen this fiscal year alone -- on ramping up mass production of next-generation 56-nanometer memory.

This gives it an edge over rivals such as the No. 1 maker, Samsung Electronics Co. of Korea, which has yet to start mass production of memory chips that dense.  Finer-grade memory allows for more storage on a single chip, reducing the size and cost per unit.

Toshiba also is bolstering its nuclear-power operations, investing about 330 billion yen in the next three years, because the business brings in steady revenue for maintenance and repair.  Toshiba
has the top share of reactors in operation in Japan, where boiling-water technology is most common.

Abroad, pressurized-water reactors are the norm. So, in October,  Toshiba and two partners completed a $5.4 billion acquisition of reactor maker Westinghouse Electric Co., which is strong in pressurized-water reactors.

Westinghouse earnings will be included in the three-month period through December, and analysts expect favorable results, though it will probably increase revenue by only a few percent.

A cloud emerged overnight, when  Toshiba was hit with a 90 million  euro ($117 million) fine by the European Commission on accusations that it took part in a  cartel for switchgear products, which are used to disconnect parts of large power grids.

The company said the  fine won't change its earnings outlook, and it will appeal the ruling to the
European court.

LP
The European Commission has opened a formal investigation into "artificially low" government-regulated industrial power prices in Spain, saying these equated to an illegal state subsidy and impeded competition from new entrants.
The regulated industrial tariffs led to a deficit of €3.8 billion ($4.9 billion) in Spain's electricity system
in 2005, said the  commission. Spain's government is seeking to make this up through a new charge
levied on all Spanish consumers, including households, in their electricity bills over the next 14 years.

TD
The commission will assess whether the 2005 tariffs constituted state aid to energy-intensive, large and medium-sized industries and to the electricity incumbents -- and if so, whether such aid distorted trade in the  European Union's single market. The probe will not concern regulated prices for small companies and households.

On Wednesday, EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes referred Spain to the  European Court of Justice for obstructing foreign takeover bids in the energy sector, notably E.On's bid for Endesa (IOD Jan.25,p9). Spain now risks further legal action, if the  commission finds against it over the
2005 electricity tariffs.

On Wednesday Kroes also imposed  fines totaling €750 million ($973 million) on 10 big-name electrical switchgear manufacturers -- the largest ever imposed on a single  price-fixing cartel, with Germany's  Siemens due to fork out a record €397 million.

More than 10,000 investors came to the city's Olympiahalle to assail the technology firm's executive and supervisory boards for doing too little too late to investigate allegations that senior managers created secret slush funds to bribe overseas officials to award telecoms contracts, and for  Siemens shares'
poor showing.

But the stock rose more than 6% after it announced, just before the annual meeting, a 51% jump in operating profits in the first quarter, the $3.5bn (pounds 1.8bn) acquisition of the Texan digital automation firm UGS and plans to float off a minority stake in its profitable VDO car parts unit.

Henning Gebhardt, head of equities at Germany's biggest fund manager, DWS, told the Guardian: "These figures and the scale of the transactions indicate clearly that  Siemens has reached a
turning-point. The planned IPO [initial public offering] of VDO is a rare sign that it is properly managing its portfolio and floating off a division when it is making money and not in crisis." Mr Gebhardt, whose firm has euros 1bn invested in Siemens, had been one of several institutional and small investors to criticise the board for failing to deal with the group's strategic growth and appearing to reel from one crisis to another.

Daniela Bergdolt, head of DSW, a small investors group, asked how a firm renowned for its solid reliability had been forced to react belatedly to a spate of bad headlines, leaving the impression that the board could not run the business. Mr Gebhardt said  Siemens had become so complex that the executive board could no longer control the whole business.

But moves to refuse to approve the two boards' actions in the past year evaporated after Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, said he had withdrawn from the audit committee investigating the bribery scandal to avoid any conflict of interest over events which took place when he was chief executive. Visibly contrite, he expressed "deep distress" that efforts he had instigated to ensure full compliance with corporate governance codes had failed.

Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, promised to restore  Siemens' exemplary reputation. "There is no place for crooked business practice in our company and that principle is non-negotiable," he said to loud applause, while admitting that some allegations would prove to be true.

Gerhard Cromme, audit committee chairman and architect of Germany's corporate governance code, promised that  Siemens' own inquiries would go far beyond state prosecutors' investigations. "Our goal
is clear: to have in place a system that will prevent and detect unethical and illegal conduct and serve as a benchmark for other companies," he said.

Shareholders' ire turned instead to the auditors KPMG for failing to detect the holes in  Siemens' accounts caused by the alleged use of slush funds to win contracts through bribery.

Siemens regained shareholders' confidence by announcing that its first-quarter operating profit soared to euros 1.63bn on sales that were up 6% to  euros 19bn and orders up 4% to  euros 25.6bn.

The company, which has also been assailed over executive pay rises and the abortive disposal of its now-bankrupt mobile phones business to Taiwan's BenQ, said net income fell 16% to  euros 788m because of the euros 433m impact of  fines imposed by the European commission on Wednesday for leading a cartel in equipment for electricity sub-stations.

TOKYO --  Toshiba Corp. is shifting its focus to its lucrative semiconductor and nuclear-power operations, and the company's fiscal-third-quarter earnings, due next week, are expected to reflect its continued success.

The Tokyo company's net profit for the quarter ended in December was likely up about 50% from a year earlier -- when it posted profit of 21.9 billion yen ($181 million) -- analysts said, keeping  Toshiba on track for its most profitable year in more than a decade.

TD
Some observers have concerns about parts of  Toshiba's business. "The main concerns for this quarter are their digital-products and semiconductor operations," said Masaharu Sato, a Daiwa Institute of Research analyst who recently initiated coverage at the second-highest rating on a five-point scale.
The company is scheduled to release its results Wednesday.

Toshiba's semiconductor business, which increasingly centers on NAND flash-memory products, is a mainstay for the company as it shuffles its other businesses. In the first six months of the fiscal year ending in March, semiconductors accounted for around 85% of the company's operating profit.

The popularity of NAND flash-memory products, including mobile phones, cameras and Apple Inc.'s iPod music players, has kept demand high. Competition among chip makers has sent prices sharply lower.

That is what has analysts worried, although  Toshiba is investing heavily -- more than 250 billion yen this fiscal year alone -- on increasing mass production of next-generation 56-nanometer memory.

This gives it an edge over rivals such as the No. 1 maker, Samsung Electronics Co. of Korea, which has yet to start mass production of memory chips that dense.  Finer-grade memory allows for more storage on a single chip, reducing the size and cost per unit.

Toshiba also is bolstering its nuclear-power operations, investing about 330 billion yen in the next three years, because the business brings in steady revenue for maintenance and repair.  Toshiba has the top share of reactors in operation in Japan, where boiling-water technology is most common.

Abroad, pressurized-water reactors are the norm. So, in October,  Toshiba and two partners completed a $5.4 billion acquisition of reactor maker Westinghouse Electric Co., which is strong in pressurized-water reactors. Westinghouse earnings will be included in the three-month period through December.

A cloud emerged overnight, when  Toshiba was hit with a 90 million  euro ($117 million) fine by the European Commission on accusations that it took part in a  cartel for switchgear products, which are used to disconnect parts of large power grids. The company said the  fine won't change its earnings outlook, and it will appeal the ruling to the  European court.

HD           Siemens Profit Falls 17%, Hit by Price-Fixing Fine

MUNICH -- Siemens AG posted a 17% decline in fiscal first-quarter net profit because of a  European
Union fine for price fixing,  though its operating profit improved after a turnaround at its
information-technology unit.
Net profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to 739 million  euros ($957.8 million) from 886 million
euros a year earlier, weighed down by a 423 million  euros charge tied to the EU  fine.

TD
Sales rose 6.1% to 19.07 billion  euros from 17.98 billion  euros, while new orders were up 3.9% to
24.58 billion euros. Sales and new orders were boosted by double-digit percentage growth in power
generation and transmission and automation and drives.
The company posted a 51% rise in operating profit, which excludes expenses such as the EU  fine. The quarterly results were disclosed just hours after the German engineering and technology giant
announced a sweeping portfolio revamp: It agreed to buy U.S. software firm UGS Corp. for $3.5 billion,
while planning to sell a minority stake in its  Siemens VDO Automotive car-parts division through an
initial public offering.

Siemens shares ended up 6% Thursday at 82.60  euros in Frankfurt.

The information-technology-services unit, SBS, posted profit of 24 million  euros, compared with a loss of 232 million euros, while earnings climbed at other units, such as medical equipment and transportation systems.

Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld has disposed of the loss-plagued cellphone arm, unveiled job cuts and made several big purchases since taking the helm in early 2005. He also vowed to bring profit margins in line with peers such as General Electric Co. by April.

Mr. Kleinfeld still has his work cut out to raise the profitability of four of the conglomerate's 10 divisions in the current quarter in order to meet that April deadline.

Meanwhile, Siemens has been haunted by several issues, with the latest blow coming Wednesday from a 423 million euros penalty imposed by the  European Commission for price fixing  among providers of gas-insulated electric-power switchgear. The company also is a target of investigations by Munich prosecutors in a wide-ranging bribery probe, with several former executive-board members of the company among the suspects.

"In terms of underlying performance of our business, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," Mr. Kleinfeld said, adding that  Siemens remains committed to achieving the divisional profit margin targets by April.

Meanwhile, the CEO continues to overhaul  Siemens's industrial holdings that make items including steam turbines, high-speed trains and light bulbs, in a drive to boost the company's profitability. It is in the process of transferring its telecommunications equipment unit into a joint venture with Nokia Corp.,

as the initial starting date was delayed due to the bribery investigations. Mr. Kleinfeld yesterday said that he still expects the deal to be completed in the current quarter.

TD
MUNICH, Jan 25 (Reuters) - German industrial conglomerate  Siemens' management and supervisory board members survived a protest vote by shareholders on Thursday over a corruption scandal that has shaken the company.

All the board members received a majority of votes to approve their actions in the last fiscal year at the annual general meeting of shareholders. Chairman Heinrich von Pierer received the lowest approval rate, at 66 percent.

Votes on ex-Chief Financial Officer Heinz-Joachim Neubuerger and ex-senior telecoms manager Thomas Ganswindt, who have both been named by prosecutors as suspects in the bribery probe, were postponed pending results of investigations.
Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld won 71 percent.

Many shareholders are incensed at  Siemens management's handling of an affair involving hundreds of millions of  euros allegedly used for bribes to win foreign telecoms contracts.

At the  Siemens annual meeting, a series of investor-group representatives had called on 13,000 shareholders, who had braved sub-zero temperatures to attend the AGM in Munich, to withhold their approval of the actions of the boards.

"There's no reason to approve the management," said Daniela Bergdolt, the Bavarian representative of small-shareholders' association DSW. "They informed us too late, underestimated the scale of the
affair and weren't proactive enough."

Hans-Christoph Hirth, a fund manager at Hermes, said, "The managers should have reacted sooner and more decisively."

Munich prosecutors are investigating the disappearance of 200 million  euros ($260 million) from Siemens accounts, and  Siemens is examining 420 million euros of what it calls "dubious payments" that were booked as consultancy fees over seven years.

The affair has been compounded by news that  Siemens is being investigated for possible abuse of the United Nations oil-for-food programme in Iraq and a hefty  cartel fine imposed by the European           Commission on Wednesday for  price-fixing.

A protest vote would have had only symbolic importance but would have been rare in Germany, where company boards' actions are normally waved through.

Siemens took the unusual step of inviting shareholders to approve the actions of its board members one by one this year in light of the affair.
CHAIRMAN CONCESSION

Page 40 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As well as retail shareholders, who often voice dissent at AGMs but hold little sway, institutional shareholder adviser ISS had also recommended a protest vote on Wednesday.
Some shareholders had called on von Pierer, who was chief executive of  Siemens until the start of
2005, to resign or step aside until the affair was resolved.

Von Pierer denies any wrong-doing but did make a concession on Thursday, saying he had withdrawn from a Siemens committee examining compliance issues.
He acknowledged concerns about a conflict of interest because of his role as chief executive of
Siemens until the start of 2005, when Klaus Kleinfeld took over.
"This measure was already in effect at yesterday's meeting of the audit committee. With this step, I
believe the concerns of a conflict of interest have been addressed," he said.

"I took major steps during my period as president and CEO to fight corruption. And you can be assured: I am deeply distressed that these efforts were not successful enough," von Pierer said.

Fund manager Henning Gebhardt, head of German equities at DWS Investment, which is one of the company's biggest shareholders with about 1 billion  euros' worth of stock, said: "The latest operating numbers make us optimistic ... that our trust in the supervisory and managing boards won't be disappointed."
"Mr Kleinfeld, take this chance to rise above this scandal and restore  Siemens' reputation." Kleinfeld, who has been forced to make numerous public statements on the subject and has hired
external advisers, auditors and experts to help stamp out corruption at  Siemens, told shareholders he
was doing his best.

"Assumptions, speculation, accusations and defamations dominate the current situation -- and, unfortunately, some of them will turn out to be based on fact," he said.

"No one knows what the outcome of these investigations will be. And it's not appropriate to fuel speculation. However, I can assure you that we are doing everything we can to clear up these incidents completely and comprehensively."

Siemens earlier reported forecast-beating first-quarter financial results that boosted its shares more than 6 percent to their highest level since November 2001.

HD      EC fines switchgear cartel firms $976 million

LP
The European Commission has fined 11 companies a total of €750.7 million ($976 million) for participating in an illegal cartel for gas-insulated switchgear projects, the EC said January 24.
Gas-insulated switchgear is heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids, and is the major component of turnkey power substations.

The EC said it had found that the 11 companies had "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information" between 1988 and 2004. The companies concerned are ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech. The EC said  ABB had received full immunity from the  fines for alerting the EC to the existence of the cartel.

TD
"The Commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years. The Commission has once more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"This is the largest single  fine the EC has ever imposed on a single cartel," The EC's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said. He said the  fine on Germany's Siemens alone of €396 million was the largest ever imposed on a single company for participating in a single cartel.

"The Commission regards cartels as totally unacceptable behavior... this is a warning to other companies if they follow this bad example," Todd said.

The cartel was brought to an end in May 2004 when the EC launched surprise inspections after  ABB alerted it to the  cartel, requesting immunity from any  fines. The EC found documents including detailed written agreements concluded in 1988 between members of the  cartel where they agreed to inform each other of calls for tender and coordinated their bids to secure contracts in line with their quotas in the cartel, the EC said. They also agreed that Japanese companies would not sell in Europe and European companies would stay out of the Japanese market. The EC said the members of the cartel had taken "sophisticated measures to keep their communications secret" including anonymous and encrypted emails and that "code names were used for both companies and individuals".

Siemens rapidly published a statement stating it intends to go to the  European Court of Justice to take legal action against the €396  fine. "The company denies the blanket accusation of the EU  Commission that it participated in a  cartel in the European market for 72 kV and higher gas-isolated switchgear systems (GIS) between 1988 and 2004. Price fixing  in the GIS segment took place only in a few projects in the European economic area and only in the period between October 2002 and April 2004," it said January 24.

SIEMENS AG, Europe's biggest engineering company, says fines by European antitrust regulators because of alleged price fixing  will crimp first-quarter earnings. Siemens was fined EUR396.6 million ($A657.7 million), the European Commission said in a statement.

"We decided to fully book the  fines in the three months through December," said Udo Niehage, head of Siemens' power transmission and distribution unit, at a press briefing in Munich. "The fines are completely exaggerated and we will take legal action, but we still have to transfer the fines within three months to the  European authorities."

TD
Siemens, Areva SA, Alstom  SA, Schneider Electric SA and another six makers of electricity network equipment were fined a total of EUR750.7 million for fixing prices, the second-biggest penalty imposed by European antitrust regulators.

Siemens said it started its own investigation in May 2004 after prosecutors searched company offices. Siemens said it suspended three employees on June 1 the same year, and is reviewing the legality of deals worth EUR60 million.

Mr Niehage said he was shocked by the alleged wrongdoing and that he "wasn't personally aware of the accusations" before the company was contacted by the authorities in 2004.

Siemens is also the target of allegations regarding whether customers were bribed to win orders for its communication unit.
The company is reviewing EUR420 million in payments after police raided its offices in Germany last
November.
The probe, which has spread to Siemens offices in countries including Italy, Switzerland and
Liechtenstein, has forced Siemens to take charges that reduced fiscal 2006 earnings.

(CIA, Jan 24, Hospodarske noviny-13, Jan 25) The  European Commission has imposed record-breaking fines worth ER 750.7 mln (CZK 21 bln) to 10 manufacturers of energy technology. More than a half of the total fine, exactly EUR 396.56 mln, will be paid by Siemens. ABB will be able to avoid the  fine because it notified the EC about the  cartel's existence. The Commission found out that the 10 guilty companies formed a cartel between 1988 and 2004, negotiated prices and other conditions for public sector tenders and shared information. The  cartel involved the production and supply of switchboards for transformer stations. The  cartel agreement damaged operators of electricity grids and distribution networks in several European countries.

TD
(CIA, Jan 24) In addition to  Siemens, the EC  fines were imposed on Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (EUR
118.6 mln),  Toshiba (EUR 90.9 mln),  Alstom  (over EUR 65 mln), Areva (EUR 53.55 mln),  Hitachi  (EUR
51.75 mln), VA Tech (EUR 22.05 mln), Schneider (EUR 8.1 mln),  Fuji (EUR 3.75 mln) and Japan AE
Power Systems (EUR 1.35 mln).The Czech grid operator CEPS has not recorded any  cartel activities in
its tenders.

(Hospodarske noviny-1,18, Jan 24) Only two Czechs participated in this year's World Economic Forum in Davos. Among the 2,400 guests from around the world, Czech business was represented by CEZ CEO Martin Roman and a representative of the non-profit sector. Roman was applauded as one of 250 young global leaders announced by the forum each year based on their professional success.
(Hospodarske noviny-15, Jan 26) The price of carbon dioxide permits in the  European market dropped on

high number and chances that Brussels will be unable to push through plans of drastic emission cuts.

(Hospodarske noviny-18, Jan 25) Slovekia will file a complaint against the  European Commission (EC) due to cuts in the carbon dioxide emission quotas. Slovakia wanted permits for 41.3 mln tonnes of greenhouse gases a year between 2008 and 2013 but the EC cut the quota to 30.9 mln tonnes.

(Právo-10, Jan 22) Russia is ready to build a giant gas storage facility in Germany. German would thus become one of the largest  European distribution points, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Russia has nothing against branches from the North European gas pipelines to Poland or Sweden, Putin added.

(HN-17, Jan 23) Russia will apportion all new submarine oil and gas fields equally between public enterprises Rosněfť and Gazprom. It will thereby restrict access of foreign companies to its energy sector. The decision was reportedly adopted during President Vladimir Putin's meeting with government officials last week.

(Hospodarske noviny-23, Jan 22) The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reduced the forecast of the world growth in the demand for crude oil for this year. This was caused by unusually warm weather on the northern hemisphere. The  cartel expects that the demand would fall to
30.1 million barrels per day instead of 30.3 million barrels.

HD           Leading the News: Siemens profit  declines  17% --- EU price-fixing fine dents bottom  line; sales, new orders rise

LP
MUNICH -- Siemens AG posted a 17% decline in fiscal first-quarter net profit because of a  European
Union fine for price fixing,  though its operating profit improved after a turnaround at its
information-technology unit.
Net profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to 739 million  euros ($957.8 million) from 886 million
euros a year earlier, weighed down by a 423 million  euro charge tied to the EU  fine.

TD
Sales rose 6.1% to 19.07 billion  euros from 17.98 billion  euros, while new orders were up 3.9% to
24.58 billion euros. Sales and new orders were boosted by double-digit percentage growth in power
generation and transmission and automation and drives.
The company posted a 51% rise in operating profit, which excludes expenses such as the EU  fine. The quarterly results were disclosed just hours after the German engineering and technology giant
announced a sweeping portfolio revamp: It agreed to buy U.S. software firm UGS Corp. for $3.5
billion, while planning to sell a minority stake in its  Siemens VDO Automotive car-parts division
through an initial public offering.

Siemens shares ended up 6% Thursday at 82.60  euros in Frankfurt.

The company's information-technology-services unit, SBS, posted profit of 24 million  euros, compared with a loss of 232 million  euros, while earnings climbed at other units, such as medical equipment and transportation systems.

Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld has disposed of the loss-plagued cellphone arm, unveiled job cuts and made several big purchases since taking the helm in early 2005. He also vowed to bring profit margins in line with peers such as General Electric Co. by April.

Mr. Kleinfeld still has his work cut out to raise the profitability of four of the conglomerate's 10 divisions in the current quarter in order to meet that April deadline.

Meanwhile, Siemens has been haunted by several issues, with the latest blow coming Wednesday from a 423 million euro penalty imposed by the  European Commission for price fixing  among providers of gas-insulated electric-power switchgear. The company also is a target of investigations by Munich prosecutors in a wide-ranging bribery probe, with several former executive-board members of the company among the suspects.

"In terms of underlying performance of our business, the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start," Mr. Kleinfeld said.

Meanwhile, the CEO continues to overhaul  Siemens's industrial holdings that make items including steam turbines, high-speed trains and light bulbs, in a drive to boost the company's profitability.

HD            Snakes alive, Qantas goes commie

REFLUX
AFTER searching hard for a new Asian airline to invest in, Qantas appears to have found a gem in
Vietnam's Pacific Airlines.

TD
While Pacific Air appears to have never made a dong, it has some impressive credentials it could bring to the Qantas group.
Aside from sharing its name with the airline which featured in the recent horror flick Snakes on a
Plane with Samuel L. Jackson, Vietnam's second major airline apparently "has been and continues to
be a pioneer in Vietnam for its numerous customer service programs".

For instance, the airline delivers tickets to people's homes for free. Sure beats the $12 Qantas credit card charge fee and $40 phone booking charge for international flights. Pacific Air also gives gifts to all child passengers.

But it is unclear what Qantas will make of Pacific Air's discounting policy. On its website, the airline offers bargains to "Vietnam's hero parents, elderly revolutionary cadres, wounded soldiers, relatives and family members of martyrs, victims of Agent Orange, senior citizens, adolescents".

The airline also boasts that its staff are "professional, savvy, skilled, and committed in all areas of activity". "With such quality human resources and a strong company culture, Pacific Airlines is fully able to meet the demands of domestic and international passengers with ever increasing effectiveness," the airline notes on its website.
Investment-grade ice-cream

Pacific Airlines' savvy approach has not gone unnoticed by passengers. The airline quality monitoring firm Skytrax has given Pacific Air a two-star rating. This puts the carrier in the same league as Air Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan Airlines, MIAT Mongolian Airlines, Biman Bangladesh and Sudan Airways.

Passenger comments on Pacific Air have been good, too. "Planes used are probably from a now defunct Soviet airline. I saw instructions in a Slavic language," one happy customer said on the Skytrax website. "Cabin has a funny smell and FAs [flight attendants] are adequate," added the customer.

Another customer also praised the airline's low fares and services. "They would not turn on air conditioner until the plane is in motion. The magazine seat pockets were worn out and torn," said the customer.

If Qantas has little luck in its proposed new Vietnam investment it could try the Communist state's ice-cream market. The Vietnam Net news service reported during the week the ice-cream market in Vietnam was growing 15 to 20 per cent a year.

"This proves to be an attractive figure for investors, though the ice-cream consumption level of Vietnamese people is still low compared to the world's consumption level, just 0.3 litres per capita per year," said Vietnam Net.

Pointing to the strong GDP and population growth in the country, the news service added: "The production of milk and ice cream-made products are being encouraged by the State."
Another Hilmer classic

The former chief executive of Fairfax Media, Fred Hilmer, signed a deal to become a content provider for the Evil Empire, News Limited.

Due to some legal thingummy or watchyacallit, Reflux was unable to reprint extracts of the book, given Hilmer signed an exclusive deal to have extracts published in the News Ltd newspapers. A pre-released copy of the book appeared to be in such high demand on the Herald news floor that it went missing.

Reflux was not even allowed to find out the name of the alleged book. Going by other ageless classics penned by Hilmer such as When the Luck Runs Out and Strictly Boardroom, the best this column could do was work out possible titles for the book: Honey, I Shrunk the Company, Newspapers: What Are They?, Fairfax for Dummies, It Was Not My Default Position, or How To Lose Circulation and Influence No One.

It is a shame that Hilmer - who is now vice-chancellor of the University of NSW - missed out on the groundbreaking acquisition Fairfax made this week of the mothering website Essential Baby.

The purchase means this media company will not only be encouraging single people to meet one another through its RSVP.com website but to go the whole hog. Apparently this business strategy is called horizontal integration.
Mysterious suitor
Meanwhile, Multiplex, the construction company famous for the delays in its redevelopment of
England's Wembley Stadium, finally had some good news for long-suffering security holders.

In a statement, Multiplex said it had received a "request from a third party to commence discussions on a confidential basis which may lead to a proposal being put in relation to the acquisition of Multiplex securities and/or assets".

The company said "no firm proposal" had been made and "it is not clear whether any proposal would be made". The only thing Reflux wonders is what does Multiplex mean by "third party".

Does this mean someone informed someone in a brown trenchcoat who told someone else in a bar who knows someone at Multiplex that they may want to take over the Perth-based company?

Nearly one year since it was meant to open its gates, the Multiplex partly-built Wembley Stadium also had some good news this week. The stadium announced it would be opening on March 3 for a local community day.

Given Wembley had reported a few blockages in its toilets during construction, it might be good to let some locals put the stadium to the test.

"Residents will be asked to play a crucial part in the initial testing of some key stadium facilities and will be making history as they help to get the stadium open," Wembley management said in a statement.

"Not only will visitors test-run the stadium's turnstiles, escalators and join together for a collective flush of the stadium loos, but they'll also get the chance to see some action on the famous Wembley pitch."
Lacking emphasis

German engineering group  Siemens took out the Reflux understatement of the week award after copping a EUR396 million ($662 million)  fine from the European Union competition  commission for participating in a  cartel.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  commission arrived at these amounts," said the president of  Siemens's Power Transmissions and Distribution unit, Udo Niehage.
Pocketmail goes nuclear

The most illogical takeover announcement of the week was Pocketmail Group's bid for the privately owned uranium explorer Adavale.

Page 50 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company, which is in the business of providing a mobile email service (most of us just use SMS or a BlackBerry), said it would raise $1 million in new shares to fund its acquisition of the uranium explorer.

Let's hope Adavale has more success finding radioactive material than Pocketmail has in finding subscribers. The company has "approximately" 3000 subscribers and generated a whopping
$158,000 in revenues in the six months to December 31. Maybe Pocketmail's new mobile email devices could be nuclear powered.
The acquisition of Adavale comes three weeks after it was registered by John Risinger. Pocketmail's main claim to fame is its chairman, Andrew Kelly, is the founder of the floundering car
radio retailer Strathfield Group.

Ian Norris, former chief executive of construction company Morgan Crucible, became the latest director to be ordered to America under the controversial Extradition Act. Mr Norris, who heard his fate in the High Court last week, faces charges in the US for his alleged role in a  price-fixing scandal. He is accused of colluding with other executives to rig carbon product prices in the 1990s and then later trying to shred incriminating documents.

Another week, another outrageous pay package for a top banker. This time it was Stanley O’Neal, chief executive of Merrill Lynch. It was revealed that the Wall Street veteran earnt $48m (£24.5m) in 2006, or
30 per cent more than the year before. His compensation came after a bumper year for Merrills, whose net income rose to $7.5bn on the back of the mergers and acquisitions boom.

Trevor Matthews, head of the life and pensions business at Standard Life, was forced to apologise after making a racist remark during a staff meeting. Asked by an employee why a proposal to close the company’s final salary scheme was put at the very end of a report, Mr Matthews referred to the matter as the “nigger in the woodpile”. A complaint was swiftly filed and he was forced to issue an apology on the Standard Life website.
Klaus Kleinfeld,chief executive officer of German engineering giant  Siemens, was carpeted by
investors after the  European Commission fined the company€397m (£261m) for alleged  price-fixing.
Siemens was one of a group of companies that made up an alleged  cartel said to have inflated
electricity network equipment prices. Shareholders were shocked by the penalty, one of the largest ever
levied by the EC.

Corporate Germany was in the dock last week when a former Volkswagen boss was convicted of bribery. Michael Woodhead reports from Frankfurt on a national system that breeds corruption

He arrived dressed in a tailor-made dark-blue suit, light-blue shirt and matching tie, and was driven in a black Volkswagen Phaeton limousine burnished to perfection. Everything about him epitomised his status as the man who set Germany on the road to recovery.

Peter Hartz, former personnel director at Volkswagen, the son of a hatmaker and once the confidant of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, was once again in the limelight.

But this time it was not to the applause of the German government and business leaders but to the shouts of an angry crowd as he shuffled his way across a cobbled yard to a courthouse in Brunswick to confess to bribery and corruption on a grand scale.

At the precise moment Hartz stood before the court, in Munich the supervisory board chairman of the engineering giant  Siemens was facing 9,000 angry shareholders and apologising for another corruption scandal -the worst in German corporate history.

For Germans, the live television pictures of Hartz's court appearance together with those from Munich of the humbled  Siemens board members had an awesome and tragic Wagnerian touch of Gotterdammerung (Twilight of the Gods).

It was the moment Germans began to ask themselves who else is guilty. How deeply ingrained is institutionalised corruption? Who let them get away with it for so long?

After decades of pride in their postwar "economic miracle", last week the Germans lost faith in the honesty of their business leaders and to some extent in how that miracle happened.

"In the past, cases of corruption in a company were more frequently covered up or played down. Nowadays there is more public awareness and people are more sensitive to the issue," said Peter von Blomberg of Transparency International, a group that fights corruption around the world.

Some public anger was vented at the Hartz trial, where protesters carried placards demanding that he be jailed. Hartz is a particular focus of rage because he was the architect of employment-law reforms, the toughest of which produced severe cuts in state benefits.

The public backlash over the Hartz corruption affair has led to leading members of the German government promising to remove his name from the statute books. A new title will now be found for the Hartz labour reforms.

Never has the image of the mighty German industrial machine, renowned for hitting record-breaking targets for exports year after year, been so tarnished.

THE LATE and unlamented Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha is an unlikely figure to intrude into German domestic politics. But he is alleged to have received millions of dollars in backhanders from  Siemens. More than seven Siemens executives have been arrested amid allegations that the company set up a
Page 53 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
slush fund to pay bribes to win billions of  euros worth of international contracts. A network of front companies and secret bank accounts set up by  Siemens employees has been uncovered by the Munich prosecutors.

In the case of Volkswagen and Hartz the investigation uncovered the extraordinarily louche life of German bosses. There is evidence that for more than a decade Hartz, his union chums, along with prominent politicians and fellow executives from the Volkswagen empire, jollied their way through millions of euros signed off as "in the interests of the company". Not all of it was legitimate.

Such "interests" included group visits to brothels in Germany, Spain and South America. In addition there were expensive presents for "girlfriends", VIP treatment at Czech nightclubs and discos and luxurious trips around the world.

Meanwhile, hard-pressed ordinary Germans were enduring a long period of economic stagnation and cuts in household spending.

The German public is angry that, at both Volkswagen and  Siemens, executives with salaries of millions of euros a year were greasing palms as if it were standard business practice.
As Siemens publicly owned up to errors, Hartz was in court pleading guilty to paying E2m over a
10-year period in bribes to Klaus Volkert, former head of Volkswagen's works council. Another charge
of paying Volkert's former Brazilian mistress, Adriana Barros, E400,000 was dropped as part of a deal
with the prosecutors.

In return for a full confession, Hartz got off lightly. The whole complex investigation would be wrapped up in two days. No prostitutes would be called as witnesses and no details given in public -in effect the whole scandal would be brushed under the carpet.
Hartz faced up to five years in prison but escaped with only a two-year probation order and a  fine of
E576,000. The senior Brunswick prosecutor Hildegard Wolff said she was happy with the outcome.

Both the Volkswagen sex and corruption affair and the continuing investigation into  Siemens have shaken even hardened experts such as Von Blomberg.

Of Siemens he said: "It astonishes us. The size of the case begs the question whether corruption is part of Siemens's corporate culture and is knowingly tolerated by management or whether the
company is simply the victim of ruthless managers acting for their personal gain. Whatever the answer, all control systems have clearly failed."

The same questions are being asked of Volkswagen. Who at the very top of the company knew what was going on? Did they sanction it or turn a blind eye?

Hartz claimed he had acted entirely on his own initiative. Nobody believed him, least of all the court judges. They asked him to go away and think over what he had said. He duly consulted his lawyer and returned on the final day of the case with a revised explanation. Actually, he said, the then Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech did agree to paying Volkert a "bonus" but had no idea how much it was.

Some suspect this was an an attempt to cover up the extent of the corruption. The doubters point out that Hartz and Piech had adjoining offices on the 13th floor of Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg.

"I believe Piech should resign," said Hans-Olaf Henkel, the former president of the German Industry Federation. "He used Hartz to buy off the head of the works council so he could do crazy things like purchasing Bugatti and building the Phaeton, which make no money. To say he (Hartz) did it all on his own is like saying the Earth is flat."

THE SCANDALS are seen by many as making a mockery of Germany's vaunted social-market economy. While appearing to adopt a more Anglo-Saxon shareholder culture and a stricter code of corporate governance, German boardrooms and their political friends actually carried on as they always had done -scratching each other's backs and living in each other's pockets.

However, the system dubbed "the amigo culture" had served Germany well during the so-called "economic miracle" years. And despite the belated recognition in the 1990s that Germany was out of step with the more market investment-driven economies of Britain and America, the Germans were loath to give it up. They tried instead to have it both ways.

Big companies realised they would have to introduce greater transparency if they were to have a chance of raising investment capital on the open markets. The postwar years were typified by cosy


Page 54 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
relationships between lending banks and companies. Executives sat on each other's boards in a bewildering network of reciprocal arrangements between companies, banks and politicians.

Volkswagen typifies the system. Before he became federal chancellor, Schroder was the former governor of the state of Lower Saxony, which has a large shareholding in Volkswagen.

Schroder was greeted as the reforming chancellor. Indeed, he did introduce a new code of corporate governance and he did start an ambitious project called Agenda 2010 to make Germany fit for the challenges of the 21st century.
But beneath the veneer, Schroder was an old-fashioned German social-market economy stalwart. Schroder befriended Hartz, who was a trade-union official, and drew him into his inner circle, where
moralising about anyone's personal life or the way they did business was regarded as bad form.
Schroder himself had easily shrugged off criticism of his closeness to Volkswagen's Piech. Schroder
and his then wife had flown at Piech's expense in a private jet to the Vienna Opera Ball.

Piech appointed Hartz as Volkswagen personnel director in 1993 saying "Hartz is our best man" -and so he proved to be, getting the unions to agree to a range of changes to working practices.

Schroder later asked his friend to set up the Hartz  Commission. Its brief was to reform the employment laws and come up with job-creation schemes. The Hartz reforms paved the way for the present
upswing in the economy. Hartz had become the man for all seasons.

However, the reality was very different. The much-vaunted restructuring measures at Volkswagen were a fix between management and unions. This was possible because of what is known as the co- determination law, which decrees that the supervisory board of companies must be equally divided between management and unions.
"This trial is a huge indictment of the co-determination principle," said Henkel.
"Everything that is wrong with this law is evident in this affair. At Volkswagen you had a union member
(Hartz) landing overnight on the board of a major company.
He went from being nobody and earning nothing to a six-figure salary.

"When Hartz solved Volkswagen's overmanning problems by reducing the working week without losses in pay, it made him into a hero with Schroder. Hartz had done the right thing politically and that counted with Schroder," said Henkel.

Henkel says Chancellor Angela Merkel should repeal the co-determination laws. "No German chief executive dare criticise the system in public. In private they want it dug up by the roots," said Henkel.

And the public apology by Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of the  Siemens supervisory board, has added to the feeling that the system doesn't work any more.

Von Pierer told his audience that his failure to fight corruption when he was the chairman had caused him "great grief".

The German press remains unconvinced. Die Welt commented that "Siemens has the worst bribery scandal in German corporate history to its name, an infamous sale of its bankrupt mobile-phone subsidiary, illegal  price fixing  and, on top of that, exaggerated rises in executive pay. It is this difference between what it claims and what it really is that make Von Pierer's excuses sound weak."

But the aftershocks of this scandal are far from over. Further trials are expected later this year, not least those involving Siemens itself.

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Jan. 24 handed out hefty fines totaling 750 million  euro ($975 million) to Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and nine other Japanese and European companies. The biggest penalty ever assessed by the EU's  European Commission for a single cartel was issued for fixing prices on switchgears used by power utilities.

Although the Japanese companies have done little business in the EU, the  commission said they had colluded with the  European firms to distort price competition by staying out of one another's markets. The cartel has allegedly been in existence for 16 years.

Mitsubishi Electric was  fined roughly 118 million euro, with Hitachi  Ltd.,  Toshiba Corp., Fuji Electric
Systems Co. and Japan AE Power Systems Corp. also fined.

Germany's Siemens AG received the largest  fine, about 396 million euro, while Alstom  SA of France and other European companies were penalized as well. Swiss firm ABB Ltd. was implicated but had its fine waived because it provided information concerning the cartel.

"We will consider our response, including filing an appeal in a  European court, after reviewing (the order)," Mitsubishi Electric said in a statement.

Toshiba also plans to appeal its fine. "We have not engaged in illegal activity," a spokesperson said, "so we will fight this in a European court."
The other affected Japanese companies are still weighing their responses.

Hitachi  argues it does not sell the equipment at issue in  Europe - the firm's power equipment operations were transferred to Japan AE Power Systems in 2002.

Fuji Electric Systems says it will formulate a response after further reviewing the order.

With firms like the heavily penalized  Siemens dominating the European market for utility infrastructure, Japanese companies have made very few inroads there. Siemens also objects to the commission's decision and intends to file an appeal.

HD       EC fines switchgear cartel

The European Commission has fined 11 companies a total of €750.7 million for participating in an illegal cartel for gas-insulated switchgear projects, the EC said on January 24.

Gas-insulated switchgear is heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids, and is the major component of turnkey power substations.

TD
The EC said it had found that the companies had "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information" between 1988 and 2004.

The companies concerned are ABB, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji, Hitachi  Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Schneider, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech. The EC said  ABB had received immunity from the  fines for blowing the whistle on the  cartel.

"The Commission has put an end to a  cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. "The  Commission has once
more shown that it will not tolerate cartels in  Europe and the damage that they do in any area of business."

"This is the largest single  fine the EC has ever imposed on a single  cartel," The EC's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said. The  fine on Germany's Siemens of €396 million was the largest ever imposed on a single company for participating in a single cartel.

The cartel was brought to an end in May 2004 after the EC launched raids. It found written agreements concluded in 1988 between members of the  cartel, where they agreed to inform each other of calls for tender and to coordinate bids to secure contracts in line with their quotas in the  cartel, The EC said. European firms agreed with Japanese firms not to infringe on each others' markets. Sophisticated measures were taken to keep communication secret, the EC said, including anonymous and encrypted emails and code names used for companies and individuals.

Siemens reacted immediately, saying it would take legal action in the  European Court of Justice against the fines. The company denied the "blanket accusation" that it had participated in a  cartel in the European market for 72 kV and higher gas-insulated switchgear systems between 1988 and 2004.
"Price fixing  in the GIS segment took place only in a few projects in the  European economic area and only in the period between October 2002 and April 2004,"  Siemens said.

"The fines are completely exaggerated, and we cannot understand how the  Commission arrived at these amounts," said  Siemens' president of power T&D Dr Udo Niehage.

"The accusation that  Siemens participated in a cartel in the market for gas-isolated switchgear systems from 1988 to 2004 goes far beyond the findings of Siemens' internal investigation," the company said.

With the acquisition of VA Tech in 2005 and the integration of VA Tech T&D in the PTD Group,  Siemens assumed financial responsibility for VA Tech. This responsibility also involves accepting any legal consequences resulting from past antitrust violations on the part of VA Tech. VA Tech companies in
Italy, France, Great Britain and Austria were served with antitrust  fines totaling round €22 million at the same time Siemens was charged antitrust  fines. "In the VA Tech cases, the  fines seem

disproportionately large as well, and legal action will be taken against any unjustified accusations,"
Siemens said.

HD        Commission Switches  Cartel Fines Up A Gear

The European Commission yesterday imposed a fine totalling €750 million (£500m) on members of a European gas insulated switchgear  cartel. The fine is the largest ever imposed by the  Commission on a single cartel.
The cartel, which had been in operation for some sixteen years, had been involved in a litany of
anti-competitive conduct - they had coordinated their bids for contracts over the sixteen year period, fixed
prices, allocated projects amongst themselves, shared markets and exchanged commercially sensitive
information.

TD
The cartel itself was highly organised. Code names were used by the members and they employed sophisticated techniques (such as encrypted e-mail to anonymous addresses) to avoid detection. The Commission only found out about the cartel when one of the participants,  ABB, blew the whistle and applied for immunity under the Commission's leniency programme. The authorities then carried out a series of dawn raids during which a significant amount of evidence of the  cartel was uncovered.

ABB's decision to come clean when it did was clearly a very sensible one. As it was first to blow the whistle the company received 100% immunity from  fines and saved itself €215 million as a result!

This shows that, if you are (or have been) part of a  cartel, whilst there are very real penalties, there are real benefits of being first to approach the authorities. It also shows that, no matter how cosy or
long-lasting the  cartel, you never know when one of your co-conspirators may have an attack of conscience. In the UK, the Office of Fair Trading has a very similar leniency regime where the first organisation to repent can look forward to total immunity from  fines.

HD          Widening  Scandal: At Siemens, Witnesses  Cite Pattern of Bribery  --- They Call It Common;  Firm
Denies Impropriety By Any High Officials

One day in early 2004, senior  Siemens AG executive Michael Kutschenreuter says, he got a disturbing phone call from a Saudi Arabian businessman.

The caller said he represented Beit Al Etisallat, a Saudi consulting firm that had been a business partner of  Siemens. Now Beit wanted $910 million in  commission payments. If  Siemens didn't pay up, the caller threatened, he would forward documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission detailing bribes paid on the German industrial giant's behalf to win telecommunications contracts in the kingdom.

TD
Mr. Kutschenreuter says he alerted his superiors, including Klaus Kleinfeld, now the chief executive of Siemens, and Heinrich von Pierer, the CEO at the time. Mr. Kutschenreuter also says that with the backing of the  Siemens management board, he reached a deal in January 2005 to pay Beit Al Etisallat
$50 million. He says that $17 million was for past obligations and the rest was what he describes as
"hush money" to make the problem go away.

It hasn't. Mr. Kutschenreuter was arrested in November as part of a widening criminal investigation that has shaken the foundations of the storied 160-year-old German conglomerate. Mr. Kutschenreuter and five other suspects were released from custody before Christmas after agreeing to cooperate with German prosecutors.

Prosecutors suspect that  Siemens officials diverted funds through sham consulting contracts to slush funds to bribe potential customers over several years. Since police raids made the probe public, Siemens says it has uncovered 420 million  euros ($544 million) in suspicious transactions spanning seven years and has ordered an external audit. Investigators now are trying to determine how far up the corporate ladder the corruption traveled.

Mr. Kutschenreuter is their star witness. If allegations by him and others pan out,  Siemens could find itself barred from bidding for public-sector projects in many of the nearly 200 countries in which it is active. Mr. Kutschenreuter's lawyer declined to discuss the details of the witness statement but said investigators consider his client to be a reliable witness. The Munich prosecutor's office said the investigation is continuing and declined to discuss details of it. Police are looking into the veracity of Mr. Kutschenreuter's allegations.

Siemens suspended Mr. Kutschenreuter after his arrest and says its payments to Beit Al Etisallat were perfectly legitimate.  Siemens says that it is cooperating with authorities and that any wrongdoing was confined to "individual acts" by renegade managers.

Arrest warrants and detailed witness statements by company executives, including Mr. Kutschenreuter, suggest a different story. The statements, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, depict a company where payment of bribes was common and highly organized. The statements portray top  Siemens executives as scrambling to escape detection while prosecutors from neighboring countries drew an ever-tighter net.

The allegations come at a difficult time for  Siemens, which manufactures a wide range of products from power turbines and medical scanners to light bulbs. CEO Mr. Kleinfeld has been restructuring its
Page 61 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
far-flung operations to narrow the focus and bring up profit margins. A plan to merge the bulk of Siemens's telecom-equipment business -- the main focus of the criminal investigation -- into a joint venture with Nokia Corp. has been delayed by the bribery investigation.

The case also underscores what critics say is German industry's failure to improve corporate governance. Until Germany toughened its corruption laws in 1999, companies were actually allowed to write off as expenses bribes paid abroad. DaimlerChrysler AG is under investigation by the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department for what the auto maker acknowledges were "improper payments" in Africa, Asia and Eastern  Europe.

Last week, Siemens was hit with a roughly 400 million  euros fine by the European Commission for leading a cartel that allegedly fixed prices in the market for electric-power switching gear. Siemens says the fine is unjustified and that it plans to fight the penalty.

In the potentially more damaging bribery investigation,  Siemens says that while it's impossible to keep close watch over every one of its 480,000 employees, it knows of no wrongdoing by members of its current management or supervisory board. CEO Mr. Kleinfeld -- who prosecutors have so far said is only a witness, not a suspect -- says  Siemens has "zero tolerance" for corruption. Mr. von Pierer also says he never engaged in illegal activity. Mr. von Pierer gave up the CEO post two years ago to head Siemens's supervisory board.

The highest-ranking executive arrested so far is Thomas Ganswindt, a member of the management board until last September. German prosecutors have also said that Heinz-Joachim Neuburger -- Siemens's chief financial officer until last April -- is a suspect. Mr. Ganswindt's lawyer said his client is not guilty. A lawyer for Mr. Neuburger declined to comment.
Mr. Kutschenreuter, in the witness statement made after his arrest, spread the blame far wider.

In the Beit Al Etisallat matter he described, Mr. Kutschenreuter said that a  Siemens colleague of his met in London in early 2004 with the Saudi caller, Abdul Wahab Al-Akeel. According to the witness statement, the colleague returned to Munich with documents detailing bribes by  Siemens from the late
1990s until early 2000. The payments allegedly were made to win contracts with Saudi Telecom to supply equipment for land-line and wireless communications networks.

The colleague said Beit Al Etisallat would settle for double-digit millions of dollars, according to Mr. Kutschenreuter -- who added in his witness statement that he informed Messrs. Kleinfeld, Neuburger and Ganswindt of the situation in writing on April 26, 2004. Mr. Kleinfeld then was the senior executive in charge of Siemens's telecom business, a unit in which Mr. Kutschenreuter then oversaw finances for land-line operations.

Siemens's legal department recommended negotiations with Beit Al Etisallat after seeing Mr. Al-Akeel's documents, according to Mr. Kutschenreuter's witness statement.

Mr. Kutschenreuter said he then received a call from Mr. von Pierer, the CEO at the time, asking his opinion. He said he told the CEO it would likely cost $50 million to settle with Beit Al Etisallat, a consulting firm that  Siemens had dropped in favor of another Saudi firm in 2000.
Mr. Kutschenreuter said that he worked out the details over Christmas 2004 and the agreement to pay
$50 million was routed through a Saudi arbitration court to formalize it. He said he informed  Siemens's
management board of the agreement in January 2005, just as Mr. Kleinfeld was about to replace Mr.
von Pierer as CEO.

Mr. von Pierer said in a written response to questions that the settlement wasn't a bribe. He said Beit did outline $910 million in damages: a "completely arbitrary" $875 million for lost profit up to the year
2024; $19 million in past-due  commission claims; and $14 million for damage to the claimant's reputation. In January 2005, Mr. von Pierer said, the sides agreed to settle the matter and certify the payment in a Riyadh court.

A spokesman for Mr. Al-Akeel and Beit Al Etisallat declined to comment on the  Siemens negotiations. Executives at Saudi Telecom didn't return phone calls seeking comment.

In a written response, Mr. Kleinfeld gave the same version of events as Mr. von Pierer. "At no time did Mr. Kutschenreuter mention to me, that any 'Hush-Money' was involved in any settlement and at no time did I have any knowledge of documents relating to bribes and still have no such knowledge," he added in his emailed statement.

Mr. Kutschenreuter, 52 years old, joined the company in 1974 and was posted to Algeria in the late
1970s. After six years abroad, including a stint in Iraq, he returned to Germany in 1984 and took up a
position in the sales department for telecom contracts in Africa and the Middle East.

Back at Munich headquarters, he told prosecutors, he learned of an encryption code he alleged was widely used at Siemens to itemize bribe payments. He said it was derived from the phrase "Make Profit," with the phrase's 10 letters corresponding to the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0. Thus, with the letter A standing for 2 and P standing for 5, a reference to "file this in the APP file" meant a bribe was authorized at 2.55% of sales.
A spokesman for  Siemens said it has no knowledge of a "Make Profit" encryption system.

In the mid-1990s Mr. Kutschenreuter worked on financing for power projects. In that role, he alleged, he witnessed bribe payments for power projects in Russia and Slovakia.

After moving to  Siemens's information-technology division in 1999, Mr. Kutschenreuter said, he learned of bribes paid to Argentine government officials as  Siemens competed for a contract to develop electronically scannable passports. He said the payments stopped after the Argentine government changed hands in late 2001, before the contract had been awarded.

Siemens says allegations of bribe payments in Russia, Slovakia and Argentina are false. A
spokesman at the Argentine Embassy in Berlin declined to comment.

Mr. Kutschenreuter said he was personally involved in lots of bribe payments after becoming finance chief at the land-line telecom unit in early 2001. Though paying bribes abroad was illegal in Germany starting in 1999, many of his colleagues still saw them merely "as peccadilloes because it was all for the good of the company," he told prosecutors.

Two other former  Siemens telecom executives have also described alleged bribes, in November statements to prosecutors reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Reinhard Siekaczek and Andreas Mattes, onetime colleagues of Mr. Kutschenreuter, also said the bribes were carried out with the knowledge of senior managers.

Prosecutors have presented the three witness statements as evidence in the arraignment hearing of Mr. Ganswindt, the former management-board member. Mr. Ganswindt, like Messrs. Kutschenreuter and Siekaczek, was detained by authorities late last year and then released. Mr. Mattes wasn't detained.

Mr. Siekaczek, who worked at  Siemens for four decades, said in his witness statement that he was asked to set up slush funds for bribes in 1999 or 2000. He described a bank account in Salzburg, Austria, through which he said more than 75 million  euros in bribe funds flowed each year. In 2001, he alleged, Mr. Kutschenreuter warned him to shift funds elsewhere because Swiss authorities were following the trail of Austrian accounts linked to bribes in Nigeria.

Mr. Siekaczek gave prosecutors a long list of other countries in which he alleged that bribes were paid to win business, including Egypt, Cameroon and Kazakhstan. A lawyer for Mr. Siekaczek, who left Siemens in 2004, declined to comment on specifics but said police have investigated his client's statements and found them reliable.

Mr. Mattes told prosecutors that a member of the telecom unit's management board told him in 2001 that bribes were commonly paid for securing big telecom projects. Mr. Mattes is now an executive at Hewlett-Packard Co. in the U.S., after leaving  Siemens in 2005. His lawyer said Mr. Mattes met with investigators in November and stands by his testimony. The lawyer said his client is suspected of playing only a minor role in the alleged activity.
Messrs. Kutschenreuter and Siekaczek alleged in their statements that Joe Kaeser, now CFO at
Siemens, was aware of bribes while overseeing the wireless telecom unit's finances from 2001 to
2004. Mr. Kutschenreuter also cast blame on two other former wireless executives: Rudi Lamprecht,
now a member of Siemens's management board, and Lothar Pauly, who left in 2005 to join the
management board of Deutsche Telekom AG.

Siemens said Messrs. Kaeser and Lamprecht weren't aware of any alleged bribes and did nothing wrong. A lawyer for Mr. Pauly said allegations of wrongdoing by his client are false.

Prosecutors say bribes became more elaborate after a tightening of money-laundering laws following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and also after investigators in Italy, Switzerland and Liechtenstein began circling.


Page 63 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Investigators say  Siemens lawyers filed briefs to keep prosecutors from accessing bank records in some countries. Cuno Tarfuser, a prosecutor in the Italian city of Bolzano, said in an interview that his investigation of Austrian accounts was held up for months in 2004 and 2005 by legal challenges.

Siemens says that at no point did it try to prevent prosecutors from examining company-linked accounts. Siemens said that it has been cooperating with authorities for years.

A German arrest warrant for Mr. Siekaczek issued last November, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, mapped out how prosecutors suspect bribes were carried out in Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam from 2002 to 2004. It said that generally, after money was routed through at least three layers of secret accounts and shell companies, it was entrusted to "bag men" who carried bundles of cash to local "fixers." The fixers then organized the payoffs on behalf of Siemens.
In one case, prosecutors said in the arrest warrant, Mr. Siekaczek signed a consulting contract in July
2002 with Austrian firm Krhoma GmbH related to a project with Saudi Telecom. According to the arrest
warrant,  Siemens paid 4 million euros to Krhoma, which took a 60,000  euros commission before
wiring the rest to a firm that was based in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by Mr. Siekaczek.
A lawyer for Krhoma GmbH said Krhoma wasn't involved in illegal activity.

Mr. Kutschenreuter told prosecutors that the chief executive of  Siemens in Greece, Michael Christoforakos, told him in October 2004 the company had made illegal payments for an infrastructure project related to the 2004 Athens Olympics. Mr. Kutschenreuter said he informed other senior managers, including Messrs. Ganswindt and Neuburger, of the conversation.

Mr. Siekaczek's arrest warrant cited 1.83 million  euros in suspicious transfers from  Siemens to third parties in 2004 and alleged they were related to an Athens security-systems contract.

A Siemens spokeswoman in Greece said Mr. Christoforakos "has never mentioned anything to anybody concerning improper payments" related to the Olympics. She said he has met as a voluntary witness with Greek prosecutors, who are conducting a preliminary probe of the awarding of a
security-systems contract. She said  Siemens was a subcontractor and "there is no evidence of any wrongdoing or improper behavior whatsoever."

Mr. Kutschenreuter had a busy Christmas in 2004. In addition to trying to settle the Saudi matter, he told prosecutors, he got a call from Mr. Siekaczek telling him that Liechtenstein authorities were investigating certain bank accounts there. Again, Mr. Kutschenreuter alleged, senior management was informed.

Siemens later told Liechtenstein authorities that the accounts were its own, and asked prosecutors to end their investigation, according to Robert Wallner, the lead Liechtenstein prosecutor. The authorities continued to dig. At the same time, investigators in Switzerland, Italy and Austria were tracking separate leads on suspicious transactions flowing through other bank accounts tied to  Siemens or people acting on its behalf.

This past November, armed with the information, more than 200 German police raided about 30 offices and homes of current and former  Siemens employees. They searched offices of management-board members, including Mr. Kleinfeld, the CEO, and seized 36,000 documents. German prosecutors are sifting the material and questioning more people in a probe that could stretch for several more months or longer.

Mr. Kutschenreuter, who by the time of his arrest had moved on to  Siemens's real-estate division, told prosecutors in December that he would cooperate because Mr. Kleinfeld had said he wanted to get to the bottom of the matter. "I can help him with that," he said in his witness statement.

At the company's annual meeting in Munich last week, Mr. Kleinfeld said he was "shocked" when he heard the allegations of wrongdoing. "I can assure you that we are doing everything that we can to clear up these incidents completely," he said.

His predecessor, Mr. von Pierer, told the crowd of 10,000 restive shareholders that while serving as CEO for more than a decade, he had taken major steps to combat corruption. He added, "I am deeply distressed that these efforts were not successful enough."

One day in early 2004, senior  Siemens AG executive Michael Kutschenreuter says, he got a disturbing phone call from a Saudi Arabian businessman.

The caller said he represented Beit Al Etisallat, a Saudi consulting firm that had been a business partner of  Siemens. Now Beit wanted $910 million in  commission payments. If  Siemens didn't pay up, the caller threatened, he would forward documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission detailing bribes paid on the German industrial giant's behalf to win telecommunications contracts in the kingdom.

Mr. Kutschenreuter says he alerted his superiors, including Klaus Kleinfeld, now the chief executive of Siemens, and Heinrich von Pierer, the former CEO. Mr. Kutschenreuter also says that with the backing of the Siemens management board, he reached a deal in January 2005 to pay Beit Al Etisallat $50 million. He says $17 million was for past obligations and the rest was what he describes as "hush money" to make the problem go away.

It hasn't. Mr. Kutschenreuter was arrested in November as part of a widening criminal investigation that has shaken the foundations of the storied 160-year-old German conglomerate. Mr. Kutschenreuter and five other suspects were released from custody before Christmas after agreeing to cooperate with German prosecutors.

Prosecutors suspect that  Siemens officials diverted funds through sham consulting contracts to slush funds to bribe potential customers over several years. Since police raids made the probe public, Siemens says it has uncovered 420 million  euros ($544 million) in suspicious transactions spanning seven years and has ordered an external audit. Investigators now are trying to determine how far up the corporate ladder the corruption traveled.

Mr. Kutschenreuter is their star witness. If allegations by him and others pan out,  Siemens could find itself barred from bidding for public-sector projects in many of the nearly 200 countries in which it is active. Mr. Kutschenreuter's lawyer declined to discuss the details of the witness statement but said investigators consider his client to be a reliable witness. The Munich prosecutor's office said the investigation is continuing and declined to discuss details of it. Police are looking into the veracity of Mr. Kutschenreuter's allegations.

Siemens suspended Mr. Kutschenreuter after his arrest and says its payments to Beit Al Etisallat were perfectly legitimate.  Siemens says it is cooperating with authorities and that any wrongdoing was confined to "individual acts" by renegade managers.

Arrest warrants and detailed witness statements by company executives, including Mr. Kutschenreuter, suggest a different story. The statements, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, depict a company where payment of bribes was common and highly organized. The statements portray top  Siemens executives as scrambling to escape detection while prosecutors from neighboring countries drew an ever-tighter net.

The allegations come at a difficult time for  Siemens, which manufactures a wide range of products from power turbines and medical scanners to lightbulbs. CEO Mr. Kleinfeld has been restructuring its far-flung operations to narrow the focus and bring up profit margins. A plan to merge the bulk of

Siemens's telecom-equipment business -- the main focus of the criminal investigation -- into a joint venture with Nokia Corp. has been delayed by the bribery investigation.

The case also underscores what critics say is German industry's failure to improve corporate governance. Until Germany toughened its corruption laws in 1999, companies were actually allowed to write off as expenses bribes paid abroad. DaimlerChrysler AG is under investigation by the SEC and the U.S. Justice Department for what the auto maker acknowledges were "improper payments" in Africa, Asia and Eastern  Europe.

Last week, Siemens was hit with roughly a 423 million  euro fine by the European Commission for leading a cartel that allegedly fixed prices in the market for electric-power switching gear. Siemens says the fine is unjustified and that it plans to fight the penalty.

Siemens senior management denies any wrongdoing. CEO Mr. Kleinfeld -- who prosecutors have so far said is only a witness, not a suspect -- says  Siemens has "zero tolerance" for corruption. Mr. von Pierer also says he never engaged in illegal activity. Mr. von Pierer gave up the CEO post two years ago to head Siemens's supervisory board.

The highest-ranking executive arrested so far is Thomas Ganswindt, a member of the management board until September. German prosecutors have also said that Heinz-Joachim Neuburger -- Siemens's chief financial officer until last April -- is a suspect. Mr. Ganswindt's lawyer said his client is not guilty. A lawyer for Mr. Neuburger declined to comment.
Mr. Kutschenreuter, in the witness statement made after his arrest, spread the blame far wider.

In the Beit Al Etisallat matter he described, Mr. Kutschenreuter said a  Siemens colleague of his met in London in early 2004 with the Saudi caller, Abdul Wahab Al-Akeel. According to the witness statement, the colleague returned to Munich with documents detailing bribes by  Siemens from the late 1990s until early 2000. The payments allegedly were made to win contracts with Saudi Telecom to supply equipment for land-line and wireless communications networks.

The colleague said Beit Al Etisallat would settle for double-digit millions of dollars, according to Mr. Kutschenreuter -- who added in his witness statement that he informed Messrs. Kleinfeld, Neuburger and Ganswindt of the situation in writing on April 26, 2004. Mr. Kleinfeld then was the senior executive in charge of Siemens's telecom business, a unit in which Mr. Kutschenreuter then oversaw finances for land-line operations.

Siemens's legal department recommended negotiations with Beit Al Etisallat after seeing Mr. Al-Akeel's documents, according to Mr. Kutschenreuter's witness statement.

Mr. Kutschenreuter said he then received a call from Mr. von Pierer, the CEO at the time, asking his opinion. He said he told the CEO it would likely cost $50 million to settle with Beit Al Etisallat, a consulting firm  Siemens had dropped in favor of another Saudi firm in 2000.

Mr. Kutschenreuter said he worked out the details over Christmas 2004 and the agreement to pay $50 million was routed through a Saudi arbitration court to formalize it. He said he informed  Siemens's management board of the agreement in January 2005, just as Mr. Kleinfeld was about to replace Mr. von Pierer as CEO.

Mr. von Pierer said in a written response to questions that the settlement wasn't a bribe. He said Beit did outline $910 million in damages: a "completely arbitrary" $875 million for lost profit up to the year
2024; $19 million in past-due  commission claims; and $14 million for damage to the claimant's reputation. In January 2005, Mr. von Pierer said, the sides agreed to settle the matter and certify the payment in a Riyadh court.

A spokesman for Mr. Al-Akeel and Beit Al Etisallat declined to comment on the  Siemens negotiations. Executives at Saudi Telecom didn't return phone calls seeking comment.

In a written response, Mr. Kleinfeld gave the same version of events as Mr. von Pierer. "At no time did Mr. Kutschenreuter mention to me, that any 'Hush-Money' was involved in any settlement and at no time did I have any knowledge of documents relating to bribes and still have no such knowledge," he added in his emailed statement.
Mr. Kutschenreuter, 52 years old, joined the company in 1974 and was posted to Algeria in the late
1970s. After six years abroad, including a stint in Iraq, he returned to Germany in 1984 and took up a
position in the sales department for telecom contracts in Africa and the Middle East.

Back at Munich headquarters, he told prosecutors, he learned of an encryption code he alleged was widely used at Siemens to itemize bribe payments. He said it was derived from the phrase "Make Profit," with the phase's 10 letters corresponding to the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0. Thus, a reference to "file this in the APP file" meant a bribe was authorized at 2.55% of sales.
A spokesman for  Siemens said it has no knowledge of a "Make Profit" encryption system.

In the mid-1990s Mr. Kutschenreuter worked in Erlangen helping organize financing for power projects. There, he alleged, he witnessed bribe payments for power projects in Russia and Slovakia.

After moving to  Siemens's information technology division in 1999, Mr. Kutschenreuter said, he learned of bribes paid to Argentine government officials as  Siemens competed for a contract to develop electronically scannable passports. He said the payments stopped after the Argentine government changed hands in late 2001, before the contract had been awarded.

Siemens says allegations of bribe payments in Russia, Slovakia and Argentina are false. A
spokesman at the Argentine Embassy in Berlin declined to comment.

Mr. Kutschenreuter said he was personally involved in lots of bribe payments after becoming finance chief at the land-line telecom unit in early 2001. Though paying bribes abroad was illegal in Germany starting in 1999, many of his colleagues still saw them merely "as peccadilloes because it was all for the good of the company," he told prosecutors.

Two other former  Siemens telecom executives have also described alleged bribes, in November statements to prosecutors reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Reinhard Siekaczek and Andreas Mattes, onetime colleagues of Mr. Kutschenreuter, also said the bribes were carried out with the knowledge of senior managers.

Prosecutors have presented the three witness statements as evidence in the arraignment hearing of Mr. Ganswindt, the former management-board member. Mr. Ganswindt, like Messrs. Kutschenreuter and Siekaczek, was detained by authorities late last year and then released. Mr. Mattes wasn't detained.

Mr. Siekaczek, who worked at  Siemens for four decades, said in his witness statement that he was asked to set up slush funds for bribes in 1999 or 2000. He described a bank account in Salzburg, Austria, through which he said more than 75 million  euros in bribe funds flowed each year. In 2001, he alleged, Mr. Kutschenreuter warned him to shift funds elsewhere because Swiss authorities were following the trail of Austrian accounts linked to bribes in Nigeria.

Mr. Siekaczek gave prosecutors a long list of other countries in which he alleged that bribes were paid to win business, including Egypt, Cameroon and Kazakhstan. A lawyer for Mr. Siekaczek, who left Siemens in 2004, declined to comment on specifics but said police have investigated his client's statements and found them reliable.

Mr. Mattes told prosecutors that a member of the telecom unit's management board told him in 2001 that bribes were commonly paid for securing big telecom projects. Mr. Mattes is now an executive at Hewlett-Packard Co. in the U.S., after leaving  Siemens in 2005. His lawyer said Mr. Mattes met with investigators in November and stands by his testimony. He said his client is suspected of playing only a minor role in the alleged activity.
Messrs. Kutschenreuter and Siekaczek alleged in their statements that Joe Kaeser, now CFO at
Siemens, was aware of bribes while overseeing the wireless telecom unit's finances from 2001 to
2004. Mr. Kutschenreuter also cast blame on two other former wireless executives: Rudi Lamprecht,
now a member of Siemens's management board, and Lothar Pauly, who left in 2005 to join the
management board of Deutsche Telekom AG.

Siemens said Messrs. Kaeser and Lamprecht weren't aware of any alleged bribes and did nothing wrong. A lawyer for Mr. Pauly said allegations of wrongdoing by his client are false.

Prosecutors say bribes became more elaborate after a tightening of money-laundering laws following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and also after investigators in Italy, Switzerland and Liechtenstein began circling.

Investigators say  Siemens lawyers filed briefs to keep prosecutors from accessing bank records in some countries. Cuno Tarfuser, a prosecutor in the Italian city of Bolzano, said in an interview that his investigation of Austrian accounts was held up for months in 2004 and 2005 by legal challenges.



Page 68 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Siemens says that at no point did it try to prevent prosecutors in Italy or Liechtenstein from examining company-linked accounts.  Siemens said it has been cooperating with authorities for years.

A German arrest warrant for Mr. Siekaczek issued last November, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, mapped out how prosecutors suspect bribes were carried out in Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam from 2002 to 2004. It said that generally, after money was routed through at least three layers of secret accounts and shell companies, it was entrusted to "bag men" who carried bundles of cash to local "fixers." The fixers then organized the payoffs on behalf of Siemens.
In one case, prosecutors said in the arrest warrant, Mr. Siekaczek signed a consulting contract in July
2002 with Austrian firm Krhoma GmbH related to a project with Saudi Telecom. According to the arrest
warrant,  Siemens paid 4 million euros to Krhoma, which took a 60,000  euro commission before
wiring the rest to a firm that was based in the British Virgin Islands and controlled by Mr. Siekaczek.
A lawyer for Krhoma said Krhoma wasn't involved in illegal activity.

Mr. Kutschenreuter told prosecutors that the chief executive of  Siemens in Greece, Michael Christoforakos, told him in October 2004 the company had made illegal payments for an infrastructure project related to the 2004 Athens Olympics. Mr. Kutschenreuter said he informed other senior managers, including Messrs. Ganswindt and Neuburger, of the conversation.

Mr. Siekaczek's arrest warrant cited 1.83 million  euros in suspicious transfers from  Siemens to third parties in 2004 and alleged they were related to an Athens security-systems contract.

A Siemens spokeswoman in Greece said Mr. Christoforakos "has never mentioned anything to anybody concerning improper payments" related to the Olympics. She said he has met as a voluntary witness with Greek prosecutors, who are conducting a preliminary probe of the awarding of a
security-systems contract. She said  Siemens was a subcontractor and "there is no evidence of any wrongdoing or improver behavior whatsoever."

Mr. Kutschenreuter had a busy Christmas in 2004. In addition to trying to settle the Saudi matter, he told prosecutors, he got a call from Mr. Siekaczek telling him that authorities in Liechtenstein were investigating certain bank accounts there. Again, Mr. Kutschenreuter alleged, senior management was informed.

Siemens later told Liechtenstein authorities that the accounts were its own, and asked prosecutors to end their investigation, according to Robert Wallner, the lead Liechtenstein prosecutor. The authorities continued to dig. At the same time, investigators in Switzerland, Italy and Austria were tracking separate leads on suspicious transactions flowing through other bank accounts tied to  Siemens or people acting on its behalf.

This past November, armed with the information, more than 200 German police raided about 30 offices and homes of current and former  Siemens employees. They searched offices of management-board members, including Mr. Kleinfeld, the CEO, and seized 36,000 documents. German prosecutors are sifting the material and questioning more people in a probe that could stretch for several more months or longer.

Mr. Kutschenreuter, who by the time of his arrest had moved on to  Siemens's real-estate division, told prosecutors last month that he would cooperate because Mr. Kleinfeld had said he wanted to get to the bottom of the matter. "I can help him with that," he said in his witness statement.

At the company's annual meeting in Munich last week, Mr. Kleinfeld said he was "shocked" when he heard the allegations of wrongdoing. "I can assure you that we are doing everything that we can to clear up these incidents completely," he said.

His predecessor, Mr. von Pierer, told the crowd of 10,000 restive shareholders that while serving as CEO for more than a decade, he had taken major steps to combat corruption. He added, "I am deeply distressed that these efforts were not successful enough."

(Adds comment, byline)

TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said on Friday its quarterly profit rose 30 percent on record factory automation sales, but it kept its full-year forecast below market expectations because of the possible impact of a  cartel fine.

TD
A company executive said it is also cautious about demand next year, citing sluggish orders from display and auto makers.

Mitsubishi Electric and its rivals  Siemens AG and Rockwell Automation Inc. have benefited from a spending spree by chip and construction makers on robots, lasers, sensors and other equipment used to run their plants.

But despite record quarterly profit and sales figures released on Friday, Katsuhiko Mori, a senior portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, said he had his eye on other buys.

"Mitsubishi Electric is the honours student in the class. Everyone knows it's doing well and it's a buy when times are uncertain," Mori said. "But now, a stock like  Hitachi  looks more attractive to institutional investors because every bit of positive news could make the stock shoot up."

Shares in struggling Hitachi  Ltd. fell 7.1 percent while the electronics sector <.IELEC.T> rose 9.1 percent in 2006, but Hitachi  has since climbed 9.4 percent after a report that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. may become a partner of General Electric Co. and  Hitachi  in nuclear power.

Mitsubishi posted a stronger-than-expected operating profit of 63.58 billion yen ($526 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31.
The news helped push its shares up 1.2 percent to 1,130 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei average
<.N225> closed up 0.16 percent.

Yukihiro Sato, Mitsubishi Electric's senior vice president, said the company could raise its forecast of 14 percent operating profit growth for the full year to March 31 but was monitoring the impact of a 118.6 million euro ($154 million) European Commission fine for fixing prices for electric power system
switch gear.
"We are considering fighting this  fine in court and are consulting auditors about how much of the  fine
we will need to pay," Sato told a news conference.

The company kept its operating profit forecast at 180 billion yen for the full year to March, missing a consensus estimate of 197.6 billion yen by 20 brokerages polled by Reuters Estimates.

Mitsubishi Electric, Japan's fifth-largest electronics conglomerate, was one of several companies slapped with fines totalling 750.7 million  euros by the EU  Commission.

It also faces a probe by the U.S. Justice Department into possible antitrust violations in its dynamic random-access memory business between 1998 and 2002.

For the year starting on April 1, Mitsubishi, which has finished restructuring its chip and overseas mobile phone businesses, is hoping to cash in on plant spending throughout Asia, Sato said.
But the company was typically cautious about its outlook for next business year.

"Overall orders are flattening out and are falling for displays," Sato said. "We are watching to see if orders have peaked or if this is a lull before orders pick up again."
Slowing orders bode ill for sales three to six months ahead.

Mitsubishi Electric's shares rose 9.1 percent in the October-December period, compared with a 4.1 percent rise in Tokyo's electrical machinery subindex <.IELEC.T>,

by Janet WoodThe UK could be the front-runner to host the likely legal battles for compensation after the European Commission last week found switchgear manufacturers guilty of  price-fixing.The Commission found that 11 switchgear manufacturers had acted as a  cartel between 1988 and 2004, and fined them a total of £750 million. It said they had "rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important information". Investi?gations began when  ABB tipped off the  Commission in exchange for immunity. Peter Willis, head of EU and competition at law firm Dundas & Wilson, said members of a  cartel now had to ask: "What's the chance someone else will blow the whistle?"A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggested customers were overcharged by 20-25 per cent by such cartels.

TD
Paul Brennan of Morgan Cole noted that claimants could include power plant owners charged for grid reinforcement as well as network companies. The Commission has encouraged affected companies to seek redress in national courts because European courts cannot hear claims for damages.Carolyn Waddell, a senior solicitor in the EU, competition and regulatory department at solicitors Maclay Murray and Spens, said the UK had introduced procedural changes that made action easier. If infringement has already been proven and the guilty parties cannot appeal, claims could be passed quickly through to a specialist tribunal of the Competition Appeal Tribunal. It was too early to take this route, however (except for whistleblower  ABB), because Siemens has already said it will appeal and others may follow suit. However, Waddell said the UK courts were also attractive because "they have wide discretion in forcing defendants to disclose evidence".At the moment claimants can only claim for civil damages, Waddell said, but a European Commission White Paper due shortly will propose a system of exemplary damages such as exists in the US. It is possible claims will be delayed until after this takes effect. "This is new ground," she said.Willis said that so far, exemplary damages had "not really been tested, but have been considered by the courts". He added: "It is safe to assume some will consider this course of action."

Switchgear fraud raises question over utility buyingThe  fine of £750 million (almost £500 million) imposed on Europe's suppliers of gas-insulated switchgear for operating a  cartel is the largest  fine for price-fixing ever levied by the European Commission. If the £215 million penalty on ABB had not been waived because it blew the whistle, the fine would have been almost one billion euros - a staggering sum for
such a specialised market.It is not as though these manufacturers were fleecing innocent consumers. Some of their biggest customers were  Europe's major utilities, and while the turnover of  Siemens (one of the guilty parties) is enormous at£53 billion, it hardly dwarfs Eon's £37 billion. The fact that these suppliers were able to dupe their customers for 16 years makes you wonder about the buying departments of major utilities.

TD
The price-fixing among the switchgear companies was calculated and well-organised, but it is hard to believe that effective competitive tendering could not have flushed out fraud on such a massive scale.If utilities had the wool pulled over their eyes for so long in this supposedly highly competitive sector, what might be happening elsewhere? The sums spent by utilities with, for example, the contractors who handle a high percentage of maintenance and capital projects are much greater than those spent on gas-filled switchgear. Contractors have long complained about the low margins they earn compared with equipment manufacturers, and perhaps this is a sign that competition among contractors is keener than it is among suppliers. Utility contractors and suppliers rightly argue that in the long term, trusting partnerships are
more efficient than constant competitive tendering, but not if this trust is abused by one part of the supply chain.Ofwat still ignoring the CATThe decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the case of Albion Water against Welsh Water and regulator Ofwat was as clear-cut as possible. On every count, the tribunal found Ofwat had been wrong in the way it handled Albion's bid for a fair access price to Welsh Water's network. The tribunal's decision is not binding in the way that an appeal court or Lords ruling is, and the case centred on an inset appointment rather than competition under the new water supply licensing regime.Nevertheless, the tribunal's message was clear: the regulator's approach to network access pricing is wrong, and it was widely expected that Ofwat would listen and act on the verdict. But instead of
changing its approach to make it easier for new entrants to compete effectively, the regulator has passed the buck back to the government, arguing that the failure of competition is due to the small size of the market and low profit margins.If Ofwat is unable to enforce the current competitive regime it will be interesting to see if the government accepts this failure and quietly drops competition in the water sector or tells Ofwat to change its ways. An alternative model for competition in water will be tested in Scotland, but not until April 2008 and that is far too long for customers in England and Wales to wait for the benefits that a competitive market was supposed to bring.Steve Hobson

HD      Siemens stock rides out scandal -- Rises 6 percent despite 'black money' charge

Munich, Germany - When Heinrich von Pierer stepped up to the microphone in front of 12,000 shareholders at Siemens AG's annual general meeting late last month, the atmosphere was almost as frosty as the mounds of snow outside the Munich Olympia Hall. Many market watchers expected the representatives of institutional and private investors in attendance would tear into von Pierer, the former chief executive officer of  Siemens who now serves as president of its supervisory board.

In the end, von Pierer drew lukewarm applause. But even that was a victory of sorts for a man attempting to explain the bribery scandal in which the German electronics giant has become enmeshed.

TD
Indeed, the financial community seems generally unimpressed by the allegations against  Siemens. While the company's stock price took a dive when reports of a corporate "black money" fund first surfaced, it later returned to an upward trend. On the day after the  European Commission imposed a roughly $500
million fine on Siemens for illegal price fixing  in the energy distribution business, the stock price climbed
6 percent. That was the same day, Jan. 25, that von Pierer asked shareholders not to prejudge the matter
until all the facts were on the table. He also assured shareholders that the company was fully cooperating
with law enforcement agencies.

Police and prosecutors allege that during the time von Pierer was CEO, the company set aside funds, mainly in the communications division, for use in bribing potential customers abroad in return for orders. The communications division has been one of the most prominent and visible branches of the conglomerate.

The system came to light in November, when police raided the  Siemens headquarters here as well as other company locations in Germany and Austria, confiscating many documents and arresting five suspects. Among them were two high-profile communications division executives-the former CFO and the former head of internal auditing and accounting.

Law enforcement officials maintain that those arrested were involved in a widespread, secret bribery system, with potential beneficiaries based in the Middle East, Nigeria, China and Russia. In Greece, prosecutors allege that  Siemens acquired large-scale infrastructure orders using black money. Some reports mentioned orders for telecommunications and lighting systems connected to the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

The German police had become watchful after receiving letters from authorities in Italy and Switzerland, where police investigating money laundering had found several suspect bank accounts. On seizing accounts in Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein, the German police found about $25 million.

But once they began sifting through the mountain of 36,000 ring binders and folders they had confiscated, investigators discovered that much more money was involved. According to the present state of the investigation,  Siemens fed some $520 million to $540 million into the system during the years when it was active. Apparently, the black-money fund was implemented sometime in the 1990s and was in effect at least through 2004. Von Pierer's successor, Klaus Kleinfeld, was appointed CEO in January 2005.

Since Siemens is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probable. At the end of November, Kleinfeld hired an outside ombudsman to track down any cases of corruption brought to his knowledge by  Siemens' employees. Kleinfeld also hired an external auditor to conduct a comprehensive investigation.

The measures did not stop the police from arresting more suspects. In December, they nabbed former central-management board member Thomas Ganswindt. And in January, former CFO Heinz-Joachim Neuburger became a "suspect." The latest wave of allegations for the first time has implicated an acting board member: CFO Joe Kaeser.

Siemens, facing potential damage to its plans for the communications division to launch a joint venture with Nokia Oy, has denied the accusations. However, the Finnish company has postponed the launch of the joint venture until the case is settled.

HD     CARTELS : DANONE LOSES CARTEL APPEAL WC    697 words
PD     9 February 2007
SN     Europolitics SC     EURREP LA     English

LP
On 8 February, the EU Court of Justice rejected in its entirety an appeal by Groupe Danone against a  fine imposed for its participation in the Belgian beer  cartel. The Court ruled (Case C-3/06) that previous offences could increase cartel fines and upheld a 2005 Court of First Instance decision, which rejected Danone's appeal but reduced the fine slightly from €44.043 million to €42.4125 million.

The case concerned a December 2001  Commission decision fining Danone for its part in a  cartel lasting from 1993 to 1998 on the Belgian beer market. The other companies involved were Interbrew, Haacht, Martens and Alken-Maes, a subsidiary of Danone (see  Europolitics 3192).

TD
The Commission welcomed the decision as confirming definitively for the first time that repeat  cartel offenders can be fined more severely. Commenting on the Court's ruling that previous infringements could be taken into account no matter how long in the past (Danone's were 17 and 27 years prior to the
Commission decision in 2001), spokesperson Jonathan Todd said, "Any company that has been involved in a cartel at any time should have in place a strict compliance programme. So if you have broken the rules, there is no statute [of limitations[". The percentage increase in the  fine for repeat offenders was in this case set at a maximum of 50% by the 1998 Commission guidelines then in force. These were updated in June 2006 to impose even heavier fines on recidivists and will apply to cases where a statement of objections was sent after September 2006. By the new rules, an increase of up to 100% of
the fine will be possible for each prior infringement and previous decisions of national competition authorities (not only those of the  Commission) can also be taken into account.
The arguments

The arguments in Court referred to Regulation 17 (the law in place when the  fine was imposed in 2001), but the ruling equally applies to the current Regulation 1/2003. Groupe Danone argued that there was no express power in Regulation 17 to increase a  fine due to repeat infringements, that this was only found in the Commission guidelines and therefore it had no basis in law. Regulation 17 (and Regulation 1/2003) only talk about the "duration and gravity of the infringement."

The Court, however, rejected this argument, pointing to previous case law establishing that although the guidelines "do not constitute the legal basis of fining decisions adopted by the Commission, (they)
ensure legal certainty since they determine the method which the Commission has bound itself to use for the purposes of setting  fines". Furthermore, the  Commission has a wide discretion when determining the gravity' of the infringement and can take into account aggravating circumstances, one of which is repeated infringement. "Consequently, the  Commission was entitled to consider the element associated with repeated infringement to relate to the gravity of the infringement committed by Danone."
An aside

Although not an issue in the appeal, one aspect of this case has, interestingly, some similarities to the situation of Areva in the  cartel recently exposed in the gas insulated switchgear cartel (see Europolitics
3233). Areva was  fined €53.5 million jointly with Alstom  for participation in that cartel but its involvement was only through its acquisition, four months before the cartel was exposed, of the company TND SA, formerly owned by Alstom.  Areva claims it had no involvement in or knowledge of the cartel activity. In
the Danone case, there were in fact two cartels. Danone was clearly involved in the first - market-sharing and price-fixing for sales to hotels, restaurants and retail - but only its subsidiary, Alken-Maes, was involved in the second - sale of private-label beer. Danone was  fined for the first  cartel, leading to the current appeal, but not  fined for the second because, in the words of the ECJ in the 8 February 2007
Page 77 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
judgement, "the  Commission considered that there was no reason to attribute responsibility to [Groupe Danone] for the participation of its subsidiary in the concerted practice relating to private-label beer, since [it] was not itself involved in that  cartel."

TD
The companies can appeal the UOHS verdict now.

The UOHS and the  European Commission concluded that the companies coordinated their price bids in tenders for regulatory equipment for energy utilities in order for all of them to win some of the contracts.
The agreement was applied all over the world since 1988.
The EC fined the companies involved EUR750m (Kc21.06bn).
Some of the affected companies have already appealed against that  fine.
The Czech UOHS dealt only with the years 2001-2004. The orders in question were worth Kc700m. Four firms from the  Siemens group were fined Kc305m of the total  fine of Kc979m.
The other  fined companies are Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji Electric,  Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric,  Toshiba, and Nuova Magrini.

Swiss company ABB which was also involved in the  cartel has not been fined because it informed the commission about the  cartel.

PRAGUE (CIA) - The Antimonopoly Office of the Czech Republic UOHS imposed the highest  fine in its history on February 9. The  fine of CZK 979 mln applies to the largest producers of the gas insulated switchgear (PISU). "They had closed a  cartel agreement, which has no comparison in terms of the sophistication, extension, length in the history of UOHS," UOHS Deputy Chairman Kamil Rudolecky said.
According to UOHS, the companies closed so-called bid rigging, when participants agree on PISU
prices, so contracts are granted to a company agreed in advance. "This completely violated the business
competition on the market in the Czech Republic with an intention to keep market shares and a price
level for PISU in the years 1991 - 2004," UOHS said.

TD
The fine will likely be paid by ten foreign producers of PISU -  Alstom  (CZK 85.6 mln), Areva (CZK 156.5 mln), Fuji (CZK 88.8 mln),  Hitachi  (CZK 109.2 mln), Japan AE Power Systems (CZK 44.4 mln), Mitsubishi Electric (CZK 75.3 mln),  Toshiba (CZK 70.8 mln),  Siemens (CZK 259.8 mln), VA Tech (CZK
44.4 mln), and Nuova Magrini Galileo (CZK 44.4 mln).

UOHS started the administrative proceedings in August 2006 due to a previous complaint by  ABB, who confessed its participation in the cartel and submitted evidence. The company then received full immunity from  fines under the European Commissionĺs leniency programme. UOHS  fined actions of the above-mentioned firms only for the July 2001 - March 2004 period.

The above-mentioned  cartel was solved also by the European Commission, which fined 10 producers of PISU EUR 750.7 mln in January. The Hungarian Antimonopoly Office fined four companies HUF 702 mln (CZK 78 mln).

The alleged cartel members have 15 days in which to appeal against the UOHS ruling, the office said. The regulator said the  cartel companies between 2001 and 2004 sold about CZK700 million-worth of
gas-insulated switching gears on the Czech market and used illegal practices, including price
agreements, to secure individual contracts from regional power companies, the UOHS said.

"The cartel members used emails that were encrypted and cellular text messages to communicate among each other," the UOHS said.

PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The Czech Republic's regulator fined 10 companies a total of 979,221 million koruna (US$45.09 million; €34.67 million) for running a cartel to fix prices for heavy equipment used by power utilities, the regulator said Monday.
The fine is the biggest ever  fine imposed by the Czech regulator.

The anti-monopoly office said in a statement that the companies, including  Siemens AG, France's Alstom, or Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp., rigged bids for contracts to supply power plants, fixed prices and shared projects between themselves.

Last month, the European Commission fined the companies a combined €750 million (US$975.52 million) for running the cartel over the past 16 years.

The companies all handled gas-insulated switchgear, heavy electrical equipment used to control energy flows in electricity grids.

The Czech anti-monopoly office said it  fined the firms for running the  cartel between July 2001 and March 2004, a period when they placed contracts worth 700 million koruna (US$32.2 million; €24.8 million) on the Czech market.

(Adds Siemens comment, another  Siemens subsdiary, paras 11-13)

PRAGUE, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The Czech competition regulator UOHS said on Monday it had  fined 16 firms including Siemens , Alstom  and Toshiba a total of 979.2 million crowns ($44.88 million) for a cartel agreement.

TD
It said the firms had colluded in supplies of gas insulated switchgear, which is needed at sub-stations used to carry electricity to homes, offices and factories. The firms involved may appeal against the  fines.

"They created a  cartel agreement unprecedented in the experience of the UOHS for its sophistication, extent and duration," the regulator said.

The European Commission has already fined 11 producer groups for the same thing. The European Commission fine, levied last month, was 750.7 million  euros. Hungarian authorities have also fined four of the firms.

"The issue is so-called bid rigging, in which participants agreed among themselves on who will offer what price of gas insulated switchgear so the contract is awarded to the company agreed in advance," the UOHS said.
It said the  cartel had been agreed in 1998 in Vienna.  ABB of Switzerland blew the whistle on the  cartel
Europe-wide, and was also behind the Czech probe. It was not  fined by the EU nor by the Czechs.

The regulator said the overall volume of business under the probe in the Czech Republic in 2001-2004 was some 700 million crowns ($32 million).

The UOHS said it only investigated the July 2001-March 2004 period because it did not have the authority to investigate the firms' behaviour at other times. It gave no details, but the Czech Republic joined the European Union in May 2004.

Siemens AG got the biggest Czech  fine, of 126.6 million crowns.

Three of its other units --  Siemens Aktiengesellschaft Oesterreich,  Siemens Transmission and Distribution Limited, and VA Tech -- were also  fined, an additional 88.8 million, 44.4 million, and 44.4 million crowns respectively.

Siemens said it would appeal the decision.
"Siemens considers the fine imposed to be unreasonably high," it said. Mitsubishi Electric Corp was
fined 75.3 million crowns, and  Toshiba Corporation got a 70.8 million  fine.

PRAGUE (Dow Jones)--The Czech antitrust regulator, or UOHS, Monday said it has  fined 16 multinational companies, led by  Alstom  SA (1022047.FR) and Siemens AG (SI), a total of 979 million koruna ($44.8 million) for participating in an alleged price-rigging cartel for gas-insulated switching equipment.

Fines were also levied against Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503.TO),  Toshiba Corp. (6502.TO),  Hitachi Ltd. (HIT),  Fuji Electric Holdings Co. (6504.TO), VA Tech Transmission & Distribution GmbH, and Nuova Magrini Galileo SpA.

TD
It is the highest  fine the Czech regulator has ever handed down and comes after the  European          Commission in January levied a EUR751 million  fine against the same group of companies.
The alleged cartel members have 15 days in which to appeal against the UOHS ruling, the office said. The regulator said the  cartel companies between 2001 and 2004 sold about CZK700 million-worth of
gas-insulated switching gears on the Czech market and used illegal practices, including price
agreements, to secure individual contracts from regional power companies, the UOHS said.

"The cartel members used emails that were encrypted and cellular text messages to communicate among each other," the UOHS said.
Gas-insulated switching gears are used to control power flows in electricity distribution networks. UOHS Web site:  http://www.compet.cz

The Anti-Monopoly Bureau levied the largest  fine in its history on 9 February. It imposed a  cartel fine of CZK 979 mln on nine manufacturers of special electrical switchboard switches (PISU). Firms such as Siemens, Alstom,  Hitachi, and Toshiba agreed on tender bids over a 16-year period. According to the bureau, the highest sum, roughly CZK 304 mln, could be paid by four firms from the  Siemens group The European Commission also levied a fine on the firms for their EU  cartel this year.

BRUSSELS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The European Commission has raided ABB plants in Germany and Siemens plants in Austria and Germany on suspicion of price-fixing for transformers, the EU executive and companies said on Tuesday.

TD
"I can confirm that we undertook unannounced inspections on the 7th and 8th of February at premises of several power transformer producers in France, Germany and Austria,"  Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said.
He did not identify any of the raided firms, and it was not yet clear which companies were involved in
France.

German engineering group  Siemens said its Power Transmission and Distribution division had been raided. Its unit VA Tech EBG Transformatoren was also raided in Austria.

Siemens said it had suspended three staff suspected of conspiring to fix prices for transformers, key components in electricity transmission and distribution networks.

Only last month the  Commission fined Siemens nearly 400 million euros ($520 million) for fixing prices on electric power switchgear, the EU executive's second-highest penalty ever levied on a firm for price fixing.

Siemens could be fined heavily if found guilty. Under new EU guidelines adopted in July 2006, any  fine
against it would be doubled because of the company's previous offence.

The EU's highest court last week affirmed the power of the  Commission to increase fines for past offences.
In Zurich, Swiss heavy-engineering group  ABB said one of its German plants had been searched. "We are confirming that there are investigations ongoing in our Bad Honnef, Germany, transformer
factory," an  ABB spokesman said.

The Commission's Todd said: "The  Commission has reason to believe the companies may have violated article 81 of the EC treaty, which prohibits practices such as  price fixing."  (Additional reporting by Oliver Hirt in Zurich and Michael Shields in Frankfurt)

Siemens, the German technologies group, is reported to be facing a  fine of 12.4m euros in the Czech Republic for alleged involvement in a  cartel. The EU Commission has already imposed a fine of 420m euros in connection with the same case. The Czech fine is being imposed separately owing to the fact that investigations began before the country's accession to the EU.

Altogether, Prague is demanding 34.7m  euros from the companies involved, said also to have included the French companies  Alstom  and Areva and Japanese companies Fuji, Mitsubishi and  Toshiba. Siemens has announced that it plans legal action, as it regards the fine as excessive.

SUMMARY

The reform of Hungarian commercial law, including laws regulating contracts, is practically complete. The Hungarian judicial system operates under clearly specified guidelines. Even so, some reforms are still needed to harmonise Hungarian law with EU standards; the transparency of the legal system is inadequate; and delays in processing court cases are a major problem. As a result, contract disputes are
unlikely to be dealt with speedily. Regulatory disputes have arisen over the government's use of price caps in certain sectors. The Socialists, who came to power in 2002 and were re-elected in 2006, have been slow to address the wrongs of past administrations. More worryingly, the Socialist-led government has whittled away the powers of some nominally independent regulatory bodies in an effort to replace officials with individuals more loyal to the sitting government.
SCENARIOS
Judicial reform is delayed, keeping the courts overburdened and slow (Moderate Risk)

The court system is overburdened and scarce budgetary resources are making it difficult for remaining judicial reforms that would help streamline procedures to be implemented. Low pay for judges is now less
of a problem than in the past, following large salary increases, but staff numbers remain insufficient to keep up with increasing caseloads. Depending on the issue and the court, firms can still wait more than a year
for a final ruling on a contract dispute. After a long delay, the government has established five Courts of Appeal at the national level, which should help to alleviate the substantial backlog of cases at the Supreme Court. But the  European Commission has noted that a lack of adequate funding is still hampering the establishment of additional regional courts, which would streamline processes further. Businesses will want to pursue accelerated procedures that are sometimes available, such as for obtaining temporary injunctions for intellectual property violations. Businesses may also want to include in their contracts that disputes be settled by binding arbitration. An arbitration court works alongside the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The government fails to streamline regulations that are hindering competitiveness (Moderate Risk) The administrative procedures involved in setting up and running businesses have been streamlined,
although the introduction of stricter environmental regulations to meet EU requirements will impose
substantial costs. The World Bank has singled out as weaknesses a long business registration process,
high registration and legal costs, underdeveloped credit information systems and a weak insolvency
regime. Despite the simple rules for business start-ups, the process of setting up a business in Hungary is
relatively costly and takes longer than in most other countries in the region. Registering property is also
much more expensive than elsewhere. With other countries in the region quickly improving their business
environments there is a risk that Hungary could see its share of foreign direct investment (FDI) decline.
That said, inflows of FDI into Hungary were strong in 2004-06, and the World Bank survey notes that

Hungary's strict investment data regulations offer investors more protection than anywhere else in the region. Businesses should stress the need for further streamlining of business regulations.
BACKGROUND
(Updated: September 8th, 2006) Enforceability of Contracts
Contract disputes may be taken to court, but the system is overburdened, and average resolution time is
15.5 weeks, according to a survey in 2005 by the World Bank; this is higher than the average of 11.6 weeks
in Europe and Central Asia. Confidence in the courts is also below the regional average. Contracts may
provide for settling disputes through binding arbitration.
Independence of the Judiciary

The Hungarian judicial system is adequate, apart from delays in processing court cases, and it operates under clearly specified guidelines. Contract disputes may be taken to court, but the system is overburdened, and average resolution time is 15.5 weeks, according to a survey in 2005 by the World
Bank; this is higher than the average of 11.6 weeks in  Europe and Central Asia. Confidence in the courts is also below the regional average. Contracts may provide for settling disputes through binding arbitration.

The efficiency, reliability and integrity of public-sector employees vary, and corruption is not unknown. Personal connections can considerably accelerate and improve the chances of success in bureaucratic and many other processes. Some Western embassies, including that of the United States, have complained
that corruption has worsened in the past four years, and they warn that investment may be lost as a result. However, a study by the World Bank and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development released in July 2006 shows improvement since 2002, as part of a general trend in the region since EU accession.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

Hungary welcomes foreign direct investment (FDI) and implements policies to encourage it. FDI inflows have recovered following a decline in 2003, which reflected both declining international investment flows to the region and a perceived loss of Hungarian competitiveness due to significant wage hikes in 2002.

The business community and the general public generally welcome foreign investment. Local businesses see foreign participation as a way to access more-developed technology, export markets and critical working capital. Although majority foreign ownership and decision-making is commonly accepted in the Hungarian business community, some conservative political forces, including the Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union, the largest opposition party, have criticised foreign investors, particularly ahead of elections.

A record level of investment arrived in 2005, thanks in part to large-scale privatisation revenues from the sale of the operating rights for Budapest Airport. Total FDI inflow to Hungary, including reinvested earnings and intercompany loans, reached €5.36bn in 2005, up from €3.36bn in 2004, as reported by the National Bank of Hungary (Magyar Nemzeti Bank—MNB). Cumulative FDI stood at €56.5bn at end-2005, or about
€5,605 per capita, leaving Hungary in the leading position in Central and Eastern  Europe for cumulative FDI per capita, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport. The ministry expects FDI inflows to Hungary to exceed €4bn in 2006, buoyed by the sale of the natural-gas trading and storage businesses of the national oil and gas company (Magyar Olaj- es Gazipari Vallalat—MOL) to E.ON of Germany, which took place in the first quarter for about €900m.

The general rate of return on foreign investments in 2004 was 10.1% (against the total amount of investments in 2004), according to the MNB, which has not yet released corresponding data from 2005. However, because of the large share of the Budapest Airport transaction in total FDI, new investments made up 64% of total FDI inflows, with reinvested earnings accounting for 31% and intercompany loans for just 5%. Non-debt-generating FDI inflow (including portfolio equity investments but without intercompany loans) amounted to €3.6bn in 2005, which covered 64% of Hungary’s net external financing needs, according to MNB data.

The largest foreign investors in terms of cumulative FDI at the end of 2004 (figures for 2005 will be published in September 2006) were Germany (29%), the Netherlands (18%), Austria (11%), France (5%) and the United States (4%), according to the MNB. However, these figures are somewhat distorted by the fact that much investment from companies headquartered in the US comes in through  European subsidiaries, particularly in the Netherlands and Germany. By end-2004, 17% of FDI had gone into real property and other business activities, 11% into the automotive industry, 10% each into financial services and trade, and 9% into the high-tech manufacturing of electrical and optical equipment.

Foreign investors participated in 625 privatisation deals between 1990 and 2005; these had a combined value of Ft1.29trn, according to the Hungarian Privatisation and State Holding Company (Allami Privatizacios es Vagyonkezelo—APV), the privatisation agency. The largest foreign investors in Hungary’s privatisations were Germany (125 deals valued at 23% of the total), the United States (51 deals, 13%), France (54 deals, 8%), Austria (151 deals, 5%), Belgium (15 deals, 4%) and the Netherlands (23 deals,
3%).

There are no general local-content requirements. However, the state-owned Hungarian Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) extends subsidised credit only for the export of Hungarian-made goods. The bank considers a product to be of Hungarian origin if it was fully produced in Hungary or if its value increased by at least 50% through further processing or assembly in Hungary. The Hungarian origin of the product must be proved with a certification issued by the regional chambers of commerce.

Under the requirements of the National Radio and Television Board (Orszagos Radio es Televizio Testulet—ORTT), at least 50% of all television programming must be  European in origin, and the minimum share of Hungarian-made programming is 7%. Certain exemptions apply to pay-TV channels, based on an ORTT decision (627/2004).
Unfair Competitive Practices

Authorities generally promote competition, but a handful of sectors remain influenced by large state-owned or formerly state-owned enterprises that are sometimes monopolies. Because the Hungarian market is relatively small (the population is about 10m), producers tend to establish dominant market positions rapidly, becoming monopolists or duopolists from economies of scale.
Competition policy is governed by Act LVII of 1996 on the Prohibition of Unfair and Restrictive Market
Practices. This law, known as the Competition Act, includes provisions against unfair competition,
consumer deception, collusive and trust practices, and abuse of market dominance. The law also regulates
mergers and acquisitions; it provides for their supervision by the Office of Economic Competition
(Gazdasagi Versenyhivatal—GVH), which reports directly to parliament. Modelled on Germany’s Federal
Cartel Office, the GVH is the chief regulatory body for competition policy in all sectors.
The Competition Act introduced several changes to align Hungarian policy with that of the  European
Union. Its most significant aspects include the following:

The court system, not the GVH, handles decisions on violations of competition law that primarily affect only the parties concerned (cases of unfair competition). The GVH (through its Competition Council) judges cases where larger interests of competition policy or social welfare are at stake. In these cases, the Competition Council, a quasi-judicial body within the GVH, takes decisions and can impose  fines.

A general anti-cartel provision covers vertical and horizontal cartels. The government has issued block exemptions from antitrust provisions in the following areas: Government Decree (GD) 55/2002 for vertical agreements (replacing GD 246/1997 on the block exemption of franchise agreements); GD 54/2002 for research and development agreements; GD 53/2002 for specialisation agreements; GD 86/1999 for technology transfer agreements; GD 19/2004 for motor-vehicle distribution and servicing agreements; and GD 18/2004 for insurance agreements.

Permission to merge companies must be sought when total combined net revenues of the companies to be merged exceeded Ft15bn in the preceding year and when the net sales revenues of the undertakings acquired or merging exceed Ft500m.

In assessing whether an agreement between companies restricts competition, the companies’ total joint market share must be considered. If their market share is below 10%, the agreement is considered insignificant.
The Competition Act also underwent a significant revision with Act LXVIII of 2005, which came into effect
on November 1st 2005. The changes reflected a shift in overall state administration policies and the GVH’s
experiences since EU accession. Among other matters, the include the following:

The threshold for permission for mergers increased from combined turnover of Ft10bn to Ft15bn, to reduce the administrative burden on the GVH and correct somewhat for inflation since the Competition Act was passed in 1996.

The maximum level of  fines is now 10% of a company group’s net revenues in the previous business year, compared to the previous maximum of 10% of the individual company’s net revenues.
The GVH may now conduct raids on suspected companies to prevent concealment of evidence of  cartel
behaviour.

Page 105 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The role of the courts in competition procedures was strengthened, making it easier for individuals and companies to sue for damages if anti-competitive behaviour has damaged their interests. The role of the Competition Council in imposing  fines for such behaviour remains unchanged.

The act introduced the concept of a “group of undertakings”, which recognises that within a single ownership group, companies will act in a co-ordinated manner, which does not violate anti-cartel provisions.

Companies or individuals need no longer initiate competition procedures by filing the GVH’s standardised form. Rather, a simple complaint, with no formal requirements, may result in an investigation into potentially anti-competitive behaviour.

Harmonisation with EU law terminated the GVH’s authority to allow individual exemptions from the requirements of competition law.

The act more precisely defined procedures for sector investigations, which the GVH has increasingly relied on in recent years, and the act allows information received from parliament, parliamentary committees or ministries to prompt such investigations.

Another important legal change in 1995, made at the GVH’s instigation but not affecting competition law per se, was a change to the Criminal Code (Act IV of 1978) to allow the imprisonment of company directors
who engage in cartel activity in the context of public procurement or public concession procedures.

Since Hungary’s accession to the EU on May 1st 2004, the Union’s competition rules apply to certain mergers affecting the EU market under  European Council Directive 139/2004/EC. Restrictive agreements and the abuse of market dominance affecting trade between Hungary and other EU members also are examined according to EU regulations, which are detailed in Articles 81 and 82 of the EU’s establishing treaty and Directive 1/2003/EC.
Price controls are provided for by the Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990).

The Consumer Protection Act (CLV of 1997) affects competition policy with its requirements for product safety and consumer information. Government Decree 89/1998 established the scope of authority and procedures for the Central Consumer Protection Supervisor (Fogyasztovedelmi Fofelugyeloseg—FVF), which implements the law. If an entity achieves unfair market advantages by breaching provisions of the act, competitors whose market positions are jeopardised may assert a claim under the provisions of the Competition Act, in addition to action before the FVF, and now potentially before the court system as well.

Under the Consumer Protection Act, customers may file consumer protection complaints with domestic and foreign non-governmental organisations accredited with the  European Commission. Consumers may demand financial compensation for losses caused by the inadequate quality or safety of products, if the value of the loss exceeds €500.

The Commercial Advertising Act (LVIII of 1997) forbids advertising that qualifies as unfair competition or consumer deception. The courts or the GVH decide whether an advertisement is anti-competitive or deceptive.

Monopolies and market dominance are not prohibited per se. Rather, the Competition Act bans abuse of a dominant position that restricts competition. A dominant position occurs when goods reasonably
substituting those of a company cannot be acquired, or can be acquired only under conditions substantially less favourable; when a company’s goods cannot be sold to another party, or can be sold only to a party under substantially less favourable conditions; or when a company can pursue its economic activities in a manner substantially independent of other participants in the market or without having to consider the attitudes of its competitors, suppliers, customers or other business partners.

The act includes the following non-exclusive list of agreements or concerned practices that might be considered impermissible if they have, as their object or effect, the prevention, restriction or distortion of economic competition:

price-fixing or defining other business conditions;

restricting or controlling manufacturing, distribution, technical development or investment in a product or industry;

dividing purchasing sources, restricting freedom of choice in purchasing or excluding others from the purchase of goods;
dividing a market, excluding others from selling, restricting sales choices;

Page 106 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
colluding between competitors in a bidding;
preventing others from entering a market;
discriminating against business partners through sales or purchase price or conditions; “tying” contracts—that is, requiring specified purchases besides the original contract item.
Nevertheless, agreements between companies to engage in the practices listed above are not forbidden if the combined market share of the parties to the agreement does not exceed 10% or if the companies are part of the same company group.

The new Trade Act (CLXIV of 2005) also defines the concept of significant market power in the context of wholesale/retail businesses and their suppliers, and prohibits the abuse of such power. If the company, or any group of undertakings or purchasing alliance to which it belongs, has annual revenues of Ft100bn, it is considered to have significant market power. Such power also exists if the company has a dominant bargaining position under market conditions. Among other measures, abuse of market power includes the following: discrimination against a supplier; unreasonable restriction of a supplier’s access to sales opportunities; setting unfair risk burdens on suppliers (such as restocking or advertising charges); unreasonable modifications to contracts; and unreasonable requirements (such as a most-favourable-terms clause or requiring a supplier to manufacture under the retailer’s house brand as a condition for access). Any contract that violates the terms of the law may be voided, and the GVH may launch proceedings and levy fines for the abuse.

The total amount of  fines the Office of Economic Competition (Gazdasagi Versenyhivatal—GVH) imposed fell to Ft3.4bn in 2005 from Ft8.9bn in 2004. The reason for the decline was a massive Ft7bn  fine imposed in 2004 on five domestic construction companies for colluding in a Ft160bn public-procurement tender for motorway construction. However,  fines will probably increase in 2006 because of the higher upper limit the GVH can assess as a  fine (1% of group net revenues in the previous year, in the event of serious infraction). The structure of  fines shifted in the first quarter of 2006, in that most cases involved consumer deception rather than antitrust issues. The largest  fine in the first seven months of 2006 was a Ft1.5bn total penalty in June 2006 on three information-technology companies (IBM Hungary, SAP Hungary and local
firm ISH). The GVH said the firms illegally co-ordinated their bids in five public-procurement tenders in
2004. In addition, there was a Ft1bn  fine in July 2006 on MAV (the state railway) for abuse of its dominant
market position in the rail-freight business. Colgate Palmolive (a US consumer-goods manufacturer) faced
a Ft257m fine for misleading consumers in an advertisement, and Tesco (a British retailer) faced a fine of
Ft100m for the same offence, which the GVH said was exacerbated by the fact that Tesco had been fined
eight times previously for similar offences. At the end of 2005, a total fine of Ft702m was imposed on a
cartel for gas-insulated electrical switchgear involving  Alstom  (France), Siemens (Germany), VA-Tech
(Austria) and Areva (UK).
Businesses leaving previously unknown cartels and co-operating with the authority in such  cartel cases
(that is, “whistle blowers”) are eligible for a total or partial abolition of  fines. In accordance with GVH’s
non-binding Leniency Notice 3/2003, companies can file for leniency either outright or anonymously. Either
way, companies filing for leniency have to describe the  cartel they have been part of and give evidences of
its existence. The GVH usually reviews the evidence in 20 days and issues a conditional note on the
abolition of  fines. Full exemption is available for the first members exiting the  cartel, other members exiting
later are eligible for only partial exemption, up to 50% of  fines.

Hungary’s electricity and gas markets are partially open, with all but household consumers allowed freely to choose their supplier. These consumers may also decide to remain on Hungary’s regulated power and gas markets. In both power and gas, overall market liberalisation (measured as the percentage of consumption taking place outside the regulated market) is in the 20–30% range. Therefore, the regulated wholesale businesses of the dominant market incumbents—MVM (state owned) for electricity and E.ON Ruhrgas (Germany) for gas—control some 70–80% of their respective markets. The  European Union requires full market liberalisation as from July 1st 2007, and preparations to open the markets fully are underway. However, there are fears that, especially in electricity, the government will accept a market model proposed by MVM, which would seek to maintain the status quo as much as possible. The GVH is strongly opposed
to this, and is pursuing a stiff anti-cartel investigation into the company in co-operation with the  European Commission. Indeed, MVM was the only subject so far of a company raid (as allowed by the 2005 changes to the Competition Act), which included competition experts from the  European Commission. They cited numerous suspected abuses at the company.

Hungary liberalised its telecommunications market in 2001. Magyar Telekom (formerly known as Matav and now a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom), the dominant fixed-line provider, was forced to unbundle its networks and provide local-loop access to smaller market players. Fixed-line telephone rates and dial-up access charges to the Internet remain regulated, and this applies to the rates charged for calls from

Page 107 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
fixed-line networks to mobile networks. Law C of 2003 on Electronic Communications, which took force on January 1st 2004, governs the telecoms sector and obliged Magyar Telekom and other fixed-line providers to reduce their interconnection fees. The 2004 law introduced number portability for fixed-line and mobile phones, reduced call-termination charges from fixed-line to mobile networks and reformed the financing of universal-access telecom services.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents, trademarks, industrial designs and models, and copyrights are legally recognised in Hungary. Legislation on intellectual-property (IP) rights is comparable to that in Western  European countries, but foreign producers still cite local piracy of software, music and branded apparel as problem areas for enforcement. Nevertheless, much has been done to improve respect for IP rights, as required by the EU, OECD and World Trade Organisation.

Patents are protected for 20 years from the date of filing the patent application; an annual fee is required to maintain the patent. The Act on the Protection of Inventions by Patents (XXXIII of 1995) conforms to EU legislation, and includes provisions for the compulsory licensing of patents. Under compulsory licensing, a patent holder may be forced to license a patent for use if:

the patent holder has not introduced the patented item for availability on the Hungarian market within four years of the date of filing the application for registration; or

the item is required for the business activities of a user who is entitled to use other patented items that cannot be used without the item in question. The patent holder may then attach conditions to the use of the patent, restricting it to the purpose for which the licence is granted.
A patent holder or licenser that suspects patent infringement may file a lawsuit at the Budapest
Metropolitan Court (Fovarosi Birosag) and may request an injunction to halt the alleged abuse, an award of
compensation and damages, or confiscation of the goods produced under the infringing activity. Cases may
be appealed to the Supreme Court (Legfelsobb Birosag). Disputes may be settled by direct ruling or trial. A
registered licensee can itself sue an infringer, but only if the licensee requested the proprietor of the right
(the licenser) to take actions against the infringement and the proprietor failed to take any action within 30
days. It should be noted that there can be delays in Hungary’s court system in pursuing legal remedy, and
even injunctions against infringing activity can be difficult to obtain. Holders of copyrights and trademarks
suffer frequent infringement, and industry groups have been set up to lobby the government and assist
authorities.
Government Decree 371/2004 allows customs guards to halt export, re-export or import of goods infringing
IP rights, and if infringement is established, to destroy them.

Act CLXV of 2005 implemented tougher court protection in IP matters, including stronger provisions on injunctions, procedures to obtain court orders for the cessation of infringing activities, and collection of damages. The act modified most of the key laws in the field of IP law, as well as laws on court procedures. A significant change under the new system is that the requirements for injunctions to stop IP infringement are now listed in the laws covering the specific type of property (such as in the Patent Act, the Copyright Act and the Act on Trademarks and Geographical Indications). Provisions are very similar for each type of protection. The general rule is that the applicant must show that the object in question is under protection, and that he is the owner or rightful user; the court must then view the property as worthy of protection unless there is evidence indicating a probability that there is no infringement. The request for injunction may be made regardless of whether a lawsuit has been filed against the alleged infringer. No injunction is available if the infringement has continued for more than six months. If there is cause to believe that any damages awarded will not be paid, the court may authorise measures to freeze the infringer’s assets, including bank assets. A decision on the request for injunction must be made within 15 days.

These provisions are a significant strengthening of protection. Previously, the applicant was required to show that without the injunction, imminent and direct damages could not be avoided, and the injunction could be requested only if a lawsuit had already been filed.

Patents are protected under the Patent Act (XXXIII of 1995), which fully integrated the Hungarian patent system into the European Patent Convention (EPC), which took force on January 1st 2003. Inventors can now apply for European patents at the Hungarian Patent Office (HPO) in Hungarian.

Although the number of patents registered rose steadily in 1990–2002, it has been decreasing since 2003, when fewer foreign firms registered their patents directly with the HPO in Hungary after the office joined EPC. The HPO registered 1,275 patents in 2005, including national applications and direct filings with the HPO from abroad, down from 2,657 in 2004. The HPO attributes the low level of activity to general Hungarian weakness in innovation and research and development, and also to a low level of awareness of intellectual-property issues. The number of Hungarian applications for international patents was extremely
Page 108 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
low in 2005, at just 143, but this was up by 15% from 2004. The leading source of patent applications remained the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, but other branches of engineering were also relatively active.

The HPO introduced a three-year programme in early 2004 to support local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through new patent-information services and trademark monitoring. The programme, dubbed Vivace, also provides educational courses to SMEs on protecting intellectual properties. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport, aiming to increase the competitiveness of innovative firms, announced a tender in late 2003 to cover up to 90% of registration, maintenance and renewal costs of Hungarian patents and other industrial rights (industrial designs, utility models and plant varieties) abroad. The ministry has extended the programme, and applications are being accepted until November 1st 2006. Applications should be sent to the HPO. SMEs may also deduct the costs of obtaining protection for patents, industrial designs and utility models from their corporate tax base.

Trademarks are covered by Act XI of 1997 on the Protection Trademarks and Geographical Indications. Protection of trademarks is valid for ten years, and it can be extended by additional ten-year periods. There have been problems with international companies seeking to extend their trademarks to Hungary, only to find that a local player has already protected the name in question. HPO officials report that about 100 of the 8,000–9,000 trademark applications that arrive from abroad each year in Hungary are problematic. But the officials say that this is not always a question of bad faith, with locals reserving international trademarks in hopes of reaching a profitable settlement. Some Hungarian companies have been operating legitimately under a trademark for years, when a lesser-known western  European company with the same name and business decides to expand to central  European markets. The HPO does not automatically screen trademark requests for conflicts but will do so for an additional small fee.

Industrial designs are protected under Act XLVIII of 2001. Protection is valid for five years from the date of application and can be extended to a maximum of 25 years.

Utility models, new technical solutions that do not reach the level of a patentable invention, are protected under Act XXXVIII of 1991. Protection is valid for ten years, and the utility model then becomes part of the public domain.
Topography is protected under Act XXXIX of 1991 on the Protection of the Topography of Microelectronic
Semiconductor Products.

Copyrights are protected under Act LXXVI of 1999. Copyright lasts during the author’s lifetime and for 70 years from the first day of the year following the death of the author. Hungary’s copyright law is fully harmonised with EU requirements. Copyright law has also been modernised to account for the spread of information technologies and has incorporated provisions of international copyright treaties.
The first award for damages to a foreign copyright owner (Microsoft) for illegal use of software occurred in
1999, and that year also saw the first criminal convictions with (suspended) prison terms for two individuals
for copyright infringement. Since then, court actions against copyright infringers, increasingly including
illegal copies of films and DVDs, have become relatively common. Co-operation with the authorities
reduces sanctions, but violators face up to eight years in prison for copyright infringement.

The Business Software Alliance (BSA), a private industry group, helps its members defend their copyrights, in part by initiating legal action against illegal use. The BSA says that while software morality has improved over the past decade, it is now stagnating. It estimates that software piracy rates fell to 42% in 2005, from
44% in 2004 but still only even with the estimated level in 2003. Although this is better than the 51% recorded in 2000 or 76% in 1994, it exceeds the western  European average of around 35%. The BSA estimates that illegal software resulted in US$106m in damages to the industry in 2005.

The Audiovisual Copyright Foundation estimates that the film and video industry suffered lost revenues of about Ft6bn in 2005, about even with 2004, because of pirated videos and DVDs. The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimated that US filmmakers alone suffered losses of US$102m in Hungary from pirating in 2005. The organisations estimate that nine out of ten downloads and seven out of ten DVDs in Hungary are illegal

Act I of 1996 on Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Act) requires cable operators to complete contracts or obtain contract waivers from the broadcasters whose programmes they transmit. The operators must also register their programme offerings with the National Radio and Television Board (Orszagos Radio es Televizio Testulet—ORTT). The ORTT must allow any broadcaster to check the
registry for information regarding their programmes retransmitted by the cable operators and the protection of copyrights.

The Copyright Act prohibits the manufacture and distribution of certain decoding devices used illegally to view pay-television programming (such as HBO). Industry associations believe the number of those illegally
Page 109 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
viewing premium cable-TV programming to be about equal to the number of paying subscribers. Act LXXVII
of 2001 modified the law to include electronic databases as well.
Price Controls

Hungary has freed the prices of most products and services offered by private concerns. Nevertheless, the Act on the Determination of Prices (Act LXXXVII of 1990) maintains regulated prices on electricity, natural gas, public transport, certain telecommunications services, postal fees, retail price margins on pharmaceuticals, publicly owned water and wastewater services, and district heating. The law authorises the government and municipalities to determine compulsory prices for these products and services to protect the interests of consumers, and if necessary suppliers. Prices are usually set as an upper limit.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport regulates retail and wholesale prices for the
non-competitive public segment of the energy market under Decrees 56/2002, 57/2002, 58/2002 and
59/2002 for electricity, 70/2003, 96/2003 and 105/2005 for natural gas, and 1/2006 for district heating.
Prices in these sectors are determined based on proposals of the Hungarian Energy Office (Magyar
Energia Hivatal—MEH), but ultimately they are political decisions. Companies affected by these price
controls may apply for increases to the MEH, which is required to review all applications and publish the
results of any price revisions.

Prices in the liberalised segment of the energy market are determined by market forces. Act CX of 2001 (Electricity Act) gradually introduced competition to the electricity market for all non-household consumers, and Act XLI (Gas Act) of 2003 did the same quickly on the natural-gas market. Based on the Gas Act, domestic natural-gas prices follow world market prices, and discount household-gas prices are subsidised by higher mining fees paid by MOL, the oil and gas company. However, the peg to import prices has not been maintained. The government announced increases in natural-gas and electricity prices in July 2006, as part of a larger government austerity package.

Based on Law C of 2003 on Electronic Communications, the National Communication Authority (NHH) determines wholesale and retail prices of fixed-line telecom services. The NHH has acted in the past to limit price increases. Although its decisions can be challenged in court, this is unlikely due to increased competition, primarily from mobile-service providers and also because Hungary’s telecoms prices are already among the highest in the OECD. The NHH has also required Hungary’s three mobile-telecom providers to reduce the connection fees they charge for calls initiated from a fixed-line network.

Pharmaceutical retail prices remain a point of concern for companies in that sector in Hungary. The government is attempting to keep prices down by discouraging the prescribing of more-expensive treatments when cheaper generics are available. There have been numerous conflicts about the state’s drug-subsidy budget, which the industry says is consistently underfunded, and the government says consistently overruns its budget. Pharmaceutical prices rose by 15% in both 2004 and 2005.

The European Commission searched sites belonging to German technologies group  Siemens last week, as it was suspected that the company could have entered into illegal price agreements in business with so-called network transformers, which are used to regulate the tension in electricity networks. Five companies are thought to have been involved in total, including Austrian group VA Tech, which has been taken over by Siemens. The searches are reported to have been carried out at sites in Germany, France and Austria.

TD
These raids are said to have been merely a first step in the investigations; if the  Commission's suspicions are confirmed and proceedings are commenced against the companies involved, the companies could
face fines of up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover.  Siemens admitted yesterday that it had been affected, and suspended three employees owing to infringement of the  cartel laws. According to the German group, the  Commission is investigating business between 1999 and 2003, although  Siemens has admitted to entering into agreements only between 2001 and 2003. Swiss rival  ABB has also admitted that its site in Bad Honnef, Germany, has been searched.

The European Commission carried out unannounced inspections at several power transformer producers on 7th and 8th February in France, Germany, and Austria, according to an EC statement.
While Brussels declined to name the companies involved, Germany’s  Siemens and Switzerland’s  ABB
confirmed that their factories had been visited by EC inspectors.

TD
“The Commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated Article 81 of the EC treaty, which prohibits practices such as  price fixing,”  the Commission said in a statement. “The fact that the  European Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour.”

No deadline for the inquiry was given, although  Siemens announced it had suspended three employees for anti-trust violations, adding that an internal investigation had found problems at factories in Nuremberg, Germany and Linz, Austria.

A spokesperson for  ABB also confirmed that a power transformer plant in Bad Honnef, Germany had been visited by EC officials, although he declined to give further information.

This announcement into anti-trust behaviour follows an EU ruling at the end of January against eleven companies for participating in a  cartel for gas insulated switchgear (GIS) projects. Used to control energy flows in electricity grids, GIS forms part of power substations, and the EC’s  fine represents the largest set of fines imposed on a single cartel: the firms were  fined a total of EUR 750.7 million

The companies include Switzerland’s ABB, France’s Alstom,  Areva and Schneider, Japan’s Fuji Heavy, Hitachi, Japan AE Power Systems, and Toshiba, and both the Austrian and German units of Siemens, the latter of which was  fined a record EUR 396.5 million. MS

(CIA, Feb 12, HN-1,13, Feb 13) The Anti-Monopoly Bureau levied the largest  fine in its history on 9
February. It imposed a  cartel fine of CZK 979 mln on ten foreign manufacturers of special electrical
switchboard switches (PISU). The  fine refers to the 2001-2004 period when the firms were making
agreements on PISU prices. Among the penalised companies are  Siemens, Alstom,  Hitachi, and five
Japanese concerns. According to the bureau, the highest sum, roughly CZK 304 mln, could be paid by
four firms from the  Siemens group.The bureau found that bid-rigging was going on - the firms agreed on
tender bids for a 16-year period. The  European Commission also levied a fine totalling EUR 750.7 mln
on the firms for their EU  cartel this January.

TD
(CIA, Feb 12) Companies ensuring electricity distribution in the Czech Republic avoid talking about the existence of the  cartel of manufacturers of special gas insulated switchboard switches (PISU) for substations. E.ON refused to comment on the issue. ČEZ mentioned that during the existence of the cartel regional electricity distributors had yet not been under its control. CIA is currently seeking the response of Pražská Energetika.
(CIA, Feb 12) In the first half of this year the ČEZ will start building a new 110/22/10 kV substation in
Ostrava. The investment will amount to CZK 146 mln. The construction work is scheduled to last until
2008. The substation will make it possible to cover the growing energy needs resulting from the
development of the area near the existing Shopping Park and the Nad Porubkou industrial zone. It will
also ensure stand-by power supply for the 10 kV network in the Starý Zábřeh part of Ostrava and alleviate
the capacity loading at the Kunčice quarter.

(CIA, Feb 9) PREdistribuce has announced a public tender for the development of a new 110/22 kV transformation station in Prague 4 - Pankrác. The orientation value of this contract reaches over CZK 267 mln. The construction will run from June 2007 till the end of November 2008. Potential bidders can register until 23 March. The deadline for submissions is 4 April.

(CIA, Feb 13) The Moravia Energo group is going to modify its organisational structure. According to chairman of the Moravia Energo board of directors Bohuslav Bernátek, the role of the controlling company will be taken over by ENIAS, which will control Moravia Energo, Teplo Jaroměř and Bicorn.

(CIA, Feb 9) Last year electricity consumption increased most in the regions of South Moravia and South Bohemia, where it rose by an average of 7 % on 2005. Following was the Central Bohemian region where electricity consumption grew by 6 %. In Prague electricity consumption increased by 4.6 % y/y, in North Bohemia it was up by 4.4 %, in East Bohemia by 2.7 %, in West Bohemia by 2.5 % and in North Moravia by 2 %. Net electricity consumption in the entire country rose 2.9 % y/y to 59.35 bln kWh; gross consumption saw an increase by 2.4 % to 71.66 bln kWh.

(CIA, Feb 15) The  European Parliament called on EU member states to make investment into energetic infrastructure and energy supply. It is, among others, requesting an increase in minimum crude oil reserves within the EU from 90 to 120 days of consumption and a creation of minimum natural gas
reserves that would last for at least 90 days. The parliament is desiderating a new EU strategy focused on gradual elimination of fossil fuels from transport and a more extensive use of non-conventional fuels. The deputies are also calling for measures improving energetic efficiency. If the current trend is preserved Europe's dependence on energy and fuel imports will increase from existing 50 % to 71 % by 2030.

TD
(LN-11, Feb 15) Because of protests by certain countries the  European Commission's plan to
consolidate consumer tax on fuel will not be discussed until the end of February. The dispute concerns the
so-called fuel tourism which affects especially Germany. That is why this country regards itself as the main
initiator of the plan. Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, i.e. countries with low fuel prices and frequent targets of
fuel tourism, sharply oppose it.
(HN-15, Feb 14) Russian gas concern Gazprom is planning to raise prices of gas supplies to Slovakia by
10 %. Gazprom's client Slovenský Plynárenský Priemysel has a gas supply contract signed until 2008.
This price rise will not affect the Czech Republic.
(HN-18, Feb 13) Last year the net profit of Slovak refinery Slovnaft saw a decrease by 30 % y/y to SKK
6.3 bln (roughly CZK 5.1 bln). The revenue of this firm, which is controlled by Hungarian MOL, however
increased by 17 % to SKK 120.1 bln. The lower profit was mainly influenced by currency exchange rates,
lower margins and changing stock. In 2006 the operating profits dropped by 28 % to SKK 8 bln. In Q4 of
last year Slovnaft posted a loss totalling over SKK 1 bln, whereas in 2005 it yield a profit of SKK 2.1 bln.

(HN-18, Feb 13) The net profit of Hungarian oil and gas group MOL slid by 53 % y/y to HUF 24.53 bln in the fourth quarter of last year. The yearlong profits, however, increased by 35 % to HUF 331.42 bln.

(HN-15, Feb 14) The  European Commission made a raid on factories of several engineering firms on Germany, Austria, and France due to a suspicion of a  cartel agreement in the area of transformers. Siemens and ABB stated they belonged among enterprises to which the raids carried out on 7 and 8
February referred to.  Siemens is one of the companies that were  fined by the EC as well as by the Czech
Anti-Monopoly Bureau for making a  cartel in the area of gas insulated switching devices.

(HN-17, Feb 12) Russia's largest oil company Lukoil wants to invest USD 800 mln (CZK 17.37 bln) into its refineries this year. The investment is part of the firm's strategy which envisages expanding production of high-octane gasoline.

BRUSSELS, Feb 21, 2007 (AFP) -

The European Commission, which imposed its biggest antitrust  fine ever Wednesday, is stepping up efforts in its anti-cartel crusade, handing out ever-bigger penalties against the illegal clubs.

TD
The EU competition watchdog wants to crack down on cartels because it says they shield members from competition, leaving consumers to foot higher bills for lower quality and less choice.
Since taking up her job as  Europe's top antitrust regulator in late 2004, EU Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes has made fighting cartels one of the top priorities of her five-year term.
She currently has a staff of about 60 people devoted to uncovering and punishing cartels.

Although her trustbusters have only hit two cartels so far this year, they have already in less than two months beat the total of  fines imposed in 2006 of 1.08 billion  euros, which was already an annual record.
If fines are not reduced by an EU court following an appeal, they are paid into the EU's budget.
The following are the biggest  fines EU regulators have imposed in  cartel cases by company and sector. By company Fine (euros) Year

HD     OUTLOOK Thyssenkrup, Otis, Schindler, Kone braced for 1 bln eur EU cartel fine

BRUSSELS (AFX) - Four of the world's biggest lift makers, ThyssenKrupp AG, United Technologies
Corp's Otis Elevators Co Ltd, Schindler AG and Kone Oyj, are bracing themselves for heavy sanctions set
to be imposed tomorrow by the  European Commission totalling close to 1 bln eur for alleged  cartel
behaviour beginning nine years ago, sources said.

Sources told Agence France-Presse that said the collective  cartel fine imposed on the German, US, Swiss and Finnish manufacturers would set a record for EU antitrust regulators. Reports also said that the majority of the  fine would be levied at ThyssenKrupp.

TD
The sanction could come as early as tomorrow, with European Commissioners, including EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, meeting to discuss the timing and fine detail of the decision on the
long-standing case.
Industry sources told DPA News Agency that the  commission is to rubber-stamp its ruling tomorrow. The
commission has declined to comment.

ThyssenKrupp said it was cooperating with the body, but a company spokeswoman declined to provide further details on the matter.

The commission will say that the companies engaged in  price-fixing and market collusion in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands between 1998 and 2004.
In Jan 2004, EU executive officials raided the premises of the four groups after receiving  cartel
allegations from third parties with regard to the  European elevator and escalator market.
Third parties complained that they were not supplied with spare parts by the members of the supposed
cartel.

The commission also conducted further raids in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany in early March of that year.
United Technologies confirmed at the time that a "small number" of employees at the  European
operations of its Otis elevator unit may have violated company policy and competition rules.

Kone added that it found "local" anti-competitive behaviour at its offices in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany following an internal investigation triggered by the EU raids, but said it did not find "evidence or indications" of any  European-wide anti-competitive practices.

In a statement at the time, Kone said it took "immediate measures to stop anything that could be considered as anti-competitive behaviour in the  European Union." The company declined to specify the nature of the measures.

The commission finally issued formal charges to the companies -- set out as a 'statement of objections' -- in mid-October 2005.
The companies can appeal  fines at the EU's highest court, the  European Court of Justice (ECJ).



Page 120 of 130 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The fine is set to be the heaviest imposed by EU regulators after they levied 855.2 mln eur -- reduced on appeal to 790.5 mln -- in Nov 2001 against eight vitamin companies suspected of  cartel behaviour lasting nine years.
The companies implicated were Roche Holding AG, BASF AG, Aventis SA, Takeda, Solvay
Pharmaceuticals NV, Merck KGaA, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd and Eisai Co Ltd.
Late last month, the  commission also fined 11 companies a total of 750.7 mln eur for participation in a
cartel for gas insulated switchgear projects between 1988 and 2004.
The companies involved were  Siemens AG,  ABB Ltd, Alstom,  Areva,  Fuji Co, Hitachi  Japan AE Power
Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Toshiba Corp and VA Tech.

Kroes has made the fight against cartels one of the key policies of her tenure as head of the EU's competition department.

Under new guidelines set by the  commission in June last year, the  commission adopted new powers for its policing of antitrust abuses.

The commission will fix a basic fine of up to 30 pct of a company's sales of the product in the market where the abuse has taken place. The  fine will also be multiplied by the number of years during which a company participates in the infringement.
The overall ceiling for  fines remains 10 pct of global annual turnover.

In addition, a so-called 'entry fee' may be imposed, particularly on cartels, irrespective of the duration of the infringement. This is calculated as a sum equal to 15-25 pct of a company's annual sales, whatever the duration of the infringement.
The commission added that repeat offenders will also be  fined more than in the past.

The commission's previous practice has been to increase a  fine by 50 pct where the company has been found to have been previously involved in one or more similar infringements.

Under the new rules, the  commission can increase the fine up to 100 pct. It will also take into account not only its own previous decisions, but also those of EU member state national competition authorities.
Each prior infringement will justify an increase of the  fine.
In this regards, the  commission's remit to fight cartels was given a boost earlier this month after the ECJ
upheld a fine of 42.4 mln eur imposed by the EU's lower court on French food company Groupe Danone.

The court dismissed Danone's claim that sanctions imposed for repeated  cartel infringements have no basis in EU law.
A spokesman for Kroes said at the time that the ECJ for the first time "clearly confirmed the
commission's policy of increasing  fines for repeat offenders."

The changes do not affect the commission's rules on leniency, whereby  cartel whistleblowers can receive full immunity from fines. There are also graded  fine reductions for assistance in  cartel exposure.

There is no strict deadline to complete  cartel inquiries. Their duration depends on a number of factors, including; the complexity of each case, the extent to which the companies concerned co-operate, and the exercise of the rights of defence.

"The European Commission has decided not to raise any objections under Community state aid rules to the financial aid granted by France to the NeoVal research and development (R&D) programme," the Commission said.
The Commission, the European Union's regulatory arm, said the research was to help develop a
new-generation metro train intended to make optimal use of power. The aid is being granted through the
NeoVal project.
