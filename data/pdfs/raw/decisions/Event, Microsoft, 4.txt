ATTENTION - ADDS details ///

Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said Wednesday he still sees a possible negotiated settlement in the EU antitrust case despite the  European Commission decision to pursue a "much riskier course."

TD
"I spent most of last week in Brussels because we believed we were really on the verge of an agreement that would resolve the issue in this case without the need for litigation," Ballmer told reporters in a teleconference after the EU's record 497 million euro (613 million dollar)  fine was announced.

"In the end, although we had agreed on steps to address all the issues the Commission had in the current case, the Commission nonetheless decided to pursue the much riskier course of litigation."

Ballmer said Microsoft officials "remain hopeful that at some point we may be able to resume those discussions to reach a mutual resolution of these issues."
EU regulators slapped a record  fine on Microsoft in a landmark anti-trust ruling that labelled the US
software giant a predatory monopolist.

The EU sanctions, which also include enforced changes to the Windows operating system, went dramatically further than a contentious settlement reached by US anti-trust authorities with Bill Gates' titan in 2001.
Ballmer said the EU action offers little to consumers.

"We worked hard to reach an agreement that would address the  European Commission's concerns and still allow us to innovate and improve our products for consumers," he said.

"We respect the Commission's authority, but we believe that our settlement offer from last week would have offered far more choices and benefits to consumers."

Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel of  Microsoft, said the company would appeal to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

"We have acted responsibly while seeking to build the best products we can to meet the needs of our customers," Smith said.

"We believe that the Commission's decision would actually reduce consumer choice and hurt European software developers. We want to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, and we look forward to the possibility of continuing these discussions as this case moves forward."

Microsoft rivals Wednesday lauded a record EU fine against it, plus mandated changes to the Windows operating system in Europe as a way to help competition, while others lashed out at European intrusion into the US market.

TD
The 497 million euro (613 million dollar)  fine and other requirements by the  European Commission drew a sharp reaction on both sides of the debate on  Microsoft in the United States.

"This decision is fundamentally significant because the  European Commission has formally declared that Microsoft's media player bundling strategy is illegal and has established the guideposts for future bundling cases," said Bob Kimball, vice president and general counsel at RealNetworks.

RealNetworks was a key firm in the EU case because it complained that Microsoft's "bundling" of its media software for audio and video within the Windows operating system was an abuse of the Microsoft monopoly position.

"This is the first legal review of Microsoft's media player bundling practice. While we have not yet seen the complete decision, we support the European Commission's efforts to provide European consumers with all the benefits of a competitive marketplace, including choice in digital media products," Kimball added.
"RealNetworks welcomes the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field."

The EU ordered Bill Gates's firm to offer a European version of its all-conquering Windows operating system without the Media Player program within 90 days.

And Microsoft was ordered to disclose "complete and accurate" data to enable rival companies to offer low-end servers that can work with Windows within 120 days.
But US Senator Trent Lott lashed out at the ruling, calling it "an unprecedented intrusion into the US
marketplace."

"It will force Microsoft to disclose to its competitors in Europe, and potential to non-European companies as well, some of Microsoft's most valuable trade secrets and other intellectual property assets," Lott said.

Jonathan Zuck of the pro-Microsoft Association for Competitive Technology said the move could have unintended consequences.

"The European Commission may be trying to punish  Microsoft, but its proposals reserve their harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies," he said. "The  European Commission plans to regulate the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software costs for everyone."
Server hardware and software maker Sun Microsystems meanwhile hailed the EU decision.
"This decision is important for consumers not only in Europe, but also for increased innovation and
competition worldwide," said Lee Patch, Sun's vice president for legal affairs.

Page 7 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The Commission's decision seeks to create a level playing field in the work group server marketplace, enabling competitors to deliver work group servers that can fully interoperate and therefore compete on the merits," Patch added.

Ed Black, of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group of  Microsoft rivals, said the EU decision is a "confirmation of  Microsoft's anti-competitive and illegal business tactics."

"This decision details the ways in which  Microsoft caused competitive harm, hurt innovation, and forced consumers to accept increased prices with less choice," Black said.

"The issues outlined today will prevent  Microsoft from controlling the platform for the delivery and subsequent control over digital content ... The decision prevents  Microsoft from 'locking in' their media player and their proprietary format as the de facto standard, which would force developers and consumers alike to bow to whatever demands or taxes  Microsoft wishes to place on digital content."

Microsoft Belgium, a unit of U.S. software giant  Microsoft, attracted 90 partners and clients at a seminar, which it organised on March 23 and 24, 2004 in Brussels.

The seminar was opened with a speech by  Microsoft's top three executive Kevin Johnson. It runs at building 7 and building 11 of the Brussels Heysel exhibition complex. The seminar is open to visitors and some 5,000 are expected attend the event, of whom numerous users of  Microsoft's word processing products and the operational system Windows. Belgian company Real Software was acknowledged on March 23, 2004 as Microsoft's Golden Certified Partner in the area of collaborative solutions and business intelligence, the highest status attainable by  Microsoft partners.

TD
The seminar is a sign that the group respects partnership, and also that Microsoft is not willing to give in to competition in spite of the pressure from the European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft awaited for March 24, 2004. [Editor's note: The EC is expected to announce its ruling, according to which Microsoft will have to pay a fine of 497 mln euro ($612.6 mln) for abuse of a dominant position on the market of computer operational systems and software products. The fine is smaller than the maximum fine of 10 pct from the annual turnover of a company, allowed by EC's rules.  Microsoft has told journalists that the group disagreed with the grounds for the ruling and would appeal it before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.]

Schaeffer's Midday Options Update

TD
The major market indexes are trading marginally above breakeven just before midday, as the tech sector received a lift from Red Hat's (NASDAQ: RHAT) fourth-quarter earnings report. The company announced late Monday that revenue for the quarter jumped 47 percent over the same quarter last year on
better-than-expected new subscription sales. RHAT posted net income of $5 million, or three cents per share, on revenue of $37 million, compared to flat earnings on revenue of $26 million for last year.

Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK) geared up today for the next round of earnings announcements by boosting its second-quarter outlook. The firm announced that it now expects profit between 37 and 39 cents per share, slipping past the Street's view of 36 cents per share for the quarter.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hopes to have finally settled its  antitrust woes with the  European               Commission. The group announced its decision to  fine the software maker $612 million for abusing its dominant market position. The commission also ordered MSFT to disclose operating system interface information to rival server maker within 120 days. Under the terms of the reprimand, the software giant will be forced to offer a version of its Windows operating system without the hotly debated Windows Media Player.

Analysts came out in force today, as Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) received an upgrade to "sector outperformer" from "sector performer." The brokerage also raised its price target for TWX to $20 from
$18, citing expectations that the company will post better growth than its peers during 2004 and 2005. Best Buy was also the recipient of positive analyst action, being raised to "outperform" from "neutral," while Bed, Bath & Beyond was similarly upgraded to "outperform" from "neutral."
At 1:48 p.m. eastern time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA - 10078.8) is up 0.15 percent and the
S&P 500 Index (SPX - 1095.85) is higher by 0.17 percent. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP - 1918.6) is up
0.88 percent. At 1:49 p.m. in the options pits, 1,526,270 calls and 1,154,706 puts traded for a composite
put/call ratio across all five exchanges of 0.75. The CBOE put/call ratio for equity options weighed in at
0.80.

Nokia (NYSE: NOK) was the focus of some heavy call trading today. The stock's April 20 call saw 7,071 contracts cross the tape on open interest (or existing positions) of 27,445. Overall sentiment toward the security is heavily skewed toward the bearish cam among options players. Looking at existing options on NOK, investors have not been more pessimistically configured over the past year.

Despite the elevated levels of pessimism from the options crowd, short sellers are fairly optimistic toward the security. Short selling is a bearish technique in which a trader borrows shares to sell in the market
Page 10 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
with the intention of buying them back at a cheaper price. The nearly 14.9 million NOK shares sold short leave investors with a paltry 1.56 days to cover (or buy back) these bearish bets at the equity's average daily trading volume. This greatly decreases the stock's chances of benefiting from a short-covering rally should these investors be forced out of their positions.

Wall Street is decidedly enamored with NOK. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, 21 rate the shares a "buy" or better. Digging into the group we find 15 "strong buys," six "buys," six "holds," and no "sell" ratings. This bullish configuration of analyst rankings leaves plenty of room for potential downgrades.

The high levels of optimism for NOK are surprising given the stock's recent technical performance. After gapping higher to the 20 level on January 8, the shares have since breached this long-term level of support/resistance. This is not only alarming due to the fact that the 20 level has acted as staunch resistance to advances for NOK in the past, but also because gaps usually act as technical support for future pullbacks. In today's trading, the security is struggling to maintain the support of its 20-week moving average - a trendline the stock has only closed one week below since September 2003. Given the optimistic sentiment and poor technical performance, future losses could be in store for NOK.

In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union on Tuesday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615 million US for alleged antitrust abuses.

TD
With the EU decision on the software giant due Wednesday, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the  European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

Sources familiar with the five-year-old case, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the EU ruling finds Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any  fine or remedies.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behaviour in the U.S.  antitrust case, but settled with the Bush administration in late 2001. A U.S. appeals court is considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore  competition.

U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the Commission to levy  fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 per cent of a company's global revenue.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments approved the  fine Monday. A source said Tuesday it was around $818 million.

That would be a record for the EU in an antitrust case, but far below the maximum of around $3.5 billion US that could be imposed in Microsoft's case.

Given that the Redmond, Wash.-based company has cash reserves of nearly $53 billion, experts say the fine is less significant than the changes Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows.

HD     Other proposed remedies, however, may have a more enduring effect. BY     By Stephen Taub.

Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner who in the past has blocked a number of large, high-profile mergers, is seeking to fine Microsoft Corp. $613 million for allegedly abusing its Windows monopoly, according to the Financial Times.

This would be the highest penalty imposed on a company by the European Union, added the paper. The current record was assessed against Hoffmann-La Roche AG for its part in a vitamins cartel.

TD
Though the  fine might almost be inconsequential for a company with more than $50 billion cash on hand, two other proposed remedies may have more of a lingering effect.  Microsoft must offer a version of its PC operating system without Windows Media Player, and it must license - at a reasonable price - information so rival manufacturers can make their servers as compatible with the operating system as Microsoft's own servers.

The 20-member European Commission will formally decide the case on Wednesday.  Microsoft intends to appeal the case and to ask that implementation of any remedies be delayed until the appeals process
is concluded - a process that could take years, observed Reuters.

The FT explained that EC  fines are based on factors such as the gravity of the offense and the time for which it continued - five years and five months in the case of  Microsoft. The paper also said the  fine might have been doubled because of the company's global operations - an assessment with which the company took exception.

Horacio Gutierrez,  Microsoft's chief European legal counsel, told the paper, "We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government and the conduct at issue has been permitted by the Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company is also reportedly arguing that it shouldn't be  fined since it could not have known it was breaking EU competition law.

In 2001 a U.S. appeals court determined that  Microsoft broke antitrust rules, but Reuters noted that critics of the U.S. ruling have maintained that those remedies did not encourage vigorous  competition.

HD          EU Makes Landmark  Bid To Shake Microsoft's PC Power

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In a landmark bid to shake  Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) stranglehold on the personal-computer industry, European Union regulators slapped tough sanctions on the software giant for abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips.

The E.U. Commission Wednesday ordered  Microsoft to reveal code from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create competing server software. Unless  Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with that disclosure requirement.

TD
In the other major part of the penalties,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer PC manufacturers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play Internet audio and video.
E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also  fined Microsoft EUR497 million.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation," Monti said. He denied that his orders violated  Microsoft's intellectual-property rights and called his moves "proportionate" and "balanced."

Microsoft said it will appeal to the E.U.'s Court of First Instance, saying the decision oversteps
European and international law.

Microsoft expects a protracted appeals "process that will likely extend for several years," according to an electronic-mail message from Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
The company also said the  fine is about double what it expected.

Microsoft now has 70 days to ask judges to freeze and eventually overturn the decision.  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, said he hoped to freeze the decision before  Microsoft is obliged to implement the first of the Commission's orders in three months' time.

Antitrust experts say the company has a fighting chance to win that order to freeze - particularly if judges share Microsoft's fears that the decision represents a threat to intellectual-property protection in Europe.

Microsoft competitors RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) and Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) praised the decision and said it gave them a fair chance in the market. Both companies had led the anti-Microsoft campaign in Europe.

"The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' vice president and general counsel.


Page 15 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sun's vice president for legal affairs, Lee Patch, said the decision will help consumers by making it easier for their computers to communicate on "a level playing field."

Microsoft supporters denounced the E.U.'s move.

Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, said the verdict would make doing business harder for his members who are small software developers.
"The European Commission may be trying to punish  Microsoft, but its proposals reserve the
harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies," Zuck said. Europe "plans to regulate
the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software
costs for everyone," Zuck added.
Other industry groups said the net effect would be to curb innovation.

The ruling "signals an ominous change for the global information and communications technology industry," said Hugo Lueders, European director for the Computing Technology Industry Association.

Monti spent much of Wednesday defending a decision that goes far beyond what  Microsoft agreed to in a 2001 settlement with the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush in a similar case.

Monti said he could have imposed a  fine on Microsoft's global sales but refrained "in deference" to regulators in different parts of the world, including the U.S. Instead, Europe set its fine against Microsoft, which is a record against a single company, by taking into account Microsoft's sales only in Europe.

The sum represents less than 2% of  Microsoft's worldwide sales and 8% of the company's narrower sales in Europe and nearby countries, E.U. Commission officials said. Europe's regulators justify their opaque fining rules by saying they need broad discretion to impose penalties in order keep future wrongdoers guessing at the likely punishment and to discourage offenses.

Under E.U. law, regulators could have  fined Microsoft as much as 10% of its most recent annual worldwide sales - which works out to about EUR3 billion. Still,  Microsoft has tens of billions of dollars in cash reserves, making any  fine less important than the other orders to modify its business model.

Europe's case against  Microsoft dates back to 1998, when Sun accused Microsoft of withholding code that enables smooth connections between its servers and Microsoft-powered PCs. Wednesday, the regulators upheld those charges but said  Microsoft can charge "reasonable remuneration" for sharing its interfaces.

In 2001, the Commission later expanded the case to investigate  Microsoft's power over multimedia software. That part of the case focused on RealNetworks' RealPlayer software. As part of Wednesday's ruling, the Commission said  Microsoft can't sell discounted versions of Windows that are prebundled with its own Media Player.
The E.U. also will appoint a "monitoring trustee" to make sure  Microsoft complies.

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement in recent months, with Ballmer visiting Brussels last week to oversee the company's negotiating tactics. But talks collapsed over Monti's concerns about the company's plans to continue bundling Windows with consumer-friendly functions.

The earlier U.S. case also focused on the concept of bundling but it differed in the details. While the U.S. concentrated on the Internet Explorer Web browser, the European case concerned compatibility issues between PCs and servers, and later on media players.

Any appeal by Microsoft likely will charge the Commission with neglecting procedural steps, and in particular, misunderstanding evidence. During the five-year case, the company submitted about 50 "customer statements" to show that big computer users such as banks, companies and government agencies are happy with the way Windows works.

Those statements triggered bitter exchanges between  Microsoft and the Commission. The regulators said the statements didn't paint a true picture and had been manipulated.  Microsoft insisted that the statements were "the best source of information" for the commission.

Wednesday, the Commission concluded that the statements actually hurt  Microsoft's case. "Survey responses submitted by  Microsoft itself confirmed the link between the interoperability advantage that Microsoft reserved for itself and its growing market shares," the Commission said.


Page 16 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Still, an appeal could go beyond such wrangling and answer the basic business question that an earlier
U.S. settlement left open: What kinds of features can  Microsoft add to Windows?

Microsoft has long argued that it should be able to add almost any feature to Windows for the purpose of product improvement.
Resolving the question is key to  Microsoft. The company still faces at least two separate  antitrust
challenges in Europe.

E.U. regulators already are investigating whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, such as hand-held computers
and smartphones. They also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree to unfair technology licensing terms.

On Wednesday, the Commission signaled that it would keep up the pressure on  Microsoft and said the company's "illegal behavior is still ongoing."

It also warned that it remains concerned about  Microsoft's "general business model" that "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take an interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

HD      Microsoft Hopes Appeal Will Blunt EU Decision

While promising to comply with European law and keeping the door open to future settlement,  Microsoft executives dug in their heels Wednesday in response to the $613 million  fine and other sanctions announced earlier in the day by the European Union. The action came after years of investigation by European regulators into  Microsoft's business practices.

CEO Steve Ballmer, in a teleconference to discuss Microsoft's position, said his company felt it was on the verge of a settlement with the European Commission last week, but that the commission "decided to pursue the much riskier course of litigation." Ballmer reiterated  Microsoft's position, voiced many times before, that "every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers."

TD
In announcing the  fine and sanctions for what it called  Microsoft's "near monopoly," EU regulators placed tight time restrictions on  Microsoft. The company was given 90 days to offer PC manufacturers two versions of its Windows operating system--one with Windows Media Player included; another without the multimedia program. In addition,  Microsoft has 120 days to comply with an EU sanction compelling it to disclose Windows code that will make it easier for server manufacturers to work with Windows.

The EU is also calling for the establishment of an advisory body to monitor  Microsoft's future behavior. At a news conference Wednesday, EU  competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "I am confident that we have produced here a decision that will stand before any appeal."

Microsoft is expected to file an appeal at the Court of the First Instance, in Luxembourg, within 90 days. Senior VP and general counsel Brad Smith, on the conference call with Ballmer, said it was "unfortunate" that the European Commission decided to impose sanctions when U.S. regulators had already studied Microsoft's business practices, resulting in the consent decree that already governs the company's actions.

"This is a case that started in the United States.  Microsoft is an American company. The complainant companies are American companies. The software is designed in the United States, and the U.S. government dealt with the issues thoroughly," Smith said. "There was no need for the commission to disrupt that regime with the conflicting approach in which it's embarked today."

The European Commission's ruling signifies a victory for RealNetworks, which pushed the audio-video issue, and for Sun Microsystems, which pushed the server issue. Sun's 1998 complaint against  Microsoft did much to get the case rolling in the EU.

CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning to you.
It is Wednesday, March 24.

TD
From the CNN global headquarters in Atlanta, I'm Carol Costello.
Thank you for joining us.

His new book blasts President Bush for botching the war on terror. Well, today former counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke will air his complaints at a public hearing of the 9/11 Commission.

A military convoy comes under attack in Falluja, west of Baghdad. Two coalition soldiers are wounded, but their nationalities are unclear.
A specific threat shuts the U.S. Embassy in the United Arab Emirates. Reaction to the killing of Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin may have led to the closing.

A memorial service begins next hour for the 190 people killed in the Spanish train bombings. Leaders from around the world are attending the state funeral.

And rescue crews are searching five states for a small plane carrying NASCAR fans. The plane has been missing since Sunday night.
We update the top stories every 15 minutes. The next news update comes your way at 5:15 Eastern.

It should be a dramatic day at the 9/11 Commission hearings. Here is the lineup. George Tenet, CIA chief under both the Clinton and Bush administrations, will kick off the testimony. He will be followed by Clinton's national security advisor, Samuel Berger. And then we'll hear from Richard Clarke, who worked for both Bush and Clinton as counter-terrorism director. His new book alleges Bush administration failures leading up to and following 9/11. Finally, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage will appear. He takes the place of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who has refused to testify publicly.
You can sum up the previous day's 9/11 hearings in just five words -- we just didn't know enough. CNN's David Ensor highlights the testimony on why the U.S. did not take out al Qaeda before 9/11. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ENSOR (voice-over): The commission staff director told of at least three different times the CIA thought it had Osama bin Laden in its sights, once in particular at a desert camp in Afghanistan in February of '99 where bin Laden stayed for a week but there was a problem.

PHILLIP ZELIKOW, EXEC. DIR., 9/11 COMMISSION: According to CIA officials, policymakers were concerned about the danger that a strike might kill an Emirati prince or other senior officials who might be with bin Laden or close by.

ENSOR: The Clinton administration hesitated, Philip Zelikow says, because near bin Laden were senior men from the United Arab Emirates at a hunting camp and, before long, the opportunity was lost. Then Defense Secretary William Cohen insists there never was a clear shot at bin Laden.

Page 19 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WILLIAM COHEN, FMR. DEFENSE SECRETARY: If the director of Central Intelligence says we don't have it then you have to rely upon that.

ENSOR: The commissioners grilled both Clinton administration and Bush administration officials about why they didn't strike al Qaeda earlier.

BOB KERREY, 9/11 COMMISSION MEMBER: The fact that it's unpopular, that it's difficult, that our allies are not necessarily with it shouldn't deter a president who believes that what we have is a serial killer on our hands.

SLADE GORTON (R), COMMISSION MEMBER: What made you think even when you took over and got these first briefings, given the history of al Qaeda and its successful attacks on Americans that we had the luxury even of seven months before we could make any kind of response much less three years?

ENSOR: Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said time for planning was needed that just firing off cruise missiles, as the Clinton administration did once, seemed pointless.

DONALD RUMSFELD, DEFENSE SECRETARY: You can hit their terrorist training camps over and over and over and expend millions of dollars in U.S. weapons against targets that are dirt and tents and accomplish next to nothing.

MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We were mostly accused of over reacting not under reacting and I believe we reacted appropriately and, as I said earlier, we would have acted more had we had actionable intelligence.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

COSTELLO: White House officials are challenging Richard Clarke's credibility on several fronts. They've now released a copy of the letter Clarke wrote when he resigned as counter-terrorism chief in January of
2003. The letter makes no mention of the concerns Clarke writes about in his book. The letter also includes positive comments about President Bush.

Here are some excerpts. I'm going to read one to you. "It has been an enormous privilege," Clarke says, "to serve you these last 24 months. I will always remember the courage, determination, calm and leadership you demonstrated on September 11. I will also have fond memories of our briefings for you on cyber
security and the intuitive understanding of its importance that you showed."
That's from Richard Clarke to President Bush.

Tonight, after his testimony, Richard Clarke will speak with Larry King. You can watch that on CNN at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

And remember, you can follow our live hourly coverage of today's hearing. That will start at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. That's on the 9/11 Commission hearing. That's what I'm talking about there.
Israel and Hamas staring down each other this morning. Israel says it's actively targeting Hamas
leadership. And there's a new man at the top of Hamas, Abdel Aziz Rantisi. He says he will follow the same
path as his predecessor.
Live now to Gaza City and our Brent Sadler -- hello, Brent. BRENT SADLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello.
Good morning, Carol.

Continuing military activity in southern Gaza. In the early hours of this morning, Israeli tanks led an incursion against the Khan Younis refugee camp. This after Palestinian militants had planted -- or, rather, attempted to plant a bomb in a Jewish settlement. Dozens of Palestinian homes destroyed.

In the wider regional context, a flare-up in violence across the border between Lebanon and northern Israel. Israeli air strikes against Hezbollah Monday, soon after the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, followed by another strike against pmts from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine general command, who fired, reportedly, mortars against Israeli settlements in northern Israel, provoking another Israeli air strike.

Now, on the Israeli staff side, continuing anxiety about the possibility of more suicide bombings against Israeli targets. In an opinion poll published in a top Israeli newspaper, some 60 percent of Israelis say they supported Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to go ahead with targeted assassinations. But at least 80

Page 20 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
percent of Israelis, it's reported, understand that this may lead to an escalate in violence with Hamas, causing, perhaps, more suicide bombings against Israeli targets.

Now, as far as the new leadership of Hamas is concerned, there has been a smooth transition of power. Abdel Aziz Rantisi has risen to the top here in Gaza after an election. He is a very able lieutenant of the assassinated leadership, Ahmed Yassin. In fact, he is a hardliner among a very hard-line, militant group.

Rantisi has been a very visible and popular figure here in Gaza and abroad and, in fact, he was the subject of an attempted assassination against him last June, when he escaped an Israeli missile strike, a man who knows that once again he must be in Israeli gun sights -- Carol.
COSTELLO: Brent Sadler reporting live from Gaza City this morning.
The Pledge of Allegiance begins our look at some of the news across America.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments today in the case of a California man who successfully sued to get the Pledge of Allegiance ruled unconstitutional. He objects to the phrase "under god." Only eight of the justices will hear the arguments. Justice Scalia has recused himself because he has already spoken out in favor of the Pledge.

No pain, no gain -- a 37-year-old New York man is suing Crunch Fitness for more than $1 million. He says their workout nearly killed him. The suit alleges that three days after the first session he was hospitalized with a kidney condition caused by extreme exertion. Crunch Fitness calls the man's claims highly suspect.

Today, off the coast of South Carolina, scientists will take another crack at freeing a tangled whale. The whale was discovered last week caught in fishing lines. Experts say if it isn't freed soon, the 34-foot endangered whale will surely die.
To the forecast center now to say good morning to Chad -- good morning. CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Carol.
They should have pleasant weather for that out there, too. You really don't want seas 16, 20 feet high when you're trying to -- when you're in an eight foot rubber boat trying to get this off the whale. So they should have pretty pleasant weather out there.
(WEATHER REPORT)
COSTELLO: All right, thank you, Chad. MYERS: You're welcome.
COSTELLO: Still to come, pain at the pump. Find out how much gas prices are going to go up before they go down. Yes, they're going to rise even higher.

If you have insurance and you go to the hospital, you still may think your bill is too high. But if you don't have insurance, you may feel like you're the victim of price gouging.
CNN's Peter Viles has more for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ed and Dianna Jellison are still paying the price for a trip to the hospital two years ago. Suffering from encephalitis, a viral infection, Ed was hospitalized 17 days.

JELLISON: My whole world had been turned completely upside down. We lost our business. My husband wasn't going to be the same again. Everything had changed.

VILES: They paid $30,000 in doctor's bills, but then another bill came from Florida Hospital, $116,000. The Jellisons had no health insurance. If they did, the insurance company would have been charged a fraction of that amount.
JELLISON: It makes me very mad, very mad.

VILES: But that's the way hospital billing works. List prices are wildly inflated, but insurance companies don't pay those high prices. Only the uninsured do.

K.B. FORBES, WWW.CONSEJOHELP.ORG: It is outrageous that they price-gouge a working-class, middle-class family here in the United States. It's all about greed. All they wanted to do was suck out the hard-earned assets of this family.
VILES: These are cases K.B. Forbes has analyzed. An appendectomy, the bill to Medicare would be
$10,000, to an insurance company, $12,000, but if you are uninsured, $29,000. A broken leg cost Medicare
$4,800. It costs an insurance company $5,400. Cost if you have no insurance, $15,000.
Still, the hospital industry says it loses money treating the uninsured.

CARMELA COYLE, AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION: We have 44 million Americans who have no health insurance coverage at all. And while they come to America's hospital emergency departments and are able to receive care, there is no payment that's ultimately received for many of those patients.

VILES: The Bush administration's point man on this, Tommy Thompson, is urging hospitals to offer discounts to the uninsured and some hospitals are doing so.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

COSTELLO: With more middle class Americans losing their coverage, health insurers have taken an aggressive approach to marketing to the uninsured. That story when our series resumes tomorrow on DAYBREAK.

Bill Gates waits in Brussels today. The European Commission announces its decision on  Microsoft's alleged breaches of E.U.  competition law. Microsoft could face fines of up to $650 million.

Live to Belgium. Actually, on the phone, our Jim Boulden on just what this means to  Microsoft's Windows program -- what does it mean, Jim?
JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, hi, Carol.

What it means is that  Microsoft is going to have to offer two operating systems -- one without Media Player, one with Media Player. The reason is is the  European Commission feels that  Microsoft uses its dominance in the operating system, X.P., by putting Media Player on there for free. And then when someone buys a computer from a store, they simply just go to Media Player and don't use Apple's Quick Time or don't use RealNetwork's RealPlayer. And those two have asked the  European Commission to investigate.

For five years, the investigation has gone on. And the European Union says that  Microsoft has been using its dominance in the operating system to  abuse its power in other areas.



Page 22 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So we should be hearing in about an hour about that $600 million  fine, which Microsoft says is far too much, and we should be hearing more about the RealPlayer.
COSTELLO: That is an incredibly hefty  fine. You know, something similar took place here in the United
States and, you know, it dwindled down to really  Microsoft not having to do very much.
Might that happen in Europe, too?

BOULDEN: Well, there's two issues there. One is that you're absolutely right,  Microsoft's competitors felt that Department of Justice did not do its job. It did not force  Microsoft to level the playing field. So they came here to Europe to ask it to do the same thing.

We're going to hear whether or not the European Union expects  Microsoft to behave differently worldwide or only in Europe. And  Microsoft says the European Union should only tell it what to do in Europe. But the European Union is looking for a worldwide remedy and so is  Microsoft's competitors.

As far as the  fine goes, it's double what  Microsoft says they thought it would be.  Microsoft says that's completely unfair because they did not know they were breaking European law.
COSTELLO: Well, we'll see what happens.
Jim Boulden live from Belgium, on the phone with DAYBREAK this morning. Coming up next on DAYBREAK...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's nothing you can do, really. You've just got to pay. (END VIDEO CLIP)
COSTELLO: Oh, ain't that the truth? Feeling the pinch at the pump? Is there any relief in sight? No. We'll tell you why.
Up, up and away, a high flying fanatic sets the record straight. This is DAYBREAK for Wednesday.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
COSTELLO: Time now to reach new heights in our DAYBREAK Eye- Opener.

A British man in Colorado says he set a new world record after reaching 42,000 feet in his hot air balloon. That would be nearly eight miles high. Hempleman-Adams made the climb in an open air wicker basket and says the temperature reached 75 degrees below zero at the highest altitude.

In the meantime, the FAA is investigating the flight and actually may charge him with driving his balloon without a license into restricted air space.

Holy mackerel -- I mean, buffalo head. It took a Wisconsin man about 45 minutes to pull in this monster of a fish. It's a large mouthed buffalo head fish, to be exact. The whopper weighed in at 73 pounds, one ounce, which breaks the world record by more than three pounds. Ooh, that's a big fish.

If you enjoyed playing dodge ball as a kid, you are not alone. Adult dodge ball leagues like this one in Portland, Oregon have begun springing up all over the country. Included in the resurgence is a Hollywood dodge ball movie starring Ben Stiller. It hits theaters in June.

Wasn't that a cool game in school, where people just heaved the ball at the less popular kids as hard as they could?
MYERS: I believe that was the point. COSTELLO: That is so wrong. MYERS: Well, I...
COSTELLO: It's just so wrong.

MYERS: I believe that's how it went. And then if you caught the ball and somebody else got to come back in. That was progressive dodge ball.

Page 23 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
COSTELLO: Oh, thanks for explaining that, Chad.
MYERS: Sure. I remember -- that was only 41 years ago. I remember it vividly. Good morning, Carol.
(WEATHER REPORT) COSTELLO: Thank you, Chad. MYERS: You're welcome.
COSTELLO: We're used to expecting gas prices to go up by Memorial Day. But, ouch, they are already here. Per gallon prices nationwide have reached a record high, almost $1.74. The previous record was set in August of last summer, when the price was almost $1.74 per gallon.
Our Jen Rogers has more on the pump shock. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JEN ROGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's a record few Americans will cheer, gasoline prices peaking at a new all time high Tuesday, the nationwide average nearly $1.74 per gallon.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's nothing you can do, really. You just got to pay.

ROGERS: And paying can be painful from coast to coast. AAA reports the highest prices are in California, coming in at $2.14 a gallon. Move east and it doesn't get much better, Arizona $1.91, New York $1.86, Florida $1.77.

ROBERT SINCLAIR, AAA: Usually at this time of year record low prices and we usually don't see higher prices until the Memorial Day weekend which signals the beginning of the summer driving season. The fact that this is happening now is a big deal because really prices should be much lower.

ROGERS: In fact, the government isn't predicting relief around the corner, forecasting gas prices will jump another ten cents a gallon this spring. The problem a lesson in Economics 101, high demand here in the U.S. and booming China facing off against tight supply thanks to OPEC and older refineries struggling with capacity.

Add to the costly mix a seasonal slowdown from refiners shifting to special blends of cleaner burning gas that doesn't cause as much air pollution during the hot summer months.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a real big hassle, really big hassle.

ROGERS: Even with pump prices at an all time high, on relative terms adjusted for inflation $1.74 is cheap. In 1980, gas cost more than $2.50 in 2004 dollars.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

COSTELLO: And we will talk more about these record prices in the next hour of DAYBREAK with AAA's Montill Williams. He will join us to talk about why and how much higher gas prices will go when we really start driving into the summer.
In the next half hour of DAYBREAK... (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: ... the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP)
COSTELLO: "Under god" under fire -- the Supreme Court hears from a man who wants to ban the words
"under god" from the Pledge of Allegiance.

And violence erupts west of Baghdad as Iraqis count down the transfer of power. We'll have a live report for you out of Baghdad straight ahead.

And are you confused about carbs? What's a good carb, what's a bad carb? Dr. Sanjay Gupta to the rescue, straight ahead.

CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning to you. Welcome to the second half hour of DAYBREAK. It is Wednesday, March 24. From the CNN Global Headquarters in Atlanta, I'm Carol Costello. Thank you for waking up with us.

Former White House terrorism adviser Richard Clarke appears before the 9/11 Commission today. Clarke's new book is highly critical of President Bush's leadership.

TD
Kobe Bryant will face his accuser today. She testifies in a closed preliminary hearing. The judge is trying to decide if the woman's sexual history is relevant in the rape case against Bryant.
More than a dozen world leaders are in Madrid this morning. They will attend a memorial service for the
190 people killed in the terror attacks in Spain. The service gets under way in just about 30 minutes.

And today marks the fifth anniversary of NATO's bombing campaign in Kosovo. It was started to stop the violence against ethnic Albanians in Serbia. At least 30 people have been killed in renewed clashes between the groups.
We update our 'Top Stories' every 15 minutes. The next update comes your way at 5:45 Eastern.

The clock is ticking. The scheduled handover of control to Iraq by the U.S.-led coalition is 100 days away, June 30.
Our Jim Clancy live in Baghdad now to tell us more. Jim, what's going on there today?
JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Carol, that's right, 100 days from now the Iraqis will have sovereignty, once again, over their country. And the U.S. administrator, the head of the coalition provisional authority, Ambassador Paul Bremer, is going to be talking with local officials, giving a speech, a major speech. And let's be clear here, this is a speech that's going to be aimed not just at these local officials, but a much broader audience both inside Iraq and outside.

In it the ambassador is not only going to recount what has been accomplished, but he is going to lay out the things that Iraqis, the coalition members and others in the international community, have to do in the coming 100 days to make this work. It's going to be an important speech. Already there is some acknowledgements that in terms of security the Iraqis may not quite be ready. But he says the U.S. military is still going to be standing by to assist in that job. And the situation will look pretty much the same as it
does on the -- on June the 29th or June the 30th as it will on July the 1st. So that's the situation here. We're expecting that speech about three hours from now.

Talking about security, let's look at the situation in Fallujah. Two U.S. Marines reported wounded, a roadside bomb exploded and they returned fire. There are reports that many Iraqis were killed. One report says as many as six, others are saying only two were killed, others were wounded. The details of that, obviously, still being sorted out. Just more evidence of the pressure that the U.S. military is under here as it continues. So we're continuing to follow that.

And of course looking for the political developments that are going to be coming from the U.S. ambassador just a little bit later from now -- Carol.

COSTELLO: Busy day for you. Jim Clancy live from Baghdad.
In the ever-escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the new leader of Hamas is a marked man, because
Israel vows to kill the entire Hamas leadership.

Our senior international editor David Clinch joins us now with what this may mean for the region and even the world.
DAVID CLINCH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL EDITOR: Hey, Carol.

Yes, well, Hamas has a new leader, at least in Gaza, for the temporarily or interim leader, although he may very well end up being the long-term leader, if he has a long term. This man Rantisi is at least as radical as Sheikh Yassin, the man Israel killed. And Israel has made it absolutely clear, as you say, that he is a marked man.

We are interested in talking to Rantisi to find out exactly what it is that he is going to do with this borrowed time that Israel is giving him. Of course the danger inherent in that, if we sit down to interview him, we expose ourselves to the danger that he could be hit by the Israelis at any time. These are real questions that we have to ask ourselves when we go about our business in Gaza, we're talking to these Hamas leaders, they are targets. That's made absolutely clear by Israel. We have to take that into account.

COSTELLO: Well, and some of the interesting things you may get out of this man. I mean Hamas is now threatening the United States.

CLINCH: Right. We looked into that yesterday. And interestingly, after we spoke about that yesterday morning, the U.S. having sort of mentioned that they were taking it seriously the day before, went beyond that and issued a specific statement yesterday saying that all Americans should leave Gaza. Now I can't imagine there are too many Americans in Gaza, but there are presumably some. Those people have been warned. And also beyond that, U.S. targets throughout the region taking that very seriously. We have had a report today from the United Arab Emirates that the U.S. embassy there has shut down, at least
temporarily. Not clear whether that's specifically related to that Hamas threat. Of course the fear on that is that whether Hamas does anything or not, that other terrorist organizations may take Yassin's killing as an incentive or an inspiration for attacks on U.S. targets anywhere.
COSTELLO: Well there were protests even inside Iraq over Yassin's killing yesterday.

CLINCH: Right, which turned violent. And there -- we have seen and heard of demonstrations in Bahrain and elsewhere today which have turned violent. Again, the problem now emerging for the U.S. is that the distinction between what Israel does and what the U.S. does is being eliminated for many people on the ground there. They see Israel and the U.S. as the same.
COSTELLO: Well I think it's been that way for quite some time. CLINCH: Yes, and probably not to change in the near future.
A couple of other stories we're looking at today, one in Mexico. We've got a few British cave explorers. They are called spelunkers I believe is the technical term for these people. It's a British military expedition caught in some caves in Mexico. We have sent a correspondent down from Mexico City to look into this. Just what we are hearing is that they are deep inside the caves and that floodwaters have risen so high that they can't get out.
COSTELLO: Well didn't I hear somewhere that they don't want to be rescued?

CLINCH: Well apparently the first communication from them was you know this happens all the time in caves, not that big of a deal, we'll get out eventually when the water comes down. But the rain -- I mean weather factors in here. It's apparently pouring with rain. So they may change their attitude over the next few hours if the rain keeps -- the water keeps getting higher.

COSTELLO: And they are scientists. I mean they are there -- aren't they, not just spelunkers, but aren't they scientists as well?

CLINCH: They are -- they are British military scientists. It's not clear exactly what they were doing there, but presumably this is what they do for a living or for their pastime. Although one thing is still under question whether they had official permission to be in these caves at this time. So we're looking into that as well.
COSTELLO: OK. Anything else?
CLINCH: Well a few other things. We're just hearing  Microsoft is up against a big  fine by the European
Union today.
Page 27 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
COSTELLO: Six hundred fourteen million dollars. CLINCH: Six hundred fourteen million dollars, apparently, is the fine. They say they will --  Microsoft say they will appeal. This is for them bunching a whole thing -- a bunch of Microsoft things together. EU says they can't do that, big  fine.
COSTELLO: OK. David Clinch, many thanks to you. CLINCH: OK.
COSTELLO: Here is a rundown of the witnesses at today's 9/11 Commission hearing, just so you know. George Tenet, CIA chief under both the Clinton and Bush administrations, will kick off the testimony. He will be followed by Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and then we'll hear from former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke. Finally, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage will testify
before the committee. We will have live hourly coverage of today's commission hearing starting at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Are the words "under God" constitutional -- unconstitutional in the Pledge of Allegiance? That is the issue before the Supreme Court today.
Bob Franken has more for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BOB FRANKEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's part of the pledge school children obediently recite every day.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One nation under God.
FRANKEN: While few ponder the significance of the slogan in God we trust on their money, is this... UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Under God, indivisible.
FRANKEN: ... simple ceremony, or as an appeals court held, an unconstitutional endorsement of religion? MICHAEL NEWDOW, ATHEIST: That old Pledge of Allegiance.
FRANKEN: Michael Newdow is an avowed atheist, who, in an usual move, is being allowed to argue his case himself that the words "under God" violate his and his daughter's First Amendment rights to be free from religion.

NEWDOW: As I have the right to be able to have my child in public school without her being inculcated with religious belief. You know this is supposed to be a public school. It's supposed to be religion free.

FRANKEN: The case coming so soon after 9/11 created a political uproar. One friend of the court brief calls "under God," inserted during the 1950s Cold War, "part of an American tapestry of patriotic and historical references." JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Faith and America have a causal connection. There is a relationship between what our founding fathers thought about the values of human dignity and where that worth derives from different than any other country.
FRANKEN: Ann, the child's mother, says she has no objections to her daughter saying "under God."

(on camera): In addition, it is not clear the father, Newdow, had custody when he filed the lawsuit. So the key question might be does he have the right to bring the case at all?
Bob Franken, CNN, the Supreme Court. (END VIDEOTAPE)
COSTELLO: Michael Newdow will be a guest on CNN's "PAULA ZAHN NOW." That airs tonight at 8:00
Eastern.
Let's head to the Forecast Center and check in with Chad right now. Good morning -- Chad.
CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, Carol. (WEATHER REPORT)
COSTELLO: I'm just checking out  Microsoft, because the verdict just came down in Brussels. You know we've been talking about that. We were talking about that earlier this morning.
Page 28 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Well the European Union has declared  Microsoft guilty of abusing its near monopoly with a  fine of up to
$613 million. Microsoft, I believe, has two months to file a promised appeal and to be sure it will. And
under this order that the -- under the EU's order, I should say,  Microsoft will be allowed to continue selling
a version of Windows with its media player software installed. But it must refrain from any commercial,
technological or contractual terms that would make the stripped down version of Windows less attractive or
performing. It says  Microsoft has a monopoly on stuff out there, so the European Union has declared
Microsoft guilty and could be  fined up to $613 million.
We'll have more from Jim Boulden in Brussels a little later on DAYBREAK.

Now to news that could affect your health. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of the controversial painkiller Oxycontin. That means cancer patients and others suffering from painful illnesses will be able to pay much less for the drug. The narcotic can be lethal if chewed, snorted or injected.

Asthma suffers beware, researchers have found that an ingredient used in inhalers may counteract the benefits of other asthma drugs. Experts say that may explain why some patients who use the inhalers actually get worse over time.

And you know you are never too old to start eating right. A study in mice shows that a low calorie diet can help increase life span, regardless of when the dietary change takes place.
OK, we have Jim Boulden live from Brussels on the  Microsoft (UNINTELLIGIBLE). And, Jim, this probably has  Microsoft reeling?
JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It's not a surprise, though. The commission had to meet this morning and formalize this decision. The decision has been known for some time.  Microsoft has already said that it will appeal.

Now the important thing here is  Microsoft has two months to look at the decision. We're told it runs in hundreds and hundreds of pages. Two months from now it will then come back with its decision on what it wants to do and tell the -- tell the commission that. And then the appeals process begins. The European Court of Justice will hear about this. Could take up to a year before a judge hears this.

The key is does Microsoft have to stop doing these practices during the appeal? If it does not, then nothing changes. Microsoft will continue to bundle its media player in its operating system and it won't have to pay the fine. Some people say that could take three to five years for a final decision.

If Microsoft is told to stop doing this, then it will have to start to offer an operating system without media player. And that's because RealNetworks and Apple want people to have more choice when it comes to how to download music on a PC, how to listen to clips and one day to take down films and to watch films over their PC -- Carol.

COSTELLO: Again, a similar thing happened to  Microsoft here in the United States.  Microsoft appealed and was successful. What do you think might happen on the appeal in Europe?

BOULDEN: Well we talked to the RealNetworks lawyer yesterday. Of course RealNetworks brought this case to the European Commission. And he says that because it was unanimous within  European            Commission, because it's such a strong worded decision coming from the European Union to say that Microsoft is abusing its dominance with its operating system, he felt -- of course he said as he felt that no judge would overturn that ruling. However, the  European Commission has had many of its decisions overturned.

Mario Monti, the outgoing  Competition Commissioner, he is the one who stopped, after all, General Electric from merging with Honeywell. Some of his decisions have been overturned in the courts. There have been some very high profile European cases. So of course  Microsoft would not appeal if they did not think that they could get this lowered.

But it's because the Department of Justice's decision with  Microsoft in or in 2001 that many of these cases are now coming to Europe. They feel that the U.S. has not -- the competitors of  Microsoft feel the U.S. has not stopped  Microsoft from abusing its position, so therefore, it's come to Europe hoping for a stronger ruling, which it seems to have gotten today.
COSTELLO: Seems so, and that  fine could be up to $613 million to  Microsoft. Jim Boulden, live from
Brussels this morning, many thanks to you.
We'll be back with much more on DAYBREAK. You stay right there.

COSTELLO: It is now 5:47 Eastern Time, time to take a quick look at the 'Top Stories.'

Former White House terrorism adviser Richard Clarke testifies before the 9/11 Commission today. His new book blasts President Bush's leadership in fighting terrorism.

A government report says the Medicare system will go broke in the year 2019 if no changes are made to the current system. That's 11 years sooner than previously thought.

And we now know why legendary singer Aretha Franklin is in the hospital. Her doctor says she had an allergic reaction to antibiotics, but she is getting better. The soul singer turns 62 tomorrow.
We update our 'Top Stories' every 15 minutes. The next update comes your way at 6:00 Eastern.

It seems everywhere you look food has gone low carb. From fast food to beer, companies are touting their reduced carb alternatives.
But as CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports, not all carbs are bad. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Low carb doesn't mean good carb nor does it mean you are going to lose weight.

DR. STOART TRAGER, ATKINS PHYSICIANS COUNCIL: Clearly good carbohydrates are the ones most slowly digested, the vegetables that are full of .

GUPTA: No surprise, good carbs are in fruit and vegetables. They might be high in sugar but worth it, say low carb supporters because they are packed with nutrients. As far as bad carbs, yes, that piece of white bread has more bad carbs than wheat bread, as do most processed foods. So, what makes it so bad?

See, it is not so much the carbs or even the sugar but insulin which is the problem. Eat more than your body needs and your sugar goings up and dries up your insulin, storing those calories into fat. No question we are a low carb crazy country right now, and everyone it seems everyone is going on a high protein diet. But the real reason they work might be because they are eating fewer calories. Bottom line, both diets, low carbs or not probably have the same success rates. What counts in the end is calories. It might just be that high fat, high protein make you full quicker and you eat less. Eating less and losing more. Hmm, go figure.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)
COSTELLO: Nothing like common sense, is there?

We have got stories making 'Front Page' news from across the country straight ahead. And gas prices are on the move and the upward trend could put you in an even -- put you at an even bigger pinch at the pump. In the next hour of DAYBREAK, we'll talk with Montel Williams from the AAA to tell us why gas prices are going so high.

But first, the Princess of Pop puts in a stellar performance to a sold out crowd down south. We'll give you a peek. You stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

COSTELLO: Time to take a look at papers across America. And boy, we have some good ones this morning -- Chad.
MYERS: All right. COSTELLO: You ready? MYERS: I am ready.
COSTELLO: This is from "The Annistan Star" out of Alabama. So 18,000 neighbors get together to sue a company for poisoning their property and affecting their health, they win a $300 million settlement.
MYERS: Wow!
COSTELLO: And guess what? Each neighbor gets $7,000. How much do the lawyers get apiece?
Page 30 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MYERS: Ouch!

COSTELLO: Four million. So the people whose health was affected get $4,000, but each lawyer gets $4 million.
MYERS: Four million. COSTELLO: Neighbors are mad.
MYERS: I suppose. I can understand that.

COSTELLO: This is -- yes. This is from the Philadelphia "Daily News." You see O.T. overload. Apparently the cash strapped city of Philadelphia is paying a lot of overtime.
MYERS: Sure.

COSTELLO: They are called the overtime kings. Listen to this. Most of them are police officers, sheriff's deputies and corrections officers. A corrections officer, John Thahu (ph), makes $106,210 a year. Only
$38,000 of that is his base salary.
MYERS: Wow!

COSTELLO: He has made $68,000 in overtime. He's the guy on the cover you see there. He's the overtime king. I think there is a problem in Philadelphia.
MYERS: Need to hire some people. COSTELLO: Yes, exactly or put...
MYERS: Hello, what part of that don't I understand?
COSTELLO: They must be making double and triple time overtime, though. Who knows? Crystal Beach, this is from "The Enterprise," "The Beaumont Enterprise" out of Texas. MYERS: Yes.
COSTELLO: Have you ever been to Crystal Beach -- Chad?

MYERS: I was watching the local news here, and the traffic in Atlanta yesterday to get down here to this concert was unbelievable.

COSTELLO: Well you know our producer, our  fine producers and writers come in overnight. So they got caught in the traffic you are talking about. And they saw Britney's fans, who actually are still 13 years old, although they dress like they are 26. So Britney still popular.

#gutsparent {display: none;} BRUSSELS--The European Union on Wednesday issued its ruling in the long-running case against Microsoft, fining the American software giant $613 million, the heaviest punishment in any European competition case to date.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti ruled that  Microsoft had failed to provide to rivals information that they needed to compete fairly in the market for server software and that the company has been offering Windows on the condition that it come bundled with Windows Media Player, stifling competition.

TD
Microsoft now has 120 days to provide the information that rival server makers need to compete fairly, and it must continue to update this information in the future, Monti said. It also has 90 days to provide a version of Windows without Media Player, although it can also continue to provide a version that includes the
media software.

In the EU's judgment,  Microsoft must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of "rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing. In particular, it must not give PC manufacturers a discount conditional on their buying Windows together with the Windows Media player."

At a Brussels press conference following the release of the decision, Monti said he is sure that the antitrust ruling against Microsoft will stand up to any appeal in the European courts and that it will act as an effective deterrent.
"Of course, I'm confident we have produced a decision that will stand before any appeal," Monti said. "As for future deterrent, I believe there may be an indirect aspect...to the extent that the decision by the
European Commission may be used in the context of private actions against the company," he said. The
remedies and the legal precedent were more important than the level of the  fine, he added.

Microsoft reiterated its plan to appeal the decision. "We will go forward and seek legal review of this decision in the European Court of First Instance," Brad Smith,  Microsoft general counsel, said in a conference call, referring to the European Union's second highest court.
Long road ahead

He said the company would request that implementation of some parts of the commission's decision be suspended--specifically the EU's demand that the software giant produce a second version of the Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player.

"We will ask for that and probably other parts of the remedies to be suspended," he said. He added that he expected "four or five years" of litigation ahead.

Microsoft attempted to settle the case, but talks ended last week after both sides failed to reach an agreement on how to govern  Microsoft's future business practices.  Microsoft had offered to modify Windows to place copies of competing media player software on PC hard drives during the installation,

Page 33 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
instead of selling a version of Windows without Media Player, as the EU ultimately ordered the company to do.

Smith played down the impact of the EU decision on the next major update of  Microsoft's flagship operating system, which is code-named Longhorn.

"We have had our lawyers working with the product development teams...Based on the work that we have done so far...it is our sense that the kinds of innovations that we have planned for Longhorn are innovations that pass muster under EU law as well as the law elsewhere in the world," he added.

Despite the intense media scrutiny of the five-year investigation, when the verdict came it was with more of a whimper than a bang. On Tuesday,  European Commission representatives were warning that they would "need a bigger room" to accommodate all the world's press for Monti's statement. But it was very much business as usual Wednesday at the commission's headquarters in Brussels. There were even a few empty seats at the press conference.
Some observers welcomed the ruling, saying it would provide clarity in a complex market.

"One benefit of the case going to court is that we will get a lot more information, so both  Microsoft and others will know what sorts of activities are illegal in Europe," said Nic Francis, a consultant with Europe Economics, a London-based consultancy.
Others expressed surprise at the severity of the  fine in a case that turns on some tricky legal arguments. "This is not a classic parallel trade infringement or cartel case--it's unusual. On the server issue, there's
compulsory licensing to a competitor of intellectual property. Generally these cases are borderline," said
Marc Hansen, an attorney with Latham & Watkins in Brussels. "On the Media Player, it's a really novel
bundling issue, and that is one of the more unresolved areas of law. So suddenly there's a 497 million euro
fine for something that no one really knew was illegal?"
Reaction across the industry

Industry organizations representing both sides of the case were quick to issue statements Wednesday morning.

The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group representing  Microsoft's rivals, praised the EU's actions. "The  European Commission's decision today is another confirmation of Microsoft's anticompetitive and illegal business tactics," CCIA President Ed Black said in a statement.

"The decision is also a demonstration of a strongly committed  competition authority willing to enforce antitrust laws against Microsoft," Black added. "The issues outlined today will prevent  Microsoft from controlling the platform for the delivery and subsequent control over digital content. This is becoming even more important as computers and home entertainment converge."

Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a pro-Microsoft group, denounced the ruling, saying it will lead to higher software prices for consumers. "The European Commission may be trying to punish  Microsoft, but its proposals reserve their harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies. The message from today's decision is forget innovating, start litigating and if you fail in America, try Europe," Zuck said in a statement.

Even the U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement that was bitterly critical of the EU's approach, saying that its own settlement with Microsoft had already led to "substantial changes to  Microsoft's business practices." Forcing Microsoft to remove the Media Player from Windows threatened to distort competition, the agency said.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing ‘code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences," R. Hewitt Pate, the assistant attorney general for  antitrust, said in the statement. "Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by
'dominant' companies. A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

The 5-year-old case stems from a complaint issued by Sun Microsystems that  Microsoft would not disclose technical interfaces to Windows, meaning that Sun was unable to develop products that communicate properly with Windows PCs.

Sun on Wednesday praised the EU's actions, but noted that  Microsoft was able to stretch the process out for five years, boosting its market share in the workgroup server market from 20 percent to 70 percent.


Page 34 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The result is pretty close to exactly what we were hoping to achieve, which is  competition on the merits for workgroup servers," Sun vice president of legal affairs Lee Patch told CNET News.com. "We were not anticipating at the time that it would take this long to achieve this."

Although a negotiated settlement could have taken effect immediately, Patch said it was important to have a ruling that prevented  Microsoft from making similar abuses in the future. Patch praised the EU decision for requiring Microsoft to keep its operating system open to rivals: "Microsoft's obligation for disclosure is one which must be updated for each new product release."

Novell, which lost out to  Microsoft in the 1990s in the server operating system market and is now pursuing a strategy based on the Linux operating system, supported the European Union's actions.

"Novell believes that the commission's findings, decision and remedies will improve  competition, stimulate innovation and benefit consumers of information technology services and solutions," Waltham,
Mass.-based Novell said in a statement Wednesday.

RealNetworks, maker of a rival to Media Player, said it welcomed the decision, but was eager to see exactly how the dual-version Windows order would be enforced. The initial summary said that  Microsoft could not make the "unbundled" version of Windows less attractive than the traditional version, but did not contain details.

"The Commission today unequivocally ruled that a central part of  Microsoft's business model is illegal under clearly established principles of European law that are consistent with U.S.  antitrust law," said RealNetworks deputy general counsel Dave Stewart. "We believe that that's good for consumers and competition."
What comes next

The next legal step that  Microsoft is likely to take is to apply for an annulment of the decision, which is a relatively long procedure that may take several years, involving two written submissions from Microsoft, two from the commission, and other submissions from competitors and supporters of Microsoft. This process would end with an oral hearing and a judgment.

Microsoft can also apply for interim measures, effectively requesting suspension of the measure on the grounds that it will cause irreparable damage. This process would take a few weeks.

However, attorneys who specialize in  antitrust issues say Microsoft will face great difficulty in convincing the Court of First Instance to grant a stay, or suspension, of the measure.

"Where is the irreparable harm?" said an attorney, who formerly served as a high-ranking  antitrust official with the  European Commission. "It's not as if  Microsoft has to withdraw any product from the market...Also, it will be difficult for  Microsoft to argue that the matter is urgent because of Longhorn...which after all is still at least two years away."

Antitrust attorneys also note  Microsoft may face a difficult time convincing the court to delay the implementation of Monti's ruling beyond the three months the regulator has outlined.

"Although a timing issue would be in less conflict with the commission's decision,  Microsoft would still have make a powerful case to show that three months would not be sufficient," said another  antitrust attorney, who also previously served in a senior post with the  European Commission.

Monti's ruling on the specific question of the Windows Media Player and  Microsoft's server software business raises the larger issue of future  competition clashes with the commission. The legal issue here is whether it is possible to frame a ruling that will seem fair to  Microsoft and also address the commission's concern that the company will not break  competition rules in the future.

The commission ended its statement by saying that it "believes the remedies will bring the  antitrust violations to an end, that they are proportionate, and that they establish clear principles for the future conduct of the company."

An independent trustee will be appointed to monitor compliance with the ruling, according to the statement, to see "that  Microsoft's interface disclosures are complete and accurate, and that the two versions of Windows are equivalent in terms of performance."

After a four-year  antitrust probe, Microsoft signs a consent decree with the Justice Department, agreeing that its OS licenses will not contain conditions that apply to its other software. A similar agreement is also struck with the  European Commission, giving it the right to monitor  Microsoft's compliance for
six-and-a-half years.
Oct. 20, 1997

The DOJ files a petition, alleging the software maker violated the 1994 agreement by bundling Internet Explorer in Windows 95 and preventing computer makers from removing IE's functionality from the operating system.  Microsoft confirms that the  European Commission has also begun a probe into a complaint about its licensing practices.
1998
The European Commission expands its investigation of  Microsoft, after Sun Microsystems complains
that its rival would not disclose technical interfaces to Windows NT. In 2002, the commission further widens
its Microsoft investigation to look at how streaming media technology has been integrated into Windows.

A group of state attorneys general and the DOJ file their historic  antitrust cases against Microsoft. Both seek permanent injunctions against  Microsoft's inclusion of its browser software in Windows. A federal judge later consolidates the cases.
Oct. 19, 1998

The DOJ and 19 states square off in court with  Microsoft, as the landmark  antitrust trial begins. The DOJ alleges Microsoft squashed Netscape's market-leading browser, in part through its Windows monopoly and exclusive contracts that forced computer makers to favor IE.
April 3, 2000

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issues a ruling. He determines that "Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market."
June 7, 2000

Jackson orders Microsoft broken into two separate companies--one for OSes, the other for applications. That judgment is suspended, pending an appeal.
June 28, 2001

A U.S. Court of Appeals throws out the order to break up  Microsoft. But it also rules Microsoft used its monopoly powers to retain its OS monopoly and asks the lower court to revisit the issue of Microsoft tying its products, such as the browser, to its OS.
Sept. 6, 2001

The DOJ, now under the Bush administration, says it will drop its efforts to break  Microsoft in two and halt its pursuit of the claim that  Microsoft illegally integrated its browser with Windows 95 and 98.
Nov. 2, 2001

Microsoft, the DOJ and nine states reach a settlement under which  Microsoft must share information on its OS to let rivals better develop interoperable software. Nine other states and the District of Columbia consider pursuing their lawsuits separately.
Nov. 1, 2002
A U.S. District Court judge approves the proposed settlement. Court sanctions are set to last five years. Nov. 29, 2002
Massachusetts says it will contest the federal settlement. Aug. 6, 2003
European antitrust regulators announce a preliminary decision to require  Microsoft to provide greater technical information to its server competitors and to reduce the ties between its OS and Media Player.

Wednesday's ruling from the  European Commission cleared up some uncertainty about the punishment that will be levied on Microsoft for its alleged anticompetitive behavior in Europe. But considering the size of the  fine and potential disruption to the company--and the PC market as a whole--the details were surprisingly sparse.

As of late Wednesday, the  European Commission had issued only a summary of its decision. The result is that there may be different interpretations of how the
decision will affect  Microsoft, consumers and competitors. For example:

TD
Q: If  Microsoft is eventually forced to offer a separate version of Windows without a Media Player, what can it charge compared with the version that has the Media Player?

A: In its statement, the European Union said that Microsoft "must refrain from using any commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing." In particular, the commission said that  Microsoft cannot give PC makers a discount for choosing the version with the Media Player.

Microsoft's interpretation is that it cannot charge more for the version without the Media Player, but it can charge the same for both. "They will cost exactly the same amount of money. One will do more, one will do less," Microsoft lawyer Brad Smith said. The commission did not spell out how it defined "less attractive."

What type of information regarding servers does Microsoft have to disclose, and how is that different than what the company is required to do under the U.S. consent decree?

In general,  Microsoft said, the EU order goes beyond what the company already does in the United States. In particular, the U.S. agreement deals with allowing other

Page 38 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
companies' server software to connect to PCs running
Windows.

Microsoft executives said the EU ruling also requires the company to allow rival servers to interoperate with its servers. Smith likened it to forcing a newspaper to
share its articles with a rival. The  European                   Commission stressed in its ruling that its order would not require Microsoft to share underlying source code, only the kind of hooks that would allow the servers to
talk to one another. In any case, the company said it needs to see the final ruling to know what type of information it must share.
Does the ruling apply globally or only in Europe? While Microsoft said the European Union's actions
appear to be confined to its borders, attorneys for
competitors have said the commission could
theoretically try to apply the restrictions elsewhere in the
world. The commission's statement Wednesday was not
specific about geographical reach, however. Historically,
Microsoft has tended to have one global business
practice, so there is a chance that when all is said and
done, any EU-mandated changes could be worldwide.

The server aspect also could turn out to be more of a global issue. If  Microsoft is forced to disclose information that makes it easier to connect with its servers, it is not clear how that would be limited to a geographic region.

What impact will the ruling have on future product development?

Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stated that the company is "not doing anything different than we were yesterday in terms of how we think about new design." That said, the company noted that it needs to better understand
the EU ruling to know how it might affect future projects, including Longhorn, the upcoming version of Windows that will offer better searching capabilities along with a host of other new features.  Microsoft said it already consults lawyers on its product development plans, so it is unclear whether the company will have to do anything different. The key question is whether the  European      Commission is applying a different standard to what types of features can be added to the operating system.
Could the EU decision spur other legal actions against
Microsoft?

It's not yet clear what other legal actions may develop. As in the United States, the commission's five-year scrutiny and presumably detailed findings could serve as compelling evidence in private lawsuits against Microsoft. However, because Europe's court system does not encourage consumer class-action suits in the same way that the U.S. system does, experts say this type of follow-up is unlikely.

Private lawsuits from other companies are possible. Multimedia software company RealNetworks has said that it is focusing on its U.S. lawsuit for now, but it has not ruled out a similar suit in Europe. In a press conference Wednesday,  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti specifically cited his ruling as an indirect

Page 39 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
deterrent to future  Microsoft abuses "to the extent that the decision...may be used in the context of private actions against the company."
What about the EU's other pending investigations? The commission's report gave no hint of what may be
happening in regulators' other pending investigations
into Microsoft. One of these stems at least in part from
a grievance filed by the U.S.-based Computer and
Communications Industry Association, which includes
far-reaching complaints about the XP operating system
extending Microsoft's power with new features. Other
reports have noted that the commission is investigating
Microsoft's contracts with PC makers.

HD       Ballmer:  All companies should  be allowed to innovate; Microsoft Chief Executive  Steve Ballmer vows to fight the European Commission's antitrust ruling,  arguing  that all companies, even ones with a near monopoly, have a right to improve  their products.

Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer vowed to fight the  European Commission's antitrust ruling, arguing that all companies, even ones with a near monopoly, have a right to improve their products.
Ballmer's comments follow a decision by the  European Commission earlier Wednesday, which
involved ordering Microsoft to offer a version of Windows that comes without the Windows Media Player
and to share enough of its intellectual property to enable server industry rivals to sell machines that can
effectively interoperate with Windows-based computers. The commission also imposed a record $613
million fine against the software behemoth.

TD
"There is an important principle at stake in this case: We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers," Ballmer said during a conference call with journalists. "We recognize the sort of special position our company has, but nonetheless we think we should have that ability to improve our products, subject to the appropriate guidelines."

As a result, the company said, it plans to appeal the case to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg and will also ask that court to put on hold most, if not all, of the remedies ordered by the European Commission.

Microsoft executives tried to make the case that the European ruling, if it comes to pass, will hurt consumers.

"Even if one takes away the multimedia code and, as RealNetworks has suggested, installs their player in its place, there will remain over 20 features in the Windows operating system that will not function," Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, said during the conference call. "There will remain many European Web sites that will not function properly."

Smith noted that the same competitors that sought action from the  European Commission had already tried and failed to get a similar action from U.S. courts.

"Our competitors had their day in court, and it's unfortunate that after that day came and went they simply chose to move across the Atlantic to try to have a day in another court," Smith said.

The ruling is not expected to immediately change the way  Microsoft thinks about its future products, including Longhorn, the next major revision to Windows.

"We're not doing anything different than we were yesterday in terms of how we think about new design," Ballmer said. Both he and Smith noted that Microsoft's development efforts already have been influenced by the consent decree in the U.S. v. Microsoft case.

"We've had lawyers already giving legal advice to our development teams about the development of future versions of Windows," Smith said. "That advice would change if, and only if, the  European            Commission is now saying that the law in Europe is now different than the law in the United States."

A Microsoft representative said the company would have to review the details of the ruling to see exactly how its current and future products might be affected.

Although  Microsoft and the European Union appear to be at loggerheads on the issue of future development, Ballmer indicated that there could be an opportunity to settle the case once a European court has weighed in, noting that that's what transpired in the U.S. case. Smith pointed out that there were extensive settlement talks that failed to reach a pact in 1999 but that parties were able to find middle ground within a few months after an appeals court issued its decision in the summer of 2001.

"One can never predict the future, but it would not surprise us if the path in Europe were to follow something similar to what we saw in the United States," Smith said.
Nonetheless, while Ballmer and Smith said the company remains open to settling the case,  Microsoft
signaled it is also prepared for a long litigation process.

"At the end of the day, we do believe there are important principles at stake," Smith said. "Even though the litigation process may well last four or five years, we think those are principles that are worth standing up (for) and defending."

Long arm of law reaches back far with  Microsoft The European Union case is just the latest in a lengthy line of antitrust-related battles involving the software behemoth. Some have been settled; others still hang over the company's head.
Pending cases:
Minnesota consumer class action

The case: Consumers in Minnesota are seeking up to $425 million in damages as part of a class-action lawsuit.

What's next: The case is in trial--the first such case to make it to a jury--and the proceedings are expected to last another 2 to 3 months.
Nebraska

The case: A private  antitrust claim on behalf of Windows 98 users was initially dismissed but was revived last week by the Nebraska Supreme Court.

What's next: Now that the state's high court has reinstated the case, it will be sent back to the trial court for a rehearing.
Sun Microsystems

The case: Sun filed suit in March 2002, charging  Microsoft with various antitrust and unfair competition violations, along with copyright violations. Sun initially got a fairly broad injunction against Microsoft, though an appeals court narrowed that last summer, ruling that  Microsoft need only stop distributing its own Java Virtual Machine.
What's next: The case is set to go to trial sometime next year. RealNetworks
The case: Real sued  Microsoft in December 2003 for alleged  antitrust violations, seeking damages that Real estimates could exceed $1 billion.

What's next:  Microsoft recently lost a request to have the case moved from San Jose, Calif., to Seattle, and now, the case appears to be headed to the pretrial discovery phase.
Burst.com
The case: In this 2002 suit,  Microsoft is accused of bullying customers so that they don't use
video-streaming technology from Burst.com.  Microsoft is also charged with infringing on Burst's patents.

What's next: The case is still in the pretrial discovery and motions phase. A trial date has not yet been set.
Settled cases:
Department of Justice and state attorneys general

A federal judge initially ruled in June 2000 that  Microsoft should be split in two for abusing its monopoly in the operating-system market. That order was overturned on appeal a year later, though the company was found to have violated  antitrust laws. A settlement was reached that imposed some restrictions on

Microsoft's business practices, though Massachusetts has been seeking to have stricter penalties imposed.
AOL Time Warner

In May 2003,  Microsoft agreed to pay $750 million to AOL Time Warner (now Time Warner) to settle a range of litigation, including the  antitrust action Netscape Communications brought against  Microsoft.
Be

Microsoft paid Be $23 million plus attorney's fees to settle a lawsuit from the defunct OS rival, which had already sold its assets before reaching a pact with  Microsoft.
State  antitrust suits

Microsoft has already settled 10 lawsuits with various states and the District of Columbia. A number of others have been dismissed, and a few are still pending.

LP
Q: What exactly did the European Union say?

A: European regulators said that  Microsoft broke EU law by abusing its "near monopoly" market power in the workgroup server and media player markets.

TD
What does  Microsoft have to do?

It must create a version of the Windows PC operating system that does not have the Media Player included and offer that to computer makers within 90 days. It also must create "complete and accurate documentation" within 120 days that will allow other companies' workgroup servers to be completely interoperable with Windows. It must pay a  fine of about $613 million.
Who will enforce the decision?

The European Commission will appoint a "monitoring trustee" to ensure that Microsoft's Windows interface documentation disclosures are complete and that the
two versions of Windows are equivalent in performance.
Can Microsoft appeal?

Yes, and the company has made it clear that it will appeal. The first round of appeals will go to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. If another appeal is needed, it will go to the European Court of Justice, Europe's highest court.
Is a settlement on different terms still possible if
Microsoft appeals?
Yes.

Can Microsoft seek to have the impact of the decision put on hold pending its appeal?

Yes. If the Court of First Instance decides that  Microsoft would be "irreparably harmed" by the ruling, it will stay the commission's ruling. That process typically takes nearly three months to complete, but can vary widely.
How long is an appeal likely to take?

Page 44 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Appeals to the Court of First Instance typically take one to two years to be heard. However,  Microsoft could ask to put the case on a fast track, which could shorten that time substantially. Judges typically take a few months to issue a decision after oral arguments.
What products are affected?

Microsoft's Windows operating system is the only product in which direct changes are being ordered. The additional documentation could lead to new features in server products from other companies such as Sun Microsystems, however.
What does this mean for Windows prices?

The version of Windows without Media Player may be offered for a slightly lower price.

Does this mean that  Microsoft will be sued by other companies or consumers in Europe?

In theory, companies or consumers could file  antitrust cases, citing the commission's ruling. In practice, legal experts say Europe's private  antitrust legal system is considerably less active than that of the United States, and additional cases are unlikely.
Are other governments likely to do the same thing? Other governments could open their own proceedings
on similar issues. Japan has shown some interest in
antitrust issues, seeking evidence from  Microsoft in
that country. No other government has announced
investigations on these particular issues, however.

Does this have any effect on the  Microsoft software I've already bought?

No. All previously distributed  Microsoft software will continue functioning as before.
Can the U.S. government do anything about it?

If the U.S. government believes that any business restrictions are meant to harm American companies, or to help European companies at the expense of U.S. businesses, it can file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. Experts say such an appeal is unlikely in this case, given the rigor of the European Union's antitrust procedures.
Will this affect other  Microsoft products in the future? The order affects only the Media Player and server
interoperability issues today. However, the commission
made it clear that it is concerned about  Microsoft's
other actions and intends the logic to apply to future
markets as well. Experts said that this ruling, if upheld,
would serve as a clear precedent for other potential
features that  Microsoft wants to add to Windows.

Will the next stage in  Microsoft's European  antitrust
saga be a case of deja vu?

Industry watchers are wondering whether Judge Bo Vesterdorf, president of the European court that would hear a Microsoft appeal, could take the same path he did in a 2001 intellectual-property case that involved two health information service companies.

TD
For Microsoft, that would be good news.

The software giant is preparing to seek a stay for some of the remedies the European Commission outlined on Wednesday in its high-profile antitrust decision. In that ruling, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti gave Microsoft 90 days to provide a version of its Windows operating system that's stripped of its Windows Media Player multimedia software. A 120-day deadline was set for the company to share enough of its intellectual property with server rivals to allow them to offer machines that can work with Windows.

Vesterdorf is solely responsible for making a decision on whether to lift those orders, pending an appeal by Microsoft in the Court of First Instance against
European regulators' decision that it broke EU law.

"We have a sense of deja vu, as we see Microsoft's arguments shape up," said Frank  Fine, an antitrust attorney at law firm DLA in Brussels, Belgium. Fine unsuccessfully represented NDCHealth in an antitrust complaint against IMS Health before Judge Vesterdorf.

"Judge Vesterdorf seems to be so rigid in his support of protecting intellectual property, even against a very strong antitrust argument,"  Fine added.
Health complaint

In early 2000, NDCHealth filed a complaint with the European Commission, alleging that IMS Health had refused to license its intellectual property to rivals in the health information services industry. IMS, which held a copyright on the intellectual property, was then Europe's

Page 47 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
largest provider of pharmaceutical sales and prescriptions data.

The commission issued a temporary order in 2001 that required IMS Health to immediately issue licenses for its copyrighted intellectual property, while a final decision was reached. Monti based the ruling, in part, on the Magill precedent, which required a dominant company to share its critical services or products with others to bolster competition.

But in late 2001, Judge Vesterdorf issued a suspension on the order in the Court of First Instance.

"In our case, Judge Vesterdorf gave a hard-line view on protecting intellectual-property rights. And that will hurt the commission's server arguments,"  Fine said. "I don't know how the bundling issues will play out with the judge."

One European  antitrust attorney familiar with the Microsoft case and the NDC-IMS court battle disagrees with Fine's assessment.

In the IMS case, Judge Vesterdorf found that if IMS Health shared its intellectual property, its competitors would be able to offer the same product and service, said the European  antitrust attorney. But forcing Microsoft to share its intellectual property would not generate the same results, because Sun Microsystems, for example, and  Microsoft, would be building two different types of products.

However, those differences aren't likely to stop Microsoft from drawing on that  antitrust outcome, according to the attorney.

"Microsoft will rely heavily on the IMS case," the attorney said.

Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, stressed the intellectual property implications of the case in a conference call with journalists on Wednesday.
Smith said forcing  Microsoft to share its server
protocols with rivals was akin to telling a newspaper that
it has to make its articles available to run in rival papers.

"We think that today's decision amounts to the broadest compulsory licensing of intellectual-property rights since the European Community was founded," Smith said. "And given the nature of a compulsory license, once you give things to people, you can't really get them back."

Smith noted the role that intellectual-property issues play in European Courts and even tried to portray the unbundling of Windows Media Player as an
intellectual-property issue, saying it basically was forcing
Microsoft to dilute the value of its Windows trademark.

"It's clearly going to cause confusion for consumers and dilute the value of our trademark, if we're ordered to apply that trademark to a product that, whatever it is, is clearly not Windows," Smith said.

The FTSE 100 gives up early gains as the EU's  fine on Microsoft pushes US futures lower and
Eurotunnel chairman Charles Mackay insists the firm does not face bankruptcy.

At 1pm the FTSE 100 was down 6 points at 4,313, the FTSE 250 was up 15 points at 6,169 and the techMARK was off 1 point at 2,195.

Looking ahead US futures point to further falls in the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq when Wall Street opens for trading at 2.30pm.

US investors will be reacting to news of the European Commission's 497.2 million (£;331.2 million)  fine imposed on Microsoft for violating European Union antitrust law. Additionally the EU executive said Microsoft must act within four months to change the way it does business in Europe 'because the illegal behaviour is still going on'.

Before the opening bell the US government releases its report on February durable goods orders. Later in the session figures on February new home sales will be unveiled.

In the UK Eurotunnel (ETL) was among the biggest mid-cap gainers with a rise of 1.25p to 35p after chairman Charles Mackay said that there is no chance of the company going bankrupt after 2006.

Mackay also stood by the company's decision to cut tariffs as part of the 'Galaxie' restructuring plan and rejected shareholder suggestions that the group hike tariffs, saying that such a move would 'kill traffic'.

Mackay, who is retiring in October, confirmed that former Club Mediterannee head Philippe Bourguignon will succeed him.

Unilever (ULVR) declined 11.5p to 516p after saying it plans to convert preference shares to ordinary shares in the first quarter of 2005. Analysts had been expecting Unilever to launch a cash offer for the shares.
Hays (HAS) lost 1.25p to 121.5p despite revealing plans to sell its loss-making Rentacrate business for
£;4 million.

mm02 (OOM) dropped 2.25p to 97.25p after Japans NTT DoCoMo said it had no plans to sell its 20% stake in the UK third generation joint venture with mm02 rival Hutchinson Whampoa. The move raises question marks over NTT DoCoMos rumoured interest in making a bid for the UK telecoms group.
Sainsbury (SBRY), down 8.75p to 280p, was displaying nerves ahead of Fridays fourth quarter results. Meanwhile ex-dividend factors weighed heavily. Bradford & Bingley (BB.) was the biggest blue chip faller
with a drop of 14p to 294.5p, with Aviva (AV.), down 18.5p to 509.5p, and Intercontinental Hotels (IHG),
down 13p to 480p, also trading lower.

Johnson Matthey was a bright spot with a rise of 17p to 885p following a Credit Suisse upgrade from neutral to outperform.
Bullish broker comment also lifted Legal & General (LGR) 1.5p to 94.75p.

Shire Pharmaceutical (SHP) advanced 5.75p to 531.25p after the drugs giant said the Swedish authorities had granted the first European regulatory approval for its kidney drug Fosrenol.

Meanwhile British Airways (BAY) built on yesterdays gains with a rise of 1p to 269.5p. News that rival Virgin Atlantic was planning expand with the addition of two new aircraft to its fleet suggest that security concerns were holding back growth in the airline industry.
On a stronger second line earnings new featured.

Woolworths was among the best performers with a rise of 1p to 41.5p as its full-year results met expectations. Analysts, who had been concerned that the results might slip below forecasts, were also pleased by the retailers decision to scale back the big W out-of-town store format.

Barratt Developments climbed 14.5p to 607.5p after it beat forecasts with a 35% first half profit and offered a bullish outlook, leading Barclays to repeat its buy on the housebuilder.

However Brixton, down 7.75p to 284.5p, upset sentiment with news of an equity placing to raise £;68.5 million to help fund its development program. The news overshadowed a 17.6% rise in full-year pre-tax profit.

Away from earnings news VT Group (VTG) added 4.75p to 265p after saying it expected to win a contract with an initial value of over £;100 million to manage the Royal New Zealand Navys main dockyard at Devenport near Aukland.

Thus (THUS) firmed 0.5p to 31.5p on news that it had struck a deal with Telco Global to provide an outbound sales operation to boost its expanding Carrier Pre-Select customers.

HD                  Microsoft's Ballmer:  Still Hopeful Of Settlement  With EC BY                  By Marcelo Prince

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executives said they will continue to seek an out-of-court settlement with European  antitrust regulators, even as they challenge a ruling against the software giant.

Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, who tried to broker an 11th-hour settlement in Brussels last week, said he was "hopeful" those discussions would resume and that the two sides could reach a mutually acceptable settlement.

TD
After a prolonged investigation, the  European Commission found Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly to compete with rivals in multimedia players and server software. It announced Wednesday a record $613 million  fine, ordered the removal of Media Player from Windows and
the disclosure of technical information to rivals.


On a teleconference Wednesday with reporters, Ballmer  said every company, even a company like
Microsoft with a dominant market position, "should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers."
Ballmer said the  European Commission's decision would not alter the Redmond, Wash.,
company's product plans or development efforts, which are guided by the settlement  Microsoft
reached with the U.S.  antitrust regulators.

The chief executive also said it was "premature" to discuss  Microsoft's plans for its cash reserves. While the EC is seeking its  fine, Ballmer said it's still not clear how the proposed remedies would affect  Microsoft's business.

Microsoft has been under pressure from investors to distribute some of its $53 billion cash hoard. Executives have said they wanted to wait until the European case and other legal disputes were resolved. Analysts said this week the decision should free the company to move ahead with its unannounced plans.

Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said the company would appeal the  European               Commission's ruling and ask the court to suspend many of its requested remedies, including the order that Microsoft remove its Media Player from Windows.

Smith said the  European Commission's decision was "a step in the wrong direction, an unfortunate step and an unnecessary step."

The lawyer also questioned the need for European regulators to investigate the matter, given the U.S.  antitrust case and settlement. He noted  Microsoft and the complaining competitors are U.S. companies.

European regulators "embarked on a remedy that shows little regard for the work and decisions of the U.S. government," Smith said.

HD                EC's Microsoft Punishment Not As Bad As Some Feared

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--European  antitrust regulators imposed a record  fine on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and required changes to its Windows operating system, but the remedies were not as burdensome as some investors had feared.

"The proposed sanctions were not nearly as severe as some of the rumored worst-case scenarios floating around the Street over the past few weeks," wrote Charles DiBona, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, in a report to clients.

TD
After a five-year investigation and months of negotiations, the  European Commission found the world's largest software company abused its Windows monopoly to hurt rivals offering multimedia players and server computer software.

The EC fined the company 497.2 million euros ($613 million). It also ordered  Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without its Media Player software and to disclose more technical information about its software to rivals. The EC will appoint a trustee to ensure  Microsoft is complying with the ruling.

Microsoft said it would appeal the EC's decision, which could postpone a final decision for several years. The Redmond, Wa., company was found guilty in April 2000 of violating U.S.  antitrust laws. A judge's order to split up the company was reversed on appeal, and  Microsoft later brokered a settlement with the Justice Department.


While the
fine is the largest ever imposed by the EC for antitrust abuses, it is well below the statutory maximum and a fraction of Microsoft's cash balance.    The fine represents 1.2% of Microsoft's $53 billion cash balance and about two weeks of its free cash flow, analysts said.
The fine could have equaled 10% of Microsoft's global sales, or a $3.2 billion  fine. Instead,
European regulators decided to base the fine on 8% of the software company's European sales.

The EC's decision forces the company to offer a version of Windows without Media Player to computer makers within 90 days - something  Microsoft has resisted. But European regulators did not impose pricing on  Microsoft or compel the company to offer to stripped-down version at a discount, as had been feared, DiBona said.
DiBona rates Microsoft at outperform and doesn't own the shares. Bernstein is a unit of Alliance
Capital, which owns Microsoft shares.

"We believe the dark cloud of  antitrust is passing, and the damper on the stock is likely to subside," wrote Rick Sherlund, analyst at Goldman Sachs, in a report.

He said the decision should free  Microsoft to distribute some of its cash reserves to shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock repurchases.

Microsoft shares, which had slumped in recent days in anticipation of the EC's decision, rose slightly Wednesday. Shares recently were up 12 cents, or 0.5%, to $24.27, but remain 12% below where they began the year.

However, some analysts expressed concern about whether the ruling would hamper  Microsoft's plans to add new features into Windows, such as a search engine. The trustee could be used by competitors to affect future designs of  Microsoft products, analysts said.

"The only issue we see is whether  Microsoft will be under some constraints going forward in adding new things to Windows which may be viewed as 'tying' of a separate product with its monopoly Windows product," Sherlund wrote.

Sherlund rates  Microsoft at outperform and doesn't own the shares. Goldman has done investment banking work for  Microsoft.

HD                EU Makes Landmark  Bid To Shake Microsoft's PC Power

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In a landmark bid to shake  Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) stranglehold on the personal-computer industry, European Union regulators slapped tough sanctions on the software giant for abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips.

The E.U. Commission Wednesday ordered  Microsoft to reveal code from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create competing server software. Unless  Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with that disclosure requirement.

TD
In the other major part of the penalties,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer PC manufacturers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play Internet audio and video.
E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also  fined Microsoft EUR497 million.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation," Monti said. He denied that his orders violated  Microsoft's intellectual-property rights and called his moves "proportionate" and "balanced."

Microsoft said it will appeal to the E.U.'s Court of First Instance, saying the decision oversteps
European and international law.

Microsoft expects a protracted appeals "process that will likely extend for several years," according to an electronic-mail message from Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
The company also said the  fine is about double what it expected.

Microsoft now has 70 days to ask judges to freeze and eventually overturn the decision. Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, said he hoped to freeze the decision before  Microsoft is obliged to implement the first of the Commission's orders in three months' time.

Antitrust experts say the company has a fighting chance to win that order to freeze - particularly if judges share Microsoft's fears that the decision represents a threat to intellectual-property protection in Europe.

Microsoft competitors RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) and Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) praised the decision and said it gave them a fair chance in the market. Both companies had led the
anti-Microsoft campaign in Europe.




Page 57 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' vice president and general counsel.

Sun's vice president for legal affairs, Lee Patch, said the decision will help consumers by making it easier for their computers to communicate on "a level playing field."

Microsoft supporters denounced the E.U.'s move.

Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, said the verdict would make doing business harder for his members who are small software developers.

"The European Commission may be trying to punish  Microsoft, but its proposals reserve the harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies," Zuck said. Europe "plans to regulate the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software costs for everyone," Zuck added.
Other industry groups said the net effect would be to curb innovation.

The ruling "signals an ominous change for the global information and communications technology industry," said Hugo Lueders, European director for the Computing Technology Industry Association.

Monti spent much of Wednesday defending a decision that goes far beyond what  Microsoft agreed to in a 2001 settlement with the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush in a similar case.

Monti said he could have imposed a  fine on Microsoft's global sales but refrained "in deference" to regulators in different parts of the world, including the U.S. Instead, Europe set its fine against Microsoft, which is a record against a single company, by taking into account Microsoft's sales only in Europe.

The sum represents less than 2% of  Microsoft's worldwide sales and 8% of the company's narrower sales in Europe and nearby countries, E.U. Commission officials said. Europe's regulators justify their opaque fining rules by saying they need broad discretion to impose penalties in order keep future wrongdoers guessing at the likely punishment and to discourage offenses.

Under E.U. law, regulators could have  fined Microsoft as much as 10% of its most recent annual worldwide sales - which works out to about EUR3 billion. Still,  Microsoft has tens of billions of dollars in cash reserves, making any  fine less important than the other orders to modify its business model.

Europe's case against  Microsoft dates back to 1998, when Sun accused Microsoft of withholding code that enables smooth connections between its servers and Microsoft-powered PCs. Wednesday, the regulators upheld those charges but said Microsoft can charge "reasonable remuneration" for sharing its interfaces.

In 2001, the Commission later expanded the case to investigate  Microsoft's power over multimedia software. That part of the case focused on RealNetworks' RealPlayer software. As part of Wednesday's ruling, the Commission said  Microsoft can't sell discounted versions of Windows that are prebundled with its own Media Player.
The E.U. also will appoint a "monitoring trustee" to make sure  Microsoft complies.

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement in recent months, with Ballmer visiting Brussels last week to oversee the company's negotiating tactics. But talks collapsed over Monti's concerns about the company's plans to continue bundling Windows with consumer-friendly functions.

The earlier U.S. case also focused on the concept of bundling but it differed in the details. While the U.S. concentrated on the Internet Explorer Web browser, the European case concerned compatibility issues between PCs and servers, and later on media players.

Any appeal by Microsoft likely will charge the Commission with neglecting procedural steps, and in particular, misunderstanding evidence. During the five-year case, the company submitted about 50 "customer statements" to show that big computer users such as banks, companies and
government agencies are happy with the way Windows works.



Page 58 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Those statements triggered bitter exchanges between  Microsoft and the Commission. The regulators said the statements didn't paint a true picture and had been manipulated.  Microsoft insisted that the statements were "the best source of information" for the commission.

Wednesday, the Commission concluded that the statements actually hurt  Microsoft's case. "Survey responses submitted by  Microsoft itself confirmed the link between the interoperability advantage that  Microsoft reserved for itself and its growing market shares," the Commission said.

Still, an appeal could go beyond such wrangling and answer the basic business question that an earlier U.S. settlement left open: What kinds of features can  Microsoft add to Windows?

Microsoft has long argued that it should be able to add almost any feature to Windows for the purpose of product improvement.
Resolving the question is key to  Microsoft. The company still faces at least two separate  antitrust
challenges in Europe.

E.U. regulators already are investigating whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, such as hand-held computers and smartphones. They also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree to unfair technology licensing terms.

On Wednesday, the Commission signaled that it would keep up the pressure on  Microsoft and said the company's "illegal behavior is still ongoing."

It also warned that it remains concerned about  Microsoft's "general business model" that "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take an interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

HD              Sen. Frist: E.C's Microsoft Fine First Shot in Trade War

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said Wednesday that the European Commission's antitrust ruling against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be the first shot in a trade war.

"For some time now, the United States Congress has expressed its frustration over the European Union's intransigence on international trade issues that are vitally important to the U.S. economy," Frist said in a statement. "From over-reaching attempts to regulate e-commerce, to trade barriers against American beef and other agricultural products, the E.U. has relentlessly pursued protectionist policies that disproportionately harm American businesses and workers."

TD
"I now fear," he said, "that the U.S. and the E.U. are heading toward a new trade war - and the
Commission's ruling against  Microsoft is the first shot."

Europe's  antitrust authority Wednesday  fined Microsoft a record $613 million and ordered it to unbundle media players from some versions of Windows as punishment for abusing its market power. The Commission said its decision "is fully consistent" with international obligations.
A spokesman could not be reached for immediate comment.

In a broadside at the European Union, Frist said economic growth in the continent has been meager "because European economies are buried by public sector debt." They are drained by "excessive regulation" and "strangled by excessive regulation from bureaucrats sitting in Brussels."

"Now as if destroying Europe's economy were not enough, the  European Commission has taken aim at Microsoft, a company whose products and technology have been engines of global economic growth."

He called for the U.S. government to "make a clear and strong statement objecting to the E.U. actions."

LIZ CLAMAN, CNBC ANCHOR: Now for  Microsoft`s side of the story. Joining us in his first television interview since the E.U.`s  antitrust ruling is Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel at Microsoft.

Good morning, Mr. Smith. I know it`s a busy day. We appreciate you taking time out to be on MORNING CALL.

TD
BRAD SMITH, SR. V.P. & GENERAL COUNSEL,  MICROSOFT: Thank you, good morning.

CLAMAN: The E.U. is saying the clock`s ticking, they`re giving you 90 days to offer a Windows version that doesn`t have Media Player bundled with it, and then 120 days to comply with the order to reveal your code. What`s your plan of attack now?

SMITH: We`ll go forward and ask the European courts to review this. One of the first things we`ll do is ask the court to suspend these remedies. And we`re optimistic that the court will grant our request. Fundamentally, these are remedies that would disrupt our industry, and cause harm to consumers. In contrast to the kind of settlement offer we made last week, which would have given consumers more value for their money, this is a remedy that tells us to produce software that gives consumers less for their money. Given the kinds of problems it would create, we`re optimistic that the court will suspend these, and instead the litigation will go forward.

CLAMAN: So just to be clear, will you supply or will you not supply the technical information the E.U. is demanding?

SMITH: Well, the first principle for everything is, we will do whatever we`re required and ordered to do under the law. We will, however, ask the court to suspend that obligation. And if the court grants our request, then obviously we won`t have to do so in this timetable. On the other hand, if the court tells us we must do so, then obviously that`s what we`ll do.

CLAMAN: But you`re going to appeal, right? Now, how long will you fight this through the appeals process? Could it be years?

SMITH: Unfortunately, the European litigation process probably will take four or five years. That is one of the reasons that we thought it made much more sense to reach a settlement last week. That would have taken immediate effect. It would have obligated us to take steps that would have ensured that consumers receive 300 million additional Media Players each year. It at least was something that would have given consumers more value, rather than less. We think that there`s an important principle at stake in this case, and that`s innovation. Can we and other companies continue to improve our products, deliver more value
to consumers? That is something that we think is worth standing up for, even if it takes four or five years to do so.

CLAMAN: Well, the EU, and perhaps some of your competitors here in the States would say that you`re stifling competition, because you bundle, and because you`re kind of forcing other people to choose that Microsoft Windows Player. The  fine, get to that, is more that are six times the size of the largest  fine ever given by the E.U. for similar penalties. But a lot of people, Mr. Smith, are saying that  Microsoft has so much cash, it`s just a slap on the wrist. How does the company really see the  fine?



Page 62 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
SMITH: Well, the  fine is very substantial. The number speaks for itself. But I think what matters the most is not the fine, it`s the future. And while there are a few competitors that have spent millions of dollars lobbying the European Commission for this result, at the end of the day, we think that the governments around the world should base these decisions, not just with an eye on a few competitors, but with a broader perspective, the impact on consumers, and the marketplace as a whole. We do integrate better technologies into Windows, because that makes computers more useful tools for people in their homes and at work. But competitors have ample room to compete as well. If you buy a new PC today, you`ll probably find that it not only has Windows on it, but it has alternative media players. And if it doesn`t, you can easily download those over the Internet. Our competitors have every opportunity to get their products into the hands of consumers. And this is a very competitive marketplace, as your own reports just over the last few minutes are showing.

CLAMAN: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, it`s just 10 minutes past 7:00 on the West Coast, and a lot of people there, and certainly in Redmond, Washington, are tuning in. In case they were asleep when the E.U. made its announcement, we want to listen in on what EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said this morning about forcing  Microsoft to end the bundling process. And then we`ll continue our conversation. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARIO MONTI, E.U.  COMPETITION COMMISSIONER: We are saying that consumers and PC hardware manufacturers ought to able to decide which media software player they want to pre-install in their computers. They ought to choose. They ought to choose, not  Microsoft.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

CLAMAN: Mr. Smith, this morning, not a surprise, there are statements out from RealNetworks and Sun Micro, your competitors. Real Networks is saying: "We support the E.C.`s efforts to provide consumers with all the benefits of a competitive marketplace." Surely you`re not against fairness in the marketplace. And then they go on to accuse you of continued illegal conduct here in the U.S. What`s your comment on that?

SMITH: Well, I`m not surprised. They`ve spent millions of dollars lobbying officials in Brussels for this result. So they did get what they lobbied for. The real question is, is the marketplace working today? We have a marketplace in which we, today, can make our products better. And P.C. manufacturers today can and do decide what they are going to put on their new machines. There is a U.S. consent decree in place, because the U.S. government spent five years reviewing these issues already, and their decision was reviewed and approved by a U.S. court. Consumers today get the benefit of widespread software on new machines, and over the Internet, and in retail stores. The European decision today is not going to give consumers any greater choice. It is, rather, focused on trying to freeze technology where it is today, and in effect, offer consumers less rather than more. We think that`s a step backwards rather than forwards.

CLAMAN: Now, there is a camp, certainly, and we want to be fair in all of this, that say, look, at one time, a long time ago,  Microsoft started in a garage and was very small, and fought its way up. And certainly,
why should you be forced to cough up that code that you guys all worked so hard for? In the end, how will this change the way you do business? And I guess we could attack Europe first. How will this change the way you do business in Europe, if at all?

SMITH: Well, the first question is whether these remedies are going to take effect, or whether the court suspends them. And we`ll learn that over the next several months. But I think your point is a very
important one. We started in a garage. Today we`re much larger. We spend more money on research and development than any company in any industry in the world. That is the type of thing that creates jobs, not only for our employees, but for people throughout our industry. The European decision announced today
is really a broad attack on the kinds of intellectual property rights that give companies the incentive to invest in R&D, that give them the incentive to create new jobs, especially given the fact that the U.S. government already looked at these issues, and put a decision in place. It`s really bad news for the global marketplace when global companies work for so long and so hard with one government, and then another government comes in after the fact to try to stand a result like that on its ear. And that is what has happened today.

CLAMAN: Will you join us again, when more decisions are made by  Microsoft, and just keep us updated, Mr. Smith?
SMITH: Be happy to do that. Thank you.

CLAMAN: Thank you very much. We`ve been speaking with Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel at Microsoft.

WASHINGTON, March 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) today expressed outrage over the draconian punishment handed down by the European Commission (EC) to Microsoft for violating European  antitrust laws. The decision requires Microsoft to handover valuable intellectual property, unbundle its software, and pay a $612 million  fine.

"The decision by the  European Commission will have a global impact of negative consequence," CAGW President Tom Schatz said. "In most international  antitrust cases, courts will rely on precedent if a decision has been made in another jurisdiction. This is to ensure stability in the global marketplace. Microsoft had already reached a fair agreement in U.S. courts that the EC should have followed."

TD
The European Commission began antitrust investigations against Microsoft in 1999. It contended that by including its Windows Media Player with its operating system, Microsoft had an advantage over other manufacturers of media players. The Commission also claimed Microsoft did not disclose enough technical data about its operating systems that would allow competitors to manufacture compatible programs. Settlement talks broke down last week when the EC insisted that it be able to regulate any future additions to the Windows operating system.

"The EC should not be making decisions that are best left to the marketplace. Attempting to restrict the future design of software is unprecedented and has been rejected by the U.S. courts.

"The decision forcing  Microsoft to give up many of its rights to its intellectual property is a dangerous setback to innovation. Companies will have no motivation for designing new products if they have to share their information with competitors or face strict penalties from the EC," Schatz continued. "This is not just a decision that affects Europe. 95 percent of the world's computers use  Microsoft's Windows operating systems. If this decision and those of the future force  Microsoft and other companies to alter their products depending on where they are sold in the world or the whims of unelected bureaucrats, international communication and transactions could be severely hampered."

CAGW tracked the  antitrust case in the United States and monitored the $35 million cost to taxpayers. It works closely with taxpayer groups in Europe such as Contribuables Associes in France and The Taxpayer Alliance in England.

"As the rest of the world continues to grow technologically, Europe will lag behind if it does not change its mindset," Schatz concluded. "The  European Commission should not have issued a decision that defies precedent and will have such a negative impact on the global economy. It is imperative that when Microsoft appeals this decision that the United States government weighs in on behalf of the American consumer and taxpayer."

Citizens Against Government Waste is the nation's largest nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement in government.

Real chance of EU constitution agreement-Barnier

BRUSSELS - There is a good chance that the European Union's first ever constitution can be agreed by the end of June, EU Commissioner Michel Barnier was quoted as saying on Wednesday.

"The momentum is there," Regional Affairs Commissioner Michel Barnier told Belgian De Standaard paper in an interview.

"The chances of reaching an agreement before the European elections or by the end of June at the latest, are real. The atmosphere has completely changed from last December."
The charter is aimed at improving the efficiency of the bloc which is set to expand from 15 members to
25 in May.

EU set to rule against  Microsoft on Wednesday

BRUSSELS - European regulators will on Wedneday slap  Microsoft with a record fine and tell it to change the way it does business in Europe so that it will stop crushing software rivals.

The ruling, which the  European Commission says is a blow for consumers, goes further than a negotiated settlement on the firm's home base of the United States that critics deemed insufficient.

The 20-member Commission is set to meet at nine a.m. (0800 GMT), for a decision that is expected to be announced within a few hours after the meeting.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti planned
a news conference after 12.15 a.m. (1115 GMT) to discuss the decision.

The Commission was expected to  fine Microsoft 497 million euros. It planned to order the software giant to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software.

Germany takes aim at low E.Europe corp tax rates

BERLIN - A German government source signalled on Tuesday that low corporate tax rates in central and eastern Europe were a concern that could influence Berlin's negotiating position in talks on sharing out EU regional aid.

"It can't be that we get into a situation of tax  competition that affects the tax revenues that we need to help finance the new (EU) members to catch up," he said.

Page 67 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said the 10 mainly east European countries set to join the EU were expecting financial "solidarity" from the EU's existing 15 members, but many had corporate tax rates that western European states "can't compete with".
"It's these (western) countries that have to provide these funds," he added.

Ireland aims to secure timeframe on new EU accord
DUBLIN - Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern aims to secure a timeframe for negotiating a new
European Union constitution in Brussels this week, a government official said on Tuesday.

Ahern has already set out his stall by expressing optimism that talks which broke down last year in a row over voting rights can be wrapped up by the end of June.
The constitution is needed to ensure the bloc can run smoothly when it expands eastwards to embrace
10 mainly ex-communist nations in May.

Prospects of a deal have improved with the election of a more pro-European government in Spain and tentative signs of compromise from Poland and Germany.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, an Irish government official said Ahern hoped the impasse could be broken during the two-day Spring European Council meeting which kicks off on Thursday.

INTERVIEW-Finland optimistic on Russia-EU trade deal

HELSINKI - Russia's fears about future trade relations with an enlarged European Union are exaggerated and the two sides will probably agree to a trade deal before a May 1 deadline, Finland said on Tuesday.

"It looks even more likely that a deal will be done," Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja told Reuters in an interview. "It's now a question of wording, because not much substance can be negotiated at this point."

EU ties with Russia are governed by a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA). Brussels wants it to automatically apply to Russia's relations with the 10 new member states - eight of them former Soviet bloc countries - from the day they join. - - - -
EU seen facing relegation in competitiveness race

BRUSSELS - The European Union has little chance of becoming the most competitive economy in the world by the end of the decade and must take urgent action just to hang on to second place, a think tank said on Tuesday.

The stark warning came just days before EU leaders attend a summit in Brussels to assess progress towards this economic goal, named after the 2000 Lisbon summit at which it was set.

Business and trade unions were less brutal in their judgment but also told EU governments they were failing to deliver on their economic promises.

Germany, Poland revive EU constitution talks

WARSAW - Germany and Poland broke a deadlock over the European Union constitution on Tuesday, saying a deal over the bloc's first ever charter could be reached by the end of June.

"I am very happy that we agree that the creation of the constitution...should be finished during the Irish presidency (in the first half of 2004)," German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said after talks with Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller.

A dispute over the charter, pitting Germany and France against Poland and Spain, led to the collapse of the EU summit in December. The Irish EU presidency hopes to re-launch constitution talks at a Brussels summit on Friday.

EU to harvest more cereals, keep surplus in check

BRUSSELS - The EU will harvest steadily more cereals over the next six years but keep its exportable surplus stable as demand gathers pace after the bloc admits 10 countries as new members, the EU executive said on Tuesday.

In a report projecting cereals balances through to 2010, the  European Commission forecast that the enlarged EU-25 would turn out 276.8 million tonnes of cereals by 2010, compared with the 272.4 million expected for this year.

"In the cereal markets, the growth in domestic uses and exports would absorb the moderate expansion in cereal availability," the Commission said in a statement.

EU delays decision on Romania nuclear plant loan
BUCHAREST - The European Union delayed by one week a decision to give candidate Romania a
224 million euro loan to fund completion of a second nuclear reactor, after requests from MPs in
Strasbourg, officials said on Tuesday.

Bucking the trend elswhere in Europe where atomic energy is being phased out, Romania wants to double nuclear power production by 2010 to make up for the planned closure of its ageing
coal-burning plants.

EU's executive decision on whether to support Romania via Euratom - the European Atomic Energy Community - was postponed to March 30, Teodor Chirica, director at Nuclearelectrica, owner of the country's sole nuclear reactor told Reuters.

Eurozone consumers bloomed in the spring pre-Madrid

LONDON - Euro zone consumers were in a mood to open their wallets in the early spring, surveys showed on Tuesday, but it remains unclear how badly their confidence has been shaken by the Madrid bombings.
Data from Italy and France, eagerly awaited by analysts who believe it could influence next week's
European Central Bank decision on interest rates, showed shoppers were in an upbeat mood.

That pushed down the likelihood of a rate cut from the ECB, at least until the fog clears over the impact of Madrid.
"We continue to expect that the recovery will take firmer hold," ECB executive board member Gertrude
Tumpel-Gugerell told reporters in Prague on Tuesday, adding she did not expect a sustained change
in sentiment as a result of the bombings.

Japan, EU remain split over nuclear fusion plan

TOKYO - Japan and the European Union (EU) failed to agree in talks on Tuesday over which side should host an experimental nuclear fusion project but discussions are to continue, a Japanese official said.

At issue is the $12 billion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, the world's first attempt at generating energy in the same way as the sun.
The EU is backing Cadarache in southern France as its proposed site for the ambitious project, while
Tokyo is pushing Rokkasho, a remote fishing village in northern Japan.

"Discussions are still continuing... Our stance hasn't changed one bit," a Japanese official said after vice-ministerial talks in Tokyo. The two sides would work to set up another meeting, but no date had been set.

UK says Turkey EU entry could help war on terror


Page 69 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
COPENHAGEN - Encouraging Turkish membership of the European Union could be crucial in reaching out to moderate Islam as part of the war on terror, Britain said on Tuesday.

Islamic militants sought to create a "clash of civilisations" with the West, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said in a major foreign policy speech.

That division could be combated by demonstrating how much history and common values Europe shares with the Islamic world.

"For me the acid test of this is the question of Turkey's candidacy for membership of the EU," Straw told the Danish Foreign Policy Society.

"If we believe, as I strongly do, that Europe's strength lies not in a Judaeo-Christian club but in a diversity of traditions underpinned by common and universal values, then we must fulfil our engagements to Turkey."

HD         Microsoft Says It Made "Significant Concessions" To EU WC       1,149 words

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it would "seek legal review" of the European Union decision finding it guilty of antitrust abuses and ask the Court of First Instance to suspend the E.U. verdict to produce a second version of Windows.

In a conference call, the company's general counsel Brad Smith said the planned appeal could take at least five years to settle.

TD
"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," Smith said. [ 24-03-04 1324GMT ]

Earlier Wednesday, the E.U. declared  Microsoft guilty of abusing its "near monopoly" with Windows to squeeze competitors in other markets and levied a record  fine of EUR497.2 million.

The E.U.'s  antitrust authority gave  Microsoft 90 days to offer to European personal computer manufacturers a version of Windows that doesn't include its digital media player. It gave the company
120 days for Microsoft to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the server market so their products can have "full interoperability" with desktop computers running Windows.

"The ongoing abuses act as a brake on innovation and harm the competitive process and consumers, who ultimately end up with less choice and face higher prices," E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement. In his conference call,  Microsoft's Smith disputed all of the contentions. He said the E.U. penalties, if imposed, would hurt consumers, providing them with inferior and incomplete operating systems.

In particular, Smith said that a Windows without its Media Player would make it difficult to view many popular web sites include that of the U.K.'s leading pay TV station British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSY). In a  Microsoft survey of consumers, "one thing came through loud" - "European consumers want greater functionality and greater ease of use," he said.

Smith also said basic operating system functions would be disabled by the E.U. verdict. Voice instructions on how to set up a newly purchased computer no longer would work, for example without a pre-installed media player.

Smith contended it would have been much more productive to reach an amicable agreement, rather than find  Microsoft guilty. In settlement talks last week, he said  Microsoft offered to install three separate programs to listen to music and watch video.

"We fully responded to the Commission's concerns" and would have made "today's actions unnecessary," Smith said. In addition, "our settlement would have applied worldwide." By contrast, Smith insisted today's E.U. verdict applies only to Europe.

Talks broke down last week over the E.U.'s insistence on ground rules that would apply to future versions of Windows. The Commission is already investigating a complaint filed by competitors against the latest operating system, Windows XP.

Even though the case will now be litigated, Smith said he continues to hope for an out-of-court settlement.


Page 71 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behavior in the U.S., but a settlement reached with the Bush administration's Justice Department in late 2001 allowed it to continue adding to Windows. Smith noted that the U.S.  Microsoft investigation was settled after an appeals court ruling and he said a similar scenario could play out in Europe, although no discussions were currently underway.

"Frankly, we remain hopeful that we may at some point be able to resume those discussions and perhaps in the future reach a mutual solution to these issues," he said.

The Redmond, Washington-based company has 70 days to appeal the E.U. order, which goes beyond the U.S. settlement and aims at the heart of  Microsoft's business strategy of regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades. Smith lashed out against the E.U. verdict, calling it "the broadest possible licensing of intellectual property rights" and said it would result in an inferior operating system if carried out. -By William Echikson,Dow Jones Newswires;32-2-285-0134; william.echikson@dowjones.com [ 24-03-04 1453GMT ]

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Critics of the European Union's verdict Wednesday against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) say the decision will stunt innovation and hurt consumers, but supporters of the ruling argue it will increase competition and help consumers.

The E.U. Wednesday declared  Microsoft guilty of abusing its "near monopoly" with Windows to squeeze competitors in other markets and levied a record  fine of EUR497.2 million.

The E.U.'s  antitrust authority gave  Microsoft 90 days to offer a version of Windows to European PC manufacturers without its digital media player, and 120 days for  Microsoft to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the server market so their products can have "full interoperability" with desktop computers running Windows.

Microsoft's competitors Real Networks Inc. (RNWK) and Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) say the decision has given them a fair chance against the software giant. Both companies had led the effort to prosecute Microsoft in Europe.

"The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, Real Network's vice president and general counsel. "Building on the (European) Commission's findings," he added, Real intends "to vigorously pursue our case in the United States."

Sun argues that the decision will help consumers by making it easier for their computers to communicate.

"By requiring  Microsoft to make disclosures that will allow other servers to comparably interoperate with Microsoft desktops and servers, the Commission's decision seeks to create a level playing field," said Lee Patch, Sun's vice president of legal affairs.

But others denounced the decision. Jonathan Zuck, the president of the Association for Competitive Technology, complained that the verdict would make it harder for his members who are small software developers. "If you develop a multimedia application, now you won't know whether Windows would play it," he complained.

"The European Commission may be trying to punish Microsoft, but its proposals reserve the harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies. The European Commission plans to regulate the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software costs for everyone."
Other industry groups complained that the net effect would be to curb innovation.

The ruling "signals an ominous change for the global information and communications technology industry," said Hugo Lueders, European director for the Computing Technology Industry Association. "Rather than encouraging companies to provide better and less expensive computing technology (it) sends a message that companies who compete aggressively and give computers better products will be punished. Consequently, the ruling will stunt growth in the ICT industry and harm consumers, in Europe and around the world."

HD          EU Makes Landmark  Bid To Shake Microsoft's PC Power

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--In a landmark bid to shake  Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) stranglehold on the personal-computer industry, European Union regulators slapped tough sanctions on the software giant for abusing its power in markets for technology that links computers and plays music and video clips.

The E.U. Commission Wednesday ordered  Microsoft to reveal code from its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create competing server software. Unless  Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay that order, the company will have 120 days to comply with that disclosure requirement.

TD
In the other major part of the penalties,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer PC manufacturers a separate version of its Windows operating program that doesn't include its Windows Media Player, which is used to play Internet audio and video.
E.U.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also  fined Microsoft EUR497 million.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation," Monti said. He denied that his orders violated  Microsoft's intellectual-property rights and called his moves "proportionate" and "balanced."

Microsoft said it will appeal to the E.U.'s Court of First Instance, saying the decision oversteps
European and international law.

Microsoft expects a protracted appeals "process that will likely extend for several years," according to an electronic-mail message from Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer seen by Dow Jones Newswires.
The company also said the  fine is about double what it expected.

Microsoft now has 70 days to ask judges to freeze and eventually overturn the decision.  Microsoft's chief lawyer, Brad Smith, said he hoped to freeze the decision before  Microsoft is obliged to implement the first of the Commission's orders in three months' time.

Antitrust experts say the company has a fighting chance to win that order to freeze - particularly if judges share Microsoft's fears that the decision represents a threat to intellectual-property protection in Europe.

Microsoft competitors RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK) and Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) praised the decision and said it gave them a fair chance in the market. Both companies had led the anti-Microsoft campaign in Europe.

"The decision confirms the merit of our own U.S. lawsuit, which addresses  Microsoft's illegal tactics, including bundling its media player with its monopoly operating system," said Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' vice president and general counsel.

Sun's vice president for legal affairs, Lee Patch, said the decision will help consumers by making it easier for their computers to communicate on "a level playing field."

Microsoft supporters denounced the E.U.'s move.

Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, said the verdict would make doing business harder for his members who are small software developers.
"The European Commission may be trying to punish  Microsoft, but its proposals reserve the
harshest effects for consumers and small technology companies," Zuck said. Europe "plans to regulate
the future of software development and it will ultimately lead to less innovation and higher software
costs for everyone," Zuck added.
Other industry groups said the net effect would be to curb innovation.

The ruling "signals an ominous change for the global information and communications technology industry," said Hugo Lueders, European director for the Computing Technology Industry Association.

Monti spent much of Wednesday defending a decision that goes far beyond what  Microsoft agreed to in a 2001 settlement with the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush in a similar case.

Monti said he could have imposed a  fine on Microsoft's global sales but refrained "in deference" to regulators in different parts of the world, including the U.S. Instead, Europe set its fine against Microsoft, which is a record against a single company, by taking into account Microsoft's sales only in Europe.

The sum represents less than 2% of  Microsoft's worldwide sales and 8% of the company's narrower sales in Europe and nearby countries, E.U. Commission officials said. Europe's regulators justify their opaque fining rules by saying they need broad discretion to impose penalties in order keep future wrongdoers guessing at the likely punishment and to discourage offenses.

Under E.U. law, regulators could have  fined Microsoft as much as 10% of its most recent annual worldwide sales - which works out to about EUR3 billion. Still,  Microsoft has tens of billions of dollars in cash reserves, making any  fine less important than the other orders to modify its business model.

Europe's case against  Microsoft dates back to 1998, when Sun accused Microsoft of withholding code that enables smooth connections between its servers and Microsoft-powered PCs. Wednesday, the regulators upheld those charges but said  Microsoft can charge "reasonable remuneration" for sharing its interfaces.

In 2001, the Commission later expanded the case to investigate  Microsoft's power over multimedia software. That part of the case focused on RealNetworks' RealPlayer software. As part of Wednesday's ruling, the Commission said  Microsoft can't sell discounted versions of Windows that are prebundled with its own Media Player.
The E.U. also will appoint a "monitoring trustee" to make sure  Microsoft complies.

Microsoft fought hard to reach a settlement in recent months, with Ballmer visiting Brussels last week to oversee the company's negotiating tactics. But talks collapsed over Monti's concerns about the company's plans to continue bundling Windows with consumer-friendly functions.

The earlier U.S. case also focused on the concept of bundling but it differed in the details. While the U.S. concentrated on the Internet Explorer Web browser, the European case concerned compatibility issues between PCs and servers, and later on media players.

Any appeal by Microsoft likely will charge the Commission with neglecting procedural steps, and in particular, misunderstanding evidence. During the five-year case, the company submitted about 50 "customer statements" to show that big computer users such as banks, companies and government agencies are happy with the way Windows works.

Those statements triggered bitter exchanges between  Microsoft and the Commission. The regulators said the statements didn't paint a true picture and had been manipulated.  Microsoft insisted that the statements were "the best source of information" for the commission.

Wednesday, the Commission concluded that the statements actually hurt  Microsoft's case. "Survey responses submitted by  Microsoft itself confirmed the link between the interoperability advantage that Microsoft reserved for itself and its growing market shares," the Commission said.

Still, an appeal could go beyond such wrangling and answer the basic business question that an earlier
U.S. settlement left open: What kinds of features can  Microsoft add to Windows?

Microsoft has long argued that it should be able to add almost any feature to Windows for the purpose of product improvement.
Resolving the question is key to  Microsoft. The company still faces at least two separate  antitrust
challenges in Europe.

E.U. regulators already are investigating whether  Microsoft illegally leverages Windows to dominate the market for software that runs next-generation computing devices, such as hand-held computers
and smartphones. They also are investigating whether  Microsoft forces computer hardware makers to agree to unfair technology licensing terms.

On Wednesday, the Commission signaled that it would keep up the pressure on  Microsoft and said the company's "illegal behavior is still ongoing."

It also warned that it remains concerned about  Microsoft's "general business model" that "deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which  Microsoft could conceivably take an interest in and tie with Windows in the future."

BRUSSELS -- Critics of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) hope a European  antitrust decision against the company today will set a precedent not only for the European Union, but for other  antitrust authorities world-wide, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported.

The European Commission, the EU's top  antitrust authority, is expected to impose a record 497 million euro ($613 million) fine and tough sanctions on the Redmond, Wash., software company for abusing its market power in the markets for midsize computers called servers and for multimedia software.

TD
Microsoft, for example, will be ordered to supply technical information about its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create server software that is more competitive with Microsoft's own server programs. The ruling stresses a desire to create "a level playing field" in the market, according to a person familiar with the commission's statement.

Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) started the proceeding in 1998 by complaining about lack of access to information about  Microsoft's desktop operating systems. Although the ruling was expected to cover Windows 2000 and earlier operating systems, the commission also will order  Microsoft to disclose information about successor products, this person said.

Unless Microsoft wins an injunction to stay the orders, the company will have 120 days to comply with the disclosure requirement, this person said. In the other major half of the case,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer a separate version of Windows without its Windows Media Player product, which is used to play Internet audio and video. The commission decision also calls for what it calls a "monitoring trustee" to insure that  Microsoft fulfills its obligations under the orders.

HD     ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ANTITRUST, R. HEWITT PATE, ISSUES STATEMENT ON THE EC'S DECISION IN ITS MICROSOFT INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- R. Hewitt Pate, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, issued the following statement today after the  European Commission announced its order that Microsoft disclose certain information to competitors, offer for sale a version of its Windows Operating System that does not contain the Windows Media Player, and pay a  fine of 497 million euros (about $613 million):

TD
"The United States filed a complaint against  Microsoft in 1998, alleging that  Microsoft had restrained competition in violation of U.S.  antitrust laws. A lengthy trial and appeal confirmed that  Microsoft had violated the Sherman Act, though the court of appeals rejected the breakup remedy the U.S. had advocated and disapproved certain aspects of the district court's theory of liability. Following the remand
of the case, the United States reached a settlement, embodied in a Final Judgment, which was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the district court.

"The United States' Final Judgment provides clear and effective protection for competition and consumers by preventing affirmative misconduct by  Microsoft that would inhibit competition in
'middleware' programs, such as the web browser that was the subject of the United States' lawsuit and the media player that is the subject of the EC's action today. The Final Judgment, for example, prohibits the use by Microsoft of exclusive contracts or other provisions that inhibit competition, prohibits anticompetitive manipulation of icons and default settings, and requires Microsoft to provide information
to allow 'interoperability' of competitors' software. The United States continues to be active in its enforcement of Microsoft's compliance with the Final Judgment, and this work has resulted in substantial changes to Microsoft's business practices.

"The EC has today pursued a different enforcement approach by imposing a 'code removal' remedy to resolve its media player concerns. The U.S. experience tells us that the best  antitrust remedies eliminate impediments to the healthy functioning of competitive markets without hindering successful competitors or imposing burdens on third parties, which may result from the EC's remedy. A requirement of 'code removal' was not at any time - including during the period when the U.S. was seeking a breakup of
Microsoft prior to the rejection of that remedy by the court of appeals - part of the United States' proposed remedy.

"Imposing  antitrust liability on the basis of product enhancements and imposing 'code removal' remedies may produce unintended consequences. Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and competition even by 'dominant' companies. A contrary approach risks protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it. It is significant that the U.S. district court considered and rejected a similar remedy in the U.S. litigation.

"While the imposition of a civil fine is a customary and accepted aspect of EC  antitrust enforcement, it is unfortunate that the largest antitrust fine ever levied will now be imposed in a case of unilateral competitive conduct, the most ambiguous and controversial area of  antitrust enforcement. For this  fine to surpass even the fines levied against members of the most notorious price fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities.

"With respect to the EC's 'interoperability' remedy, which requires Microsoft to license technologies used by Microsoft server software to communicate with other Microsoft software on a network, there is considerably more overlap with the United States' approach. Like the U.S. decree, the EC decision appears to focus on providing competing software developers with the opportunity to build products that communicate and interoperate with Windows-based PCs. The details of the EC's requirements on this point remain to be seen, and we look forward to examining them.
Page 78 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Notwithstanding today's divergence, it is important to emphasize the overall strong and positive relationship between the U.S. and the EC on matters of  competition policy. The continued success of this working relationship is particularly important in the context of global markets, where the sale and use of products stretch across borders. The Justice Department will continue to work constructively with the EC
to develop sound antitrust enforcement policies that benefit consumers on both sides of the Atlantic."

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union on Tuesday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $613 million US for alleged  antitrust abuses.

TD
With the EU decision on the software giant due Wednesday, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle, as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the  European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Monti would address questions Wednesday at a news conference after the  European Commission adopts the ruling. Sources familiar with the five-year-old case, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the EU ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media
and server software.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any  fine
or remedies. Murray called on the Bush administration to "engage" the EU in settling the case.

"The EU has now directly attacked the authority of the United States and our economy in general," she said in a statement late Monday. "American jobs and economic interests are threatened."
U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the
Commission to levy fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 per cent of a company's global revenue.

A source familiar with the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday  Microsoft would be fined 500 million euros, approximately $613 million US. That would be a record for the EU in an antitrust case but far below the maximum of around $3.5 billion that could be imposed in  Microsoft's case.

Given that the Redmond, Wash.-based company has cash reserves of nearly $53 billion, experts say the fine is less significant than the changes Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows, which runs most personal computers worldwide.

HD     Microsoft is hit with GBP 331m Brussels fine. BY     JIM STANTON Deputy Business Editor.

MICROSOFT was today hit with a record GBP 331 million  fine by the European Commission for
breaking anti-trust rules by "bundling" products and programmes which stifled competition and effectively
monopolised the market. And the European Union's regulatory authority said "because the illegal
behaviour is still ongoing," it was also demanding changes in the way  Microsoft operates. But the
software giant said it would appeal against the ruling and  fine, which follows a five-year investigation. The
EC probe was triggered when rival Sun Microsystems complained in December 1998 that  Microsoft had
refused to provide the technical information necessary for Sun to develop products able to "talk" properly
with Windows personal computers. California-based  Microsoft was today ordered by the EC to offer a
version of its Windows operating system without the Windows Media Player programme within 90 days to
allow rivals to compete.

TD
The EC also demanded  Microsoft disclose "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the server market so that their products have full interoperability with Windows personal computers and servers. Microsoft has 120 days to fulfil this condition. "The ongoing abuses act as a brake on innovation and harm the competitive process and consumers, who ultimately end up with less choice and facing higher prices," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said. "Today's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the market concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a
company with such a strong dominant position."  Microsoft, co-founded by billionaire Bill Gates, defended its position, arguing that its codes were its own intellectual property and that offering a complete package was part of its commercial strategy. Analysts said more than 90 per cent of the world's PCs now run using Microsoft software. They also said that the real battle had only just begun.  Microsoft said it would appeal against the  fine to the European Court of Justice with a final verdict possibly five years away. Meanwhile, the group will be seeking suspension of the EC's order to start selling a version of Windows without Media Player and to make available the information other companies need to produce compatible rival server products. Mr Gates is furious that the EU is interfering at all when  Microsoft is already subject to anti-trust laws in America. The EC order goes beyond the 2001 US settlement on similar anti-trust charges and
aims at the heart of Microsoft's business strategy of regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades. Microsoft argues this bundling helps users. But Mr Monti said the company's commercial methods affect millions of European customers and must comply with EU laws.

FROM THE ECONOMIST GLOBAL AGENDA
After more than five years of investigation, the  European Commission has fined Microsoft almost
€500m for monopolistic abuses and given it four months to make life easier for competitors in the server
and media-player markets. But with a long-winded appeal inevitable, the punishment may prove
ineffectual

TD
IT IS headline-grabbing stuff: a  fine of almost €500m ($610m)—the European Union’s biggest ever for an antitrust violation. As importantly, the EU has required that Microsoft make far-reaching changes in its behaviour. But many worry that the punishments handed down by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, on Wednesday March 24th will have little effect. Microsoft will apply for an immediate injunction against the commission’s decision and will appeal. This process could take five years, a lifetime in the fast-moving world of computer software. And, in the meantime,  Microsoft has its sights set on the Google search engine, just as in the past it has targeted Lotus’s spreadsheet, Netscape’s browser, Sun Microsystems’ servers and RealNetworks’ media player.

In addition to the record  fine, the EU has demanded that  Microsoft do two things to make life easier for its rivals: it must produce a Windows package that excludes Windows Media Player within 90 days; and, within 120 days, it must make available a chunk of code for Windows, so that rival server manufacturers can design network computers that will work smoothly with the 90% of PCs that run on Windows operating software.

Microsoft has protested against the  fine and these demands, saying that a settlement rejected by the EU's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, would have been better for consumers. (Many expect Microsoft to continue to push for a settlement, despite the ruling, perhaps once the appeal is under way.) Anticipating the  fine, Patty Murray, a senator from  Microsoft's home state of Washington, described the EU's sanctions as “a hostile act with severe consequences for the global economy”. It is not the first time that Mr Monti has irked Americans. There was an outcry three years ago when he blocked the merger of General Electric and Honeywell after American regulators had given it the go-ahead.

Microsoft's forays into a succession of new markets have landed it on the wrong side of  antitrust authorities on both sides of the Atlantic many times before. During the late 1990s, the company fought an aggressive antitrust suit from America’s Department of Justice (see timeline, below). The department argued, as European  competition regulators are now doing, that  Microsoft was abusing its dominance in the PC operating-software market in order to expand into other markets. The other market in that case
was the one for internet browsers, then dominated by Netscape. The case led to a groundbreaking judgment, in 2000, that the only solution was a break-up of  Microsoft into two companies: one making the Windows operating software, and one making the applications that run on it. That way, there would be no reason for the maker of Windows to favour products like  Microsoft Office or the firm’s Internet Explorer browser at the expense of rivals’ products.

However, that judgment was reversed in 2001 after the Clinton administration, which had adopted an aggressive antitrust stance, was replaced by a more business-friendly Bush administration. The new judgment cancelled the break-up, and instead insisted on “behavioural remedies”.  Microsoft was to allow PC-makers to carry browsers other than Internet Explorer, for instance, but the company could still bundle any product it wished into Windows. It is telling that many of the complaints that have driven the European

Page 83 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
case against Microsoft arose after this judgment, suggesting that the American remedies had little effect on its behaviour.

The European case was sparked by a 1998 complaint by Sun Microsystems, which alleged that  Microsoft was not sharing the source code of its PC operating systems, making it difficult for Sun to make servers that interacted smoothly with Windows when  Microsoft was itself trying to enter the server market. The case was later broadened so that, like America’s, it concerned the bundling of  Microsoft's application software—in this case, Media Player—with the Windows operating system. RealNetworks, then the dominant maker of PC audio-visual software, claimed that this clobbered demand for its product, which many considered to be better than  Microsoft’s. RealNetworks’ share of this market has since fallen
behind that of Windows Media Player.

RealNetworks and Sun are both pursuing separate legal actions against Microsoft in America. Furthermore, thousands of consumers have joined class-action suits. Though Microsoft has now settled many of these, the first class-action suit to come to trial is currently before a judge in Minnesota; the plaintiffs are seeking more than $400m in damages due to alleged overcharging.  Microsoft took the diplomatic step of apologising for past wrongdoings in the opening of its defence. But many—including the EU—see the company as a persistent offender that has wriggled out of settlement after settlement.
More bark than bite

But even if the EU is successful in setting a legal precedent, will it have any practical effect in the market? The requirement that  Microsoft open access to its interoperability code will apply only to Windows 2000, not to the more recent Windows XP, which is being dealt with in a separate case. As for media players, even if Microsoft does offer cheaper, stripped-down versions of Windows, will PC-makers want them? Even a discount of, say, $10—a substantial cut in  Microsoft’s average package price of around
$50—would barely make a dent in the $1,000 cost of the average PC. And European consumers might feel that they are being offered a second-class product. When offered a choice between Windows with and without Internet Explorer after the American settlement, few PC-makers went without.

Most important of all is what the ruling will mean for  Microsoft's plans to conquer yet more markets. The company is believed to be integrating an internet search facility like Google (which Bill Gates greatly admires) into its new version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn. The  European Commission has not specifically banned any further bundling—it says this will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps this week's ruling will prove strong enough to stop  Microsoft from tying its products to Windows in order to storm new markets. But if the past is a guide, that seems unlikely. And with the appeal process set to last for years, it is hard to see  Microsoft being swayed from its usual strategy: bundle now, litigate later.

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The following is a summary of
Wednesday's

antitrust developments involving the European Union Commission and companies
publicly traded in the U.S.:

EU Fines  Microsoft EUR497 Mln For Monopoly Abuses


(MSFT)
European Union regulators Wednesday fined  Microsoft Corp.
EUR497 million and slapped tough sanctions on the software giant for abusing
its power in markets for software that links computers and plays music and
video clips.  The E.U. ordered Microsoft to reveal code from its dominant
Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create competing server
software. Unless Microsoft wins a court injunction to stay the order, the
company will have 120 days to comply with the disclosure requirement.


Microsoft Says It Made 'Significant Concessions' To EU

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it would "seek legal review" of the

European Union decision finding it guilty of antitrust abuses and ask the
Court of First Instance to suspend the E.U. verdict to produce a second

version of Windows. In a conference call, the company's general counsel
Brad
Smith said the planned appeal could take at least five years to settle. "The
European  Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the
final word," Smith said.

HD         Microsoft handed record E497m fine. BY         BY FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTERS

Microsoft's battle with the  European Commission reached a climax on Wednesday as the software company was fined E497m and disciplined for abusing its Windows monopoly.

Mario Monti,  competition commissioner, called for  Microsoft to be fined for trying to shut out competitors in other markets.

TD
The Commission decision says  Microsoft broke European Union  competition law by "failing to provide the information" needed by rivals in the market for computer servers and by "making the supply of Windows . . . conditional" on the inclusion of its Media Player program.

The Commission argues that  Microsoft put competitors at an unfair disadvantage by withholding technical codes which allow Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft contends that the information is its own intellectual property.

Brussels also argues that  Microsoft hurt rivals by bundling Windows with Media Player, while the company maintains it was merely meeting consumer demand for more functions.

The decision gives Microsoft 120 days to reveal the information needed by companies involved in "developing and distributing" rival server products. It would also have to ensure the information was kept up to date.

The decision also orders the company to offer a version of Windows without Media Player within 90 days, though it notes that  Microsoft is still allowed to include Media Player in a separate version. It also forbids the company from any behaviour that could have an "equivalent" effect to any of the infringements for which it will be punished.

Microsoft has made clear that it will contest the decision and seek a court order to suspend the
Commission's demands in what could be a five-year legal case.

Only a week ago, the two sides were discussing a deal that could have come into effect as soon as August 1 - but which Mr Monti rejected because it would not have constrained  Microsoft in other sectors.

The company's proposed deal would have included three rival PC media player programs used throughout most of the world. It also proposed "detailed undertakings to address all of the [server] interoperability issues raised by the Commission's services."

Microsoft had offered to share protocols used to communicate between its servers and between servers and personal computers. It would have supported industry standards and met the Commission regularly to discuss "future versions of Windows . . . [and] interoperability and product integration".

Mario Monti managed a headline-grabbing finale to the  European Commission's five-year investigation into Microsoft. The E497m  fine, for abuse of market power, is a European record. Microsoft will have to provide new information to rivals in the server market to help them interface better with Microsoft products. It will also have to offer a version of Windows without Media Player included in the European Union. But the immediate impact on  Microsoft will be negligible.

The fine represents little more than 1 per cent of  Microsoft's cash pile. The remedy on Media Player actually looks less onerous than  Microsoft's offer to include rivals' programs alongside its own in both the EU and beyond.

TD
The real point of Mr Monti's decision is to kick off a fight for the future, rather than trying to alter the past. Microsoft's Media Player is already established. That will not change. Mr Monti's strategy is to minimise the chance of his remedies being overturned in the courts - and avoid disagreements with the US authorities - while securing a framework to contain  Microsoft from now on. If the  European                    Commission weathers Microsoft's appeals, it should be in a position to check abusive behaviour in the future more quickly.

Such close control in a major market would make it yet more difficult for  Microsoft - which relies heavily on its maturing Windows and Office products - to accelerate growth. Negotiations may have been amicable. Mr Monti should expect the gloves to come off.

PAT KIERNAN, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: As we`ve been reporting, Microsoft has been hit with a record fine for violating  antitrust laws in Europe. The European Union today ordered Microsoft to pay roughly $613 million U.S. Katharine Barrett is  Microsoft headquarter in Redmond, Washington, with details on this - Katharine.

KATHARINE BARRETT, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: That`s right, Pat. This investigation started in Europe just when the U.S.  antitrust investigation of Microsoft was at its peak. Now after five years, the European Commission has concluded that Microsoft continues illegal anticompetitive business practices. As punishment, Europe has assessed as you said a record  fine of $613 million. But that`s not a manageable amount for a company with $53 billion in cash in the bank. And also, in order to restore fair competition in the market for media players, Europe demands that  Microsoft unbundle or separate its Windows media player from its operating system within 90 days.

TD
Second, in server markets, the company must submit technical information to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days and the European Union will appoint a trustee to monitor  Microsoft`s disclosures to its rivals. Europe`s lead  antitrust regulator said this morning that companies as dominant as  Microsoft have a special responsibility not to harm  competition or consumers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARIO MONTI, E.U.  COMPETITION COMMISSIONER: Our decision is about protecting consumer choice and simulating innovation. As I said, we did not rush into a decision.

BRADFORD SMITH, GENERAL COUNSEL,  MICROSOFT: The decision announced today in Brussels is a step in the wrong direction. It attempts to freeze technology in its tracks and it basically requires us to produce a new version of software that gives consumers less rather than more. We think that`s moving in the wrong direction.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

BARRETT:  Microsoft of course plans an immediate legal appeal of this judgment. Most critically they hope that they can get suspended those remedies that would force them to change the way they do business in Europe and have those remedies suspended for the duration of appeal. An appeal like that could last anywhere from three to five years. And  Microsoft has certainly had plenty of practice and use the court system to its advantage to certainly buy itself time. Pat?
KIERNAN: Katharine, does this mean anything to the U.S. business?

BARRETT: Well, interestingly there are also two more  antitrust investigations pending in Europe and also in the United States, its two competitors who were partly responsible for this judgment today. Sun Microsystems and Real Networks have private lawsuits against Microsoft. There are still several class action lawsuits against the company in the U.S. as well as one state antitrust lawsuit from
Massachusetts. And there`s some suggestion that the precedent set here can just add further fuel to those lawsuits against the company - Pat.

KIERNAN: Katharine, I was just punching up Real Network shares here to see what it was doing today. I`m not see much movement on the news, but that`s the kind of company that was counting on this European Union ruling and looking at this. Who stands to benefit from this?

Page 94 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BARRETT: Well, certainly Real Network stands to benefit, but only if those remedies are actually imposed in any kind of timely fashion. If  Microsoft doesn`t have to unbundle its media player for three to five years, it`s anybody`s guess how the market for media players will go. That`s somewhat what happened to Netscape in the U.S.  antitrust investigation. But Real Networks has said it is certainly pleased with this decision and as I said, it has its own lawsuit to weigh in against  Microsoft with. But again, time is the key here. If these remedies are delayed for five years, it may not help so much.

KIERNAN: And putting this into perspective for me earlier. As far as the  fine itself against  Microsoft, they`ve got so much cash that they`re not even going to blink.

BARRETT: They do. It`s really not an onerous or significant, it`s significant to the rest of us but not to a company with $53 billion. It`s less than 1 percent of their sales and it could have been larger. The European Commission could have levied a fine as high as $3 billion. So it`s even as big as they could have, but again, a larger  fine than they`ve assessed against any company to date.
KIERNAN: True from that perspective. Katharine Barrett, thank you.

$618-million (U.S.) — for alleged  antitrust abuses.

TD
With the EU decision on the software giant due today, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

“This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth,” said Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the  European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft, which is accused of abusing its Windows monopoly, does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

“We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government,” Mr. Gutierrez said.

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti “has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently,”  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes said.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Mr. Monti would address questions today at a news conference after the commission adopts the ruling.

Microsoft was found guilty of monopolistic behaviour in the U.S.  antitrust case but settled with the government in late 2001. A U.S. appeals court is considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore  competition.

U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the commission to levy  fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 per cent of a company's global revenue.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments approved the  fine on Monday. A source familiar with the case, speaking on condition of not being identified, said yesterday it was about 500 million euros.

Page 96 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That would be a record for the EU in an  antitrust case but far below the maximum of about 2.8 billion euros that could be levied in this case.

Given that the Redmond, Wash.-based company has cash reserves of nearly $53-billion (U.S.), experts say the  fine is less significant than the changes Mr. Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows, which runs most personal computers worldwide.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying Windows code to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

Antitrust lawyers call Microsoft's latest arguments unsurprising.

“It's unprecedented but not necessarily wrong,” said Martin Baker, chief  antitrust partner at Taylor Wessing in London. He noted the U.S. case focused on Internet browsers, while the EU case deals with media and server software.
“The absence of a precedent can be a mitigating factor,” he added.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any
fine or remedies.

In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union on Tuesday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615 million US for alleged antitrust abuses.

HD         US backlash  fear after hefty EU fine on Microsoft. BY         By David Usborne in New York.

TENSIONS BETWEEN the United States and the European Union are set to be inflamed as the European Commission prepares to release details this morning of a record EUR497m (£331m)  fine to be imposed on the American software giant  Microsoft for allegedly impeding free  competition.

Pressure will rise on the White House to challenge the decision, which will be approved at a full meeting of the European Commission today on recommendations from the EU  competition chief, Mario
Monti, after a five-year probe. It will be the highest  fine ever imposed by Brussels on a foreign company.

TD
"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said US Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington. She called on President George Bush to "engage" with Brussels on the case.

More important may be the reaction of the US Justice Department, which negotiated a settlement with Microsoft in 2001 after a similar investigation into claims that its Windows software was unfair to competitors in the industry. As details of the impending EU decisions have leaked out, officials in Washington have maintained a more or less tactful silence.

Last week, an official at the Justice Department said it believed its settlement "provides the appropriate framework for marketplace  competition in this important sector". But Senator Murray insisted the EU "has now directly attacked the authority of the United States and our economy in general. American jobs and economic interests are threatened".

There was similar controversy three years ago when the EU took the unusual step of overriding regulators in Washington and blocking a proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell. Although both were American companies, the EU is entitled to intervene in cases where the companies in question do substantial business in Europe. In the latest case, Europe accounts for 30 per cent of Microsoft's revenues.

Microsoft's chief lawyer in Europe, Horacio Gutierrez, signaled its intent to appeal against today's ruling, which also includes provisions requiring the company to offer stripped-down versions of Windows without its media player software.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's US operations when those operations are already regulated by the US Government," Mr Gutierrez said, referring to the 2001 Justice Department accord. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the US Department of Justice and a US court."

The fine, though very large by European standards, would barely dent  Microsoft, which reportedly has more than $50bn cash in hand. The restrictions on its ability to bundle extra features with Windows is a far more threatening prospect. Yet the effect of the EU decision could be delayed by months or even years if the company pushes ahead with an appeal.

HD       Microsoft could face life as an old-style utility

PARIS:

Proving that  Microsoft has a monopoly is not hard, and now regulators on two continents have agreed that it abuses that monopoly. But figuring out what to do about it is proving to be a daunting task for Europe, as it was for the United States after  Microsoft lost its antitrust trial there.

TD
In the end, the risk to  Microsoft may not be that it will be forced to pay  fines as large as the 497 million, or $613 million, being sought by the  European Commission, or even to distribute a competitor's program, as it was reported to have agreed to do in unsuccessful settlement talks with the commission. Instead, the risk is that  Microsoft is becoming the functional equivalent of an old- style utility, with extensive government regulation that could even extend into determining what products it sells and at what prices.

There are worse fates than running a regulated monopoly. But such stocks are not the type that appeal to traditional technology investors, and the specter of such an outcome may be one thing that has been weighing on Microsoft's share price, which has underperformed the market badly over the past 18 months. For antitrust regulators, the heart of the problem is the changing nature of the personal
computer market. Consumers do want new features, as  Microsoft says, and they do want them bundled in. Any nonexpert who has ever tried to download and install a program would much rather have it done by someone else.

But Microsoft's pattern has been to wait for others to pioneer a computer application and then to put out its own program. If that program is eventually bundled as part of the operating system in all new Windows computers, the first arrival screams foul, but in the end  Microsoft wins. Netscape pioneered Internet browsers but was left in the dust. RealNetworks, which led the way in music software, could face a similar fate. It is not easy to make money off a product that consumers must install themselves when the consumers already own Microsoft's version, which comes already installed.

In the United States, a federal judge ruled in 2000 that  Microsoft had violated antitrust law and ordered it split in two, separating the operating system from the rest of the company. But that ruling was partly overturned on appeal, and the company later settled with the Justice Department on terms that left it free to pursue expansion of the operating system.

In an ideal world, decisions on which features to offer would be made at an industry level where there is competition, such as the manufacturer level. Just as General Motors, Ford and other automakers deal with many of the same suppliers for everything from seats to transmissions, and choose which to put on any given model, Dell and Hewlett-Packard and other computer makers could decide among competing offerings from  Microsoft and other companies. The manufacturers would be competing, presumably, on the basis of functionality and price. The consumer would be able to buy machines with everything loaded on already, but different vendors would decide just what combination they wanted to offer and would do the work of integrating the programs.

But the fact is, that does not happen. To make that work,  Microsoft would have to be selling different versions of Windows, some with features bundled in and others without them. There is no clear way to
Page 104 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
accomplish that, short of government regulation, utility-style. Mario Monti, the European Union's chief antitrust regulator, sought a deal in which regulators would have a say in what was added to the operating system in the future, but  Microsoft was unwilling to give in. It is possible that when the commission issues its final decision Wednesday it will order such changes in addition to the  fine, whose size was reported by people close to  Microsoft on Monday. The company has said it will appeal, a procedure that could take years.
In the United States, efforts to get  competition in areas that were deemed natural monopolies have had
a mixed record, at best. In the local telephone market, would-be competitors have had to use local phone
company lines, at prices set by regulators. There is a parallel in the PC industry, where those who seek
to compete with systems that  Microsoft uses in its operating system must use the same operating
system and can hope to be price-competitive only with government intervention.

Microsoft has fended off such moves in the past, and it may do so again as the European case continues on appeal. But it will face similar fights time and again, as innovations prompt protests from injured competitors. Such companies may be quite profitable and pay high dividends far better than the current Microsoft payout of less than 1 percent but they do not get priced as growth stocks.  Microsoft's sheer size makes exponential growth impossible anyway, but the notion of governments watching over every new Microsoft innovation, prepared to challenge it if it seems unfair to some competitor, is a daunting one.

Microsoft finished 35 cents lower Tuesday at $24.15, leaving it up just 11 percent from where it was
when the stock market hit bottom on Oct. 9, 2002. Over that same period, the Standard &Poor's 500 is up
41 percent, and the Goldman Sachs software index has risen 80 percent. Measuring from the bottom
may seem unfair to  Microsoft, since it did not fall as far as many stocks did during the bear market. But
the fact is that over the past year,  Microsoft has traded in a range of $23.60 to $30, a low-to-high
difference of only 27 percent, the smallest range in  Microsoft's history. And over that year, while most
stocks have risen,  Microsoft is down 9 percent.

Microsoft's battle with the  European Commission is set to reach a climax today, when the software giant will be fined and disciplined for abusing its Windows monopoly.

Mr Mario Monti,  Competition Commissioner, has called for  Microsoft to be fined €497 million for trying to shut out competitors in other markets. The figure could be adjusted by the 20 European Commissioners at a meeting today, but significant changes are thought unlikely.

TD
A draft of the Commission decision says  Microsoft broke EU competition law by "failing to provide the information" needed by its rivals for computer servers and by "making the supply of Windows... conditional" on the inclusion of its Media Player program. The Commission argues that  Microsoft unfairly disadvantaged rivals by withholding technical codes that allow Windows-based personal computers to work better with servers.

Microsoft contends that the information is its own intellectual property.

The draft decision gives  Microsoft 120 days to reveal the information needed by companies involved in "developing and distributing" rival server products. - (Financial Times Service)

BRUSSELS -- Critics of  Microsoft Corp. hope a European  antitrust decision against the company today will set a precedent not only for the European Union, but for other  antitrust authorities
world-wide.

The European Commission, the EU's top  antitrust authority, is expected to impose a record 497 million euro ($613 million) fine and tough sanctions on the Redmond, Wash., software company for abusing its market power in the markets for midsize computers called servers and for multimedia software.

TD
Microsoft, for example, will be ordered to supply technical information about its dominant Windows desktop operating systems to help rivals create server software that is more competitive with Microsoft's own server programs. The ruling stresses a desire to create "a level playing field" in the market, according to a person familiar with the commission's statement.

Sun Microsystems Inc. started the proceeding in 1998 by complaining about lack of access to information about  Microsoft's desktop operating systems. Though the ruling was expected to cover Windows 2000 and earlier operating systems, the commission also will order  Microsoft to disclose information about successor products, this person said. That is a victory for Sun, which otherwise would have had to keep filing additional complaints to keep pace with newer  Microsoft products.

Unless Microsoft wins an injunction to stay the orders, the company will have 120 days to comply with the disclosure requirement, this person said. In the other major half of the case,  Microsoft will have 90 days to offer a separate version of Windows without its Windows Media Player product, which is used to play Internet audio and video. The commission decision also calls for what it calls a "monitoring trustee" to insure that  Microsoft fulfills its obligations under the orders.

Microsoft and a U.S. political champion already are condemning the expected action as a threat to American innovation, jobs and growth. "The EU's proposed actions against  Microsoft amount to a hostile act with severe consequences for the global economy," said Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Microsoft's home state of Washington. She called on the U.S. government to "engage the EU immediately" in search of a negotiated settlement.
But Microsoft competitors and others who feel U.S.  antitrust authorities let Microsoft off easy in a
2001 settlement hoped for the opposite: that an EU crackdown would inspire antitrust authorities in
the U.S., Japan and elsewhere to take another look at the company's activities.

"It's proof that what was done in the U.S. is too little," said Douglas A. McIntyre, chief executive of New York-based On2 Technologies Inc., a company that, like  Microsoft, sells technology for compressing video images so they can be sent cheaply over the Internet. Mr. McIntyre says On2 has submitted complaints about alleged predatory pricing by  Microsoft to antitrust authorities in Japan, Europe and the U.S.

"I'd be happy to see the Justice Department come back and rethink some things that have gone on over the past couple of years," Mr. McIntyre said, referring to recent  Microsoft inroads into new

markets that weren't covered in the 2001 settlement. The U.S. settlement, related to  Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, exacted some concessions from the company, but allowed it to continue to integrate the browser with its dominant Windows operating system.

A commission spokeswoman and a  Microsoft lawyer declined to comment on Mr. McIntyre's complaints.

Ed Black, chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, agrees that the commission's tough stance could spur U.S. and other  antitrust authorities world-wide to take complaints about the software company's business practices more seriously. "One could make the case that there's real value in having  competition between competition authorities," said Mr. Black, whose group represents Nokia Corp., Time Warner Inc. and about 30 other companies, including On2.

Last year Mr. Black's group complained to the  European Commission about the growing impact of Microsoft Windows XP on related technology markets. The commission has been investigating that complaint even as it moved to conclude the current case.

After European antitrust authorities backed the planned EU  fine against Microsoft on Monday, Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft's chief lawyer for Europe, complained that a fine on the company's U.S. operations would be "unprecedented and inappropriate" when those operations have been permitted by American regulators and a U.S. court. He added that the  fine was about double what the company expected. But Europe's regulators say they need broad discretion to impose penalties in order to discourage offenses.

The European Union (EU) decided Wednesday to  fine Microsoft Corp. a record 497.2 million euros for abusing its market dominance in the way it sells its Windows operating systems.

The European Commission, the EU's executive body, also ordered the U.S. software giant to sell a European version of its Windows operating system by detaching the popular Media Player program within 90 days.

TD
The fine, which is equivalent to 65 billion yen, is the largest ever imposed on a single company by
European regulators.

The commission concluded that  Microsoft's sale of the Media Player audiovisual software as part of its Windows operating system runs counter to fair  competition.

The ruling follows last week's failure to settle the landmark  antitrust case between the commission and Microsoft.

Relying on the European market for 30% of its sales,  Microsoft is set to file an appeal in a bid to nullify the ruling.

-Japan's beef restaurants hurting from import ban on U.S. beef

TOKYO - Japan's import ban on U.S. beef dealt a blow to restaurants focusing on beef dishes as sales posted double-digit drops in February despite a slight rise in the overall restaurant industry, an industry body said Wednesday.

TD
Sales at two restaurant types - one serving Japanese fast foods and the other offering grilled beef - declined 16.4% and 18.2%, respectively, from a year earlier on a same-store basis, said the Japan Foodservice Association. The Japanese fast food chains are mostly "gyudon" beef bowl chains.

A corrected version follows.
By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - European regulators will on Wedneday slap  Microsoft (MSFT.O) with a record fine and tell it to change the way it does business in Europe so that it will stop crushing software rivals.

The ruling, which the  European Commission says is a blow for consumers, goes further than a negotiated settlement on the firm's home base of the United States that critics deemed insufficient.

The 20-member Commission is set to meet at nine a.m. (0800 GMT), for a decision that is expected to be announced within a few hours after the meeting.  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti planned
a news conference after 12:15 p.m. (1115 GMT) to discuss the decision.

The Commission was expected to  fine Microsoft 497 million euros. It planned to order the software giant to offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player and to encourage computer makers to provide other audiovisual software.

The Redmond, Washington-based company must also license information to make the servers of rivals more compatible with Windows desktop machines. Windows runs more than 95 percent of all personal computers.
APPEAL CERTAIN

Microsoft has said it will take the decision to European Union courts in Luxembourg and try to get the remedies delayed until final appeals are over, a process that could take four to seven years or more.

Although that limits the impact of the decision, the Commission has shown no inclination to slow two other investigations of Microsft it now has underway.

It will be able to cite the precedent from its decison on Wednesday in bringing the next cases, easing the way for quicker action, experts say.

The decision to go for a broad remedy follows a decade of investigations and settlements on narrow issues without any formal findings against the software firm.

A U.S. appeals court ruled unanimously in a final 2001 decision that Microsoft broke antitrust rule, but critics say the remedies there failed to encourage vigorous competition.

FIGHTING FOR CONSUMERS

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti explained to reporters last week that his decision was based on what was needed for the European marketplace.

"In the end, I had to do what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe," he said. "I believe they will be better served with a decision that creates a strong precedent."
The Commission fine exceeds the record 462 million euro penalty imposed on Switzerland's
Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel.

Nonetheless, it amounts to slightly more than one percent of  Microsoft's roughly $53 billion cash on hand. On January 22 it projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current quarter.

Microsoft has three months to pay the fine but may instead give a bank guarantee during the appeal. If it ends up losing, it would owe the fine plus interest.
In addition to the  fine, two remedies requiring  Microsoft to change its behaviour will be approved on
Wednesday.

One will require that  Microsoft's licenses at a reasonable fee more information so that rival makers of low-end servers can make their software as compatible with the Windows operating system as Microsoft's own servers.

The other will require it to sell two versions of its Windows XP operating system to computer makers, one stripped of audiovisual software.
The Commission argues that  Microsoft has bundled an audiovisual player to damage such rivals as
RealNetworks (RNWK.O) RealPlayer and Apple Computer (AAPL.O) Quicktime.

NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks to watch:

MICROSOFT CORP. (MSFT.O)

TD
The European Union slapped  Microsoft on Wednesday with a record  fine for violating EU antitrust law, and ordered the software company to take immediate steps to stop harming its rivals. The European Commission levied a record 497.2 million euros ($611.8 million)  fine, ordered the unbundling of Windows Media Player within 90 days, and required that "complete and accurate" information be given
to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days.  Microsoft shares ended at $24.15 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq.
BED BATH & BEYOND INC. (BBBY.O)

Credit Suisse First Boston said on Wednesday it raised its recommendation on Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, to "outperform" from "neutral". Its shares ended at $38.80.
BEST BUY CO. INC. (BBY.N)
Credit Suisse First Boston said on Wednesday it raised its recommendation on electronics retailer Best
Buy to "outperform" from "neutral." Best Buy shares ended at $45.61.
TYSON FOODS INC. (TSN.N)

Tyson, the nation's largest meat producer, said late Tuesday a federal judge presiding over an Alabama-based class-action lawsuit denied a motion to enter a $1.28 billion judgment against the company. In February, a jury found that Tyson manipulated the cattle market, and must change its buying practices. The lawsuit was brought by cattle producers who accused Tyson of using privately contracted supplies of cattle bought outside daily auctions as leverage against market prices. Tyson shares ended at $17.97 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
PMC-SIERRA INC. (PMCS.O)

PMC-Sierra, a maker of high-speed Internet and storage semiconductors, said after Tuesday's close its quarterly revenue would be at the higher end of its previously announced estimates. PMC-Sierra forecast first-quarter revenue above the mid-point of a revenue range of $77 million to $79 million. Wall Street had pegged first-quarter revenue of $78.17 million, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
PMC-Sierra shares closed at $15.94.
RED HAT INC. (RHAT.O)

Red Hat, a leading Linux software distributor, posted after Tuesday's close higher quarterly earnings, and also forecast current-quarter sales above the most bullish Wall Street estimate. Red Hat, which provides software updates and support services for the free Linux operating system, said its
current-quarter sales would be stronger than expected due to the success of distribution deals with major computer hardware vendors. Its shares ended at $19.41.

AMSTERDAM, March 24 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's ruling that  Microsoft (MSFT.O) has abused its huge market power is good for consumers, as it could boost competiton and lead to price cuts for its Windows operating system, consumer groups said on Wednesday.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined Microsoft 497.2 million euros ($611.2 million) and said the firm can no longer integrate its digital media player with the core Windows software.

TD
Microsoft has said it will fight the decision in the European courts, a process which could delay some remedial actions demanded by the Commission, but while the legal battle could take many years Microsoft will have to take Media Player out of Windows much sooner, possibly later this year or early next year.

It would give media players from rivals like RealNetworks (RNWK.O), Apple Computer (AAPL.O) and others more room to compete in the emerging digital media age. "This ruling will offer consumers more choice," said Jim Murray, director of the European consumer interests groups Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC).

He also expects price falls for Windows, the key software that operates 95 percent of all personal computers.

"The logic of the Commission is that this ruling should make (Windows) cheaper, because it will bring more competition. A lack of  competition results in higher prices," Murray added.

The remedy ordered by the Commission to uncouple Media Player from Windows should be implemented within 90 days. Other common interest groups also welcomed the decision.

"This ruling will no longer allow  Microsoft to charge the prices they charge now," said Andreas Dietl, the head of the Brussels office of European Digital Rights, an interest group which seeks to protect digital content against piracy.
WHAT IS A FAIR PRICE?

Dietl said he could not predict by how much the price of Windows might fall but the price of a computer product was determined by the extent to which consumers were locked into one system. When Microsoft integrates more features that people need, such as Media Player, it ties customers to its software.

"And the harder it is to move to another system, the more expensive it will be," Dietl said. He pointed to Microsoft's $50-billion cash pile, the result of fat profits on its Windows and Office products which are de facto standards for anyone using a computer.

Microsoft has said its products might be more expensive than some rival programmes but it offers more functionality. It argues that the integration of the latest software like Media Player makes the lives of consumers easier.

Consumer interest group BEUC said most consumers never change the default media player, usually Windows Media Player, when they listen to a CD, download music from the Internet or watch a video clip.

"Unless you're technologically inclined, most consumers will just use Windows Media Player," Murray said. The ruling should now be followed up by easy ways for consumers to get and install alternative media players, analysts said. European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the ruling also established "clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position".

Some analysts were doubtful that this one ruling could change  Microsoft's behaviour forever, but said it was a sign that the computer industry and governments had recognised they needed a fundamental solution to prevent market dominance in an area which has become vital to today's companies and consumers.

"This ruling should act as a wake-up call for international debate and, possibly international treaties," said Neil Ward Dutton, an analyst with Ovum.
Consumer groups are already worried about the next Windows version, codenamed Longhorn, due in
2006. It contains a new system to store digital content, including documents, film, music, pictures and
presentations.

Microsoft says the new system makes it easier for consumers to operate, but consumer advocates fear that it will force everyone to use the same software to swap and use files.

"The lock-in mechanism will be even stronger than in today's Windows," Dietl said. (Additional reporting by Bernhard Warner).

HD           UPDATE 3-EU orders Microsoft to end abuse of monopoly. BY           By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - European Union regulators ordered U.S. software giant  Microsoft Corp on Wednesday to pay a record  fine for violating EU  antitrust law and change its business model fundamentally to stop crushing rivals.

The European Commission said Microsoft must act within four months to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers used in millions of offices in Europe a fairer chance to compete "because the illegal behaviour is still going on."

TD
The Commission - enforcer of EU  competition law - levied a record 497.2 million euros ($611.8 million) fine, ordered the unbundling of Windows Media Player within 90 days and required that "complete and accurate" information be given to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days.

"Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the market concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position,"
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

In a historic decision mirroring a U.S. appeals court finding, the Commission described Windows, which runs on more than 95 percent of all personal computers, as a "near monopoly".

Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith called the decision "unfortunate", vowed to challenge it in the EU courts and said he would seek the suspension of the key sanction that it must sell an alternative version of Windows stripped of Media Player.
He forecast four or five years of litigation but said he still hoped to reach a mutual settlement with
Brussels.

Settlement talks collapsed last week because the two sides were unable to agree on commitments about Microsoft's future business practices.

"We believe the proposed settlement would have been better for European consumers," the company said.

Stock markets had little reaction to the decision with  Microsoft shares broadly steady in Frankfurt and on Instinet from their Tuesday close.
DECISION WATERTIGHT

Rebutting  Microsoft's key objections, Monti declared: "We are not expropriating  Microsoft's intellectual property. We are also not breaking new legal ground, neither in Europe nor for the United States."

After an exhaustive five-year probe, in which the EU executive sent  Microsoft three statements of objections to its practices, the company could not credibly argue it was not aware it could be violating EU law, he said.


Page 123 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The grey-haired Italian former economics professor expressed confidence that the decision would withstand any appeal by  Microsoft to the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice.

Rejecting criticism that the  fine was peanuts for a company with a $53 billion cash pile, he said the ruling would act as a deterrent and set a precedent that could be used in private lawsuits against the company.

The Commission will appoint a special monitoring trustee to ensure that  Microsoft's disclosures to rivals are "complete and accurate and that the two versions of Windows are equivalent in terms of performance".

Monti said the decision gave manufacturers freedom to choose which software they installed in personal computers to play films and music, and did not mean consumers would get PCs and operating systems without a media player.

It contained provisions barring  Microsoft from circumventing the ruling, for example by offering discounts to computer makers which installed the version of Windows with Media Player.
The Commission ruled that  Microsoft bundled its own audiovisual player to damage such rivals as
RealNetworks RealPlayer and Apple Computer Quicktime.
DEFINING MOMENT

Monti said the landmark decision, the defining moment in his five-year term which ends in October, would also set a framework for quicker decisions in pending investigations into  Microsoft's Windows XP operating system, and all future probes, even if each would be handled on its merits.

The decision to go for a broad remedy follows a decade of investigations and settlements on narrow issues without any formal findings against the software firm.

A U.S. appeals court ruled unanimously in a final 2001 decision that Microsoft broke antitrust rule, but critics say the remedies there failed to encourage vigorous competition.
The Commission fine exceeds the record 462 million euro penalty imposed on Switzerland's
Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel.

Nonetheless, it amounts to slightly more than one percent of  Microsoft's roughly $53 billion cash on hand. On January 22 it projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current quarter.

HD          NEWSMAKER-EU's Monti determined to change Microsoft ways. BY          By David Milliken

BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - European competition czar Mario Monti made regulatory history on Wednesday when he ordered U.S. software giant Microsoft to pay a record fine and radically change its business model to stop crushing rivals.

The European Commission's marathon antitrust case against Microsoft has been the defining event in Monti's five-year term as EU Competition Commissioner, which ends on October 31.

TD
The deadpan Italian former economics professor, who turned 61 last Friday, showed his determination to change the U.S. firm's business practices after past deals struck by his predecessors failed to alter Microsoft's ways.

"We're here to defend the welfare interest of consumers on European territory," said Monti, who rejected a tantalising settlement offer from  Microsoft last week because of his insistence on setting a precedent for future behaviour.

The full 20-member Commission ruled  Microsoft had abused its dominant market position,  fined the company 497.2 million euros ($611.8 million) and ordered it to change the way it sells and licences software to give rivals a fairer chance to compete.

The courteous, grey-haired Monti has not flinched from confronting the world's biggest companies and some of Europe's most intransigent governments.
Aside from taking on  Microsoft, he blocked U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co's takeover of
Honeywell International in 2001, drawing political flak from the United States.

When fabled GE boss Jack Welch tried to sweet-talk Monti by urging him to "Call me Jack", the austere commissioner replied that he would happily do so once the case was over.

He challenged French government aid to state-owned utility Electricite de France and troubled engineering firm Alstom, and forced conglomerate Lagardere to sell key assets before he would approve its government-favoured takeover of Vivendi Universal's publishing arm.
NON-IDEOLOGICAL?
But Monti, the only serving commissioner who did not have a political career before joining the EU
executive, has always defined his work as non-ideological.

Summing up his tenure, he told the European Parliament in February that economic liberals and socialists alike could share his goals of lower prices and more choice for consumers.

While few could dispute those ends, individual decisions by Monti's  competition authority have come under attack.

The European Court of Justice has ruled three times in the last two years that the Commission overreached its powers when blocking mergers. Two of the decisions were on Monti's watch.

Page 129 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Luxembourg-based judges also found that the Commission had insufficient evidence to  fine a group of ocean shippers 273 million euros for price fixing.

There is doubt too over whether regulators can act speedily enough to be effective in fast-moving high tech markets.

Routine competition work should go more smoothly once new EU legislation proposed by Monti after regulators became swamped during the merger wave of the late 1990s comes into force in May. Monti also prides himself on forging closer coperation with U.S.  antitrust authorities, and on shaking up EU antitrust law.

The competition department's commercially sensitive work means Monti keeps a profile more like a guarded central banker than that of his more political Commission colleagues.
He has made clear he would be keen to stay in Brussels and take another Commission portfolio in
November, perhaps the role of Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner.

But political sources in Rome said Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was under pressure to appoint a coalition politician, European Affairs Minister Rocco Buttiglione, in his place.

At the same time, Ballmer said that  Microsoft would continue to pursue a settlement. "We remain hopeful that we may be able to resume discussions," he said.

Brad Smith,  Microsoft's general counsel said "we will ask the court to suspend many or all of the sanctions."

HD           Microsoft unveils  new mobile, speech software. WC         430 words

SAN FRANCISCO, March 24 (Reuters) - Chairman Bill Gates unveiled on Wednesday  Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT.O) latest foray into business computing with Speech Server 2004 and an updated version of its software for mobile phones.

The world's largest software maker has been expanding its product offerings as it targets a wider base of business customers, but its efforts so far have been overshadowed by the wide reach of its Windows, Office and server software for networked computers.

TD
"There's a huge range of scenarios that this new speech capability will be used for," Gates told an audience of developers at a conference in San Francisco.
Gates made no reference to Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to pay a record
497 million euro ($606 million)  fine for violating EU antitrust law and to give competitors in
audio-visual software and servers a fairer chance to compete "because the illegal behavior is still going
on."

Redmond, Washington-based  Microsoft's new Speech Server, based on natural language recognition technology developed over the past several years, is a software platform for networked computers that allows other software developers to create programs tailored to their needs.

The No. 1 use of speech server technology is expected to be for companies setting up call centers with automated voice and touch-tone menus to provide customers service,  Microsoft said.

Information technology departments are also expected to use the speech server to provide internal support functions, such as password resetting and help for computer users.
In addition,  Microsoft unveiled an updated version of its cell phone software, called Windows Mobile
2003 Second Edition, which adds features such as better screen management and resolution, as well
as support for phones with built-in keyboards.

Gates also unveiled new software releases of  Microsoft's tools for other software developers to create programs that run on top of its Windows and server software products.

"We don't' see ourselves backing off in terms of large research and development investments in these areas," Gates said.

Microsoft has also been trying to get more wireless carriers and mobile phone manufacturers to use its cell phone software. Although it says 37 handset maker are developing phones with  Microsoft software, only Motorola Inc. (MOT.N) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. offer phones in the United States featuring Windows Mobile.

"We are certainly at the early stage of the market and an industry that is beginning to accept us more and more," said Ed Suwanjindar, lead product manager for  Microsoft's mobile and embedded software group.

HD           Security  software  makers rally on Microsoft ruling. WC          335 words

NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - Shares of security software companies rallied on Wednesday as investors decided that the  European Commission's sanctions on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) make the world's largest software provider less likely to wade into the fast-growing antivirus market.

Symantec Corp. , best known for its Norton antivirus and firewall products, rose as much as 4.7 percent. RSA Security Inc. (RSAS.O), which sells network security software, soared 7.6 percent.

TD
Investors were worried about  Microsoft crushing those companies by bundling security software with its dominant Windows operating systems after it bought antivirus technology from Romanian company GeCAD Software Srl last June.

On Wednesday, European regulators slapped a record  fine on Microsoft and ordered it to offer computer manufacturers a separate Windows version that does not include its Windows Media Player audio-visual product.

"The EU ruling makes it unlikely that Microsoft will get into the consumer virus market," said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Joel Fishbein. "The antitrust environment is going to make it very unlikely that Microsoft will be able to play in that market."

Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is a favorite target for computer viruses, launched a company-wide "Trustworthy Computing" campaign in early 2002 to boost the security and reliability of its software.

Nitsan Hargil, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey, said the  Microsoft threat may have been overblown because Microsoft is more interested in protecting its lucrative Windows monopoly than profiting from the burgeoning security software market.

"Microsoft does not want to be blamed when the inevitable (computer security) attacks do occur," he said. "Right now  Microsoft has the benefit to say we sold you the operating system, go blame the security vendors."
The security software market has been growing rapidly after a slew of virus attacks last year. Shares of Symantec rose $1.45, or 3.4 percent, to $43.44. RSA Security was up 85 cents, or 5.6
percent, to $16.05, in afternoon trade.

HD           UPDATE 1-US Senate leader slams EU over Microsoft ruling. WC           305 words

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate majority leader on Wednesday attacked the decision by European regulators to impose stiff  antitrust sanctions on Microsoft Corp. and expressed fears of a trans-Atlantic trade war.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Republican from Tennessee, said the requirement that  Microsoft
(MSFT.O) change the way it designs and sells its Windows operating system was "preposterous."

TD
"I now fear that the U.S. and the EU are heading toward a new trade war - and that the commission's ruling against Microsoft is the first shot," Frist said.

His comments were the strongest so far from a U.S. lawmaker and were reminiscent of the storm of criticism that erupted in 2001 when European regulators rejected General Electric Co.'s (GE.N) proposed purchase of Honeywell International Inc. (HON.N).
EU regulators ordered  Microsoft to pay a record 497 million euro ($606 million)  fine for violating EU
antitrust law and change its business model to stop crushing rivals.
The European sanctions against  Microsoft are stronger than those contained in a settlement U.S.
antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department reached with  Microsoft in 2001.

Specifically, the  European Commission ordered Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player and take other steps to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers a fairer chance to compete.
The Justice Department, which had lobbied the commission not to impose stricter sanctions on
Microsoft, had no immediate comment on the decision on Wednesday.
The commission ruled that  Microsoft bundled its own audiovisual player to damage such rivals as
RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK.O) RealPlayer and Apple Computer Inc.'s (AAPL.O) Quicktime.

Microsoft has vowed to appeal the European ruling in court and seek a suspension of the order.

WASHINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust chief said on Wednesday that the huge  fine European regulators imposed on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) was "unfortunate" and other sanctions against the company could have "unintended consequences."

While avoiding direct criticism of the European Commission, Assistant Attorney General Hewitt Pate warned against "protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

TD
Pate's statement came after EU regulators ordered  Microsoft to pay a record 497 million euro ($606 million) fine for violating EU  antitrust law and change its business model to stop crushing rivals.
The European sanctions against  Microsoft are stronger than those contained in a settlement U.S.
antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department reached with  Microsoft in 2001.

Specifically, the commission ordered  Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player and take other steps to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers a fairer chance to compete.

Pate said forcing the removal of the media player from Windows, including its underlying computer code, was a break from the Justice Department's approach.

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies," Pate said in the statement.

Pate also expressed reservations about the size of the  fine imposed on Microsoft, noting it was the largest antitrust fine ever imposed.

"For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the most notorious price-fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities," Pate said.

Still, Pate said the department will continue to work cooperatively with EU  antitrust enforcers, and he said they still have an "overall strong and positive relationship."

While avoiding direct criticism of the European Commission, Assistant Attorney General Hewitt Pate warned against "protecting competitors, not competition, in ways that may ultimately harm innovation and the consumers that benefit from it."

Pate's statement came after EU regulators ordered  Microsoft to pay a record 497 million euro ($606 million) fine for violating EU  antitrust law and change its business model to stop crushing rivals.
The European sanctions against  Microsoft are stronger than those contained in a settlement U.S.
antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department reached with  Microsoft in 2001.

Specifically, the commission ordered  Microsoft to sell a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player and take other steps to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers a fairer chance to compete.

Pate said forcing the removal of the media player from Windows, including its underlying computer code, was a break from the Justice Department's approach.

"Sound  antitrust policy must avoid chilling innovation and  competition even by 'dominant' companies," Pate said in the statement.

Pate also expressed reservations about the size of the  fine imposed on Microsoft, noting it was the largest antitrust fine ever imposed.

"For this  fine to surpass even the  fines levied against members of the most notorious price-fixing cartels may send an unfortunate message about the appropriate hierarchy of enforcement priorities," Pate said.

Still, Pate said the department will continue to work cooperatively with EU  antitrust enforcers, and he said they still have an "overall strong and positive relationship."

As expected, the European Commission on Wednesday came down hard on Microsoft after a long antitrust investigation.

Regulators imposed a  fine of more than $600 million and demanded changes to some of the company's software applications. This is the summary of the commission's ruling:

TD
Brussels, 24 March 2004

Commission concludes on Microsoft investigation, imposes conduct remedies and a fine
The European Commission has concluded, after a
five-year investigation, that Microsoft Corporation broke
European Union competition law by leveraging its near
monopoly in the market for PC operating systems (OS)
onto the markets for work group server operating
systems(1) and for media players(2). Because the illegal
behaviour is still ongoing, the Commission has ordered
Microsoft to disclose to competitors, within 120 days,
the interfaces(3) required for their products to be able to
'talk' with the ubiquitous Windows OS.  Microsoft is also
required, within 90 days, to offer a version of its
Windows OS without Windows Media Player to PC
manufacturers (or when selling directly to end users). In
addition,  Microsoft is fined € 497 million for abusing its
market power in the EU.

"Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent competition on the merits and does not harm consumers and innovation" said European  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "Today's decision restores the conditions for fair  competition in the markets concerned and establish clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position," he added.

After an exhaustive and extensive investigation of more than five years and three statements of objections(4), the Commission has today taken a decision finding that US software company  Microsoft Corporation has
Page 147 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
violated the EU Treaty's  competition rules by abusing its near monopoly(5) (Article 82) in the PC operating system.

Microsoft abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows PCs and non-Microsoft work group servers, and by tying its Windows Media Player (WMP), a product where it faced competition, with its ubiquitous Windows operating system.

This illegal conduct has enabled  Microsoft to acquire a dominant position in the market for work group server operating systems, which are at the heart of corporate IT networks, and risks eliminating competition altogether
in that market. In addition, Microsoft's conduct has significantly weakened competition on the media player market.

The ongoing abuses act as a brake on innovation and harm the competitive process and consumers, who ultimately end up with less choice and facing higher prices.

For these very serious abuses, which have been ongoing for five and a half years, the Commission has imposed a fine of € 497.2 million.
Remedies
In order to restore the conditions of fair  competition, the
Commission has imposed the following remedies:

• As regards interoperability,  Microsoft is required, within 120 days, to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow
non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers. This will enable rival vendors to develop products that can compete on a level playing field in the work group server operating system market. The disclosed information will have to be updated each time  Microsoft brings to the market new versions of its relevant products.

• To the extent that any of this interface information might be protected by intellectual property in the European Economic Area(6),  Microsoft would be entitled to reasonable remuneration. The disclosure order concerns the interface documentation only, and not the Windows source code, as this is not necessary to achieve the development of interoperable products.

• As regards tying,  Microsoft is required, within 90 days, to offer to PC manufacturers a version of its Windows client PC operating system without WMP. The un-tying remedy does not mean that consumers will obtain PCs and operating systems without media players. Most consumers purchase a PC from a PC manufacturer
which has already put together on their behalf a bundle of an operating system and a media player. As a result of the Commission's remedy, the configuration of such bundles will reflect what consumers want, and not what Microsoft imposes.

• Microsoft retains the right to offer a version of its Windows client PC operating system product with WMP. However, Microsoft must refrain from using any

Page 148 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
commercial, technological or contractual terms that would have the effect of rendering the unbundled version of Windows less attractive or performing. In particular, it must not give PC manufacturers a discount
conditional on their buying Windows together with WMP.

The Commission believes the remedies will bring the antitrust violations to an end, that they are proportionate, and that they establish clear principles for the future conduct of the company.

To ensure effective and timely compliance with this decision, the Commission will appoint a Monitoring Trustee, which will, inter alia, oversee that  Microsoft's interface disclosures are complete and accurate, and
that the two versions of Windows are equivalent in terms of performance.
The investigation

In December 1998, Sun Microsystems, another US company, complained that  Microsoft had refused to provide interface information necessary for Sun to be able to develop products that would "talk" properly with the ubiquitous Windows PCs, and hence be able to compete on an equal footing in the market for work group server operating systems.

The Commission's investigation revealed that Sun was not the only company that had been refused this information, and that these non-disclosures by Microsoft were part of a broader strategy designed to shut competitors out of the market.

This relegated to a secondary position  competition in terms of reliability, security and speed, among other factors, and ensured  Microsoft's success on the market. As a result, an overwhelming majority of customers informed the Commission that  Microsoft's
non-disclosure of interface information artificially altered their choice in favour of Microsoft's server products. Survey responses submitted by Microsoft itself confirmed the link between the interoperability advantage that  Microsoft reserved for itself and its growing market shares.

In 2000, the Commission enlarged its investigation, on its own initiative, to study the effects of the tying of Microsoft's Windows Media Player with the company's Windows 2000 PC operating system.

This part of the investigation concluded that the ubiquity which was immediately afforded to WMP as a result of it being tied with the Windows PC OS artificially reduces the incentives of music, film and other media
companies, as well software developers and content providers to develop their offerings to competing media players.

As a result,  Microsoft's tying of its media player product has the effect of foreclosing the market to competitors, and hence ultimately reducing consumer choice, since competing products are set at a disadvantage which is not related to their price or quality.
Available data already show a clear trend in favour of
WMP and Windows Media technology. Absent

Page 149 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
intervention from the Commission, the tying of WMP with Windows is likely to make the market "tip" definitively in  Microsoft's favour. This would allow Microsoft to control related markets in the digital media sector, such as encoding technology, software for broadcasting of music over the Internet and digital rights management etc.

More generally, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft's tying of WMP is an example of a more general business model which, given  Microsoft's virtual monopoly in PC operating systems, deters innovation and reduces consumer choice in any technologies which Microsoft could conceivably take interest in and tie with Windows in the future.
Note to editors

The European Commission enforces EU  competition rules on restrictive business practices and abuses of monopoly power for the whole of the European Union when cross-border trade and  competition are affected.

The Commission has the power to force changes in company behaviour and to impose financial penalties for antitrust violations of up to 10% of their annual turnover worldwide.
Commission decisions can be appealed to the European
Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

(1) These are operating systems running on central network computers that provide services to office workers around the world in their day-to-day work such as file and printer sharing, security and user identity management.

(2) A media player is a software product that is able to play back music and video content over the Internet.

(3) The interfaces do not concern the Windows source code as this is not necessary to achieve the development of interoperable products. The interfaces are the hooks at the edge of the source code which allow one product to talk to another.

(4) A Statement of Objections marks the opening of a formal investigation as the Commission states its charges or objections to the company(ies) concerned.
(5) Microsoft's operating systems equip more than 95%
of the world's personal computers.
(6) The European Union plus Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein.

After more than five years of investigation, the  European Commission has fined Microsoft almost
€500m for monopolistic abuses and given it four months to make life easier for competitors in the server
and media-player markets. But with a long-winded appeal inevitable, the punishment may prove
ineffectual, says The Economist

TD
It is headline-grabbing stuff: a  fine of €497m (US$612m)—the European Union’s biggest ever for an antitrust violation. As importantly, the EU has required that Microsoft make far-reaching changes in its behaviour. But many worry that the punishments handed down by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, on Wednesday March 24th will have little effect. Microsoft will apply for an immediate injunction against the commission’s decision and will appeal. This process could take five years, a lifetime in the fast-moving world of computer software. And, in the meantime,  Microsoft has its sights set on the Google search engine, just as in the past it has targeted Lotus’s spreadsheet, Netscape’s browser, Sun Microsystems’ servers and RealNetworks’ media player.

In addition to the record  fine, the EU has demanded that  Microsoft do two things to make life easier for its rivals: it must produce a Windows package that excludes Windows Media Player within 90 days; and, within 120 days, it must make available a chunk of code for Windows, so that rival server manufacturers can design network computers that will work smoothly with the 90%-plus of PCs that run on Windows operating software.

Microsoft has protested against the  fine and these demands, saying that a settlement rejected by the EU's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, would have been better for consumers. (Many expect Microsoft to continue to push for a settlement, despite the ruling, perhaps once the appeal is under way.) Anticipating the  fine, Patty Murray, a senator from  Microsoft's home state of Washington, described the EU's sanctions as “a hostile act with severe consequences for the global economy”. It is not the first time that Mr Monti has irked Americans. There was an outcry three years ago when he blocked the merger of General Electric and Honeywell after American regulators had given it the go-ahead.

Microsoft's forays into a succession of new markets have landed it on the wrong side of  antitrust authorities on both sides of the Atlantic many times before. During the late 1990s, the company fought an aggressive antitrust suit from America’s Department of Justice. The department argued, as European competition regulators are now doing, that  Microsoft was abusing its dominance in the PC
operating-software market in order to expand into other markets. The other market in that case was the one for Internet browsers, then dominated by Netscape. The case led to a groundbreaking judgment, in
2000, that the only solution was a break-up of  Microsoft into two companies: one making the Windows operating software, and one making the applications that run on it. That way, there would be no reason for the maker of Windows to favour products like  Microsoft Office or the firm’s Internet Explorer browser at the expense of rivals’ products.

However, that judgment was reversed in 2001 after the Clinton administration, which had adopted an aggressive antitrust stance, was replaced by a more business-friendly Bush administration. The new judgment cancelled the break-up, and instead insisted on “behavioural remedies”.  Microsoft was to allow PC-makers to carry browsers other than Internet Explorer, for instance, but the company could still bundle any product it wished into Windows. It is telling that many of the complaints that have driven the European case against Microsoft arose after this judgment, suggesting that the American remedies had little effect on its behaviour.

Page 152 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The European case was sparked by a 1998 complaint by Sun Microsystems, which alleged that  Microsoft was not sharing code from its PC operating systems, making it difficult for Sun to make servers that interacted smoothly with Windows when  Microsoft was itself trying to enter the server market. The case was later broadened so that, like America’s, it concerned the bundling of  Microsoft's application software—in this case, Media Player—with the Windows operating system. RealNetworks, then the dominant maker of PC audio-visual software, claimed that this clobbered demand for its product, which many considered to be better than  Microsoft’s. RealNetworks’ share of this market has since fallen
behind that of Windows Media Player.

RealNetworks and Sun are both pursuing separate legal actions against Microsoft in America. Furthermore, thousands of consumers have joined class-action suits. Though Microsoft has now settled many of these, the first class-action suit to come to trial is currently before a judge in Minnesota; the plaintiffs are seeking more than US$400m in damages due to alleged overcharging.  Microsoft took the diplomatic step of apologising for past wrongdoings in the opening of its defence. But many—including the EU—see the company as a persistent offender that has wriggled out of settlement after settlement.
More bark than bite

But even if the EU is successful in setting a legal precedent, will it have any practical effect in the market? The requirement that  Microsoft open access to its interoperability code will apply only to Windows 2000, not to the more recent Windows XP, which is being dealt with in a separate case. As for media players, even if Microsoft does offer cheaper, stripped-down versions of Windows, will PC-makers want them? Even a discount of, say, US$10—a substantial cut in  Microsoft’s average package price of around US$50—would barely make a dent in the US$1,000 cost of the average PC. And European consumers might feel that they are being offered a second-class product. When offered a choice between Windows with and without Internet Explorer after the American settlement, few PC-makers went without.

Most important of all is what the ruling will mean for  Microsoft's plans to conquer yet more markets. The company is believed to be integrating an Internet search facility like Google (which Bill Gates greatly admires) into its new version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. The  European Commission has not specifically banned any further bundling—it says this will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps this week's ruling will prove strong enough to stop  Microsoft from tying its products to Windows in order to storm new markets. But if the past is a guide, that seems unlikely. And with the appeal process set to last for years, it is hard to see  Microsoft being swayed from its usual strategy: bundle now, litigate later.

TED TAKES OFF TO CHICAGO: United Airlines' low-fare division, Ted, will start flying between Tampa International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International on May 24. By early June, all five regular United flights on the route will be replaced by Ted, which flies A320 Airbus aircraft with coach-only service. The cabins will have a 66-seat Economy Plus section with four inches of extra leg room.

RUMORS PUMP WINN-DIXIE STOCK: Shares of Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. soared as high as 15 percent on Tuesday after thedeal.com, an online mergers and acquisitions tip sheet, reported the Davis family that controls the struggling supermarket chain is interested in taking the company private. The report quoted unnamed sources. The Jacksonville company, which has a policy of not discussing speculation, declined comment, and analysts discounted the report. Winn-Dixie shares closed at $8.08, up 73 cents.

POSTAL WORKERS SUE FOR OT: Three Tampa postal workers and one retiree have sued the U.S. Postal Service in federal court in Tampa, claiming electronic records of their work hours were routinely altered to cheat them out of overtime pay. The lawsuit filed by Gary Stone, Duane Dosal, Connie Blackburn and Dean Albrecht in January asks for class action status, saying more than 200,000 postal workers could be affected. They accuse the Postal Service of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act, racketeering and privacy breaches. A postal service official declined to comment.

ELECTRIC RATE PROPOSAL IN DOUBT: A Florida legislative panel approved a plan backed by Gov. Jeb Bush to allow Progress Energy and Florida Power & Light to freeze electric rates for seven years to finance environmental upgrades at their energy plants, including Progress Energy's Crystal River and Anclote plants. But the measure's future is in doubt. Several members of the House Natural Resources Committee expressed concerns about the freeze. And several of the state's biggest energy customers, including Publix, told the committee they oppose a freeze when energy costs are up because of higher fuel costs.

PETCO BUYS FLORIDA STORES: Petco Animal Supplies Inc. agreed to acquire 20 former Kids "R'' Us stores from Office Depot Inc. for about $45-million plus lease obligations. The stores are concentrated
in Florida and Ohio, with other locations in Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and New York. The stores are part of the 124 Kids "R'' Us properties Office Depot agreed to purchase from Toys "R'' Us Inc. this month. A Petco spokesman would not give exact locations.

DAIMLER DROPS BOARD PAY PLAN: Automaker DaimlerChrysler said Tuesday it was dropping a proposal to pay members of the board of directors according to how well the company's stock fares, saying it could conflict with a recent court decision. The company had proposed to cut board members' pay by 25 percent and then introduce a system that would link part of their compensation to stock price increases. "It cannot be ruled out that the court would view a variable form of supervisory board compensation based on the stock price as generally inadmissible,'' the company said in a statement.

MICROSOFT PREPARES ITS APPEAL: In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union of overreaching Tuesday by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615-million for alleged antitrust abuses. Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's reported fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the

European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft does about 30 percent of its business in Europe. The company also argued it could not have known its behavior would infringe EU law and thus it should not be  fined at all.

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: The European Union`s decision against Microsoft sparking a transatlantic controversy. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is calling the decision preposterous, saying it could lead to a trade war. Here with the latest is Katharine Barrett from Microsoft`s headquarters in Redmond, Washington - Katharine.

KATHARINE BARRETT, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Microsoft is of course disappointed, somewhat frustrated that they`re having to go through this antitrust ground again in Europe when they thought they had put it behind them in the United States. But they`re also determined to reverse this decision. Now here`s what the  European Commission has levied against  Microsoft today. As we said a record find of
$613 million though that`s really just pocket change for a company with $53 billion in cash in the bank.

Also, within 90 days  Microsoft must offer a version of its Windows operating system without its Windows media player. That is it must unbundle its Windows media player from the operating system. Also it must share code with competing computer server makers within 120 days. The European Union`s  competition commissioner says that these swift changes are necessary to stop  Microsoft from continuing its illegal practices.

MARIO MONTI, E.U. : We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the market place. We are saying that consumers and PC hardware manufacturers ought to be able to decide which media player software they want to preinstall in their computers.

STEVE BALLMER, CEO,  MICROSOFT: There`s an important principle at stake in this case. We believe that every company should have the ability to improve its products to meet the needs of consumers. The commission`s actions would essentially freeze our technology where it is today and that`s not good for consumers or for software developers. We will continue to work in good faith to try to address the commission`s concern while protecting the principle of innovation.

BARRETT:  Microsoft of course plans an immediate legal appeal. More important perhaps than lifting that record fine though is blocking the application of those unbundling and code sharing penalties. The way Microsoft sees it, tying new services seamlessly in with its operating system is the key to the way to enhance its products and offer upgrades of its current Windows software. The appeals process if it succeeds in lifting the penalties early, could drag on for anywhere from three to five years - Christine.
ROMANS: All right, In Redmond, Washington, thank you, Katharine.

HD           Microsoft angered by EU's 'harsh'  Euro 497m fine

Microsoft accused the EU of heavy-handedness yesterday as the software giant braced itself for a record Euro 497 million (Pounds 269 million)  fine for anti-competitive behaviour.

The company expressed anger that the penalty, due to be handed down today, would take into account its US operations, which have already been approved by American  antitrust regulators.

TD
Tom Brookes, a spokesman for  Microsoft said: "We think that is pretty unprecedented."

The group also complained that the  fine -the highest penalty imposed on a company by the EU -was harsh, given that  Microsoft had not intentionally broken the law.

"The regulations on these things stipulate that a company can only be  fined if it knows its activities are likely to infringe European  competition law," the spokesman said. "The EU has made it clear it is
trying to set a precedent here. If there is no precedent, there is nothing in the statute books that
Microsoft could have read that would have indicated to us that we were breaking the rules."

These two lines of defence are likely to underpin  Microsoft's appeal against the EU ruling. Although Mr Brookes insisted yesterday that the company would wait until it had seen the ruling before making any decisions, Microsoft is widely expected to challenge the EU findings. The company has two months and ten days to lodge an appeal at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

While the appeal, which could take up to seven years, is in process,  Microsoft is likely to seek a suspension order to stop the EU's remedies from taking immediate effect.

The expected  fine follows a five-year investigation by the  European Commission into Microsoft's business practices. The Commission has focused on two lines of inquiry in its long-running battle against Microsoft.

The first is whether  Microsoft has illegally exploited the monopoly of Windows, its operating system, by bundling its Media Player software into it, stifling  competition from Apple Computer's QuickTime software and RealNetwork's RealPlayer.

Even as Microsoft criticised the level of the  fine yesterday, analysts said it would represent little more than a "parking ticket" to the group, which has $53 billion in the bank.

Of more concern to the software giant will be the precedent that the ruling sets for its future business practices. The EU is expected to force  Microsoft to sell two versions of Windows in Europe, one with Media Player and one without.

Microsoft is thought to do about 30 per cent of its business in Europe and about 40 per cent in the US. The fine will go towards the EU's central budget.
All 15 EU member states backed the record  fine on Monday, but the figure could still be revised by the
20 European commissioners when they meet this morning.

Until today the biggest  fine over EU competition issues was the Euro 462 million that was imposed on
Hoffmann-La Roche for its part in a vitamins cartel.

Commission fines are determined by factors such as the gravity of the offence, the turnover of the company concerned and the time for which the offence continued.

THEY can have any colour as long as it is black. Thus, Henry Ford famously rubbished consumer choice. The founder of the motor industry was concerned with volume, not the irritating distraction and expense of variety. He wanted every car rolling down the highway to be one of his creations, an ambition never fulfilled.

A century later, however, Bill Gates has come close to world domination with his computer operating system and there are indications that the  Microsoft ideologues are taking the occasional leaf from the book of Ford.

TD
The European Commission will today impose a hefty  fine against Microsoft for bundling its Media Player software into sales of its Windows operating system to the detriment of rival makers of media software. In the jargon of EU  competition law, Microsoft has abused its dominant position, contrary to Article 82 of the EU treaty.

What nonsense, say  Microsoft advocates as they prepare the intellectual battleground for the appeal to the European Court of Justice. Asking  Microsoft to sell Windows without Media Player is like asking Ford to sell a car without a radio, the argument goes.

Well, why not? Suppose you like the Ford Focus but hate the built-in radio? Fortunately, there are as many models of cars as there are brands of radio so choice is not a big problem. It is, however, a problem for buyers of PCs as Windows dominates the industry.

And it is not just PCs; suppose that Ford was a conglomerate that not only made cars but owned media businesses. Suppose that its car entertainment system automatically channelled you to Ford FM, a music station, guided you to your destination by Ford satellite navigation and linked your car phone to Ford Mobile Communications. Well,  Microsoft is halfway there. Last year it launched a software platform for motor manufacturers, offering hands-free mobile phones, real-time traffic updates and access to internet news and weather services.
Within  Microsoft's frantic lobbying efforts is the kernel of a transatlantic political argument, similar to
that used by General Electric when its acquisition of Honeywell was prohibited by the European           
Commission. Microsoft is beginning to say that horrid totalitarian EU law is trampling American free
enterprise.

Yesterday  Microsoft's counsel complained that the Commission was seeking to impose a  fine on Microsoft's US operations when those operations were already regulated by US law. A spurious argument given the size of the  fine, about 2 per cent of total revenues.

What Microsoft's US lawyers find irksome is not the  fine but the huge damage of setting a precedent that could outlaw a core  Microsoft strategy: bundling new products with Windows. The relevant law, Article 82, prohibits behaviour by dominant firms which is abusive, that is to say harmful to  competition per se.



Page 160 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Article 82 has no direct counterpart in the US where behaviour which hurts your competitors is generally OK until it hurts consumers. The general philosophy is you can use your economic clout to undercut the other guy, even put him out of business, but woe betide you if you exploit the buying public.

Americans suspect there is a political agenda, that the Commission uses Article 82 to prop up weak companies and protect its domestic industry from foreign  competition. It is part of a wider agenda, they say, to promote an industrial policy, a relic of our socialist heritage.

The trouble with that argument, however, is that the complainants in this case are Americans, those notorious communist fellow-travellers, Sun Microsystems and RealNetworks. There is no serious European competitor to protect.

The American critics are partly right, nevertheless, because the  European Commission is trying to shape things. The goal, however, is not to support a particular industry or protect Europeans. It is to promote the common market. "It is a wider policy," says Julian Joshua, a former Commission offical and partner at the Brussels office of Howrey Simon, a US law firm. "It is not designed to do down foreigners but to promote the EU agenda, market integration."

History provides one explanation. US  antitrust law was framed to prevent railroad tycoons from getting a stranglehold on oil supplies in a nascent US economy. But the people who framed the European treaties had a more long-term agenda -to make an old economy work better. The difference is still telling.

Software giant Microsoft is set to be hit with a record  fine of up to 500m euro ( £332m) today by the
European Commission for allegedly abusing its market dominance, according to reports.

Representatives from European Union states met on Monday to discuss the European  Competition Commissioner's proposals on what action to take against  Microsoft, which is accused by the EU of being an "abusive monopolist".

TD
If the  fine does touch 500m euro, it will be the biggest in the EU's history, ahead of the 462m euro (
£307.5m) imposed on pharmaceutical company Hoffman-La Roche in 2001 for being the ringleader of a
vitamin cartel.

As well as fining  Microsoft, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is expected to set limits on the company's practice of bundling software and services with its Windows operating system, an important part of the software firm's commercial strategy.

Mr Monti wants  Microsoft to issue a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and to encourage other computer makers to provide other audio-visual software.

The US computer giant is also set to be asked to license information to make the servers of rivals more compatible with Windows desktop machines.

Microsoft has already announced its intention to appeal against any  fine imposed on it, arguing such a punishment is unjustified.

Even if the  fine is upheld - which may take up several more months of legal wrangling - it is unlikely to cause much commercial damage to Microsoft. The company has an estimated cash pile of $53bn (
£28.6bn), making the proposed £332m fine a long way short of the Commission's maximum  fine of
10pc of annual turnover for the year before the decision.
This would put  Microsoft's maximum fine at $3.43bn ( £1.86bn).

Despite the negative publicity surrounding the anti-trust case,  Microsoft continues to generate cash at a rapid rate.
In January, the company predicted revenues of $8.6bn ( £4.6m) and operating income of $3.1bn (
£1.6bn) for the current quarter.

HD          Microsoft may finally  face the music;  By making it sell an operating system without Windows
Media Player, EU tries to force competition in software  industry

SEATTLE

By the time  Microsoft Corp. settled its  antitrust case with the U.S. Justice Department, the Internet browser war that precipitated it had already been fought -- with  Microsoft the victor.

TD
In the ensuing years, technology has moved so fast -- and the legal process so slowly by comparison -- that the software behemoth similarly won other market battles before legal challenges could be resolved.
That may not be so with the  European Commission's expected ruling against  Microsoft today.

The European Union's executive body was expected to  fine Microsoft and order the company to offer a version of its flagship operating system in Europe that has been stripped of Windows Media Player.

And that gives European regulators a rare chance to influence  Microsoft's current behaviour, rather than trying to make amends for alleged wrongdoing against already sunken competitors.

Microsoft is just one of the companies battling over how people will hear and see music and videos online when a market now in its infancy matures.

"The EU decision comes when the media wars, if you could call it that, are ongoing," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

About 34 per cent of U.S. Internet users played a song or watched video using  Microsoft's Windows Media Player in February, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. That compares to about 20 per cent who used rival RealNetworks' format, and about nine per cent who used Apple's Quick Time.

Other media players also are snagging smaller audiences, and some people likely used more than one player.

That wasn't the case in the browser battle between Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator. By the time the courts ruled that Microsoft abused its monopoly when it included its browser with Windows, Netscape was virtually vanquished.

Experts say Microsoft still holds about 90 per cent of that market -- about the same as its desktop operating system share -- and that's unlikely to change.

The potential for competitors to benefit from a negative ruling in the European Union case is particularly strong if Microsoft is forced to sell a version of Windows without the media player at a slightly cheaper price, said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.


Page 164 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That would allow other media player companies such as RealNetworks to offer computer manufacturers their players for free, improving computer makers' slim profit margins and giving a competitor the immediate consumer access that  Microsoft has enjoyed until now.
"Without a doubt, it will create an opportunity for (competitors)," Leigh said.

Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company believed it was premature to speculate on any potential market impact.

If Microsoft were forced to ship a version of Windows without its media player, that could also mean it would have to start persuading users to download its player from the Internet -- just like its competitors.

Even in that case, analyst Ted Schadler of Forrester Research says,  Microsoft's dominance may again give it an advantage.
BRAND RECOGNITION

"Microsoft has incredible brand recognition," Schadler said. "It's easier to convince people (to download the Windows Media Player) than to convince people to download the Real player."

Schadler said the overall market for music and video online could suffer as many people opt not to download any media player at all. He thinks the best option for all involved would be to include a number of players with Windows.
Wilcox disagrees, saying most Internet users know how to download media and software. RealNetworks, which also is suing  Microsoft for antitrust violations in U.S. federal court, says an EU
ruling against Microsoft would help it but isn't critical for survival.

"We have a plan to succeed in this space with or without an (EU) ruling," said Bob Kimball, Real's general counsel.

Microsoft has defended its business conduct and accused RealNetworks of using its lawsuit to try to gain market share.

Regardless of how the legal battles play out, some people, even those at Microsoft, say this may never be a winner-take-all market. Will Poole, a senior vice president at Microsoft, told journalists in February that the media player market is "not a VHS/Beta thing," in reference to the war over video formats, in which VHS eventually dominated.

Wilcox, the Jupiter analyst, said he believes the online media battle may eventually be more about the format in which online content is recorded and delivered than which media player is easiest to find.

For example, he says, Apple has succeeded with its music store because people like the variety of songs available -- not because of what player they use. Also, most players can deliver songs and video in some competing formats.

That the market remains so competitive may even raise the question of whether the courts should intervene at all, Wilcox said.

"If there is plenty of  competition, is there a need for an enforcement action in the first place?" he asked.

BRUSSELS -- In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union yesterday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615 million (U.S.) for alleged  antitrust abuses.

With the EU decision on the software giant due today, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

TD
"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state, Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under guidelines of the European Commission, the EU's executive body, to account for the company's global operations. Microsoft does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently,"  Microsoft spokesperson Tom Brookes said.

Commission spokesperson Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Monti would address questions today at a news conference after the commission adopts the ruling. Sources familiar with the 5-year-old case, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the EU ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behaviour in a U.S.  antitrust case but settled with the Bush administration in late 2001.
A U.S. appeals court is considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore
competition.

U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the commission to levy  fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 per cent of a company's global revenue.

Representatives from the 15 EU governments approved the  fine Monday. A source familiar with the case, speaking on condition of not being identified, said yesterday it was around 500 million euros.

That would be a record for the EU in an  antitrust case, but far below the maximum of around $3.5 billion (about 2.8 billion euros) that could be imposed in  Microsoft's case.

Given that the Redmond, Wash.-based company has cash reserves of nearly $53 billion, experts say the fine is less significant than the changes Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows, which runs most personal computers worldwide.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying Windows code to rivals in the server market and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any
fine or remedies.
Murray called on the Bush administration to "engage" the EU in settling the case.

"The EU has now directly attacked the authority of the United States and our economy in general," she said in a statement.
"American jobs and economic interests are threatened,"she said.

The EU weathered similar charges in 2001 when it blocked GE's bid for Honeywell, even though the merger had been cleared in Washington.

Monti, who has stressed the importance of transatlantic co-operation, has said his ultimate concern had to be "what was best for  competition and consumers in Europe."

Observers say the Yale-educated economist believes increased  competition would eventually create growth and jobs.
"They may not be  Microsoft growth and Microsoft jobs, but in the economy as a whole,"  antitrust
lawyer Martin Baker of Taylor Wessing said in London.

European Union regulators ordered U.S. computer software giant Microsoft Corp on Wednesday to pay a record 497 million euro ($606 million)  fine for violating EU antitrust law and change its business model fundamentally to stop crushing rivals. The European Commission said Microsoft must act within four months to give competitors in audio-visual software and servers used in millions of offices in Europe a fairer chance to compete "because the illegal behaviour is still going on". "We are simply assuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. More important than the  fine were orders to Microsoft to unbundle Windows Media Player within 90 days and give "complete and accurate" information to rival makers of computer servers within 120 days, Monti added.  Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith called the decision unfortunate.

He said the firm would appeal the ruling in court and seek a suspension of the order that Microsoft sell a version of Windows without Windows Media Player. "Today's decision is a setback not only for Microsoft but for our entire industry and consumers", he said, adding it would freeze technology and damage innovation. "At the end of the day the  European Commission has the first word, the European courts have the final word and the final word is going to carry the day," Smith said. Two European court
decisions have gone against Monti in recent years, but he emphasised that every aspect of this ruling was meticulously vetted by lawyers. Monti said he was striking a blow for consumers against a "virtual monopoly" that is violating the law. "We are not expropriating  Microsoft's intellectual property, we are
also not breaking new legal ground, neither for Europe nor for the United States," Monti told reporters.

MICROSOFT SEES LEGAL BATTLE

At this point  Microsoft's main weapon is delay.  Microsoft's Smith said he was "very optimistic" the court would suspend EU remedies and argued the deal proposed by the firm would have been a better outcome for consumers. Settlement talks collapsed last week because the two sides were unable to agree on commitments about  Microsoft's future business practices. Smith said the company had offered to include three rival media players in Windows. "Instead of getting immediate action in 2004 we are now on a path to get a result in 2009," he said, expecting a legal fight "We believe we have excellent arguments about how this would cause consumer confusion and disrupt the industry," he added. Monti
said it was important to have a decision that would make it easier and quicker to act on future complaints. The Commission is already looking into two other complaints, one by the Computer and Communications Industry Association. Association president Ed Black applauded the ruling and said it was needed to stop Microsoft from dominating home entertainment centres as they converge with computers. Monti said the decision gave manufacturers freedom to choose which software they installed in personal computers to play films and music, and did not mean consumers would get PCs and operating systems without a media player. The Commission ruled that  Microsoft bundled its own audiovisual player to damage such rivals as RealNetworks RealPlayer and Apple Computer Quicktime. RealNetworks deputy general counsel Dave Stewart, whose firm has lost market share to  Microsoft, told Reuters the move was not too late as "for
the first time in five years (PC makers) are not going to be forced to include Windows Media Player". The Commission will appoint a special monitoring trustee to ensure  Microsoft has two versions of Windows that work equally well and that information given to rivals is complete. The ruling bars  Microsoft from circumventing it by offering discounts to computer makers which install the version of Windows with Media Player.
BROAD REMEDY

The decision to go for a broad remedy follows a decade of investigations and settlements on narrow issues without any formal findings against the software firm. A U.S. appeals court ruled unanimously in a final 2001 decision that Microsoft broke antitrust rule, but critics say the remedies there failed to encourage vigorous competition. Microsoft's Smith suggested the EU should not be meddling with a U.S. company when U.S. regulators had dealt with it. President George Bush and others criticised Monti in 2001 for rejecting General Electric's proposed buy of Honeywell. But Monti said he had been in close touch with his American counterpart on this case. The Commission  fine exceeds the record 462 million euro penalty imposed on Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche AG in 2001 for leading a vitamin cartel. Monti rejected criticism that the  fine was peanuts for a company with a $53 billion cash pile. On January 22
Microsoft projected expected revenues of $8.6 billion and operating income of $3.1 billion for the current quarter. (additional reporting by David Milliken, Paul Taylor, Patrick Lannin and Peter Nielsen in Brussels and Peter Kaplan in Washington).

The European Commission ruled on Wednesday that  Microsoft violated antitrust laws and imposed a record fine as well as demanding changes in its business practices in a landmark case against the U.S. software giant. EU and U.S. regulators have been involved in legal battles with the firm for more than a decade, charging  Microsoft with blocking competition. Here is a chronology: 1994 July 15:  European    Commission and U.S. Justice Department reach a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges that the
company used licensing policies to block  competition, in particular by software maker Novell, then a rival. Microsoft agrees to modify licensing policies. 1995 April:  Microsoft drops acquisition of Intuit, maker of personal finance package Quicken, in face of U.S. Justice Department lawsuit.

TD
1997 November 24: European Commission reaches a deal with  Microsoft to settle charges the company used licensing policies to block competition, this time against Santa Cruz Operation, a Unix software developer. Microsoft agrees to waive contract provisions. December 11: U.S. Justice Department says Microsoft broke the 1994 agreement and is blocking  competition. U.S. judge later orders Microsoft to unbundle Internet Explorer browser from its ubiquitous Windows operating system, but it does not. Instead, company permits computer makers to install Windows without Internet Explorer icon. 1998 May: U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia rules in favour of Microsoft, exempting
Windows 98 from the U.S. judge's order. 2000 February: European Commission says it is investigating if
Microsoft blocked competition by bundling features in Windows 2000 to the disadvantage of rival
makers of network server software. April 3: U.S. judge rules  Microsoft used its monopoly power to block
competition, later orders  Microsoft be broken up. July 7: In face of Brussels objections Microsoft gives
up plan for joint control of British cable company Telewest Communications. August 3: European
Commission says in first Statement of Objections that  Microsoft used its licensing policies to block
competition, refusing to supply essential information to Sun Microsystems. 2001 June 28: U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia rejects Microsoft break-up and faults judge for failing to hold hearings
on the matter. But it rules unanimously that Microsoft used its Windows monopoly to block competition.
August 30: European Commission sends second Statement of Objections charging that Microsoft tried
to block competition against rival audiovisual software by bundling Windows Media Player into Windows,
also that it tried to block  competition against low-end servers by withholding information from rivals. 2002
November 1: U.S. judge endorses remedies agreement between Justice Department and Microsoft
which are aimed at increasing competition through licensing and other means. 2003 August 6: European
Commission sends Microsoft unusual third Statement of Objections, laying out a case that the company
blocked competition. Commission warns it may  fine Microsoft, may require company to unbundle Media
Player or carry rival audio-visual software, and may require it to provide more information to rival makers
of low-end software. 2004 March 15: Antitrust experts from all 15 EU member states endorse
Commission draft decision on Microsoft case. March 16-17:  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer
and General Counsel Brad Smith meet EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a bid for a
last-minute settlement. Sources say Microsoft offers to require computer makers to carry rival
audio-visual software alongside Media Player. March 18 - Monti announces that "a settlement on the
Microsoft case has not been possible", says full European Commission will rule against company's
abuse of dominant market position, including a proposed fine. March 24: The  European Commission
imposes a record 497.2-million-euro ($611.2 million)  fine on Microsoft. It also orders the company to
offer a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player, to encourage computer
makers to provide other audiovisual software, and to disclose more information about its programs so that
rival server software firms can make their programs as compatible with Windows operating system as
Microsoft's own server software. (Additional reporting by Paul Hailey in London).

Microsoft Antitrust Action

WASHINGTON, March 24 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following statement of Computer &Communications Industry Association (CCIA) President Ed Black on European  Microsoft Antitrust Action was released today:

"The European Commission's decision today is another confirmation of  Microsoft's anti-competitive and illegal business tactics. The decision is also a demonstration of a strongly committed  competition authority willing to enforce  antitrust laws against Microsoft.

TD
"The commission's actions lay the foundation upon which comprehensive efforts to prevent continued anti-competitive behavior can be launched.

"This decision details the ways in which  Microsoft caused competitive harm, hurt innovation, and forced consumers to accept increased prices with less choice. Of the numerous anti- competitive tools repeatedly used by Microsoft as they expand their monopoly, forced bundling and discriminatory use of interface information are almost always essential to their plans. This decision serves notice to  Microsoft of the presumptive illegality of similar activities and that the Commission will now turn its attention to other
issues, such as CCIA's Windows XP filing. If these cases demonstrate flagrant lawbreaking, they will justify far greater  fines, broader conduct remedies and perhaps even structural remedies.

"The issues outlined today will prevent  Microsoft from controlling the platform for the delivery and subsequent control over digital content.

"This is becoming even more important as computers and home entertainment converge. The decision prevents Microsoft from 'locking in' their media player and their proprietary format as the de facto standard, which would force developers and consumers alike to bow to whatever demands or taxes Microsoft wishes to place on digital content. Likewise, the commission also requires  Microsoft to allow other computers in the critical server area to talk with  Microsoft computers.

"We would like to commend the commission and its staff for conducting an extensive and exhaustive investigation with professionalism and due diligence. We are pleased the commission did not succumb to the last minute settlement offers put forward by  Microsoft to stave off the inevitable results of the five-year investigation. The past has shown all too well that many authorities lack the sustained will to effectively check the abuses of such a powerful firm. It is with this dubious past in mind that we look towards the enforcement process as a key to restoring the competitive landscape to the software market.

"We believe that innovation and consumer welfare are driven by  competition, both of which have withered under Microsoft dominance in the five years this case has been pending. This decision is vital
not just to Europe, but to the entire world as  competition in Europe effects innovation in the United States and elsewhere. Unfortunately  Microsoft has already indicated they will engage in protracted appeals to further frustrate the promise of a competitive market. Allowing  Microsoft to continue its illegal practices by means of a stay pending appeal may cause further irreparable deterioration in a market already under siege, making an effective remedy impossible."

HD      Microsoft ready to appeal any EU antitrust fine: Company faces $615 million US fine, accuses EU

BRUSSELS -- In a preview of its promised appeal,  Microsoft Corp. accused the European Union on Tuesday of overreaching by including its U.S. business in calculating a record  fine of about $615 million US for alleged  antitrust abuses.

TD
With the EU decision on the software giant due today, transatlantic tensions also began to sizzle as they did the last time the EU took on U.S. corporate giants and blocked General Electric Co.'s planned deal for Honeywell International Inc.

"This ruling is yet another example of the EU assaulting a successful American industry and policies that support our economic growth," said U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from  Microsoft's home state of Washington.

Microsoft's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, argued that the EU's reported  fine appeared to be twice what it should have been under the  European Commission's guidelines to account for the company's global operations.  Microsoft does about 30 per cent of its business in Europe.

"We believe it's unprecedented and inappropriate for the Commission to impose a  fine on a company's U.S. operations when those operations are already regulated by the U.S. government," Gutierrez said. "The conduct at issue has been permitted by both the U.S. Department of Justice and a U.S. court."

The company also argued it could not have known its behaviour would infringe EU law and thus it should not be fined at all.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti "has said clearly the reason he wants a decision is to get a precedent, so clearly there isn't one currently," said  Microsoft spokesman Tom Brookes.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres declined to comment, saying Monti would address questions today at a news conference after the  European Commission adopts the ruling. Sources familiar with the five-year-old case, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the EU ruling finds  Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly, harming consumers and competitors in the markets for digital media and server software.

Microsoft was found guilty of similar monopolistic behaviour in the U.S.  antitrust case but settled with the Bush administration in late 2001. A U.S. appeals court is currently considering whether that landmark deal was adequate to restore  competition.
U.S. companies that do significant business in Europe also are subject to EU law, which authorizes the
Commission to levy fines for antitrust violations of up to 10 per cent of a company's global revenue.

Page 174 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Representatives from the 15 EU governments approved the  fine Monday. A source familiar with the case, speaking on condition of not being identified, said Tuesday it was around 500 million euros ($615 million US.)

That would be a record for the EU in an  antitrust case but far below the maximum of about $3.5 billion that could be imposed in  Microsoft's case.

Given that the Redmond, Wash.-based company has cash reserves of nearly $53 billion, experts say the fine is less significant than the changes Monti is seeking in how  Microsoft sells Windows, which runs most personal computers worldwide.

The EU is expected to order  Microsoft to release more of the underlying Windows code to rivals in the server market, and deliver a version of Windows without its Windows Media Player software in Europe to help competing products reach desktops.

Microsoft has promised to appeal any negative decision and is likely to seek a suspension of any  fine or remedies.

INTRO: The European Union has ruled that  Microsoft abused its dominant market position in the E-U and fined the U-S software giant more than 600 million dollars. The E-U's  antitrust authority is giving Microsoft 90-days to offer a new version of its Windows operating system, without the built-in audiovisual software, called Media Player.                 has more:

TEXT: The European Union also is ordering that  Microsoft must allow rival server makers to view its software code, so competitors can make their products compatible with Windows.  Microsoft calls the order "unfortunate," and says the move will freeze technology and stifle innovation. Analyst Brian Skiba with Deutsche Bank Securities agrees, and says that the ruling will hurt  Microsoft's research and development, or R+D:
[ACT 1 SKIBA]

Microsoft does spend seven to eight billion dollars a year on R+D. They want to take product innovation and roll it into new versions of Windows. They have a new generation of Windows called Longhorn, coming out in 2006. And for instance, they would like to integrate a very tightly coupled search engine, like a
Google search engine, into what they offer. They may or may not be able to, or that may come under increased scrutiny if they do that in the future.
[END ACT]

Despite the ruling from the European ruling, the final outcome of the case is yet to be determined, according to computer industry analyst Michael Sansoterra with Principal Global Investors.  Microsoft settled similar  antitrust charges with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001, and the settlement in part gave computer manufacturers and consumers the freedom simply to substitute competing software on Microsoft's operating system. The European Union says the U-S agreement was inadequate. Mr. Sansoterra says that  Microsoft still should get a chance to have the E-U reconsider its action:
[ACT 2 SANSOTERRA]

I suspect they will have the ability to appeal the decision, and they will probably receive a stay in the meantime. I don't think the Department of Justice's phrases, which the European Union looked at, about how innovation would be stifled, or how changing  Microsoft code may indeed hurt the industry, or the P-C (personal computer) ecosystem, will fall on completely deaf ears in the European Union.
[END ACT]

Analyst Michael Sansoterra in Des Moines, Iowa. The E-U order would force  Microsoft to produce two versions of Windows, one with Media Player and one without, and would prevent it from offering discounts to computer makers that install the bundled version. The 600 million dollar fine came after settlement talks collapsed last week when the two sides failed to agree on a way for the European Commission, the E-U's

Software giant  Microsoft must pay a fine of 497 million euros ($613 million/GBP331 million) for abusing its dominant market position, the European Union (EU) has ordered. EU  Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also insisted Microsoft must reveal secrets of its Window's software, which sits on 90 per cent of the world's PCs. The European Commission approved Microsoft's punishment on Wednesday (24MAR04).  Microsoft has already said it will appeal, kicking off a legal battle that could last years. Microsoft has a cash pile of more than $50 billion, so even a  fine on this scale - a record for the EU in
an antitrust case - is unlikely to hurt it commercially. Industry experts say that the non-financial penalties are likely to hurt  Microsoft more by opening it to further challenges and altering the regulatory environment it operates in. Announcing the penalties, Monti said they restored the conditions for fair competition in the software market. He said, "Dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition...and does not harm consumers and innovation." (GES/WNWCCB/TN)

The Basque terror group Eta - originally blamed for the Madrid rail massacre - may be ready to call another ceasefire in hopes of convincing the incoming Socialist government to negotiate more political concessions. "I have the impression that in a very short time - in coming days, or coming weeks - that Eta will declare a ceasefire," one of the group's founders, Julen Madariaga, 65, said in southern France where he has lived for three decades. Influential newspaper columnist Kepa Aulestia wrote: "Eta always has known how to take advantage of these occasions. It's very weak and needs a strategic truce." The "occasion" is the changeover next month from the conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who cracked down on Eta, to Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, shock winner in the March 14 general elections. On Sunday, Eta issued a statement proposing dialogue with the Socialists.

Microsoft £333m fine

TD
MICROSOFT accused the EU yesterday of going too far in seeking a record  fine of about £333 million against it for alleged  antitrust abuses, saying it was being penalised for behaviour permitted in the United States. The Seattle-based software giant's chief European lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, said the level appeared to have been doubled from what it would have been under the European Commission's own guidelines to account for the company's global operations. Microsoft does about
30 per cent of its business in Europe.
Election recount

LOOKING weak just days after he was shot, Taiwan's leader appeared in public yesterday for the first time since his disputed re-election victory and called for a vote recount that he promised to accept "100 per cent". As President Chen Shui-bian gave a televised address, the shouts and chants of thousands of protesters could be heard in the background. The crowd has been camping out in front of the Presidential Office since Saturday's tight vote, demanding a recount.
Pot noodles

A FIVE-YEAR-OLD boy took a bag of marijuana to school and was sprinkling it over a friend's lasagne like oregano when a monitor intervened, police said. The lasagne was confiscated before the other boy had a chance to eat it in the cafeteria at Gratigny Elementary School in Florida. Police said it was unclear whether the boy even knew what he was carrying, although he tried to hide the bag when the monitor approached. The boy "may have said it was oregano," said Mayco Villafana, spokesman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools.
Bond movie stalls

JAMES Bond star Pierce Brosnan is unsure whether he will star in another 007 film, claiming the movies' producers "don't know what to do", it emerged yesterday. Brosnan accused the producers of being "too scared" and claimed work on the next film had hit paralysis.

HD      EU fines Microsoft 497.2 mln eur for abusing  market power. WC     278 words

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The  European Commission said it is fining  Microsoft Corp 497.2 mln eur for abusing its market power in the EU.

It is ordering the company to disclose interface information - which allows computer servers to "talk" to each other - to its rivals within 120 days.

TD
This interface information allows rivals to develop products that can interoperate with  Microsoft's
"ubiquitous" operating systems, said the commission.

Microsoft will be entitled to "reasonable remuneration" for any interface information that is protected by intellectual property rights and it will not have to disclose any of its source code.

The company must also offer personal computer manufacturers a version of its Windows operating system without Windows Media Player. This has previously been tied to the operating system.

Microsoft may still offer PC manufacturers a version of Windows with the media player but it must not offer any commercial, technological or contractual terms that render the stripped-down version less attractive.

The commission said it believes the remedies bring the  antitrust violations to an end, are appropriate, and establish clear principles for the future conduct of the company.

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "Today's decision restores the conditions for fair competition in the markets concerned and establishes clear principles for the future conduct of a company with such a strong dominant position."

Today's fine is the largest ever imposed on a company by the EU. Previously, the commission had imposed a fine of 462 mln eur on Roche after it was found to have fixed prices in the vitamin pills market.

He said the commission is breaking no new legal ground with its ruling, nor is it 'expropriating  Microsoft
Corp intellectual property".
He also questioned the company's claim that it was aware of the  competition impact of its conduct. He said the commission's doubts over the future conduct of the company concerned other  Microsoft
products, not just Media Player.

He said the commission's separate investigation into  Microsoft's Windows XP program would be examined on its own merits.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares of Microsoft were being bid a few points higher on Wednesday as the markets digested the European Commission's record $612 million  fine on the company for market abuses. The Dow industrial futures were off 1 point at 10,026 at 7 a.m. Eastern. The S&P and Nasdaq futures were
also down slightly. MSFT  Microsoft were marked at $24.20-24.30, London dealers said, up from a $24.15 close.

There had been some concern that Europe would demand  Microsoft put a price on Media Player. Microsoft is expected to submit names of a trustee to oversee compliance.

Monti said the  fine could be used as a guideline in private  antitrust actions.
The fine amounted to 8 pct of the company's sales in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, he said. The commission had been extremely carefully in arriving at its decision, he said, adding: "I am confident
we have prepared a case that will stand before any appeal."

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stock futures turned higher Wednesday amid a rebound in Microsoft shares, providing early hope that the market's losing streak would end at four sessions. Microsoft dipped slightly, and then turned higher, after the  European Commission levied a $612 million fine on the software behemoth for abusing its near-monopoly status in Europe. June S&P futures were up 0.30 at 1,091.60 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 2.50 to 1,374. 00, after being down as much as 3.60 and 5.50 points,

posted late Tuesday fiscal fourth-quarter earnings vs. a year-earlier loss on revenue that rose 47 percent,
boosted by new subscription sales. Among some other technology heavyweights, Intel rallied 13 cents to
$26.29, Cisco Systems added 14 cents to $22.50 and Oracle edged up 4 cents to $11.44. Elsewhere,
Time Warner tacked on 15 cents to $16.56 after CIBC World markets upgraded the media giant to "sector
outperformer" from "sector performer," and raised its price target to $20 from $18. Analyst Michael Gallant
believes the media giant will post better growth than its peers during 2004 and 2005, while its stock trades
at a discount following its underperformance since the end of 2003. He also feels that expectations for its
AOL and cable divisions have been lower sufficiently following disappointing subscriber performances for
the company to meet or exceed forecasts for those units over the next 12 to 18 months. PMC-Sierra
tacked on 49 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $16.43 after the chip maker indicated late Tuesday that first-quarter
sales would exceed the midpoint of its originally forecasted range. Other broker calls CSFB also raised

LONDON (AFX) - U.S. stock futures were mixed to slightly higher ahead of Wednesday's open, providing early hope that the market's losing streak would end at four sessions, following stronger-than-expected durable goods order data and a rebound in  Microsoft shares. The U.S. Commerce Department said February durable goods orders rose 2.5 percent, above expectations of 1.7 percent growth, following a revised 2.7 percent drop in January. Microsoft dipped slightly, and then turned higher, after the  European Commission levied a $612 million fine on the software behemoth for abusing its near-monopoly status in Europe. June S&P futures unchanged at 1,091.30 while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.00 to 1,372.50, after being down as much as 3.60 and 5.50 points, respectively, earlier in the pre-open.

were weak, while the U.S. dollar was mixed. The buck surged 1.3 percent vs. the euro to $1.2182 but fell
0.4 percent against the yen to 106. 32 after Standard and Poor's raised its outlook on Japan to "stable"
from "negative."  Microsoft turns up Dow industrials component and Nasdaq heavyweight Microsoft rose
15 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $24.30 in ahead of the open. The Commission ordered Microsoft to disclose
operating system interface information to rival server maker within 120 days, AFX reported from Brussels.
It also ordered  Microsoft to offer personal computer manufacturers a version of its Windows operating
system without Windows Media Player. Mario Monti, Europe's top  antitrust regulator, told reporters there
was nothing specifically on pricing in the order. There had been some concern that Europe would demand
Microsoft put a price on Media Player. The Commission's remedies appeared to have met the market's
expectations on first read, London dealers said. Smith Barney analyst Tom Berquist said even in a
worst-case EC ruling scenario, he would recommend buying the stock, as  Microsoft's business model
should remain mostly intact.  Microsoft is expected to submit names of a trustee to oversee compliance.
"It is clear the decisions provides a general framework to examine"  Microsoft, Monti said. There are two
other Microsoft cases pending in Europe. Red Hat, the developer of Linux software, which competes with
Windows, rallied $2.14, or 11 percent, to $21.55 in the pre-open. The company posted late Tuesday fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings vs. a year-earlier loss on revenue that rose 47 percent, boosted by new
subscription sales. Among some other technology heavyweights, Intel added 6 cents to $26.22, Cisco
Systems advanced 9 cents to $22.45 and Oracle edged up 3 cents to $11.43. Elsewhere, Time Warner
tacked on 14 cents to $16.55 after CIBC World markets upgraded the media giant to "sector outperformer"
from "sector performer," and raised its price target to $20 from $18. Analyst Michael Gallant believes the
media giant will post better growth than its peers during 2004 and 2005, while its stock trades at a
discount following its underperformance since the end of 2003. He also feels that expectations for its AOL
and cable divisions have been lower sufficiently following disappointing subscriber performances for the
company to meet or exceed forecasts for those units over the next 12 to 18 months. PMC-Sierra tacked
on 49 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $16.43 after the chip maker indicated late Tuesday that first-quarter sales
would exceed the midpoint of its originally forecasted range. Other broker calls CSFB also raised retailer
Best Buy to 'outperform' from 'neutral', citing 'compelling' valuation following recent share price decline.

NEW YORK (AFX) - U.S. stock futures are pointing to a slightly higher open Wednesday as  Microsoft shares gained in pre-market trading on investor expectations the company can now put its European anti-trust woes behind it after the  European Commission fined it $612 million for market abuses. The latest economic data meanwhile gave a conflicting picture of the U.S. economy. Demand for U.S. made
durable goods soared 2.5 percent in February, beating economist expectations of a 1.7 percent rise, but January's numbers were revised downwards to 2.7 percent. "The economic data was not a huge positive even if the headline number was much stronger than expected but it does not equal the downward revision we saw in the month of January," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co.

"The Microsoft news won't be much of a drag because $612 million is not a daunting  fine." Hogan said the end of the European Union investigation into the software maker could now allow it to move on and refocus on its core business. Dow futures were up 6 points at 10,033, Nasdaq 100 futures were up 4 points at 1,375.50 and S&P 500 futures climbed 0.7 points at 1,092. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 1.11 points at 10,063.64 in a volatile session for stocks. The Nasdaq
Composite was down 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,901.80 after spending most of the session bouncing in and out of positive territory. The S&P 500 Index fell 1.50 points, or 0.1 percent, at 1,093.90 while the Russell 2000 Index, tracking the performance of small-cap stocks, clung to gains to end up 0.3 percent at
560.92. Currencies The U.S. dollar remained sharply higher against its U.S. rivals in the wake of mixed U.S. factory data issued Wednesday. The dollar rose after comments from European officials fed market speculation the European Central Bank would consider an interest-rate cut when it next meets April 1. The dollar was up 1.2 percent against the euro, with the shared currency valued at $1. 2178. The dollar fell against the yen, last down 0.4 percent at 106.31 yen, after Standard & Poor's offered an upbeat outlook
for the Japanese economy.  Microsoft Shares of  Microsoft gained 21 cents to $24.36 in pre-market trading, after sliding 1.4 percent to $24.15 Tuesday as investors anticipated the  European Commission's decision to fine the software maker $612 million for abusing its dominant market position. The company's share price is also not far off its 52-week low of $23.60, a position some investors may be interpreting as a buying opportunity.

Europe's  competition watchdog, Mario Monti, is expected this week to  fine Microsoft hundreds of millions of dollars for monopolistic behaviour and order it to extract its audio-visual application, Windows Media Player, from its Windows operating system.

At stake is domination of the burgeoning multibillion dollar worldwide market for online digital music and video, potentially a money machine beyond the dreams of Croesus.

TD
By bundling WMP with the operating system used by 95 per cent of the world's desktop computers, Microsoft is seen to have an advantage calculated to destroy  competition such as Real Networks and Apple Computer.

Fines imposed by the European Commission under its anti-competition laws could be as high as
$US3.2 billion ($A4.25 billion), 10 per cent of Microsoft's global revenue, but are likely to be less than
$US300 million, a relatively puny amount for which the company has probably already budgeted.

The wrangle with Europe has been running for five years. Last week, three days of last-ditch talks between Mr Monti and a  Microsoft team headed by chief executive Steve Ballmer ended in deadlock.
Mr Monti's draft resolution against  Microsoft has already won unanimous backing from EU
governments and is expected to pass easily when the full commission meets tomorrow.

Brussels, 23/03/2004 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, Commissioner Mario Monti is to propose to his colleagues a record fine of 497 million EUR to the  Microsoft group. If the college votes the decision through, this will be the largest  fine, in financial terms, ever imposed on a company by the  European       Commission. The sad record for the largest  fine imposed on a single group was previously held by the Hoffman-La Roche group (462 million EUR in 2001), for having taken part in a vitamin cartel.

TD
Microsoft has already reacted, declaring the  fine "unjustified and unjust". One of its spokespeople in New York, Lou Gellos, told AFP: "It's certainly unjustified, because we think it comes down to an inability to agree on a single problem after having agreed on all the others" (it is worth noting that talks between the Commission and Microsoft finally failed on the issue of marketing the group's future products: see EUROPE of 19 March, p.7). Mr Gellos also indicated that  Microsoft will "certainly appeal" to the Court of Justice, if the decision is confirmed at the meeting of the Commissioners on Wednesday.

HD     EU ruling  on Microsoft could affect marketplace

SEATTLE (AP) - By the time  Microsoft Corp. settled its  antitrust case with the U.S. Justice Department, the Internet browser war that precipitated it had already been fought -- with  Microsoft the victor.

In the ensuing years, technology has moved so fast -- and the legal process so slowly by comparison -- that the software behemoth similarly won other market battles before legal challenges could be resolved.

TD
That may not be so with the  European Commission's expected ruling against  Microsoft on Wednesday.

The European Union's executive body was expected to  fine Microsoft and order the company to offer a version of its flagship operating system in Europe that has been stripped of Windows Media Player.

And that gives European regulators a rare chance to influence  Microsoft's current behavior, rather than trying to make amends for alleged wrongdoing against already sunken competitors.

Microsoft is just one of the companies battling over how people will hear and see music and videos online when a market now in its infancy matures.

"The EU decision comes when the media wars, if you could call it that, are ongoing," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

About 34 percent of U.S. Internet users played a song or watched video using  Microsoft's Windows Media Player in February, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. That compares to about 20 percent who used rival RealNetworks' format, and about 9 percent who used Apple's Quick Time.

Other media players also are snagging smaller audiences, and some people likely used more than one player.

That wasn't the case in the browser battle between Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator. By the time the courts ruled that Microsoft abused its monopoly when it included its browser with Windows, Netscape was virtually vanquished.

Experts say Microsoft still holds about 90 percent of that market -- about the same as its desktop operating system share -- and that's unlikely to change.

The potential for competitors to benefit from a negative ruling in the European Union case is particularly strong if Microsoft is forced to sell a version of Windows without the media player at a slightly cheaper price, said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.

That would allow other media player companies such as RealNetworks to offer computer manufacturers their players for free, improving computer makers' slim profit margins and giving a competitor the immediate consumer access that  Microsoft has enjoyed until now.
"Without a doubt it will create an opportunity for (competitors)," Leigh said.


Page 202 of 213 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company believed it was premature to speculate on any potential market impact.

If Microsoft were forced to ship a version of Windows without its media player, that could also mean it would have to start persuading users to download its player from the Internet -- just like its competitors.

Even in that case, analyst Ted Schadler of Forrester Research says,  Microsoft's dominance may again give it an advantage.

"Microsoft has incredible brand recognition," Schadler said. "It's easier to convince people (to download the Windows Media Player) than to convince people to download the Real player."

Schadler said the overall market for music and video online could suffer as many people opt not to download any media player at all. He thinks the best option for all involved would be to include a number of players with Windows.
Wilcox disagrees, saying most Internet users know how to download media and software. RealNetworks, which also is suing  Microsoft for antitrust violations in U.S. federal court, says an EU
ruling against Microsoft would help it but isn't critical for survival.

"We have a plan to succeed in this space with or without an (EU) ruling," said Bob Kimball, Real's general counsel.

Microsoft has defended its business conduct and accused RealNetworks of using its lawsuit to try to gain market share.

Regardless of how the legal battles play out, some people, even those at Microsoft, say this may never be a winner-take-all market. Will Poole, a senior vice president at Microsoft, told journalists in February that the media player market is "not a VHS/Beta thing," in reference to the war over video formats, in which VHS eventually dominated.

Wilcox, the Jupiter analyst, said he believes the online media battle may eventually be more about the format in which online content is recorded and delivered than which media player is easiest to find.

For example, he says, Apple has succeeded with its music store because people like the variety of songs available -- not because of what player they use. Also, most players can deliver songs and video in some competing formats.

That the market remains so competitive may even raise the question of whether the courts should intervene at all, Wilcox said.
"If there is plenty of  competition," he asked, "is there a need for an enforcement action in the first place?"

HD     European Union Fines Microsoft $613 Mill

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union slapped  Microsoft Corp. with a $613 million  fine Wednesday for abusively wielding its Windows software monopoly and ordered sanctions that go well beyond the U.S.  antitrust settlement -- setting up what could be another lengthy court battle.

Microsoft called the EU's decision "unwarranted and ill-considered," and said it expected to ask a judge to suspend the order pending appeal.

TD
The EU antitrust office said it sought to alter  Microsoft's behavior because its five-year investigation found that the software giant tried to squeeze competitors out of Windows-related markets and "the illegal behavior is still ongoing."

It gave the company 90 days to offer European computer manufacturers a version of Windows stripped of the company's digital media player, software for viewing video and listening to music that is expected to become pivotal in the industry as multimedia content becomes more pervasive.

The EU also gave  Microsoft 120 days to release "complete and accurate" information to rivals in the office server market so their products can work more smoothly with desktop computers running Windows.

"Microsoft has abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe," EU  antitrust chief Mario Monti said. "We are simply ensuring that anyone who develops new software has a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace."

Monti said he limited the order to Europe in deference to regulators in the United States and other countries, but that doing so "will not unduly undermine the effectiveness," given the size of the European market. Microsoft, which had $32 billion in revenue last year, does about 20 percent of its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said he would most likely ask the presiding judge at the
European Court of First Instance to stay the order pending appeal -- a process that can take years.
"The European Commission has the first word, but the European courts have the final word," he said.

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, announcing a new speech server product in San Francisco on
Wednesday, did not mention the EU case.
The U.S. Justice Department said the decision could hamper innovation and harm consumers.

The fine would automatically be suspended upon appeal, but  antitrust experts were divided on the company's chances for winning emergency relief from the rest of the order.

"It will be up to  Microsoft to show that this prohibition causes irreparable harm, which is not an easy thing to do," said Jacques Bourgeois, a former commission legal adviser now in private practice.

Others noted, however, that the commission would have to show that further delay could result in irreparable harm to competitors, such as the danger they could go out of business. And the court has shown sympathy to arguments about threats to intellectual property rights.

"If it's later ruled that the commission was wrong" to make  Microsoft disclose information to rivals, "how do they put the genie back into the bottle?" said Stephen Kinsella, an international business expert with the Herbert Smith law firm in Brussels.

Monti called the ruling "proportionate" and "balanced," noting that "dominant companies have a special responsibility to ensure that the way they do business doesn't prevent  competition."
He said the decision should set a "framework" for resolving similar complaints already pending against
Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP.

"Maybe fewer cases will materialize because of the clarity which we hope to bring forward with this decision," he said.
Settlement talks broke down last week over the EU's insistence on just such a precedent-setting element:
preventing Microsoft from adding features such as Google-like search to future versions of Windows.

Smith argued that  Microsoft's settlement proposal, which he said included an offer to release a worldwide Windows version that included three competing media players besides its own, would have been more useful to consumers than the penalties.

He called the order to produce a version of Windows without media software an "unwarranted and ill-considered" violation of intellectual property rights under World Trade Organization rules.

Doing so, he said, would be difficult and make other features and even some Web sites work less effectively.
The company made similar claims in the U.S. case, which surrounded  Microsoft's inclusion of its Internet
Explorer Web browser in Windows.

Microsoft was also found guilty of monopolistic behavior in the U.S. case, but the EU order strikes deeper, at the heart of  Microsoft's business strategy -- regularly adding new features to Windows to help sell upgrades.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company argues that such "bundling" benefits consumers. Rivals call it unfair competition, given that Windows runs more than 90 percent of personal computers worldwide.

The EU said it was concerned that a stranglehold on media players could let  Microsoft dictate future standards for how digital music and video files are encoded, distributed and played.

Under the EU order,  Microsoft can continue selling a version of Windows with its media player software installed but must not make the stripped-down version less attractive or a poorer performer.

The ruling could boost other makers of media software, led by RealNetworks Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Bob Kimball, RealNetworks' general counsel, said the EU decision "confirms the merit" of his company's private  antitrust lawsuit against  Microsoft.

The EU case also involved low-end servers that tie desktop computers together in offices. Sun Microsystems Inc. complained to the EU in 1998 that Microsoft refused to provide details needed for Sun programs to "talk" to Windows computers as efficiently as Microsoft's own server software could.

The Commission called  Microsoft's refusal to disclose interface information "part of a broader strategy designed to shut competitors out of the market."

Microsoft could get "reasonable remuneration" for disclosing its proprietary code, the ruling said, adding that the Windows source code itself would remain untouched.

The EU said it would appoint a trustee to monitor Microsoft's compliance with the ruling. The expert is to be selected from at least three names submitted by Microsoft, but the company would have to demonstrate the independence of its nominees. The trustee would have access to  Microsoft sites, employees and documents.

The EU described the decision in a three-page statement. The ruling itself may not be released for weeks, as Microsoft may ask that business secrets be redacted.

Microsoft's shares rose 26 cents to close at $24.41 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

HD     EU ruling  on Microsoft could affect marketplace

SEATTLE (AP) - By the time  Microsoft Corp. settled its  antitrust case with the U.S. Justice Department, the Internet browser war that precipitated it had already been fought -- with  Microsoft the victor.

In the ensuing years, technology has moved so fast -- and the legal process so slowly by comparison -- that the software behemoth similarly won other market battles before legal challenges could be resolved.

TD
That may not be so with the  European Commission's ruling against  Microsoft on Wednesday.

The European Union's executive body  fined Microsoft a record $613 million and ordered the company to offer a version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player in Europe.

That gives European regulators a rare chance to influence  Microsoft's current behavior, rather than trying to make amends for alleged wrongdoing against already sunken competitors.

Microsoft is just one of the companies battling over how people will hear and see music and videos online when a market now in its infancy matures.

"The EU decision comes when the media wars, if you could call it that, are ongoing," said Joe Wilcox, senior analyst with Jupiter Research.

About 34 percent of U.S. Internet users played a song or watched video using  Microsoft's Windows Media Player in February, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. That compares to about 20 percent who used rival RealNetworks' format, and about 9 percent who used Apple's Quick Time.

Other media players also are snagging smaller audiences, and some people likely used more than one player.

That wasn't the case in the browser battle between Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Navigator. By the time the courts ruled that Microsoft abused its monopoly when it included its browser with Windows, Netscape was virtually vanquished.

Experts say Microsoft still holds about 90 percent of that market -- about the same as its desktop operating system share -- and that's unlikely to change.

The potential for competitors to benefit from a negative ruling in the European Union case is particularly strong if Microsoft is eventually forced to sell a version of Windows without the media player at a slightly cheaper price, said Phil Leigh, an analyst with Inside Digital Media.

That would allow other media player companies such as RealNetworks to offer computer manufacturers their players for free, improving computer makers' slim profit margins and giving a competitor the immediate consumer access that  Microsoft has enjoyed until now.
"Without a doubt it will create an opportunity for (competitors)," Leigh said.

Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the company believed it was premature to speculate on any potential market impact.

If Microsoft must ship a version of Windows without its media player, that could also mean it would have to start persuading users to download its player from the Internet -- just like its competitors.

Even in that case, analyst Ted Schadler of Forrester Research says,  Microsoft's dominance may again give it an advantage.

"Microsoft has incredible brand recognition," Schadler said. "It's easier to convince people (to download the Windows Media Player) than to convince people to download the Real player."

Schadler said the overall market for music and video online could suffer as many people opt not to download any media player at all. He thinks the best option for all involved would be to include a number of players with Windows.
Wilcox disagrees, saying most Internet users know how to download media and software.

RealNetworks, which also is suing  Microsoft for antitrust violations in U.S. federal court, was pleased by the EU ruling but said even before it was announced that the smaller company's survival was not at stake.

"We have a plan to succeed in this space with or without an (EU) ruling," said Bob Kimball, Real's general counsel.

Microsoft has defended its business conduct and accused RealNetworks of using its lawsuit to try to gain market share.

Regardless of how the legal battles play out, some people, even those at Microsoft, say this may never be a winner-take-all market. Will Poole, a senior vice president at Microsoft, told journalists in February that the media player market is "not a VHS/Beta thing," a reference to the video format war in which VHS prevailed.

Wilcox said he believes the online media battle may eventually be more about the format in which online content is recorded and delivered than which media player is easiest to find.

For example, he says, Apple's music store has succeeded because people like the variety of songs available -- not because of what player they use. Also, most players can deliver songs and video in some competing formats.

That the market remains so competitive may even raise the question of whether the courts should intervene at all, Wilcox said.
"If there is plenty of  competition," he asked, "is there a need for an enforcement action in the first place?"
