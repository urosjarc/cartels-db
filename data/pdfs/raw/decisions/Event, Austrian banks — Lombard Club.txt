European antitrust regulators are preparing to levy a total  fine of up to EUR120m ($108m) on a group of up to eight  Austrian banks for a five-year conspiracy to fix interest rates and commissions.

The fine, which could come as early as next week, will hit the "Lombard  Club", a long-standing group of Austria's  leading credit institutions.

TD
For decades, top representatives from the club, which include Erste  Bank and Bank Austria  - the country's two largest - met regularly in a Viennese hotel to discuss developments in Austrian banking.

The European  Commission's antitrust investigators are understood to have found that between 1994 and 1998, some of those meetings developed into an organised  cartel.

After a five-year probe, the  Commission is believed to have evidence that during the period the  banks jointly set interest rates and commissions for a number of services, in breach of European competition rules.
A final decision on the level of the  fines is not expected until at least next week.

It is understood that the  Commission's competition department is considering  fines of up to EUR120m. However, the competition experts' recommendation has to be endorsed by the 20 commissioners, who have the power to change the level of the  fines.
The Commission declined to comment on Thursday.

In 1998, the Brussels authorities carried out dawn raids at some of the  banks, looking for evidence of the alleged collusion.

The antitrust watchdog also opened a "Lombard  Hotline" for whistle-blowers who wanted to report on the club. Other  banks involved in the club include Bawag, PSK, Raiffeisen Zentralbank, RaiffeisenLandesbank, Hypo Niederosterreich and OVAG.
However, it is not certain that all of them will be  fined, as some could benefit from a  commission
scheme that is aimed at rewarding companies that co-operate with inquiries.

The commission's probe was sparked by  Austrian press reports in 1997 that the  banks had agreed a list of 13 measures to boost profitability.
Mario Monti, European competition commissioner, has made the fight against cartels, which he called
"cancers" of the market economy, a priority.
He has strengthened the  Commission's cartel department and encouraged it to pursue  price-fixing
conspiracies aggressively.
Last year, the  Commission levied a total of EUR1.8bn in  fines on several cartels, including a record
EUR855m on eight companies found guilty of fixing the price of several vitamins.

Japan machine orders rise, but economy needs oil

TOKYO - Japanese machinery orders, a gauge of capital spending, rose 8.4 percent in April as firms tooled up to meet export orders but the figures, along with others on Monday for  bank lending and prices, showed the economy was still not firing on all cylinders despite emerging from recession.

Economists said capital spending was likely to remain a drag on Japan's patchy economic recovery in the coming months even though data released last week showed the economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.7 percent in January-March.

Vivendi investors cheer Italian deal

LONDON/PARIS - Vivendi Universal's long-suffering investors cheered a deal to bail out of Italy on Monday but their glee was tempered by concerns that the media giant still has a long way to go to tame a groaning debt pile.

Vivendi shares climbed four percent in Paris after the Franco-American group agreed on Saturday to sell its Italian pay-TV operator Telepiu to News Corp and looked set to wrap up another deal to sell part of its water business.

LONDON - The prices of goods leaving British factory gates rose slightly last month while input prices fell sharply, suggesting profit margins for the country's troubled manufacturers may be improving.

Share trader Instinet to buy rival Island

LONDON - U.S. electronic share trader Instinet Group Inc agreed on Monday to buy rival Island ECN in a $508 million, all-share deal to strengthen its hand against fierce competition and create a big new industry leader.

MILAN - Rupert Murdoch is close to pulling off his plan to conquer Italian pay-television, but it could take him a few years yet to tease a profit from his latest move, analysts say.

Murdoch - who on Saturday agreed to buy Italian pay-TV rival Telepiu from Vivendi Universal in a 1.5 billion euro deal - must tackle rampant piracy, high costs of rights to Italian club soccer and boost subscriber levels, analysts said.

The banks under investigation by the EU since 1998 include the country's two biggest,  Bank Austria with subsidiary Creditanstalt and Erste  Bank (ERST.VI.  Bank Austria  is a unit of Germany's HVB Group.
"The EU sanctions decision is expected tomorrow," one  banking  source told Reuters.
Other sources said the  fine would total 120 million euros, with a maximum per  bank of 10 million to
50 million.

EU Commissioner Mario Monti is expected to announce the  fine at a news conference at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Tuesday in Strassbourg, sources said.

Besides the two largest  banks, others under investigation include Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) and the trade union  bank BAWAG and postal savings  bank PSK, which have since merged.

The probe first made headlines in June 1998 with dawn raids by EU investigators on the  banks that led to the seizure of thousands of documents.

In September 1999, the European  Commission formally warned Austrian banks that they were in breach of European Union antitrust rules.

The alleged violations centered around preventing competition by agreeing among themselves on interest rates and  bank commissions for financial services.

Shares of Erste  Bank were 0.79 percent lower at 75.40 euros on the Vienna market by 1422 GMT, while Germany's HVB Group was down 0.45 percent at 35.39 euros.

Japan machine orders rise, but economy needs oil

TOKYO - Japanese machinery orders, a gauge of capital spending, rose 8.4 percent in April as firms tooled up to meet export orders but the figures, along with others on Monday for  bank lending and prices, showed the economy was still not firing on all cylinders despite emerging from recession.

Economists said capital spending was likely to remain a drag on Japan's patchy economic recovery in the coming months even though data released last week showed the economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.7 percent in January-March.

VIENNA, June 10 (Reuters) - Telekom  Austria  slumped 0.35 percent on Monday after falling last week as investors shied away ahead of a possible secondary offering of as much as 15 percent of its shares later this year.

Despite Telekom's easing,  Austria's  ATX blue-chip index closed 0.08 percent firmer at 1,286.29 in low volume.

Vienna - Austria's  banks could face large fines from the EU after they allegedly met in secret to illegally
fix interest rates. On Tuesday the Union will decide how much money the  banks will have to pay, but up to
30 million euros per bank is estimated. The European antitrust regulators have accused seven big  banks
of illegally fixing savings and loan interest rates. The  banks had founded an association of  Austria's
leading credit institutions, called the "Lombard  Club". For decades, top representatives from the club met
regularly in Vienna's Hotel Bristol. But under community law already such attempts to form a cartel are
criminal, and the  commission is believed to have evidence that during this period the banks jointly set
interest rates for a number of services. The investigation was sparked by the Austrian Freedom Party
whose minister of justice Dieter Boehmdorfer had reported the  Lombard-Club  members to the EU as long
ago as 1997.

TD
The documents he based some of the case on were found in the legacy of former Kontrollbank head
Gerhard Praschak who committed suicide over a  banking  scandal.

HD          UPDATE 2-EU fines Austrian bank cartel 124 mln euros. BY           By David Lawsky
WC         651 words

BRUSSELS, June 11 (Reuters) - The European  Commission fined eight Austrianbanks 124.26 million euros ($117.4 million) on Tuesday and slammed what it called their "shocking violation" of antitrust laws by setting deposit and lending rates.

The Commission levied the fine after a five-year investigation found the  banks had worked together to avoid - in the wording of bank documents uncovered in raids - "uncontrolled price competition".

TD
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the  cartel blanketed the country and covered virtually all services, making it "one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the  Commission".

But unlike the United States, where similar agreements have been found to be criminal conspiracies and the conspirators have gone to prison and paid  fines, the European Union views such violations as civil offences which lead only to  fines.
Erste Bank was fined 37.69 million euros, Bank Austria,  a unit of Germany's HVB Group, and
Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) were each fined 30.38 million euros.

BAWAG and postal savings  bank PSK, which have since merged, were each  fined 7.59 million euros, as was OVAG. NO Hypo and RLB were each  fined 1.52 million euros.

Erste bank, the largest  Austrian-listed institute since bigger rival BankAustria was acquired by Germany's HVB Group in 2000, called the decision "unacceptable to us in view of the size of the  fine" and said it would appeal. "We believe the judgment is in no way justified," the  bank said.
Other banks were also expected to appeal,  banking  sources said.

The Commission raided banks' offices in 1998 on the heels of news reports and discovered hundreds of documents, including minutes of meetings, memoranda, records of phone conversations and correspondence.

"The exchange of experiences between  banks in relation to interest rates has repeatedly proved to be a useful means of avoiding uncontrolled price competition," the  banks said in one 1995 document.
FIXING PRICE PROBLEMS
The same paper urged them to gather again to fix prices.

"The way in which interest rates are currently being set shows very clearly that it is again necessary for us to sit down together and counteract problematic price developments," the document said.

The banks knew what they were doing was illegal, the  Commission notes. One document said that in the future "no more minutes should be kept" of meetings, it said in a statement.

And the  Commission said the legal department of one  bank recommended in its own words, "Destruction of all existing records."


Page 25 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Commission said the cartel was comprehensive, quoting one of its member  banks as saying that it covered the whole country, "down to the smallest village".

The entire process was coordinated by the chief executive officers of the  banks who got together monthly, except in August, for a meeting of their "Lombard  Club" to set the prices.
"Between January 1994 and June 1998 in Vienna alone at least 300 meetings took place," the
Commission said.

A defiant Erste bank responded to the decision by saying it disagreed that competition was restrained by the Lombard  Club. It said  Austrian bank services were among the most economical in Europe. It also said the Commission lacked jurisdiction as the  Austrian bank club did not affect broader European competition.
But it was unclear whether the  bank shared those views with the  Commission. The Commission
announcement said it had reduced the  fines to take into account cooperation from the banks.
"As the banks did not contest the facts set out ... a reduction of 10 percent was granted," the
Commission said.
The companies have three months to pay the  fines, which will go into the general budget of the

BRUSSELS, June 11 (AFP) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it has imposed fines totalling
124.26 million euros (117 million dollars) on eight Austrian banks for their role in the so-called Lombard
Club cartel.

The commission said it was imposing the  fine, which is one of the 10 biggest of this sort ever imposed by Brussels, because the  cartel members fixed interest rates for loans, savings and fees for certain services. The  cartel's activities also extended to money transfers and export financing, the  commission said.

TD
The cartel was uncovered following a series of dawn raids in June 1998. The  commission said it believed the cartel had been operating since 1994 but could only  fine the club for the period following Austria's  accession to the European Union in 1995.

BRUSSELS, June 11 (AFP) - The European Commission said Tuesday it had imposed  fines totalling
124.26 million euros (117 million dollars) on eight Austrian banks for their role in the so-called  Lombard
Club cartel.

The commission said it was imposing the  fine, one of the 10 largest sanctions of this sort ever approved by Brussels, because the  cartel members had fixed interest rates for loans, savings and fees for certain services.

The cartel's activities also extended to money transfers and export financing, the  commission said.

In Vienna,  Austria's  two leading  banks, Erste  Bank and the BankAustria Creditanstalt, said they would appeal against the decision.

"We think the judgement is in no way justified. We will wait to find out the reasoning behind the decision and will then examine it thoroughly. But the decision is unacceptable to us because of the large  fine," Erste Bank said in the statement.

The cartel was uncovered following a series of dawn raids in June 1998. The  commission said it believed the cartel had been operating since 1994 but could only  fine the club for the period following Austria's  accession to the European Union in 1995.
Erste Bank was slapped with the biggest  fine, followed by BankAustria and Raiffeisen Zentralbank

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union  Commission Tuesday fined eight banks a total of EUR124.26 million for fixing interest rates for loans and fees for services, declaring that they conspired to fix prices "down to the smallest village."

The heaviest  fines were given to Erste  Bank AG (R.DEO), at EUR37.69 million,  Bank Austria, EUR30.38 million, and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG (R.RFZ), also EUR30.38 million. The five other banks involved received fines between EUR1.52 million and EUR7.59 million.

TD
None of the banks contested the charges, the  Commission said. They fixed prices for many years before Austria  joined the E.U. in 1995 and only stopped in 1998 when E.U. inspectors launched surprise inspections.  Fines were calculated according to the size of the  banks' turnover and their cooperation with the investigation.
"It is one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the  Commission," said E.U. Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti.

During the 1998 inspections, the  Commission said it found hundreds of documents, minutes, records of telephone conversations and correspondence proving  price fixing.  The cartel even extended to money transfers and export financing.

The banks were aware that their activities violated antitrust law, the Commission said. At one meeting, a participant suggested that "no more minutes should be kept." When the bank's legal department was consulted, it recommended the "destruction of all existing records," the Commission said.
The cartel "covered the entire country 'down to the smallest village,' as one  bank put it," the
Commission said. For every  banking  product, a separate committee met to fix prices.
For every month except during the August vacation, the chief executives of the banks gathered at a
top-level body called "the  Lombard  Club." Interest and deposit rates were fixed, the Commission said.
Special meetings were also called when the  Austrian Central Bank changed its lending rates.
Between January 1994 and June 1998, the  Commission said at least 300 meetings took place. The
cartel behavior ended after 1998.

"Most Austrian banks participated in the cartel, but a careful analysis of the  cartel meetings showed that the eight banks played a key role," the Commission said.

In addition to Erste, Bank Austria  and Raiffeisen, the five other  banks involved were Bank Fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG (R.BAW), fined EUR7.59 million; Oesterreichische Postsparkasse (R.OPP),  fined EUR7.59 million; Osterreichische Volksbanken AG (R.OVB),  fined EUR7.59 million; NO
Landesbank-Hypothekenbank AG, fined EUR1.52 million; and Raiffeisenlandesbank
Niederosterreich-Wien Gen mbH, fined EUR1.52 million.

VIENNA -(Dow Jones)- The Austrian banks fined for fixing interest rates and commissions by the
European Union Commission, Tuesday said they will appeal against the decision.

Erste Bank AG (R.DEO), which received the heaviest  fine of EUR37.69 million, said it will file an appeal with the E.U.'s Court of First Instance.

TD
"We consider the decision of the E.U.  Commission very unfair," Erste  Bank's management said.
Management will wait to see the reasoning behind the decision and then examine it in detail. However, the decision is unacceptable in terms of the amount of  fine imposed, the  bank said.
The decision, it said, completely disregards the realities of the competitive situation in the Austrian    
banking  market as it was five years ago.

Furthermore, Erste  Bank said the level of the  fine is unreasonably high. The  fine is based on last year's income levels and not on the level five years ago.

Bank Austria,  which was fined EUR30.38 million, also said it will appeal the decision, saying
Austrian banking  services are among the cheapest by European standards.

Bank Austria  added that the matter doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the  Commission, since the alleged conduct had no impact on competition within the E.U.

Raiffeisen Zentralbank (R.RFZ) said it will examine the possibility of filing a nullity suit against the Commission's decision, arguing that the majority of its sales are earned in none-E.U. member countries, and furthermore that it doesn't have any private customer  banking  operations in Austria.

Erste Bank said it doesn't expect any sustained negative impact on its income or earnings prospects from the decision.

HD        EU Commission steps up anti-cartel action

The European Commission said its decision on Monday to impose  fines totaling Euros124m ($117m) against eight Austrian banks for their role in a  price-fixing cartel is a clear warning to other possible offenders.Mario Monti, the competition commissioner said the decision along with other similar ones last year, &quot;shows that the  Commission is stepping up its enforcement against cartels&quot;.

&quot;Banks should be in no doubt that they are subject to European Union competition rules just like any other sector. In fact, maintaining competition in the  banking  sector is particularly crucial,
considering the importance of the  banking  sector for consumers, businesses and the efficient allocation of resources in the economy as a whole,&quot; Monti said.

TD
The Commission said the Austrian banks had organised a &quot;highly institutionalised  price-fixing scheme which covered the entire Austrian territory - down to the smallest village - with a view of fixing deposit, lending and other rates to the detriment of businesses and consumers.&quot;

Monti said it was &quot;one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the  Commission.&quot; The banks knew that they were on the &quot;wrong side of the law&quot;. Documents seized included a statement by one participant that in future &quot;no more minutes should be kept of such meetings&quot;, and the legal department of one  bank recommended the &quot;destruction of all existing records&quot;.

Most Austrian banks participated in the  cartel, but the eight that have been  fined played a key role, the Commission said.

The eight banks are: the Erste  Bank der Oesterreischichen Sparkassen which had the highest fines of Euros37.6m; Bank Austria  Aktiengesellschaft and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich, each fined Euros30.4m; Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft Aktiengesellschaft, Oesterreichische Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft, Oesterreichische Volksbanken,  fined Euros7.6m each; and two regional  banks NO Landesbank-Hypothekenbank and Raiffeisenlandesbank NiederOesterreich-Wien,  fined Euros1.5m each. The total amount is the sixth largest ever imposed by the  Commission.

The Commission said it had found overwhelming evidence of collusion among the banks with hundreds of documents found and evidence of  cartel committees covering the whole of Austria  and all banking  products and services.

Monti said the action, following an earlier clamp down on anonymous accounts, would give the  Austrian banking  system &quot;the real possibility of working in a situation of much more open
competition&quot;. The  banks have not contested the  Commission's findings and have three months to pay the  fines.

Excerpt from report "Large  banks to appeal against EU ruling" by  Austrian newspaper Wiener
Zeitung on 12 June

Eight  Austrian banks are supposed to pay 124.26m euros as a fine for years of arrangements on interest rates for deposits and loans discussed in the so-called Lombard  Club during the 1995-98 period. This was decided by the EU  Commission in Brussels yesterday. The  banks - most affected are Erste Bank, Bank Austria/Creditanstalt,  and RZB [Raiffeisen Zentralbank] - will appeal against this decision.

TD
Erste Bank, which would have to pay most - 37.7m euros - reacted most quickly and will apply to the first-instance European Court of Justice to have the judgment set aside. The bank considers the ruling "not justified in any way" and "unacceptable", given the amount of the imposed fine, it said in a press release after the ruling became known...

Erste Bank continues to insist that this matter is not in the EU  Commission's jurisdiction since there was "no effect at all on the competition within the EU". This view is also shared by the BankAustria/Creditanstalt Group...

For EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti the matter is pretty serious: "The institutionalized establishment of this  cartel and its scope make it one of the most shocking cartels that the Commission has ever discovered." The  fine of 124.26m euros is the sixth largest cartelfine that the EU has imposed so far. The  banks have three months to pay the  fine.

HD     BANKING - COMMISSION FINES AUSTRIAN BANKS FOR PRICE-FIXING CARTEL. BY     By (BEP).

The European Commission has imposed fines totalling Euro 124.26 million on the so-called "Lombard Club", a  cartel of eight Austrian banks accused of fixing fees charged for consumers to exchange currencies. The Commission can only levy fines on the cartel for the period between 1995, when  Austria joined the EU, and June 1998, when it carried out surprise inspections at the banks' premises. The Commission nevertheless believes that the  cartel started well before Austria's  accession into the EU.

TD
Following the decision, announced on June 11, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti stressed that the EU executive would continue to take a hard-line over anti-competitive  cartel behaviour. "Banks should be in no doubt that they are subject to European Union competition rules just like any other sector", said Mr Monti. "In fact, maintaining competition in the  banking  sector is particularly crucial, considering the importance of the  banking  sector for consumers, businesses and the efficient allocation of resources in the economy as a whole."According to a Commission statement released after the decision was announced, the eight  banks that were involved in the cartel will be fined as follows:
- Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG: 37.69 million
- Bank Austria  Aktiengesellschaft: 30.38 million
- Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG: 30.38 million
- Bank fuer Arbeit und Wirtschaft Aktiengesellschaft: 7.59 million
- Oesterreichische Postsparkasse Aktiengesellschaft: 7.59 million
- Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG: 7.59 million
- NOe Landesbank-Hypothekenbank AG: 1.52 million
- Raiffeisenlandesbank Niederoesterreich-Wien reg Gen mbH: 1.52 million

The Commission was fairly lenient with the eight  banks when deciding on the size of their  fines. Because they co-operated fully with the  Commission's investigations and did not contest any of the facts set out in the original statement of objections, a reduction of 10% was granted.

-In deciding the size of  fines to levy on a cartel, the Commission considers the seriousness of the infringement, its duration, and the damage done to competition in the marketplace, as well as the existence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Under Regulation 17/62, the  fine can never exceed 10% of the company's total turnover.-

According to the  Commission, the Lombard  Club cartel network was comprehensive, highly institutionalised, closely interconnected and covered the whole country. The investigation found that for every banking  product there was a separate committee on which the competent employee at the second or third level of management sat. A constant flow of information took place between these committees and the top-level  Lombard  Club, which comprised the  banks' Chief Executive Officers.

Although the eight banks fined were the key players in the cartel, the Commission acknowledges that almost every bank in Austria  participated in the price-fixing.

The companies now have three months in which to pay the  fines, which will then go into the General Budget of the European Union.-The  Commission began to investigate the  Lombard  Club in May 1997, following reports of possible anti-competitive behaviour in the  Austrian media. However, it was not until June 1998 that the  Commission launched surprise inspections on the companies concerned. The raid uncovered a significant amount of evidence of a wide-ranging  cartel - such as minutes of meetings, memoranda, records of telephone conversations, and correspondence between the  banks. On the basis of this evidence, the  Commission sent a statement of objections to the  banks concerned in September
1999. It launched its investigation into the  cartel on November 24, 2000.-.

COMPANIES &FINANCE EUROPE - EU bursts into  price-fixing cartel's cosy club - Francesco Guerrera and Eric Frey look at the background to the Brussels probe and fining of eight  Austrian         banks.

Mario Monti, European Competition Commissioner, yesterday fined eight Austrian banks a total Euros 124.3m ( $117.5m) for "one of the most shocking" price-fixing conspiracies ever uncovered by the Brussels authorities.

TD
The penalty punishes some members of the "Lombard  Club" - a long-standing group of leading Austrian financial institutions that met in the Bristol Hotel, Vienna - for fixing interest rates for loans and savings and other fees between 1995 and 1998.

Erste Bank, the country's second-largest  bank, received the biggest fine - Euros 37.7m. Bank Austria, a unit of Germany's HVB group, will have to pay Euros 30.4m, like its rival RZB. Five other banks - BAWAG, PSK, OVAG, NO Hypo and RLB - received smaller  fines.

The Lombard  Club cartel may be one of the most shocking offences ever punished by the Brussels trust-busters, but it was also one of the least secret - and possibly one of the least successful.

The Commission's five-year investigation unearthed evidence of a complex set of  price-fixing committees, which covered the whole of  Austria  and most banking  products in breach of EU antitrust laws.

Between 1994 and 1998, more than 300 meetings of such committees took place in Vienna alone, the Commission said. But the existence of a  bankers' gentlemens' club that met regularly to discuss business matters was never a mystery.

Unlike most other cartels - which are agreed in cloak-and-dagger meetings in secret hideaways - this one took place before cigars and Sachertorte in the smart Viennese hotel.

The Lombard  Club was initiated in the aftermath of the second world war by the Nationalbank, the Austrian central bank, to prevent cut-throat competition between the commercial  banks and steer credit into those sectors favoured by the state planners.

Every first Wednesday of each month - apart from August -  bank CEOs met for lunch in the plush Marie Therese Room of the central Vienna hotel to talk about monetary and financial topics and agree on common interest rates and fees.

The meetings went on even after  Austria  joined the EU in 1995, but neither the  banking  nor the political establishment seemed to notice that these arrangements violated EU law.

Mr Monti made a veiled reference to this yesterday when he warned: "Banks should be in no doubt that they are the subject to EU competition rules just like any other sector."



Page 39 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The meetings stopped only in 1998 when, alerted by press reports and a series of complaints including one by the leader of the rightwing Freedom party Jorg Haider, the Brussels investigators raided the offices of some of the  Lombard  Club members.
Mr Haider's complaint was written by his lawyer Dieter Bohmdorfer, now justice minister.

Mr Haider has demanded compensation for  bank customers who had been hurt by the  cartel. He estimated the damage at Euros 7bn, which is much higher than most other estimates.

According to the  banks, which are set to appeal against the  Commission's decision, Mr Monti has been unduly harsh on a deal that was well-known and had only a limited affect on consumers and businesses.
Erste Bank said the decision was "unacceptable" and the fines "disproportionate" as the  Commission
had failed to take into account the fierce competition among Austrian banks in the late 1990s.

The banks say that, as competition heated up during the period, the  Lombard  Club agreements became increasingly irrelevant.

Bankers broke their promises the second they walked out of the room. In their view, this is proven by the fact that, by the late 1990s,  Austria  had one of the smallest interest rate spreads and lowest fee structures among any European country, a third lower than the EU average.

This also made Austrian retail banks far less profitable than institutions in Italy, Spain or other countries, they say.

The Commission disagrees. It says the  banks should be punished because they acted in such an open, anti-competitive way for so long.

The Brussels investigators said that the  cartel was comprehensive, well-structured and covered the entire country - "down to the smallest village" in the words of one participant.

The Commission dropped a parallel investigation into the efforts by some  Austrian banks to fix foreign exchange fees.

However, Mr Monti said yesterday's decision and the size of the  fine - the sixth-largest ever levied - were proof of Brussels' renewed determination to crack down on cartels.

HD         Austrian banks pay EUR124m penalty for fixing  charges. BY        By DEREK SCALLY BERLIN.

Eight leading  Austrian banks were fined EUR124 million by the European  Commission yesterday for fixing charges in what investigators called "the most shocking  cartel ever discovered by the Commission".

Mr Mario Monti, the European Competition Commissioner, said the Austrianbanks colluded for more than four years to fix interest rates on loans, as well as fees for transactions including money transfers and export financing "Banks should be in no doubt that they are subject to EU competition rules just like any other sector," said Mr Monti. He was amazed at the "institutionalised set-up and comprehensiveness" of the cartel, known as the "Lombard  Club". Once a month, the chief executives
of eight leading Austrianbanks met, often after calling for interest rate changes by the  Austrian State
Bank, "for the joint reflection of measures to be taken".

TD
At the meetings, the  bank chief executives co-ordinated policy and product launches and shared information about their own plans for interest rate changes. The  Commission said most Austrian          banks participated in the  cartel, but fined only the eight banks that it said played key roles, including Osterreichische Volksbanken, Erste and BAWAG. The banks' chief executives were aware of the illegal nature of their dealings, according to evidence uncovered. One  bank official suggested that "no more minutes should be kept of such meetings" while the legal department of another  bank recommended the "destruction of all existing records".

But the advice was not followed and investigators swooped on the  banks four years ago, confiscating minutes of meetings, telephone records and correspondence. Combing through the files they uncovered a cartel covering the entire country - as one of the  banks fined put it, "down to the smallest village".

Last December, the  Commission fined six German banks more than EUR100 million for conspiring to keep exchange charges on euro-zone currencies artificially high. An investigation into collusion between Irish banks on exchange charges on euro-zone currencies was abandoned when the  banks agreed to make certain changes.

BRUSSELS -- The European  Commission fined seven Austrian banks 124 million euros ($117 million) for allegedly fixing fees, in what European Union antitrust chief Mario Monti called "one of the most shocking" cartels he has encountered in the  commission's 18-month-old sweep against  price    fixing.

Mr. Monti said the  banks fixed fees on almost every service they offered, and fixed interest rates on nearly all their loans and saving accounts in the 1990s.

TD
None of the  banks disputed the charges, but two, Erste Bank AG and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG, said they would challenge their individual fines. Erste  Bank called its 37 million euro fine -- the largest -- "unfair" and said it would appeal to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, an arm of the European Court of Justice. Erste  Bank also said that regulating the matter isn't within the commission's jurisdiction because the "alleged conduct had no impact on competition within the EU."
The commission levied the fines after finding that the  banks colluded to fix fees between January
1995, when Austria  joined the European Union, and June 1998. The  commission levied eight
individual fines, though two of the  banks fined recently merged.

The commission said the banks' chief executive officers met regularly at Vienna's Bristol hotel to exchange confidential information and coordinate rates and fees. The executives -- called the Lombard  group after an interbank interest rate -- established "a network of  cartel committees that covered the whole of  Austria,"  the  commission said.

It said the committees reported to the  Lombard  group on how the banks should agree on fees for a host of services, including money transfers and export financing, and how to fix rates paid on savings accounts and charged for loans.

The commission's investigation began in 1998, when antitrust agents raided several of the  banks' offices and seized hundreds of documents, including minutes of meetings, records of telephone conversations and correspondence. Mr. Monti's office released excerpts from some documents yesterday to illustrate the  commission's contention that the  banks knew they were acting illegally.

The banks participating in the  Lombard  group were: Erste  Bank; BankAustria; Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich;  Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft, or Bawag; Osterreichische Postsparkasse; Osterreichische Volksbanken AG; NO Landesbank-Hypothekenbank AG; and Raiffeisenlandesbank Nieder-oestererreich Wienreg Gen.
Bawag and the postal savings  bank Postsparkasse later merged to form Bawag-P.S.K. Group.

HD         ECB's Liebscher regrets EU fined Austrian banks. WC        281 words

VIENNA, June 12 (Reuters) - Austrian National Bank Governor Klaus Liebscher said on Wednesday he regretted the European Commission's decision to  fine eight Austrian banks for allegedly violating antitrust laws by setting deposit and lending rates.
"I truly regret the penalties," Liebscher said. "And my trust in the solidity and seriousness of Austrian
financial institutions and their business management remains unchanged." The Commission levied the
124.26 million euro ($117.1 million)  fine after a five-year investigation found the banks cooperated to
avoid - in the wording of  bank documents uncovered in raids - "uncontrolled price competition".

TD
European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Tuesday the  cartel blanketed the country and covered virtually all services, making it "one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the Commission".
Liebscher, who is also a council member at the European Central  Bank, said that the so-called
Lombard  Club cartel's activities had not led to any noticeable improvements in the  banks' results.

Erste bank, the largest  Austrian-listed institute since bigger rival BankAustria was acquired by Germany's HVB Group in 2000, on Tuesday called the decision "unacceptable to us in view of the size of the fine" and said it would appeal.

Erste Bank was fined 37.69 million euros, and  Bank Austria  and Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) were each fined 30.38 million euros.

BAWAG and postal savings  bank PSK, which have since merged, were each  fined 7.59 million euros, as was OVAG. NO Hypo and RLB were each  fined 1.52 million euros.
Erste said in a statement on Wednesday that the  fine would have "no lasting impact on (its) results".

HD   (EU) EU/COMPETITION - Commission fines eight Austrian banks belonging to "Lombard Club". WC  701 words

Brussels, 11/06/2002 (Agence Europe) - The  Commission has imposed a total fine of EU 124.26 million on eight Austrian banks for their participation in an agreement known as the "Lombard  Club" which used wide-ranging price fixing  techniques. Commissioner Monti described this agreement as, "one of the most shocking that the Commission has ever come across" because of the nature of its institutionalised character and the length and breath of the country it covered. It began well before  Austria  joined the EEE in 1994 and covered the whole of the  Austrian country in fixing deposit, lending and other rates.

TD
The banks involved are Erste  Bank (a fine of EUR 37.69 million), Bank Austria  (a fine of EUR 30.38 million), Raiffaisen Zentralbank Osterreich (a  fine of EUR 30.38 million), Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft Aktieengesellschaft (a  fine of EUR 7.59 million), Osterreischische Postparkasse Aktiegesellschaft (a  fine of EUR 7.59 million), Osterreischische Volksbanken (a  fine of EUR 7.59 million), NO
Landesbank-Hypotheken  bank (a fine of EUR 1.52 million), and Raiffensisenlandesbank Niederosterreich-Wien reg Gen (a fine of EUR 1.52 million). The investigation began in 1998. Alerted by articles appearing in the  Austrian press, European investigators accompanied by civil servants from the Austrian Ministry of Economic Affairs carried out surprise inspections at a number of  Austrian banks. During the investigation they found a number of compromising documents demonstrating the existence of a network of  cartel committees covering the whole of  Austria,  as well as banking  products and services in which highly placed members of the  banking  establishment participated. The members of the  cartel fixed interest rates for loans and savings for homes and businesses, as well as fees consumers had to pay for certain services. The  cartel also extended to money transfers and export financing. The object of the Lombard Cartel was to exchange experience between  banks in relation to interest rates as a repeatedly useful means of avoiding uncontrolled price competition. Constant exchanges of information took place between the different  cartel committees, as well as between themselves and the  Lombard  club. Between January 1994 and the end of June 1998, in Vienna alone at least 300 meeting took place. What often triggered a committee meeting to be convened was a change in the key lending rates by the  Austrian Central Bank, whereupon the  banks promptly met for the "joint reflection of measures to be taken".

To calculate  fines in cartel behaviour, the  Commission took into account the gravity of the infringement, its duration and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. It thus reduced the amount that it would normally have imposed, with  banks that collaborated closely with it in the investigation, as the communication over clemency explained in 1996. As  banks did not contest the facts set out in the statement of objections, a reduction of 10% was granted. The companies have three months to pay the fines. During a press conference, Mario Monti sad that the  banks must not think that they are not subject to European competition rules as other sectors in the economy. The total  fine imposed on the "Lombard Club" is the sixth largest ever imposed and which can not exceed the 10% of annual turnover and reaches
1.8% of turnover for one of the  banks and is less than that for the other  banks.

Mr Monti underlined the fact that candidate countries still have a lot to achieve in order to adopt the acquis in competition policy. "We are at a key juncture in the process", he explained, emphasising that only four countries (the Baltic countries and Slovenia) have closed their competition chapters and that significant progress had to be made between now and the next Summit in October. He pointed out that the candidates had mostly advanced on aspects linked to mergers rather than in the field of State Aid where taxation assistance systems still exist which are incompatible with European competition rules, as well as important aid in sensitive sectors such as steel. Mr Monti will be participating on Sunday and Monday at the eighth conference on competition in Vilnius.

Vienna - The EU  Commission has fined eight Austrian banks 124.5 million euros after finding them guilty of conspiring to fix interest rates in the 1990s. The banks have said they will appeal the move to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The case was sparked after a complaint that the  banks, all members of the so-called Lombard  Club, had reportedly set up "a comprehensive price  cartel" for collusion in setting interest rates. The EU accepted that there was clear evidence to support the allegations and that the
action was in violation of EU  cartel regulations. EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a press release that "the institutionalised creation of this  cartel and its implementation make it one of the most shocking cartels that the  commission has ever uncovered." The fines cover the period from Austria's joining of the European Union in 1995 through to June 1998. Erste Bank has incurred the largest fine of
37.7 million euros.

TD
The banks have reportedly been setting aside reserves to cover the  fines, which, in the opinion of some observers, are slightly lower than expected.

BRUSSELS -- The European  Commission fined seven Austrian banks 124 million eurs for fixing fees on almost every service they offered and interest rates on nearly all their loans and saving accounts in the 1990s.

Mario Monti, the  commission's antitrust chief, said the scheme was so institutionalized and so comprehensive that it was "one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the  commission."

None of the  banks disputed the charges but two, Erste  Bank and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG, said they would challenge their individual  fines. Erste called its 37 million euro fine -- the largest -- "unfair" and said it would appeal to the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Erste Bank also said in a statement that regulating the matter wasn't within the jurisdiction of the commission, the European Union's executive body, because the "alleged conduct had no impact on competition within the EU."

The panel levied the fines for colluding to fix prices from January 1995, when Austria  joined the EU, to June 1998. The commission levied eight individual  fines, though two of the banks fined recently merged.

The panel said the  banks' chief executive officers met regularly in the Bristol hotel in Vienna to exchange confidential information and coordinate rates and fees. The executives -- called the  Lombard group after an interbank interest rate -- established "a network of  cartel committees that covered the whole of Austria,"  the  commission said.

The committees reported to the  Lombard  group on how the banks should agree on fees for a host of services, including money transfers and export financing, and how to fix rates paid on savings accounts and charged for loans.

The meetings were a "very serious infringement" of EU competition rules, Mr. Monti said at a news conference. "Banks should be in no doubt that they are subject to European Union competition rules, just like any other sector."

The commission's investigation began in 1998, when antitrust agents raided several of the  bank's offices and seized hundreds of documents, including minutes of meetings, records of telephone conversations and correspondence.

Mr. Monti's office released excerpts from some documents Tuesday to illustrate the panel's contention that the  banks knew what they were doing was illegal.

He pointed to a memo from the legal department of one  bank that recommended the "destruction of all existing records," and to an unnamed bank official who said that "no more minutes should be kept of such meetings." In the minutes of a 1995 Lombard  group gathering, an unnamed meeting host is quoted as saying that the "exchange of experience between  banks in relation to interest rates has repeatedly proved to be a useful means of avoiding uncontrolled price competition."

Last year, the  commission stepped up its investigation of price fixers, moving against 10 alleged cartels for market misbehavior and levying a record 1.8 billion euros of  fines. The number of cases

cracked and the amount of  fines levied in 2001 were more than the total number of cases or the size of
fines collected in the previous 45 years of EU antitrust activity.
The panel said Tuesday that more than eight  banks participated in the  cartel, but that the ones  fined
were the ring leaders.

The banks participating in the  Lombard  group were: Erste  Bank; BankAustria; Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich;  Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft, or Bawag; Osterreichische Postsparkasse; Osterreichische Volksbanken AG; NO Landesbank-Hypothekenbank AG; and Raiffeisenlandesbank

Excerpt from report headlined: "Large  banks to appeal EU ruling" from  Austrian newspaper Wiener
Zeitung on 12 June

TD
Eight  Austrian banks are supposed to pay 124.26m euros as a fine for years of arrangements on interest rates for deposits and loans discussed in the so-called "Lombard  Club" during the 1995-98 period. This was decided by the EU  Commission in Brussels yesterday. The  banks - most affected are Erste Bank, Bank Austria/Creditanstalt  and RZB [Raiffeisen Zentralbank] - will appeal this decision.

Erste Bank, which would have to pay most - 37.7m euros - reacted most quickly and will apply to the first-instance European Court of Justice to have the judgment set aside. The bank considers the ruling "not justified in any way" and "unacceptable", given the amount of the imposed fine, it said in a press release after the ruling became known. [passage omitted]

Erste Bank continues to insist that this matter is not in the EU  Commission's jurisdiction since there was "no effect at all on the competition within the EU". This view is also shared by the BankAustria/Creditanstalt Group. [passage omitted]

For EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti the matter is pretty serious: "The institutionalized establishment of this cartel and its scope make it one of the most shocking cartels that the  Commission has ever discovered". The fine of 124.26m euros is the sixth largest  cartel fine that the EU has imposed so far. The  banks have three months to pay the  fine.

AUSTRIAN National Bank Governor Klaus Liebscher said he rues Mario Monti's decision to  fine eight banks a total of 124.26 million euro for allegedly colluding on their deposit and lending rates. He said his "trust in the solidity and seriousness of Austrian financial institutions and their business management remains unchanged". Monti said the cartel nicknamed the 'Lombard  Club' was "one of the most shocking" he had seen.

TD
MONTI'S officials will meet telecoms industry executives next month to discuss the findings of an inquiry into the level of access to the 'last mile' of phone lines into customers homes. Competition in the
so-called local loop is seen as vital for expansion of fast internet services.

EU FOREIGN ministers meeting on Monday (17 June) are expected to trigger fresh negotiations with Switzerland, including ways to make EU citizens with Swiss  bank accounts pay taxes. The Swiss said they would start the savings tax talks only in the context of broader discussions including asylum rules and trade in services.

AUDITOR Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu has asked the  Commission for permission to complete the purchase of the UK operations of troubled rival Andersen.

EUROPEAN steel firms including Luxembourg-based Arcelor have won some exemptions from new American import duties, but are battling for more. Further progress on the exemption issue is one of the key factors in whether the EU will impose 300 million euro of sanctions against Washington.

EMPLOYMENT Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou said EU citizens should be able to switch jobs freely without losing out on pension rights. Workers retiring abroad currently face huge barriers including double taxation and women who leave jobs to raise children are also penalised by long qualifying periods before pension benefits are earned.

EU FINANCE ministers are expected to try to finalise agreements on energy taxation and budget guidelines for member states when they meet on 20 June.

EU CANDIDATE countries must boost their  banking  supervision, the president of the European Investment  Bank, Philippe Maystadt, warned. He said most  banking  laws in the countries matched those in the EU, but implementation was often below par.

HD     Haider slams Austrian banks in new populist blast

LP
VIENNA, June 14 (AFP) -  Austrian far-right leader Joerg Haider lashed out Friday at a group of  banks
accused of ripping off customers, fueling another of the populist political storms for which he is notorious.
His outburst came after the European  Commission accused the banks of illegal rate-fixing practices. The
EU's executive this week handed out one of its biggest ever fines -- 124 million euros (118 million dollars)
-- to eight  banks accused of having agreed to fix certain rates to the detriment of businesses and
customers.

TD
Haider's Freedom Party has seized on the issue -- "one of the most shocking ever discovered by the Commission" according to competition commissioner Mario Monti -- threatening embarrassment for the banks and for Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, who shares power with the far-right.
On Friday the Freedom Party put on sale 10,000 copies of a brochure entitled "Attack against the bank   
cartel". The  banks have launched an appeal against the Brussels decision.

The far-right offensive is seen by most commentators as an attempt to use the  bank issue as a campaign theme ahead of legislative elections scheduled for next year.

Haider accused the banks of being "crooks," and estimated the cost of the issue to customers at seven billion euros.

The banks responded by calling the figure "ridiculous," comparing it to their cumulated 2001 profits of three billion euros.

In an interview published Friday, Haider proposed the  banks pay two billion euros in commpensation to fund lower taxes which his party is demanding for small tax-payers.
Freedom Party Justice Minister Dieter Boehmdorfer even called on consumers to protest to  banks. Legal experts and consumer defence bodies say such complaints are unlikely to achieve anything,
stressing that it will be all but impossible to prove theoretical losses incurred in court.
The banks say that despite their agreeement, their rates are among the lowest in Europe.

The central  bank issued a statement Friday regretting that Haider "is discrediting a key sector of the economy by condemning it without judgment".
Haider, who stepped down as party leader after bringing it into the government in February 2002,
continues to condemn "scandals" in the  Austrian establishment, just as he did when he was in opposition.

The banks are accused of being under the influence of the two parties which shared power in  Austria  for decades until the 2000 elections: the conservative People's Party and the Social Democrats.
The latter are now the main opposition group.

"The two parties must answer for this scandal," said Haider, while Chancellor Schuessel -- who signed the coalition agreement with Haider -- warned against "calling financial institutions into question."

The centre-left daily Standard commented in an editorial that "while European imitators of Joerg Haider discover xenophobia, he has already found a more effective hobbyhorse, economic populism."

Vienna - Joerg Haider has demanded that the  bankers of the so-called 'Lombard  Club' cartel be made to face harsh legal and civil penalties for allegedly fixing interest rates during the 1990's. The Freedom Party Regional Govenor of Carinthia and former leader of the party was responsible for alerting the EU Commission to the Lombard  Club affair in 1997, along with Justice Minister Dieter Boehmdorfer. Those accused of involvement in the affair currently face sentences of up to 3 years. Now Haider says he expects the Austrian justice system will ensure it considers making the accused liable for some form of partial compensation for the damage caused. He said the bankers would be in a position to do this because of their substantial income. Haider rejected the bankers' argument that their illegitimate methods were necessary as the banking  system did not function properly at the time.

TD
He also said the representatives of the  bank should be held responsible for its former fraudulent practices and added that they should "pay a contribution towards tax reform." The idea would involve the  Austrian courts fixing the amount which the bankers and their representatives would have to pay. Haider also proposed a use for the EU-imposed fines of up to 124.3 million euros. He said: "The Federal Government should urge the head of the Commission, Romano Prodi, not to let the money simply trickle into one general pot, but rather use it to promote the protection of the country's borders."

HD      Austrian cartel fined Euro124 million

The European Commission said it has imposed fines totalling Euro124.26 million on eight  Austrian        banks for their role in the Lombard  Club cartel - an informal gathering of  bankers that met in a Vienna hotel.

The bulk of the fines were imposed on the three largest  banking  groups. Erste Bank was fined Euro37.69, while Bank Austria  and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich were each fined Euro30.38 million.

TD
Investigations into alleged fixing of interest and commission rates began in 1998, when some of the banks were raided for evidence, and the banks were sent a Statement of Objections, effectively a list of charges, in September 1999. In November 2000, the  Commission sent a supplementary Statement of Objections to "Austrian banks suspected to have participated in a  cartel known as the Lombard  Club" alleging that they were also engaged in "unlawful discussions concerning euro-zone exchange charges."
Slow justice on insurance directives

The Commission intends to take France to the Court of Justice for its failure to implement insurance directives by a deadline of 1 July, 1994.
The directives required some 3,000 mutual societies offering life insurance to:
* comply with prudential and financial obligations laid down in the directives;
* separate their insurance business from other activities;
* protect policy-holder interests on transfer of portfolios, and;

* bring their reinsurance arrangements into line with the EC Treaty by making them accessible to all reinsurers in the EU.

France has failed to comply with a previous judgment delivered in 1999, so the  Commission is seeking a daily fine of Euro242,650 for further non-compliance.
France clears EU-wide pension funds

The French government withdrew its longstanding demands for quantitative limits on cross-border investment by pension funds at an ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg at the end of May. EU finance ministers welcomed the move, which they said represented a big step forward in the creation of a single market for financial services. The diplomatic skills of the Spanish presidency were reported to have played a key part in French objections, which some observers saw as protectionist in nature, even though they were dressed in the language of prudential investment practices and protection of pensioners' interests.

"Pension funds will have a European passport which can mobilise trillions of euro in capital for the financing of companies," said Internal Market commissioner Frits Bolkestein. "The rights of future pensioners must be protected by strict prudential standards, but pensions must not become too costly through low returns or excessive administrative constraints. "We need to allow institutions for occupational retirement provision to benefit fully from the internal market and the euro. I am pleased that the text on which the Council has agreed preserves the  Commission's twin objectives of security and affordability of occupational pensions, without interfering with the organisation and efficiency of Member States' pension systems."

The Commission estimates that a large multinational firm in Europe could save up to Euro40 million if it could cover employees across the EU with a single pension scheme.
IAS from 2005

A regulation requiring listed companies, including  banks and insurance companies, to prepare consolidated accounts in line with International Accounting Standards (IAS) from 2005 was adopted by ECOFIN after a single reading.
The Commission said the adoption of IAS, which it proposed in February 2001, is "a key measure in the
Financial Services Action Plan, on which significant progress has been made in the last few weeks."

In contrast to directives, EU Regulations do not need to be transposed into national legislation in order to have the force of law. The Regulation establishes a new EU mechanism to assess IAS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the international accounting standard-setting organisation based in London, to give them legal endorsement for use within the EU.

The Accounting Regulatory Committee chaired by the  Commission and composed of representatives of the Member States, will decide whether to endorse IAS on the basis of  Commission proposals.
Economists predict slow recovery

The upswing has begun in Europe, but it cannot yet be regarded as strong, self-sustaining growth, according to bank economists meeting in the European  Banking  Federation's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (EMAC).

Economic growth will be around 1.4 percent this year and rise to 2.3 percent in 2003, but unemployment will not fall substantially without "courageous structural reforms in the labour market," they said. The economists reiterated earlier appeals to euro area governments to abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, which imposes limits on permissible public-sector deficits and borrowing.

EMAC chairman Martin Heufner said sterling was overvalued by at least 20 percent against the euro and would need to fall by that amount before the UK should join the single currency. "At these (current) levels, entry is not possible or advisable," he said after presenting EMAC's report on the euro area's economic outlook.
Single market for payments

The European Banking  Federation has issued a White Paper summarising the deliberations of 40  banks and four banking  associations on the development of a single payments market at a recent workshop in Brussels.

"From a policymaker's point of view, the foundation stone of the SEPA (Single European Payments Area) has already been laid," the EBF concluded. "The vision foresees a Europe that will gradually develop into a market of 500 million SEPA citizens and consumers making and receiving over 100 billion non-cash transactions every year. These transactions will all be made within a domestic eurozone, with the
cross-border transactions of today becoming a relic of the past."

However, success in reforming wholesale payments as part of the euro switchover has not been matched in the retail area, where no true pan- European electronic funds transfer system for mass, low-value payments yet exists. Even in payment cards, which are the dominant cross-border instrument, while the infrastructure exists for seamless domestic and cross-border payments, there are significant price differences, the  bankers concluded.
The White Paper is available from  www.fbe.be

VIENNA, June 20 (Reuters) -  Austria's  second largest  bank Erste Bank sprung back from over a week of selling, adding 2.4 percent in a technical rebound after falling since the EU imposed a  cartel fine and the bank announced a share capital increase.

Erste's gains were not enough to pull up the  Austrian benchmark ATX index, which slipped 0.19 percent to 1,241.50 amid heavier selling on major European stock markets.

TD
The 20-issue ATX closed with 7 stocks higher, 12 lower and one unchanged.

Losers included heavyweight Telekom  Austria  , which accounted for about a third of ATX volume and fell 1.2 percent to 8.15 euros as the previous day's 5-percent recovery from a string of losses lost steam.

The stock faces the prospect of a secondary offering later this year that has been depressing prices, although traders said it seemed to have found solid support above 8.00 euros.

Erste Bank closed at 72.00 euros in what traders called a techical move after falling 3.7 percent the day before.
"The reaction is promising, even if volumes were very large," one trader said.

The retail, commercial and investment  bank's stock has gained 21 percent this year, outperforming the ATX by 11 percent.

Erste came under pressure last week when it announced plans to issue at least eight million new shares to increase its share capital by around 16 percent in order to fund further expansion across central Europe.

The shares in Austria's  biggest listed  bank, second to German HVB Group's Bank Austria  unit, have also lost ground over fears that earnings could be dented by a 37.7 million euro fine imposed by the European Commission for allegedly violating anti-trust laws.

HD      Austrians seek to sue banks

Some 15 per cent of  Austrians are planning to sue the  banks involved in the so-called  Lombard  Club
cartel for compensation, if figures of a recent representative survey are applied nationally.

The move comes weeks after the EU  Commission imposed huge fines amounting to EUR 124.3 million on eight Austrian banks for allegedly fixing interest rates during the 1990s. Now, a nationwide survey by the Vienna market and opinion research institute Okonsult commissioned by newspaper Der Standard has found that 73 per cent of all  Austrians feel that a tougher line should be taken.

TD
Thirty-two per cent of those in favour of tougher penalties feel that Justice Minister Dieter Bohmdorfer should push the banks to pay compensation to the public, 27 per cent who think the OeNB should do so, and 24 per cent that it's the Association for Consumer Information's responsibility.

The only issue that divided the  Austrian population was the extent of possible personal loss on interest rates. Around 44 per cent believe that they would have been directly affected by the  banks' actions, compared to 56 per cent who do not. But 80 per cent agree that the  banks were aware that they were breaking the law, with 71 per cent expressing dissatisfaction at the "complete failure" of consumer protection.

The European  Commission has fined eight Austrian banks E124.3 million ($117.7 million) for their participation in what it alleged was a "highly institutionalised price-fixing" cartel, which covered all banking  products and services, including money transfers.

The fines were the culmination of a four-year investigation into the  Lombard  Club, through which chief executive officers of the  banks met most months. Hundreds of documents obtained in raids in June 1998 produced evidence of a network of  cartel committees. The  cartel members fixed interest rates for loans and savings for private or household customers and for commercial customers, as well as the fees consumers had to pay for certain services.

TD
Although most  banks were alleged to be involved in the cartel, the Commission concluded that the eight fined banks played key roles. Austria's  biggest  bank, Erste Bank, was fined E37.69 million, while  Bank Austria  and RZB were each fined E30.38 million. A 10 percent reduction in fees was granted as the banks involved did not contest the details set out in the statement of objections.

HD     Global News - Austrian Banks Announce Appeals Against  Price Cartel Penalties. WC     379 words

AUSTRIAN banks Facing a share of  fines totalling e124.26m levied by the European  Commission for allegedly participating in a wide-ranging price  cartel have announced appeals against the penalties.

Brussels acted after unmasking what it claims was a "highly institutionalised  price-fixing scheme," with the banks' CEOs meeting every month, except August. This  Lombard  Club, concluded a  Commission inquiry, was "a  cartel which covered the entire  Austrian territory down to the smallest village".

TD
This group conspired to fix deposit, lending and other rates, said the  Commission, which added that the
cartel started well before  Austria  joined the EU in 1994. Brussels officials raided participating  banks in
1998 to seize documents.

Three banks judged to be pivotal in the  cartel shared the heaviest  fines. They were Erste  Bank der osterreichischen Sparkassen AG (Erste) e37.7m, BankAustria Aktiengesellschaft: (BA) e30.4m and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich (RZB) e30.4m. Five other smaller  fines were meted out to smaller Austrian banks.
Announcements of appeals have been swift. Erste  Bank immediately announced a European Court of
Justice appeal against the  fine, calling it "unreasonably high."

The statement said: "It has been proven that, by European standards,  Austrian banking  services are among the cheapest. Further, the level of the  fine is based on last year's income levels and not on the levels five years ago."

The bank also claimed that the allegations do not fall under the Commission's jurisdiction "since the alleged conduct had no impact on competition within the EU" outside Austria.
The Bank Austria  Creditanstalt Group also announced an appeal claiming that the  banks' meetings
"were not secret cartel agreements but an official instrument of economic control".
It claimed that even after 1994, some of these meetings were presided over by the  Austrian Economic
Chamber and with the  Austrian central bank and the Austrian Ministry of Finance.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, by contrast, said: "The institutionalised set-up of this  cartel and its comprehensiveness, both in terms of the  banking  services covered and geographical scope, makes it one of the most shocking cartels ever discovered by the  Commission."

"Banks should be in no doubt that they are subject to European Union competition rules just like any other sector."

Eurofighter Wins

TD
Contract to Supply
24 Jets to Austria

Austria  awarded Eurofighter GmbH a key victory, selecting the multinational manufacturer to supply 24
Typhoon combat aircraft for a 1.79 billion euro ($1.77 billion) contract. Eurofighter is owned by European
Aeronautic Defense & Space, or EADS, Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Finmeccanica. A spokesman
for the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign-arms sales, said the U.S.
was disappointed  Austria  had chosen the Typhoon over Lockheed Martin's F-16 fighter but added it
would continue close defense cooperation with  Austria.
The Typhoon also beat out the Gripen fighter made by BAE and its Swedish affiliate, Saab. Natexis to Buy U.S. Brokerage Firm
Natexis Banques Populaires said it agreed to buy U.S. brokerage firm Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder in an all-stock deal valued at $105 million, beefing up the French  bank's equities business. As part of the deal, Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder's existing shareholders will take a 2.6% stake in Natexis, the investment-banking  arm of French mutual  bank Banque Populaire. Natexis said the New York brokerage firm would be renamed Natexis Bleichroeder. The deal, which requires U.S. regulatory
approval, is expected to be completed this fall. A&SB, the parent of Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder, said it will continue with its asset-management business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Advisers.
DeGussa, Nippon Soda  Fined by EU

The European  Commission fined German chemicals company Degussa and Japan's Nippon Soda a total of 127 million euros (US$125.7 million) for fixing prices of a key animal-feed ingredient called methionine. The European Union executive body said it granted France's Aventis complete immunity because Aventis lifted the lid on the  cartel's existence and provided proof of the unlawful operation, which the commission said operated for 13 years until 1999. Degussa said the level of its 118 million euro fine was "unacceptable" and it will challenge the decision. It didn't give any further details. Nippon Soda won a 50% reduction in its  fine, which totaled nine million euros, by providing evidence of collusion prior to 1990.
Poland's Finance Minister Resigns

Polish Finance Minister Marek Belka resigned, telling reporters he was "burned out" and potentially complicating efforts to bring Central Europe's largest economy into the European Union. Mr. Belka, a


Page 66 of 76 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Western-trained economist, was seen as the eight-month-old government's leading fiscal moderate. There was no immediate successor named for Mr. Belka.
Ahold Reiterates Argentine Exposure

Investor fears that a possible debt default by the Argentine joint-venture partner of Dutch supermarket retailer Ahold could cost Ahold almost $500 million and force it to miss its target of 15% growth in earnings per share this year -- excluding currency effects and goodwill amortization -- sent Ahold shares down 9.6% in Amsterdam trading. Ahold reiterated that it could lose as much as $496 million if its
joint-venture partner, Velox, defaults on its debt obligations, as Argentina's financial crisis continues to ravage business there.
BRIEFLY:
-- Orange said it will buy a 71.25% stake in Egypt's MobiNil Telecommunication for 324 million euros
($321 million) from the European wireless operator's parent, France Telecom.

-- Spanish utility Endesa said it will divide its operations into a European natural-gas and electricity business and a Latin American power business as part of its strategic refocus.

-- Irish real-estate company Green Property said it agreed to a 1.05 billion euro ($1.04 billion) management-led buyout through a company called Rodinheights. Green's independent directors will recommend the offer.

THE AMERICAS
Mexican Ex-President Is Questioned

A former Mexican president was called before a prosecutor to answer questions about two massacres during the country's "dirty war" against leftist insurgents. The summoning of 80-year-old Luis Echeverria, president in 1970-76, marked the first time a Mexican president was required to appear before a prosecutor. Mr. Echeverria was questioned in a closed hearing about two student massacres in 1968
and 1971. The special prosecutor, Ignacio Carrillo, spent about six hours detailing the complaints from a committee of survivors and adding questions of his own as part of an investigation. Mr. Echeverria asked to respond in writing within 30 days, his lawyer said. Mr. Echeverria's traditional ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party held power for 71 years until Vicente Fox, of the National Action Party, won the
2000 presidential election. Mr. Fox later ordered an investigation of dirty-war crimes during the 1970s and '80s.
Donors Agree on World  Bank Aid

Donor governments have agreed on a plan to increase World  Bank funds for the world's poorest countries, with a larger share of the money distributed as grants. The World  Bank's International Development Association will provide about $23 billion over the next three years to 79 countries in which the majority of people live on less than $2 per day, the  bank said. The accord was struck despite disagreements between the U.S. and Europe over how much of the money should be released to countries in loans and how much as grants. The U.S. had asked that 50% of IDA funds be in grants. The final compromise allows for between 18% and 21% of IDA aid to be distributed as grants. About half of the IDA money will be targeted at Africa.
U.S. Court Sets Montemayor Hearing

A U.S. District Court judge in Houston set a July 17 hearing for Rogelio Montemayor, the former head of Mexico's state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, after U.S. prosecutors said they weren't ready to accept his surrender on corruption charges in Mexico. Judge Nancy Atlas agreed to give U.S. officials more time to sort out the unusual case.
BRIEFLY:

-- Ecuador's first-quarter gross domestic product contracted 0.9% from the prior quarter, the central bank said. The GDP contraction could challenge the  bank's forecast of 4% growth this year. GDP last year increased 5.6%.
-- Colombia will cut its projection for economic growth this year to between 1% and 2%, from between
2.5% and 3% currently, National Planning Director Juan Carlos Echeverry said.

ASIA/PACIFIC
Australian Trade Deficit Widens

Australia's trade deficit in May widened to a seasonally adjusted 623 million Australian dollars (US$350 million), from A$333 million in April, as imports grew 2%, while exports were unchanged. The trade deficit was wider than economists' consensus forecast of a A$400 million deficit. The May trade deficit was the widest since August 2000. Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS Warburg, said the trend pointed to monthly deficits averaging about A$500 million in the months ahead.
Credit Lyonnais, Xiangcai Seek Link

Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, a unit of French  bank Credit Lyonnais, and Chinese brokerage firm Xiangcai Securities have applied to set up a joint venture in Shanghai that will be capitalized at 500 million yuan ($60.4 million), a Xiangcai official said. The application was the first to be sent to the China Securities Regulatory  Commission since new rules governing Sino-foreign securities firms took effect Monday, official media said.
BRIEFLY:

-- Canadian insurer Manulife Financial said it agreed to take on MetLife's in-force life-insurance business in the Philippines, effective immediately. Financial terms weren't disclosed. MetLife, New York, said in February it would close its Philippines unit.

-- The Tokyo Stock Exchange is considering tightening its listing standards this year to require companies to have a market capitalization of at least one billion yen ($8.3 million) in a move aimed at boosting investor confidence, an exchange official said.

-- Philippine Vice President Teofisto Guingona, locked in a policy dispute with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo over U.S. training of Philippine counterterrorist troops, has resigned from his second post as foreign secretary, according to a joint statement. Mr. Guingona declined to comment. No replacement was named.
