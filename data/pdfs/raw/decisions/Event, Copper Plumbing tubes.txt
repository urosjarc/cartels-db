BRUSSELS, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A group of  copper pipeline makers face fines on Friday from the European Commission for conspiring to fix prices and set territories for copper plumbing pipes, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.
The European Union executive is scheduled to meet on Friday.

TD
Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V.HE) of Finland is expected to be among those  fined.
SMI (SMII.MI) of Italy, privately held Wieland-Werke of Germany, Mueller Industries (MLI.N) of the
United States and others also make such pipes.
A spokeswoman for the European  Commission had no comment.

The Commission carried out raids against  copper tubing makers in March 2001 in Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Finland, including Outokumpu and SMI, on suspicion of forming a  cartel in the copper plumbing tubes and fittings market.

The raids were part of investigations by the Commission into three sectors of the  copper tube market: Industrial  tubes, fittings and plumbing.

Last December the  Commission imposed 79 million euros ($95.42 million) in  fines on three companies, Outokumpu, Germany's KM Europa Metal's KME unit and Wieland-Werke for participating in a copper air conditioning and refrigeration  tubes cartel.

The E.U.'s probe is focused on products for sanitary equipment such as water and gas pipes that are used in households and in industry. Regulators launched their probe in March 2001 with a series of raids on companies in the U.K., Germany, Italy, France and Finland. The E.U. already has  fined some of the same companies for colluding over sales of  copper tubes used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. Last year, the E.U.  fined Outokumpu EUR18.1 million and GIM EUR39.8 million in that case. Outokumpu appealed to E.U. judges at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg to overturn its  fine, spokeswoman Johanna Sintonen said on Wednesday. The fines on tube makers are a sign of wider concern about collusion in the  copper industry. Last year, the Commission launched a separate investigation into allegations that companies including Rio Tinto PLC (RIO.LN) have been fixing  copper concentrate prices. The E.U. can penalize companies as much as 10% of their company's annual global sales. The record is EUR462 million  fine levied on Hoffman-La Roche in 2001 for rigging the worldwide vitamins market. In the last three years, the  Commission fined 25 separate cartels and imposed more than EUR3 billion in  fines. -By James Kanter and Dirk Mueller-Thederan, Dow Jones Newswires;

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The European  Commission on Friday imposed a 222.3 million euro ($271.1 million) fine on a group of copper pipeline makers for conspiring to fix prices and set territories for copper plumbing pipes

"Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, EU consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

Two of the companies  fined were Finland's Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V.HE) and privately held
Wieland-Werke of Germany. Outokumpu was  fined 36.14 million euros and and Wieland-Werke was
fined 27.8 million euros.

HELSINKI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Finnish metals group Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE) plans to appeal a European Union  fine of 36 million euros ($43.91 million) for participating in a  cartel for copper sanitary tubes, the company said on Friday.

Outokumpu said some staff had violated European Union competition rules, but the  fine was too large.

TD
"We regard it to be totally out of proportion and will certainly appeal. The  Commission refers in its decision among others to the stainless steel  cartel of 1990 as an aggravating issue, however, Outokumpu was never  fined in that case," Outokumpu said in a statement.

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The European Union imposed a 222.3 million euro ($271.1 million) fine on Friday on eight  copper pipeline makers for conspiring to fix prices and set territories for copper plumbing pipes.

The EU's executive Commission said that the firms, involving Sweden's Boliden, British IMI and Finland's Outokumpu Oyj, ran a cartel between 1989 and 2001 in a market worth about 1.15 billion annually.

TD
"The companies operated a well-structured, classic  cartel with codenames, meetings in anonymous airports lounges and the clear objective to avoid competition through allocation of production volumes and market shares," it said in a statement.
Outokumpu said it planned to appeal the  fine, saying its was excessive.
"We regard it to be totally out of proportion and will certainly appeal," the firm said in a statement.
The Commission carried out raids into the  copper tube makers' headquarters as part of its anti-cartel
probe in 2001 after U.S. Mueller Industries revealed the existence of the group.
As a result of its cooperation Mueller Industries escaped a  fine, the Commission said. The fined companies are:
* Boliden AB - 32.6 million euros
* Halcor SA - 9.16 million euros
* HME Nederland BV - 4.49 million euros
* IMI plc, IMI Kynoch Ltd. and Yorkshire  Copper Tube Ltd -



44.98 million euros
* KM Europe Metal AG, Trefimetaux SA, Europa Metalli Spa --
67.08 million euros
* Mueller Industries, WTC Holding Company, DENO Holding --
0

* Outokumpu Oyk - 36.14 million euros
* Wieland Werke, Austria Bunmetall - 27.84 million euros

Last December the  Commission imposed 79 million euros ($95.42 million) in  fines on three companies, Outokumpu, Germany's KM Europa Metal's KME unit and Wieland-Werke for participating in a copper air conditioning and refrigeration  tubes cartel.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the  fine reflected the importance the  Commission
attaches to fighting cartels.

"Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, EU consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play," Monti said in a statement.
The current EU executive, whose five-year term ends in November, has imposed 4.4 billion euros in
fines for anti-trust violations.

Finnish metals and technology company Outokumpu Group said on Friday (3 September) that it had received a notification from the European Commission concerning participation by Outokumpu's  copper tube business in a  cartel with respect to sanitary tubes in the European Union.

The Commission had concluded that Outokumpu had participated in a  cartel and had therefore decided to fine Outokumpu for EUR36m.

TD
Outokumpu said that it would study the decision carefully, but would in any case appeal it.
One euro (EUR) is worth approximately 0.66 British pounds (GBP).

HD      INSURERS BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES AS FRANCES BLOWS IN. BY       MARKET REPORT - BY TOM NICHOLLS

AS INSURERS count the cost of the damage wreaked by Hurricane Charley last month, they are now also bracing themselves for the arrival of Hurricane Frances.

Estimates are that Charley may cost the industry $6.8 billion (£3.8 billion) but Frances, which could be the biggest storm to hit Florida in a decade, may do even more damage if it reaches the area, as expected, tomorrow.

TD
Analysts said there were very few UK insurers that would not be harmed by further storm damage on the
East Coast of the US.

Amlin - due to report half-year figures on Monday - was off 21/2p at 139p, Brit was down 1p at 75p, Wellington was 1/2p lower at 81p and Atrium traded flat at 1761/2p. Legal & General attracted healthy volume after claiming to have built up its share of the UK insurance market by a healthy margin in the second quarter, but the shares held steady at 1011/2p.

DFS was off 11p at 430p, despite Lord Kirkham giving shareholders a new and final offer to try out for size.

The furniture group's executive chairman, who wants to take the company private 35 years after he founded it, raised his offer last night by 10p a share to 455p, equivalent to £507 million.

Seymour Pierce described the sweetened bid as 'fair' although 'not exactly generous'. Worries among shareholders that they may be shortchanging themselves if they accept the offer could scotch the bid.

The failure of the attempted takeover, combined with a possible walkout by the firm's directors if the bid collapses, would 'significantly adversely' affect DFS shares, warns broker Arbuthnot.

London shares were flat halfway through the session, as participants awaited key US jobs data, which should give clues to the strength of the US recovery. Reversing small early gains, the FTSE 100 index edged 2.1 points lower to 4516.5.

Bid speculation ebbed in the food retail sector. Merrill Lynch poured cold water on the idea of a takeover for J Sainsbury, whose shares rose yesterday on bid speculation.

Today, they slid 23/4p to 2681/4p. One rumoured bidder, Arcadia owner Philip Green, has denied interest.

Water reached boiling point amid takeover talk, with shares in Northumbrian Water rising 14p to 157p on speculation that Kelda might launch a bid. Despite the large share-price move, some traders said such a move would be impractical on regulatory grounds.

CSFB has thrown its weight behind the oil sector, raising its medium and long-term oil price assumptions, but has been less kind to chemicals companies. It cut its sector rating to underweight and downgraded
ICI to underperform, which saw the shares drop 31/2p to 2171/2p. BOC shares were off 11p at 883p.

Rising 43p to 2606p, drugs giant AstraZeneca found itself on a high after Goldman Sachs upgraded to outperform on the basis of healthy expectations for earnings growth. Shares in IMI, due to report interim

results on Monday, were down 11/2p at 356p. Rumours are circulating that, later today, the European Commission will find IMI and other companies guilty of price-fixing for copper tubing used in household plumbing. If that proves to be the case, the EC could fine the company up to 10% of its annual turnover.
EasyJet was 2p better at 149p after it dumped co-adviser UBS in favour of Hoare Govett.

Edited Press Release

TD
Swedish mining and smelting company Boliden AB (BOL.SK) Friday said its former Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA unit has been  fined EUR32.6 million by the E.U.  Commission for participation in copper tube cartel. The company said the E.U. Commission has been investigating the operation of a cartel in the European market involving sanitary copper tubes over the period 1988-2001. Boliden said its former subsidiary, Boliden Cuivre et Zinc, which has now been sold, was one of nine companies under investigation. The  Commission has now ruled that a  cartel was effectively being operated and that  fines should be imposed on the companies involved. Boliden said it will appeal the  Commission's ruling. At
the turn of the year 2003 and 2004, Boliden sold its Business Area Fabrication, which included Boliden Cuivre et Zinc, to Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V.HE). Boliden said it has undertaken to keep Outokumpu indemnified in respect of all consequences arising from commission rulings concerning the  cartel. The company said it will be making a special allocation for the fine in its results for the third quarter of 2004.

Some of the same companies punished Friday still could face further  fines in a related but separate investigation into  copper fittings that connect pipes together. E.U. officials won't give details of that case, which still must be decided. The E.U.  Commission has become an aggressive cartel-buster under the tenure of Monti. Since taking office in 1999, Monti's levied more than EUR4.5 billion in  fines, the bulk of that amount from punishing  price-fixing rings similar to Friday's case. The E.U. can penalize companies as much as 10% of their company's annual global sales. The record in a  cartel case is a EUR462 million fine levied on Hoffman-La Roche in 2001 for rigging the worldwide vitamins market. The E.U.'s overall record fine in an antitrust case is EUR497 million, imposed earlier this year on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
for abusing its Windows computer operating system monopoly. -By James Kanter, Dow Jones

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1001 am EDT/1401 GMT CORRECTS YEAR IN THIRD TAKE TO 'LATE 1989' FROM 'LATE 1998' The European  Commission on Friday said it had imposed  fines worth Eur222.3-mil ($270.5-mil) on seven companies for operating a  cartel in copper tubes used in household plumbing. The European Competition  Commission, which investigates allegations of  price fixing  in the 25-nation EU, said the seven companies had operated a cartel in plumbing tubes between 1998 and 2001, in a market worth around Eur1.15-bil a year in 2000, the cartel's last full year. The following companies were fined (the charge imposed is shown in brackets): Germany's KME (Eur67.08-mil); Finland's Outokumpu (Eur36.14-mil); Germany's Wieland Werke (Eur27.84-mil); Sweden's Boliden (Eur32.6-mil); UK's IMI (Eur44.98-mil); HME of the Netherlands (Eur4.49-mil) and Halcor of Greece (Eur9.16-mil).

Mueller Industries of the US, which the EC said was also part of a  cartel, avoided a fine under the EC's
'Leniency Notice', which enables a company to escape a  fine if it is the first to reveal the existence of
price-fixing.

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1003 am EDT/1403 GMT The EC added that it became aware of  price-fixing in January 2001, when it had been approached by Mueller Industries. An investigation was launched in March 2001 after the EC's competition watchdog carried out a series of raids on  plumbing tube makers. "The Commission concluded that the main producers of the  copper water, heating and gas  tubes that go into houses and buildings operated a  cartel between June 1988 and March 2001 in most of the European Economic Area in a clear breach of EU Treaty and EEA Agreement rules that outlaw restrictive business practices," the EC said. It added that the investigation "has shown that the companies operated a well-structured, classic  cartel with codenames, meetings in anonymous airport lounges and the clear
objective to avoid competition through the allocation of production volumes and market shares, the setting of price targets and increases as well as other commercial terms for plain copper plumbing tubes (and, as far as the KME and the Wieland groups are concerned, plastic-coated copper plumbing tubes)."

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1005 am EDT/1405 GMT The EC said the  cartel met at airport lounges in Zurich and Amsterdam in late 1989 where the participants monitored the implementation of  price-fixing by exchanging information on sales, orders, market shares and pricing. The EC's competition watchdog said the cartel was organized at three levels, the first and oldest being the so-called Sanco club-Sanco
was the brand name for a quality  copper plumbing tube-which was formed at first by KME and Boliden. It was later joined by Wieland Werke and KME's subsidiaries Trefimetaux and Europa Metalli. Outokumpu and IMI joined the price-fixing fold a year later, the EC said. Commentators on the copper market had expected that any fines would be hefty given the size of the market in  copper sanitary tubes in Europe, where most homes contain  plumbing fittings made out of  copper. For Outokumpu, KME and Wieland Werke, it is the second time in a year that the companies have been  fined for operating a  cartel in
copper tubes.

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1005 am EDT/1405 GMT Last December, the EC's Competition  Commission slapped fines worth a total Eur79-mil on the three companies for fixing the prices of  tubes used in air conditioning and refrigeration (otherwise known as ACR  tubes). Meanwhile, Boliden said Friday it would appeal the EC's ruling on  plumbing tubes. At the beginning of this year Boliden sold its  copper fabrication business unit, including sanitary tube production, to Outokumpu and the company said it had undertaken to keep Outokumpu indemnified in respect of all consequences arising from the EC's rulings concerning the cartel. The Swedish metals producer said it would be making a special allocation for the

Page 25 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
fine in its results for the third quarter. Shortly after Boliden announced its intention to appeal Friday, Outokumpu said it would also seek to overturn the EC's ruling on sanitary  tubes.

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1007 am EDT/1407 GMT "Infringement of competition law is not condoned within Outokumpu. As for the  fine, we regard it to be totally out of proportion and will certainly appeal. The Commission refers in its decision among others to the stainless steel  cartel of 1990 as an aggravating issue, however, Outokumpu was never  fined in that case," said the company's CEO Jyrki Juusela. The Finnish company said that certain individuals within the company had infringed the competition law in conducting the ACR and sanitary tube businesses. "Immediately after the start of the investigation in
March 2001, Outokumpu CEO issued group-wide instructions requiring full compliance with the competition laws, followed by a comprehensive and strengthened implementation of compliance program within Outokumpu  Copper in order to ensure full compliance in the future," the company said.

London (Platts)-3Sep2004/1008 am EDT/1408 GMT In March, Outokumpu lodged an appeal to the Court of First Instance for Europe against the  fine imposed for the ACR tubes cartel and the amount of the  fine itself. The Finnish metals producer said Aug 31 that it would sell its fabricated copper operations in order to concentrate on its dominant stainless steel unit. Despite its intention to appeal, Outokumpu said a provision for the  fine issued Friday would be entered as an unusual item in its third quarter results.

HD     EU fines copper cartel for forcing price of plumbing up

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European  Commission ordered the main producers of copper pipe in Europe on Friday to pay a total of euro222.3 million (US$269 million) for operating a cartel that forced up the cost of  plumbing in European homes for a dozen years.

The three-year investigation was sparked by a whistle-blower, Mueller Industries Inc. and its affiliates, which escaped any penalty. The  Commission said it found the  cartel ran from June 1988 to March 2001 in most of Europe.

TD
"Because of the companies' illegal behavior, European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
The plumbing market was worth an annual euro1.15 billion (US$1.4 billion) in 2000.
The largest  fine -- euro67.1 million (US$81 million) went to the pipe-manufacturing units of Milan-based
Generale Industrie Metallurgiche SpA in Germany, France and Italy.

The IMI group of Britain received the second largest  fine, euro45 million (US$54.4 million). Finland's Outokumpu was third with a  fine of euro36.1 million (US$43.7 million). Boliden AB of Sweden must pay euro32.6 million (US$39.4 million).

Germany's Wieland-Werke and a group of Austrian companies must pay euro27.8 million (US$33.6 million), while Halcor SA of Greece was hit with a euro9.2 million (US$11.1 million)  fine. The EU also fined HME Nederland BV euro4.5 million (US$ 5.4 million).

Over five years, the  Commission has imposed a total of euro4.6 billion (US$5.5 billion) in  fines for antitrust violations.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union  Commission Friday fined a group of companies, including Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V.HE) of Finland, a total of EUR222.3 million for fixing the prices of copper plumbing tubes. [ 03-09-04 1037GMT ]
The E.U. slapped the largest penalty on pipe-manufacturing units of Milan-based Generale Industrie
Metallurgiche SpA (GI.MI) in Germany, France and Italy. Those  fines total EUR67.1 million.

TD
IMI PLC (IMI.LN) of the U.K. received the second-largest  fine, EUR45 million. Outokumpu was third with a fine of EUR36.1 million. Boliden AB (BOL.SK) of Sweden must pay EUR32.6 million.

Germany's Wieland-Werke and a group of Austrian companies must pay EUR27.8 million, while Halcor SA (XAKO.AT) of Greece was  fined EUR9.2 million. The E.U. also  fined HME Nederland BV EUR4.5 million.
Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI) of the U.S. escaped a  fine for telling European regulators first about the
cartel - which lasted 12 years - in January 2001. [ 03-09-04 1107GMT ]

E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the  fines were an important sign of the "relentless fight" against cartels - particularly those that hurt consumers.

"European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play," Monti said in a statement.

The E.U. said members of the  cartel operated surreptitiously, using codenames and meeting in airport lounges to fix prices, rig output and divide up markets.

According to notes obtained by the E.U. from a meeting in Zurich airport in September 1989, the cartel's objective was "to keep the prices in the high-price level countries high - if possible to increase even more."

The European market for sanitary pipes was worth around EUR1.2 billion in 2000, which was the last full year of the  cartel's operations. The E.U. said Outokumpu, GIM-unit KME Group, Wieland and Halcor volunteered information during the probe, and were able to win reductions in their  fines.
The E.U.has already  fined some of the same companies for colluding over sales of  copper tubes
used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

Last year, the E.U.  fined Outokumpu EUR18.1 million. GIM was hit with a EUR39.8 million  fine in that case. Outokumpu has appealed the  fine to E.U. judges at the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Outokumpu was first caught fixing prices by the E.U. in a 1990 case involving stainless steel, but it escaped a fine that time. [ 03-09-04 1128GMT ]

Some of the same companies punished Friday still could face further  fines in a related but separate investigation into  copper fittings that connect pipes together.
E.U. officials won't give details of that case, which still must be decided.

The E.U.  Commission has become an aggressive cartel-buster under the tenure of Monti. Since taking office in 1999, Monti's levied more than EUR4.5 billion in  fines, the bulk of that amount from punishing price-fixing rings similar to Friday's case.

The E.U. can penalize companies as much as 10% of their company's annual global sales. The record in a cartel case is a EUR462 million  fine levied on Hoffman-La Roche in 2001 for rigging the worldwide vitamins market.
The E.U.'s overall record  fine in an antitrust case is EUR497 million, imposed earlier this year on
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for abusing its Windows computer operating system monopoly.

STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Swedish mining and smelting company Boliden AB (BOL.SK) Friday said its former Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA unit has been  fined EUR32.6 million by the E.U.  Commission for participation in  copper tube cartel.

TD
The company said the E.U. Commission has been investigating the operation of a  cartel in the
European market involving sanitary copper tubes over the period 1988-2001.

Boliden said its former subsidiary, Boliden Cuivre et Zinc, which has now been sold, was one of nine companies under investigation.

The Commission has now ruled that a  cartel was effectively being operated and that  fines should be imposed on the companies involved.
Boliden said it will appeal the  Commission's ruling.
At the turn of the year 2003 and 2004, Boliden sold its Business Area Fabrication, which included
Boliden Cuivre et Zinc, to Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V.HE).

Boliden said it has undertaken to keep Outokumpu indemnified in respect of all consequences arising from commission rulings concerning the  cartel.
The company said it will be making a special allocation for the  fine in its results for the third quarter of
2004. [ 03-09-04 1042GMT ]

Edited Press Release

STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Finnish steel company Outokumpu Oyj (OUTIV.HE) Friday said it has received a notification from the E.U. Commission that it will be fined EUR36 million for participation by its copper tube business in a cartel with respect to sanitary tubes in the European Union.

TD
The Commission has concluded that Outokumpu has participated in a  cartel and has therefore decided to fine the company.

After having received the  Commission's complete decision Outokumpu said it will study it carefully, but will in any case appeal.
A provision for the  fine will be entered as a one-time in the third-quarter 2004 results.
As part of the same investigation, Outokumpu said it received a notification on Dec. 16, 2003, from the
European Commission concerning participation by its  copper tube business in a cartel with respect
to air-conditioning and refrigeration  tubes in the European Union.
The Commission concluded that Outokumpu had participated in a  cartel and therefore decided to
fine Outokumpu for EUR18 million.
A provision for the  fine was entered as an unusual item in the fourth-quarter 2003 results.

On March 30, 2004 Outokumpu said it submitted an appeal to the Court of First Instance for Europe with respect of the grounds for the calculation of the  fine and the amount of the  fine itself.

The Commission initiated the  cartel investigation concerning producers of  copper tubes and fittings in the European Union in March 2001.

Outokumpu said it has from the beginning given its full cooperation to the  Commission in the investigation. #

The Commission's investigation was subsequently divided into three parallel cases of ACR  tubes, sanitary tubes and tube fittings.

Outokumpu was implicated in the two first cases. In 2003, the net sales of Outokumpu's sanitary tube business in Europe were some 2% of the company's net sales.

Since the mid 1990's Outokumpu said it has issued and implemented detailed business area and group-wide guidelines for the compliance with the competition laws.
Training in these issues has covered hundreds of people in its management.

Regrettably, the company said that during the Commission's investigation it has become evident that those guidelines haven't had a strong-enough effect in its copper tube business, and that certain individuals have infringed the competition law in conducting the ACR and sanitary tube businesses.

Immediately after the start of the investigation in March 2001, Outokumpu's chief executive issued group-wide instructions requiring full compliance with the competition laws, followed by a

Page 32 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
comprehensive and strengthened implementation of compliance program within Outokumpu  Copper in order to ensure full compliance in the future.

Also certain organizational changes were implemented during the spring 2001 with respect to personnel having been implicated in the initial internal investigation by Outokumpu into the activities under the Commission s investigation.

"These infringements with the competition law go against the essence of proper corporate behavior and the Outokumpu values. We have made certain that appropriate guidelines for competition law compliance are in place and that they are strictly followed," said Jyrki Juusela, CEO at Outokumpu.

"Infringement of competition law is not condoned within Outokumpu. As for the  fine, we regard it to be totally out of proportion and will certainly appeal. The  Commission refers in its decision among others to the stainless steel  cartel of 1990 as an aggravating issue, however, Outokumpu was never  fined in that case," Juusela said.

European regulators will find seven companies including Outokumpu, IMI and the US's Mueller Industries guilty of fixing prices for  copper tubing used in household  plumbing, according to reports this morning.

The European  Commission ruling, due today, is the second in 10 months against some of the companies.

TD
Regulators in December  fined Outokumpu, which is based in Espoo, Finland, Societa Metallurgica Italiana and Germany's Wieland-Werke a total of more than E79m for fixing the prices of  tubes used in air conditioning and refrigeration. Today's  fine is expected to be higher.

Copper tubing is the second-largest application for the metal, after electric cabling and wiring. As many as 90pc of UK homes have  copper plumbing, according to the  Copper Development Association UK. European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti will recommend the decision at a  commission meeting today after his department found enough evidence of  price fixing,  the reports said. The Commission has never rejected one of his recommendations.

HD        EU fines copper cartel Euros 222.3m. BY        By RAPHAEL MINDER

Home owners in the European Union have been overpaying for  plumbing work because of a price
cartel operated by Europe's leading makers of  copper tubing, according to the European  Commission.
The EU's executive decided yesterday to  fine the colluding companies a total of Euros 222.3m (Dollars
268m) for secretly agreeing on prices in a market worth about Euros 1.15bn a year.

TD
The decision follows an investigation launched after a tip-off in January 2001 from Mueller Industries, which decided to take advantage of an EU leniency rule allowing a company to escape a  fine in return for revealing the existence of a  cartel.

The companies fined are Boliden of Sweden, Halcor of Greece, HME Nederland, the UK's IMI group, the KME group, Outokumpu of Finland and Wieland Werke of Germany.
Four of the companies - Outokumpu, the KME group, Wieland and Halcor - received reduced  fines
because they also provided information voluntarily to help establish the  cartel's activities.

Some of the  cartel participants warned yesterday they would appeal against the level of the  fines, including IMI and Outokumpu, which were ordered to pay Euros 45m and Euros 36m, respectively. Jyrki Juusela, chief executive of the Finnish company, said its  fine was "totally out of proportion". IMI said it would consider an appeal once it had studied the decision. It sold its  copper business in 2002.

The Commission said its probe had revealed that the companies operated "a well-structured, classic cartel with codenames, meetings in anonymous airport lounges and the clear objective to avoid competition through the allocation of production volumes and market shares and the setting of price targets and increases".

Among the evidence gathered against the companies was a note written at a secret meeting in Zurich airport that stated that "the objective is to keep the prices in the high price level countries high - if possible to increase even more".

Mario Monti, the EU's competition commissioner, said yesterday: "Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play."

The cartel was allegedly launched by KME and Boliden in 1988, with other members joining in subsequent waves.

The companies fixed prices for tubing used to transport water, heating and gas in houses and larger buildings. Outokumpu had already been found guilty in 1990 of participating in a separate  price-fixing cartel for stainless steel.

The Commission has penalised cartels in industries ranging from vitamins to electrical components. Since taking office in October 1999, Mr Monti has imposed Euros 4.55bn of  fines for antitrust violations.

The European Union has imposed a 222.3 million euro ($348-million U.S.)  fine on Europe's main makers of copper plumbing pipes for fixing prices and dividing up the market. The EU said the firms
— involving Sweden's Boliden Ltd., Britain's IMI PLC, Finland's Outokumpu Oy and units of Italy's Società Metallurgica Italiana SpA — ran a cartel in 1988 to 2001 in a market worth about 1.15 billion euros annually. The EU carried out raids on the copper tube makers' headquarters as part of its
anti-cartel probe in 2001 after U.S. firm Mueller Industries Inc. revealed the existence of the group. As a result of its co-operation, Mueller Industries escaped a  fine, the commission said. Reuters

HD           British firm fined £30m for its part in plumbing cartel

THE UK engineering company IMI was  fined EUR44.98m (£30.5m) yesterday for taking part in a
12-year-old long scam with European competitors to keep up the cost of  plumbing equipment.

The IMI group, made up of IMI plc, IMI Kynoch Ltd, and Yorkshire  Copper Tube Ltd, was one of eight companies running an elaborate  cartel to keep up prices for water, heating and gas  tubes, and squeeze out cheaper rivals.

TD
Announcing the  fine, the European  Commission said the companies "operated a well-structured, classic cartel, with codenames, meetings in anonymous airport lounges and the clear objective to avoid competition".

The Commission quoted notes from one of the company involved, taken at the  cartel"s first meeting of European firms in 1989 in Zurich, which said; "The objective is to keep the prices in the high price level ... if possible to increase even more."

The illegal arrangement ran between June 1988 and March 2001; IMI joined in September 1989. Although IMI sold its  copper tube and fitting business in 2002, it is still responsible for the findings of the Commission.

Copper piping used in house building and by industry accounts for a major use of the metal, second only to cabling. The market, including plastic- coated  copper plumbing tubes, was worth around EUR1.15bn in 2000.

The cartel was finally exposed by one of the eight participants, Mueller Industries, based in the UK, France and the US, which blew the whistle in exchange for escaping a  fine.

The other seven firms, including Sweden"s Boliden and Finland"s Outokumpu, were  fined a total of EUR222.3m. IMI"s penalty was the second-largest, after Societa Metallurgica Italiana"s EUR67.1m fine.

Mario Monti, the European Commissioner for Competition, said: "Because of the companies" illegal behaviour, European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house. Today"s decisions illustrates the relentless fight against cartels by this  Commission."
Outokumpu and Boliden said they would appeal against the  fine. The IMI spokesman, Graham
Truscott, said: "We"ve got to understand the full details" before making a comment.

A UK-based company involved in a Europe-wide  cartel which kept up plumbing repair costs was fined
nearly £35m by the European  Commission yesterday.

The fiddle ran for 12 years but was exposed by one of the eight participants, Mueller Industries, based in the UK, France and the US, in return for escaping any  fine.
The total fine against the other seven culprits amounted to almost £155m, shared out, said the
Commission, to reflect the gravity of each participant"s involvement. IMI"s  fine was the second largest.
It joined the cartel in 1989, staying involved until 2000, the last full year of the  cartel"s operation in a
European copper plumbing tubes market worth about £800m annually.

"Because of the companies" illegal behaviour, European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play, "" said EU competition Commissioner Mario Monti.
"Today"s decisions illustrate the relentless fight against cartels by this  Commission. ""
The cartel ran from June 1988 until March 2001, breaching EU rules outlawing restrictive practices.

THE European Union has  fined eight copper pipe manufacturers Euro 222.3 million (Pounds 159 million) for price-fixing and operating a cartel.

According to the EU, the firms ran the  cartel for more than a decade in a market worth more than Euro 1.15 billion annually. The companies were IMI, the British firm, as well as Boliden, of Sweden, Outokumpu Oyj, of Finland, Italy's SMI, Halcor, of Greece, HME-Nederland and Germany's KM Europa Metal and Wieland Werke.

TD
The Commission imposed the biggest  fine, Euro 67.1 million, on SMI.

The EU said: "The companies operated a classic  cartel with code names, meetings in airports and the objective to avoid competition through allocation of production volumes and market shares."

The Commission quoted notes taken from from one of the groups which said that "the objective (of the cartel) is to keep the prices in the high price level, if possible to increase even more".

The Commission carried out raids on the firms' headquarters as part of its anti-cartel inquiry in 2001 after Mueller Industries disclosed the group's existence.

Mueller escaped a fine because of its co-operation with the  Commission. Mario Monti, the Competition Commissioner, said: "Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, consumers paid more for plumbing replacement or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play."

Last year the  Commission imposed Euro 79 million in  fines on three firms, Outokumpu, Germany's KM Europa Metal's KME unit and Wieland Werke for participating in a  copper air-conditioning and refrigeration  tubes cartel.

Signor Monti said that yesterday's  fines illustrated the "relentless" fight against cartels by the Commission. Signor Monti has built up a reputation as a  cartel-buster. In March he announced plans to hit Microsoft with a record  fine of more than Pounds 300 million for an alleged abuse of its
monopoly position.

Lately he has suffered setbacks with many of his merger control decisions criticised for being made on the basis of sloppy reasoning.

Brussels, 03/09/2004 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has decided to impose a  fine of EUR 222.3 million on a group of companies that had formed a cartel in the European market for plumbing tubes in copper between June 1988 and March 2001. The  tubes are mainly used for water, gas and heating installations, a market that was worth around EUR 1.15 billion in 2000, the last complete year during which the  cartel operated. Groups concerned are Swedish Boliden (a  fine of EUR 32.6
million), Greek Halcor (EUR 9.16 million), Dutch HME Nederland (EUR 4.49 million), British IMI (EUR 44.9 million), KME (Germany, France and Italy, EUR 67.08 million), American Mueller Industries and its British and French subsidiaries (no  fine), Finnish Outokumpu (EUR 36.14 million) and German Wieland Werke (EUR 27.8411 million).

TD
Partners had set in place a mechanism for coordinating their activities aimed at avoiding competition via a system for attributing production volumes and market shares, the fixing of common objectives and price rises, as well as the application of other trade conditions for copper plumbing pipes (and, as far as KME and Wieland are concerned, plastic-coated copper plumbing pipes). The aim was to maintain high prices in countries where prices are high and, if possible, to increase them even more, according to a note
drafted by one of the companies during a meeting. The  cartel was organised at three levels: the first and the oldest was the so-called "de Sanco" club (Sanco being the trade name for a quality  copper plumbing pipe), formed originally of KME and Boliden. It was then enlarged to the French and Italian subsidiaries of KME, Tréfimétaux and Europa Metalli, and to Wieland, then, in a third stage, to Outokumpu and IMI which joined them in September 1989, as well as Mueller in 1997 in order to form the "group of five" biggest European producers (the three companies plus Wieland and KME as well as its subsidiaries).

Commissioner Monti recalled the negative effect that cartels have on consumers. "Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, European consumers paid more for  plumbing replacement work or when buying a house than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play", he said. Outokumpu, KME, Wieland and Halcor collaborated in the  Commission inquiry, with the  Commission therefore reducing the amount of their  fine. The fine imposed on Outokumpu also takes into consideration the fact that this company had already been found guilty of having taken part in the 1990 stainless steel cartel. Mueller Industries, which revealed the existence of the  cartel, enjoyed immunity from being fined.

HD      COMPETITION: SEVEN COPPER COMPANIES FINED 222.3 MILLION FOR ANTI-TRUST BREACHES WC     619 words

LP
Seven manufacturers of copper tubes used for water and gas  plumbing have been hit with a Euro 222.3 million fine for running an illegal cartel between June 1988 and March 2001. The existence of the cartel only came to light when the newest member, Mueller Industries, approached the European Commission in January 2001 in return for lenient treatment, as permitted under the EU's 1996 Leniency Notice.

According to a statement issued by the  Commission when it announced the  fines on September 3, the cartel allocated production volumes and carved up market shares between the companies, giving them control over setting price targets and increases, as well as other commercial terms for  copper plumbing tubes.

TD
The Commission describes the alliance as a classic  cartel - with "codenames" and "meetings in anonymous airport lounges". One note taken from the inaugural meeting of the  cartel, held on September
29, 1989, at Zurich airport, allegedly said: "The objective [of the  cartel] is to keep the prices in the high price level countries high - if possible to increase even more."

The cartel started out as a union between KME and Boliden in 1988 (the so-called Sanco club, named after a brand of quality  copper plumbing tube), and then included Tréfimétaux, Europa Metali and Wieland. Outokumpo and IMI joined in September 1989, and Mueller in 1997.

The copper piping produced by the companies is widely used in the European market for supply of water, heating and gas to domestic households, and the  Commission felt that the anti-trust infringements seriously and unfairly raised consumer prices.

The seven companies involved in the  cartel were fined different amounts according to their level of participation, how long they were involved, and to what extent they co-operated with the  Commission's investigation:
- Sweden's Boliden Group (comprising Boliden AB, Boliden Fabrication AB and Boliden Cuivre & Zinc
S.A.): Euro 32.6 million
- Halcor S.A. of Greece: Euro 9.16 million
- Holland's HME Nederland BV: 4.49 million

- Britain's IMI Group (comprising IMI plc, IMI Kynoch Ltd. and Yorkshire  Copper Tube Ltd): Euro 44.98 million
- The joint German Italian French venture KME Group (comprising KM Europa Metal AG, Tréfimétaux SA
and Europa Metalli SpA): Euro 67.08 million
- Finland's Outokumpu Oyj and Outokumpu  Copper Products OY: Euro 36.14 million
- Wieland Werke AG of Germany (including Austria Buntmetall AG and Buntmetall Amstetten
Ges.m.b.H.): Euro 27.841 million




Page 59 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- Mueller Industries, Inc. of the USA, UK and France (comprising Mueller Industries, Inc., WTC Holding
Company, Inc., Mueller Europe Ltd., DENO Holding Company, Inc. and DENO Acquisition EURL): no
fine

The absence of a  fine for Mueller Industries reflects the company's involvement in bringing the  cartel to light in the first place. The  fines on Outokumpu, the KME group, Wieland and Halcor were accordingly reduced in recognition of their co-operation with the investigation, which helped to establish the infringements. However, Outokumpu's  fine was increased because the company had already been caught in a separate steel  cartel in 1990, along with six other major stainless steel manufacturers.
A previous copper cartel.

Three of the firms involved in this latest cartel bust - Outokumpu, KME Group and Wieland Werke - have already come up against the Commission's competition watchdog for their involvement in a separate price-fixing arrangement for copper tubing. This previous abuse lasted between 1988 and March 2001, and pertained to the market for tubes used mainly in the air-conditioning and refrigeration (ACR) industry. The Commission decided to fine the companies Euro 79 million on December 16, 2003 (see Europe Information 2830).

Reporting cartel saves Mueller

TD
Mueller Industries has escaped a big fine from the European Union because the company reported the existence of a  cartel to fix the prices of copper plumbing pipes.

The EU's executive  commission levied a fine of more than $270 million on Sweden's Boliden, Britain's IMI, Finland's Outkumpu Oyj and units of Italy's SMI, which ran a  cartel from 1988 to 2001 in a market worth about 1.15 billion euros a year.

South Carolina plant to expand
Eastman Chemical Co., based in Kingsport, Tenn., said it will spend $100 million to expand a South
Carolina plastics plant, adding 50 jobs.

Eastman's Voridian division already operates the world's largest facility, near Columbia, for making the material used in plastic soft drink bottles, jars and other containers. Barry Falin, Voridian's vice president, said the expansion will begin in January and full production would begin by the end of 2006.

The investment involves a new polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, chemical process with fewer steps and lower energy needs.

The plant now has about 500 employees and will increase that to about 550, but that's still fewer than the 700 jobs the company had in Calhoun County in 2001.

Wal-Mart may settle federal suit

Page 61 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. acknowledged Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission that it is discussing a possible civil settlement with federal prosecutors that would resolve allegations that it used illegal workers to clean its stores.

A federal grand jury has been meeting in Pennsylvania since December of 2003 to investigate charges that the world's largest retailer, based at Springdale, Ark., knew that some of the janitorial companies it used to clean its floors employed illegal immigrants.

Federal agents arrested about 250 alleged illegal workers last October during a sweep of Wal-Mart stores in 21 states. Some immigrant workers have sued the company, claiming they were paid illegally low wages.
Merrill Lynch set for energy trading

Merrill Lynch & Co. said Thursday that it entered a definitive agreement to acquire the energy trading business of Entergy-Koch LP for an undisclosed amount.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, after which the trading unit will operate as the global commodities group within Merrill Lynch's global markets and investment banking division.
Entergy-Koch's current energy trading management will continue running the group.
Merrill Lynch said the deal is expected to benefit its 2005 earnings. Meat company noted for growth
Fortune magazine has named Tyson Foods Inc. one of America's 100 fastest growing companies.

It is the highest-ranked food company and the only meat protein company in the list, which appears in the magazine's Sept. 6 issue.

Based in Springdale, Ark., Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork.

Judge orders investigation

A Canadian judge on Friday ordered that an independent inspector be appointed to investigate the affairs of Hollinger Inc., the Toronto-based parent company of Hollinger International Inc., the newspaper company formerly run by Conrad Black.

The probe was requested by Catalyst Fund General Partner I Inc., a shareholder of Hollinger Inc. The judge, Colin L. Campbell of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, is expected to disclose the reasons for his decision later this month, according to a company statement.
The ruling came just days after Hollinger International released a 500-page report alleging that Black
and his associates engaged in years of "aggressive looting" of the Chicago-based newspaper company,

Page 62 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
whose holdings include the Chicago Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and, until recently, The Daily
Telegraph of London.
The report asserted that Black and others siphoned off $400 million from the company from 1997 to
2003, or nearly all of the company's profits during that time.

Black has been removed as CEO and chairman of Hollinger International, but he remains the company's controlling shareholder through Hollinger Inc., which holds 68 percent of the voting power of Hollinger International through a special class of stock.

HD            UPDATE 1-UK engineer IMI upbeat despite raw material costs. WC           317 words

LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - British engineer IMI (IMI.L) posted a 13 percent rise in first-half adjusted profits on Monday and said underlying demand should underpin its second half despite the adverse affect of higher raw material prices.

IMI, which makes valves, drink dispensers, pipes and merchandising systems, said profit before tax and goodwill rose to 74.4 million pounds ($133.4 million) in the six months to June 30, up from a restated 65.9 million.

TD
"Raw material price inflation is continuing to impact costs and margins. The positive trend in underlying demand, however, should underpin progress in the second half," the firm said in a statement.

IMI said it might appeal a  fine of 45 million euros ($54.9 million) imposed last week by the European Commission (EC) for the part played by its former  copper plumbing pipe business in what the EC said was a price-fixing cartel.

But it was awaiting details of the EC's ruling and was unlikely to make a decision before late 2005. No provision for the  fine was made in the results.

Chief Executive Martin Lamb said demand had been especially strong in North America, but profits had been eroded by the increased cost of steel and PVC.
The interim dividend was increased by 5 percent to 6.3 pence a share.

"That's the first time we've increased the dividend in three years since we started to reposition the company," said Lamb. "The board is optimistic of prospects going forward."

The strong result comes on the heels of a 8.4 percent profit increase in 2003, helped by a production shift to low-cost economies in Mexico, China and eastern Europe.
At 0828 GMT IMI shares were 0.1 percent up at 363 pence, giving the firm a market capitalisation of
1.31 billion pounds.

HD        EC fines seven companies in copper plumbing tubes cartel

LP
London–The European  Commission last week imposed fines worth a weighty Eur222.3-mil
($270.5-mil) on seven companies for operating a "classic" cartel in copper sanitary tubes in a scheme
that affected millions of European homeowners. The European Competition Commission, which
investigates allegations of  price fixing  in the 25-nation EU, said the seven companies had operated a
cartel in plumbing tubes between 1988 and 2001, in a market worth around Eur1.15-bil a year in 2000,
the cartel's last full year.

TD
The EC slapped  fines on the following companies (the charge imposed is shown in parentheses): Societa Metallurgica Italiana SpA, which is 100% owned by Germany's KME (Eur67.08-mil); Finland's Outokumpu (Eur36.14-mil); Germany's Wieland Werke (Eur27.84-mil); Sweden's Boliden (Eur32.6-mil); the UK's IMI (Eur44.98-mil); HME of The Netherlands (Eur4.49-mil) and Halcor of Greece (Eur9.16-mil). Mueller Industries of the US, which the EC said was also part of the  cartel, avoided a fine under the EC's 'Leniency Notice,' which enables a company to escape a  fine if it is the first to reveal the existence of price fixing.

The EC added that it became aware of  price fixing  in January 2001, when it was approached by Mueller. An investigation was launched in March 2001 after the EC's competition watchdog carried out a series of raids on plumbing tube makers. "The  Commission concluded that the main producers of the copper water, heating and gas  tubes that go into houses and buildings operated a  cartel between June
1988 and March 2001 in most of the European Economic Area in a clear breach of EU Treaty and EEA Agreement rules...," the EC said.

It added that the investigation "has shown that the companies operated a well-structured, classic  cartel with code names, meetings in anonymous airport lounges and the clear objective to avoid competition through the allocation of production volumes and market shares, the setting of price targets and increases as well as other commercial terms for plain copper plumbing tubes (and, as far as the KME and the Wieland groups are concerned, plastic-coated copper plumbing tubes)."

Commentators on the copper market had expected that any  fines would be hefty given the size of the market in copper sanitary tubes in Europe, where most homes contain copper plumbing fittings. For some of the companies, it is the second time in a year they have been fined for operating a  cartel in copper tubes. Last December, Outokumpu, Wieland Werke and KME (through its ownership of SMI) were hit with fines totaling Eur79-mil for fixing prices of  tubes used in air conditioning and refrigeration.

All companies involved in that ruling have lodged appeals and not a cent of these  fines has yet been paid. And most of the companies named in last week's ruling said they would appeal.

SMI voiced its intention to appeal the latest  fine and echoed the view of other producers that the amount levied was excessive and did not take into account a study that concluded the impact on the market was insignificant. A sum of $80-mil had been set aside for the  fine in 2003 accounts as a precautionary measure, but this action in no way constituted any admission of guilt, it added.

Outokumpu said it would also seek to overturn the EC's ruling. The Finnish company said certain individuals within the company had infringed the competition law in conducting the ACR and sanitary tube businesses. Outokumpu said Aug 31 that it would sell its fabricated  copper operations in order to

Page 69 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
concentrate on its dominant stainless steel unit. Despite its intention to appeal, Outokumpu said a provision for the  fine issued last week would be entered as an unusual item in its third-quarter results.
Boliden said it would also seek to have the ruling struck down in the European courts. At the beginning
of this year Boliden sold its copper fabrication business unit to Outokumpu but had agreed to indeminify
Outokumpu with regard to the cartel and so would make a special allocation for the  fine in its
third-quarter results.

Germany's Wieland Werke also said it was investigating whether there were grounds for an appeal, as did IMI, though it disposed of its  plumbing business in 2002.

Engineering group IMI yesterday reported a 13.7 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits - but admitted it had made no provision for a £30.5million  fine imposed last week for  price fixing.

The fine was imposed by the European  Commission against several major firms which it said were operating a cartel in copper tubing. IMI says it may appeal against the ruling once it has received full details.

TD
IMI makes pipes,  tubes and fittings for industries including the medical and auto sectors.

Profits rose to £64.1million despite adverse exchange rates which cost it £3million and a £4million increase in raw material prices.
Shares slipped 0.55 per cent or 2p to 360.5p.

The Globe and Mail reports in its Saturday, Sept. 4, edition that the European Union has imposed a
$348-million (U.S.)  fine on Europe's main makers of  copper plumbing pipes for fixing prices and dividing
up the market. A Reuters dispatch to The Globe reports that the EU said the firms -- involving Sweden's
Boliden, Britain's IMI, Finland's Outokumpu and units of Italy's Societa Metallurgica Italiana -- ran a  cartel
in 1988 to 2001 in a market worth about 1.4-billion (U.S.) annually. The EU carried out raids on the
copper tube makers' headquarters as part of its anticartel probe in 2001 after United States firm Mueller
Industries revealed the existence of the group. As a result of its co-operation, Mueller Industries escaped
a fine, the commission said. Boliden stock closed unchanged at $4.76 (Canadian) Friday on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $8 (Canadian) to $4.10 (Canadian).

EC scrutiny: IMI could face another European  Commission fine in 10 months relating to an investigation into a former copper fittings business. On Friday the  commission fined the engineering group pounds 30m for alleged price fixing  in a separate former subsidiary that made  copper tubing. Chief executive Martin Lamb, above, said he was expecting news of the EC's continuing inquiry by the end of June 2005 but admitted he had no idea what it would find: "I wish I could give guidance but I have no idea." Last week's  fine on IMI and other EU rivals was for keeping the price of  copper heating and water pipes artificially high for 10 years. Mr Lamb said IMI will consider whether to appeal when it receives more information about why the  fine was levied. IMI sold both companies under investigation in
2002 but agreed to pay any liabilities arising from the EU inquiry. IMI reported a 14pc jump in pre-tax profits to pounds 64.1m, on sales up 3pc to pounds 807m for the six months to the end of June.

TD
The interim dividend, up 5pc to 6.3p, is payable on October 22 - the first time in three years. IMI's shares fell 2 to 360 1/2 p.

Engineering firm pays penalty for running 12-year long  cartel

ENGINEERING giant IMI could have nearly half of its interim pre-tax profits wiped out by a £30.5 million fine imposed on the firm by European  Commission cartel-busters last week.

TD
The commission fined IMI and seven other European companies a total of £151 million for operating a 12-year long cartel in copper tubes.
IMI released its interim results for the six months to June on Monday.These showed pre-tax profits up
13.7 per cent to £64.1 million on turnover up from £780 million to £801 million.
A company spokesman said: "The European Commission has announced the imposition of a  fine of
£30.5 million on IMI in relation to its former copper tube business, which was sold in 2002.

"We await the details of the decision, following which we will be in a position to make an assessment on a possible appeal.

"Pending receipt of this information the board considers it inappropriate to make a provision in the interim results."

Cartel-busters at the  commission were tipped off about a price-rigging deal in 2001 when US-based
Mueller Industries approached investigators.
Mueller was part of the  cartel but escaped any fine by blowing the whistle on the scam.

The subsequent probe revealed that  cartel members fixed prices during a series of clandestine meetings in airport lounges.

The ring operated under a number of codenames and the companies allocated production volumes and market shares, as they set price targets for  copper plumbing tubes.

Notes taken from the first meeting at Zurich airport said: "The objective is to keep the prices in the high-price-level countries high - if possible to increase them even more."

The fines bring the total of price-rigging penalties imposed by the  commission to more than £3 billion.

Competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "Because of the companies' illegal behaviour, European consumers paid more for plumbing replacement work than if the healthy forces of competition had been at play."

HD      COMPETITION: PRIVATE ANTI-TRUST LITIGATION WILL BOOST EU ECONOMY, SAYS MONTI WC     461 words
PD      18 September 2004
SN      Europe Information
SC      EURREP
VOL    2896

CY      (c) 2004 European Report.

LP
More private enforcement, or litigation, of EU antitrust rules will unleash competition across Europe and help the Union achieve its Lisbon Agenda goals, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on September 17. In a speech to an International Bar Association conference in Fiesole, Italy, Mr Monti said the threat of litigation has a strong deterrent effect, which would spark higher compliance with competition rules.

TD
National courts are better suited to hearing competition cases since they must review all cases. This contrasts with the European  Commission and national competition authorities, which do not have the resources to follow up all infringements, said Mr Monti. He added that private parties were also likely to have a better deal since victims of illegal anticompetitive behaviour would receive compensation for losses and a recovery of legal costs. National courts have the power to declare contractual relationships null. And private litigants could save time by combining an EU antitrust claim with national competition law.

The Commission is tackling two of the obstacles to private litigation described in a recent study, he said. One is the complexity of competition actions which aims to improve the training of judges in EU competition law. The other obstacle is transparency; the  Commission is creating a data base of EU competition-based actions launched in the Member States. "But much more needs to be done", he said. He pointed to Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden which are boosting private enforcement of competition rules.

Mr Monti's term in office ends on October 31 but he said he was confident the new  Commission would devote the necessary efforts to the issue. "I believe an extended system of private enforcement, that does not fall into the excesses that we have seen in other legal systems, would be in the interest of our economy and our consumers", he said.

Mr Monti said public authorities are important for detecting anti-competitive practices such as cartels. Since he entered office in October 1999, the Commission has imposed Euro 4.55 billion in  fines, including a recent  fine imposed on a copper plumbing tubes cartel.
New merger rules.

The new system of pre-filing referral to the  Commission is enjoying a significant success, Mr Monti said. The Commission has received nine requests in four months. Only two were vetoed by the Member States. Most of the requests saw transactions going to the EU competition authority's "one-stop shop". "Businesses appear to recognise the advantage of having their case treated by the  Commission in order to avoid multiple filing requirements and so as to take advantage of coordinated investigative actions as well as, if need be, of coherent remedies", he said.

* Bayer Settles Polyols Investigation

Bayer Corp. says it has reached agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to settle charges related to allegations that Bayer engaged in anti-competitive activities from February 1998 through December 2002 involving adipic-based polyester polyols. Under terms of the agreement, Bayer agreed to plead guilty, and to pay a $33-million  fine. Bayer says it will set up a respective provision in the third quarter of 2004. Bayer says it has cooperated with the DOJ during the investigation.

Cytec Industries says it has agreed pay $7 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that it engaged in fixing carbon fiber prices. "While we deny all charges of wrongdoing, and in fact believe we would have been a victim of any conspiracy among carbon fiber manufacturers, the costs of further defending ourselves far outweighed the cost of settlement," Cytec says. Cytec says it will take a pretax charge of $8 million in the third-quarter to cover the settlement and other "minor litigation matters."
* DuPont Forms FCCL JV with Samsung

DuPont Electronic Technologies says it has agreed to form a joint venture with Cheil Industries (Seoul), a division of Samsung, to manufacture adhesiveless, flexible  copper clad laminate (FCCL) for use in displays, cell phones, and other electronic devices. The 50-50 Jv, SD Rex, will build a manufacturing facility at Cheil's Gumi, Korea site. It will have initial capacity of 100,000 sq. meters/month, and will be expanded as demand warrants, DuPont says. SD Flex will primarily serve the Korean market.
* New HOS Rules Deadline Extended

Congress approved a one-year extension of the trucking industry's new hours of sen/ice (HOS) rules late last week, says the American Trucking Associations (ATA; Washington) (p. 25). "The new rules will stay in effect until September 30,2005, or until the FMCSA comes up with a rulemaking to comply with the court order-whichever comes first," ATA says.
* Stepan to Acquire Brazilian Firm

Stepan says it has agreed to acquire surfactant maker FCC-Comerico E lndustria de Productos de Hygiene e Limpeza, a subsidiary of Unilever Brasil. Terms were not disclosed. The acquisition will enable Stepan to "better serve the growing Brazilian market with local production." FCC has total anionic surfactant capacity of 83,000 m.t./year.
PQ Puts Itself on the Block

PQ Corp. says that it has retained Credit Suisse First Boston (New York) to explore "strategic alternatives," including a possible sale of the company. The process is likely to take "several months," PQ says. PQ, which is privately held, says it has revenues of more than $500 million/year. Descendants of company founder Joseph Elkinton, who started the company in 1831, own a controlling interest in PQ, and current and retired management own a stake. "PQ's . strong performance over the past four years, the current strength of M&A markets, the favorable long-term capital gains tax environment, and geographic expansion" opportunities are reasons the company cites for pursuing a sale. PQ has strong positions in sodium silicates, zeolites, and magnesium derivatives serving the beverage, catalyst, chemical,

construction, detergent, petroleum, pulp and paper, and water treatment markets, analysts say. PQ has a leading 25%30% share of the 1.2-million m.t./year sodium silicate market in the U.S., says SRI Consulting (Menlo Park, CA). PQ also has a silicates presence in Europe, and it has announced plans to build a
40,000-m.t./year sodium silicate plant at Tianjin, China, to start up in first-quarter 2005.
ExxonMobil Chemical Acquires Basell's Stake in CIPEN

ExxonMobil Chemical says it has acquired Basell's 50% share in the Compagnie Industrielle des Polyethylenes de Normandie (CIPEN) plant in Notre Dame de Gravenchon, France, giving it 100% ownership of the facility. The plant produces 420,000 m.t./year of linear-low density polyethylene. Terms were not disclosed. The plant manufactures linear low density polyethylene resins. "Market acceptance of metallocene-based polyethylene resins continues to grow rapidly, and we are committed to extending our global supply capability to meet the growing needs of our customers," says Jim Harris, senior v.p. of ExxonMobil Chemical.
Grace Settles Honeywell Suit

W.R. Grace says it will settle a dispute with Honeywell International over chromium waste at a Grace property in New Jersey that Honeywell once owned. Honeywell will pay Grace $62.5 million and indemnify Grace from any further cleanup obligations. Grace purchased the property in 1981, but discovered it was contaminated by a former chromium manufacturing facility owned by a Honeywell predecessor. Grace
says it sued Honeywell to force a cleanup and won. Honeywell was in the process of appealing that verdict when Grace announced the settlement.
Private Equity Firm Buys Great Lakes' WIL Unit

Behrman Capital (New York) says it has agreed to purchase Great Lakes Chemical's toxicological services business, WIL Research Laboratories (Ashland, OH), for $105 million. "Divesting WIL Research Laboratories supports the company's strategy to focus on our core industrial and consumer businesses," says Great Lakes chairman and CEO Mark Bulriss. WIL provides nonclinical toxicological testing and bioanalytical contract services that provide product safety and toxicological assessment services to the pharmaceutical, chemical, and biotechnology industries. WIL has 390 employees based at its Ashland facility, and it does not anticipate job reductions as a result of the transaction, Berhrman says. After-tax proceeds from the sale are estimated at $100 million, Great Lakes says. Great Lakes says that as a result of the sale it expects to announce a realignment of its reportable segments soon.
Nufarm Buys Stake in South American Agchems Maker

Australian agrichemical company Nufarm (Laverton, Australia) has signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire 49.9% of agricultural chemicals makers Agripec Quimica e Farmaceutica (Fortalezam, Brazil) for $120 million. Privately owned Agripec is expected to post sales of around $200 million in 2004, Nufarm says. Agripec operates a major production facility in Fortaleza, and has an extensive sales network serving all of Brazil's major farming regions. Agripec's sales have grown greatly in recent years, reflecting the substantial rise in agricultural production in Brazil, which now ranks behind the U.S. and Japan as the world's third-largest crop protection market, Nufarm says. Total 2003 sales of crop protection chemicals in Brazil were $3.1 billion, Nufarm says. The proposed acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of November.
Russia Prepares to Sign Kyoto Protocol
Russian president Vladimir Putin, after years of deliberation, has recommended that Russia sign the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change. Putin's decision remains subject to approval by the Duma, Russia's
parliament. The parliament could vote on the Kyoto accord within weeks, sources say. Russia accounts for
17% of the world's global-warming gas emissions, and its approval will raise the combined emissions of all
signatories to the protocol above 55%-enough to bring the protocol into force. The Kyoto Protocol is widely
regarded as the most important environmental treaty. Anthropogenic global-warming gas emissions are
responsible for causing climate change, according to scientific consensus. "This is a decision for which the
world has been waiting for two-anda-half years," says Jennifer Morgan, director/climate change program
at environmental group WWF International (Brussels). The protocol requires that countries reduce their
emissions of global-warming gases, including carbon dioxide, by just over 5% compared with 1990 levels,
by 2008-2012. The U.S. is the only leading industrialized nation that has refused to sign the protocol. It
cites a lack of scientific evidence surrounding global warming, and concerns that joining the protocol would
harm U.S. industry competitiveness.
Europe's Incoming Industry Commissioner Supports Dilution of Reach
Günter Verbeugen, Europe's incoming industry commissioner, says he aims to water down the
commission's proposed Regulation, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (Reach) program.
Page 80 of 82 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Speaking in Brussels last week, Verheugen said that he plans in particular to lighten the burden of Reach on small- and medium-size businesses. "We want to make sure companies do not collapse under the weight of [Reach]," he says. "If it turns out that we have to make adjustments, we will make them." He did not disclose specific changes, but says he will deal with each issue "against the backdrop of the effect it could have on Europe's competitiveness." Verheugen says he will wait until the European Parliament has proposed amendments to the  commission's latest draft of Reach before proposing changes based on new information from sources such as risk assessments. Verheugen's appointment as industry commissioner is effective November 1. He was previously commissioner responsible for the recent expansion of the European Union. Incoming environment commissioner Stavros Dimas will have joint responsibility with Verheugen for  fine-tuning Reach.
Private Equity Firm Buys BASF's Printing Inks; Plans Inks Merger

Private equity capital company CVC Capital Partners says it has acquired two printing ink businesses in Europe and will merge them to create an euro8300 -million/year ($1 billion) business. CVC has purchased BASF Printing Systems (Stuttgart, Germany), the euro600'iTiillion/year printing ink and printing plate business of BASF. The deal includes pigment plants at Huntington, WV and Shanghai, BASF says. CVC has also purchased euro231-million/year printing inks and additives company ANI Printing Inks
(Trelleborg, Sweden) from a management team that bought ANI from Akzo Nobel in 2002. The merged business will be headquartered at Stuttgart.
Akzo Confirms Chlor-Alkali Closure

Eka Chemicals, an Akzo Nobel subsidiary, has confirmed plans to close a mercury-cell chloralkali plant at Bohus, Sweden, with the loss of about 150 jobs (CW, Feb. 4, p. 16).
