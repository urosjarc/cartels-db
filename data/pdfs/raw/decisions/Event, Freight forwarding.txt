Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS) will be among 13 logistics companies  fined Wednesday by European Union antitrust regulators for being part of a  cartel that colluded to fix air freight  forwarding prices, Reuters reported.

Reuters said Deutsche Post’s DHL Global Forwarding was part of the cartel, but also was the whistle blower that reported the  cartel to EU regulators and it therefore will not be fined.

(Adds responses from UPS, Deutsche Post, Panalpina, DSV, Kuehne & Nagel, Expeditors, details) By Foo Yun Chee and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS, March 27 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to  fine 13 logistics firms, including
UPS, Panalpina
and Expeditors, on Wednesday for taking part in a  cartel, two people familiar with the matter said on
Tuesday.

A European Commission document seen by Reuters also confirmed that a decision and  fines would be announced on Wednesday.

Deutsche Post unit DHL Global Forwarding, which took part in the  cartel but alerted the regulator to the collusion, will escape a financial penalty, the people with knowledge of the case told Reuters. The company confirmed this.

The European Commission charged the firms in February 2010 with  fixing  prices in the air freight forwarding business, in breach of EU antitrust rules. The charges followed raids on the companies three years earlier.

"The Commission's decision is expected tomorrow," said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The EU watchdog can  fine companies up to 10 percent of their annual turnover for breaching EU rules.
A separate Commission document obtained by Reuters listed other members of the  cartel as
CEVA/EGL, Deutsche Bahn's
logistics unit Schenker AG, Germany's Hellmann Worldwide Logistics and Japanese firm Kintetsu
World Express .
Other companies named were Switzerland's Kuehne & Nagel , Nippon Express (China), Kuwaiti firm
Agility , UTi, Denmark's DSV Air & Sea SAS and Yusen Shenda Air & Sea Service.

DHL Global Forwarding has said the Commission's case related to different surcharges imposed by the firms.

UPS said the  cartel investigation in Europe started in 2007.

"UPS's practice is to cooperate fully with government investigations and we continue to do so," said spokesman Norman Black.
Panalpina said it would issue a statement when the Commission publicises its decision. Expeditors and
Kuehne & Nagel declined to comment.
DSV's Chief Financial Officer Jens Lund said the company could not comment ahead of the EU
decision but that it did not expect a  fine to impact its financial position.

The Commission said in its charge sheet that the violations took place in  freight  forwarding services from Europe to the United States and China, from Britain to non-European destinations and from Europe to Hong Kong and southern China.
Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have also cracked down on price-fixing  in the sector. Panalpina, Kuehne & Nagel, EGL and Schenker were among six firms  fined by the U.S. Justice
Department in September 2010 and around the same time regulators in New Zealand also penalised
Schenker, Kuehne & Nagel, Panalpina and other firms.

The Commission imposed total  fines of 10.6 billion euros ($14.06 billion) in  cartel cases between 2007 and 2011, with the largest penalty, to the tune of 1.38 billion euros, imposed on a group of car glass makers in 2008.

The European Commission on Wednesday fined 14 firms a total of 169 million euros ($225 million) in four separate cases involving price  fixing  in the air freight  transport sector.

Swiss firm Kuehne und Nagel was hit with the steepest  fine of 53 million euros.  Freight giants Schenker of Britain and US company UPS were also  fined.

TD
Deutsche Post, which participated in the price  fixing  schemes through subsidiaries DHL and Exel, was offered immunity as it was the first company to report the infractions.
The companies were held responsible for aligning pricing along several key routes between 2002 and
2007, the commission said.

In one of the schemes, companies organised secret meetings under the auspices of a gardening club, the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told reporters in Brussels.
The participants used "code names based on names of vegetables", Almunia told reporters in Brussels. "Individual consumers or businesses suffered from this," Almunia said adding that "in times of crisis, it is
all the more important to stamp out the hidden tax that cartels impose on our economy".

Brussels, 27/03/2012 (Agence Europe) - It is possible that on Wednesday 28 March, the  European           Commission will announce a series of fines against participants in a price-fixing  agreement in the
freight  forwarding sector (organisation of freight  transport, customs clearance, warehousing, ground services, etc), detected in 2007. This involves four different infringements to the ruling against cartels and restrictive commercial practices (Article 101 TFEU and Article.23 of the Agreement on the EEA) and the provision of forwarding services on routes from the United Kingdom to non-EU countries outside the EEA, from the EEA to the US, from China to the EEA and from Southern China/Hong Kong to the EEA. In October 2007, the Commission raided the premises of Kuehne + Nagel, Panalpina, Schenker, EGL, which has now become CEVA, Expeditors and UTI, as part of an investigation carried out by the US Justice Department and the Swiss competition committee.

TD
In February 2010, it sent a statement of objections to several of these companies, including DHL Global Forwarding, Kuehne + Nagel and Panalpina. Since then, DHL Global Forwarding has indicated its intention to co-operate with the Commission in exchange for immunity against possible proceedings and
fines, on the condition that the company cooperates with the investigation. The  fines that the Commission is preparing to announce could also possibly target other operators. (FG/transl.fl)

BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - Thirteen logistics firms, including UPS, Panalpina and Expeditors , were fined a total 169 million euros ($225 million) by the  European Commission on Wednesday for cartel activities.

Deutsche Post unit DHL Global Forwarding, which took part in the collusion but alerted the regulator, escaped a financial penalty, confirming a Reuters story on Tuesday.

The European Commission said the companies fixed prices in the air  freight  forwarding business in four cartels between 2002 and 2007, identifying themselves in their secret talks with code names such as "asparagus" and "baby courgettes".

"In times of crisis, it is all the more important to stamp out the hidden tax that cartels impose on our economy. These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade lanes," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result," he said.

The largest  fine was for Switzerland's Kuehne & Nagel , which was charged 53.67 million euros. The company said it may challenge the penalty.

Panalpina received the second-biggest  fine of 46.48 million euros and said it was would analyse the decision before deciding on its next move. The third-biggest penalty of 34.94 million euros was for Deutsche Bahn's logistics unit Schenker AG.
UPS was  fined 9.76 million euros. UPS spokesman Norman Black said the company would review the
EU decision before deciding whether to challenge it.
Expeditors was  fined 4.14 million euros, Nippon Express (China) 812,000 euros, Kuwaiti firm Agility
4.96 million euros, UTi 3.07 million euros and Denmark's DSV Air & Sea SAS 379,000 euros.

CEVA/EGL received a 3.03 million euro penalty and Germany's Hellmann Worldwide Logistics 4.28 million euros.

ZURICH, March 28 (Reuters) - Swiss logistics group Kuehne & Nagel said on Wednesday it is considering appealing against an 53.7 million euro ($71.54 mln)  fine from the EU commission decision for cartel activities, saying the investigation was not carried out correctly.

Kuehne & Nagel Chairman Karl Gernandt said the commission had drawn "incorrect factual and legal conclusions".

"In addition, Kuehne & Nagel's comprehensive cooperation throughout the investigation was not adequately acknowledged. That is why we take into consideration to appeal against the decision before the European courts," Gernandt said in a statement.

Alongside the EU  fine, the company said they had agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay a fine of $9.8 million for proceedings relating to the same activities.

In that period, the company operated under the name of ABX Logistics Air & Sea SAS. DSV said it would seek reimbursement of the financial loss from the previous owners.

United Parcel Service Inc. is among 13 logistics companies  fined a total of $225 million Wednesday by EU antitrust regulators for being part of a  cartel that colluded to fix air  freight  forwarding prices, Reuters reported.

Reuters said Deutsche Post’s DHL Global Forwarding was part of the cartel, but also was the whistle blower that reported the  cartel to EU regulators and it therefore will not be fined. The European           Commission said the group fixed air  freight  forwarding prices between 2002 and 2007.

Others fined include Kuehne & Nagel, which operates a 1.1 million-square-foot Memphis warehouse, Panalpina and Expeditors. UPS' chief rival, Memphis-based FedEx Corp., was not included in the  fines.

European regulators  fined 14 air-shipping companies a combined €169 million ($225 million) for price fixing,  continuing its crackdown on the cargo sector in a move that analysts said could force changes in industry practice.

The European Commission announced the fines Wednesday following a six-year investigation into the freight-forwarding  sector, which combines shipping with storage and customs-processing services.

TD
Switzerland's Kuehne + Nagel International AG and Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG were  fined
€53.7 million and €46.5 million, respectively. Three U.S. companies—United Parcel Service Inc.,
Expeditors International Of Washington Inc. and UTi Worldwide Inc.—were among the companies hit
with smaller fines.
The fines highlighted the close ties between  freight  sector rivals who use each others' services. The levies were, however, much smaller than those imposed by a sweeping investigation of the
air-cargo sector over the past four years in which regulators in Europe, the U.S. and Asia  fined a
group of airlines more than $1.5 billion.

Regulators in Switzerland, Brazil and other countries are continuing a probe of the  freight-forwarding sector.

Analysts said the latest  fines would likely prompt changes in how  freight  forwarders interact. "I think [they] will be very conscious about discussions they have regarding rates" going forward, said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling. However, "there is always going to be collaboration. They've got to talk."

The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said it found evidence of four separate cartels colluding on surcharges between 2002 and 2007 on some of the largest trade routes, particularly between Europe and the U.S. and China. Members used vegetables as code names when talking about  fixing  prices, the commission said.

Panalpina said it was analyzing the decision but said its actions "likely did not affect prices paid" by its customers. The company has settled with regulators in the U.S., New Zealand and Switzerland over alleged price fixing.

Kuehne + Nagel has settled with U.S. antitrust officials, agreeing to pay a $9.8 million  fine but said it was likely to appeal the commission ruling. "The commission has not correctly investigated the facts," Kuehne + Nagel Chairman Karl Gernandt said in a prepared statement.

UPS said it had "concerns" about the commission's decision but didn't elaborate. UTi said it didn't violate competition rules. Both companies said they will consider challenging the commission's decision. Expeditors didn't return calls seeking comment.

Most of the largest  freight  players were fined, though units of Germany's Deutsche Post AG received immunity after employees alerted regulators. The  fines for some companies were reduced in exchange for cooperating with the investigation.

EU antitrust Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said the companies involved were "fully aware" of the illegal activities they were engaged in. "These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade lanes," he said. "Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result."

The European Commission today fined 14 leading freight  companies a total of €169 million for operating four different price-fixing  cartels for international air  freight  services between 2002 and 2007.

The companies are (in alphabetical order) Agility, CEVA (EGL), DSV, Expeditors, Hellmann, Kintetsu, Kuehne + Nagel, Nippon Express, Panalpina, Schenker, Toll, UPS Supply Chain Solutions (previously Menlo Worldwide), UTi and Yusen.

TD
The Commission said that the  freight  forwarders colluded on surcharges and charging mechanisms concerning important trade lanes, in particular the Europe-USA and the China/Hong Kong-Europe lanes. Participants and duration varied in each of the four cartels. In four distinct cartels, the cartelists established and coordinated four different surcharges and charging mechanisms, which are component elements of the final price billed to customers for these services.

In most cases, the  freight  forwarders took specific measures to conceal the  cartel behaviour. In one of the cartels (the "new export system"  cartel), the participants organised their contacts in a so-called "Gardening Club" and code names based on names of vegetables - such as asparagus and baby courgettes - were used when talking about fixing  prices. In another, a specific yahoo email account was set up to facilitate exchanges between the cartel participants (the "currency adjustment factor"  cartel).

The "new export system" (or NES)  cartel followed the UK's introduction of an electronic declaration for exports in 2003.  Freight forwarders agreed on establishing a surcharge on this reporting service and to fix its amount according to the size of the customer, the Commission said. The "advanced manifest system" (AMS  cartel) agreed on a surcharge to provide the US customs with advance information on goods to be shipped to the US.

In the "currency adjustment factor" (CAF) cartel, following the appreciation of the Chinese currency (RMB) against the USD in 2005, international freight  forwarders agreed on a shift of contracts from USD to RMB or, if this was not possible, on the introduction of a CAF surcharge and on its level. The collusion was driven by the fact that in general, the local services at Chinese airports were paid for by forwarders
in RMB, while the customers of forwarders were billed in USD which consequently might have led to losses. In the "peak season surcharge" (PSS)  cartel the freight  forwarders agreed in so called "Breakfast Meetings" held in Hong Kong on the introduction and timing of a PSS, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run up to Christmas (lasting generally from September to December) and on occasions also discussed the level of the surcharge.

Deutsche Post (including its subsidiaries DHL and Exel) received full immunity from  fines under the Commission's 2006 leniency notice for all four cartels, as it was the first to reveal their existence to the Commission. In addition, Deutsche Bahn (including Schenker and BAX), CEVA, Agility and Yusen received reductions of  fines ranging from 5% to 50 %. The reductions reflected the timing of their cooperation and the extent to which the evidence they provided helped the Commission to prove the respective cartels.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, Joaquín Almunia, said: "In times of crisis, it is all the more important to stamp out the hidden tax that cartels impose on our economy. These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade lanes. Many European exporters

and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result. Companies should be aware that crossing the line and colluding on prices comes at a high price, as today's decision illustrates."

In response to the decision, Kuehne + Nagel, which was  fined €53.7 million, said it was considering an appeal. Chairman Karl Gernandt said: “We are of the opinion that the Commission has not correctly investigated the facts and the participation of Kuehne +Nagel and has drawn significantly incorrect factual and legal conclusions. In addition, Kuehne + Nagel’s comprehensive cooperation throughout the investigation was not adequately acknowledged. That is why we take into consideration to appeal against the decision before the European courts."

Panalpina, which was  fined €46.5 million, claimed that the infringements were unlikely to have affected prices paid by its customers and said it was also considering an appeal.

HD          EU Fines 14 Freight Companies  EUR169M Over Price Fixing Cartel

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones) The  European Commission fined 14 air-freight-forwarding  companies, including United Parcel Services Inc. (UPS), Switzerland-based Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG (PWTN.EB) and local rival Kuehne + Nagel International AG, a total of EUR169 million for operating a cartel on several routes.
However, the EU's antitrust unit said it would exempt Deutsche Post AG (DPW.XE) unit DHL Global
Forwarding and Exel from  fines because it informed the regulator about the collusion.

TD
Most big operators were fined over the case. The probe concerned price-fixing  in four separate  cartel infringements, including freight-forwarding  services from the U.K. to outside the European Economic Area; from the EEA to the U.S.; from China to the EEA; and from southern China and Hong Kong to
the EEA.
The Commission launched surprise raids of the companies in October 2007.

Kuehne + Nagel were fined about EUR54 million in total. Panalpina were  fined just under EUR50 million. UPS was fined about EUR10 million.

EU antitrust commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the companies involved were "fully aware" of the illegal activities they were engaged in. "These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade lanes," he said. "Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result."

German logistics and mailing company Deutsche Post AG had always said its DHL Global Forwarding division had immunity from any antitrust  fines that the commission may impose on guilty companies as it was the first one to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the Brussels-based antitrust authority in
2007.

Freight-forwarding consists of organizing the transport of goods including customs clearance, warehousing and ground services. It is traditionally a low-margin, equipment and labor-intensive industry, where friendly rivals have enabled smoother global services.

The cartel investigation launched in 2007 could fundamentally change the way these companies cooperate, industry officials have said.

By Laurence Norman, Doug Cameron and Bob Sechler
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

European regulators  fined 14 air-shipping companies a combined EUR169 million ($224.8 million) for price fixing,  continuing their focus on the cargo sector in a move analysts said could force changes in industry practice.
The European Commission announced the fines Wednesday following a six-year probe into the
freight-forwarding  sector, which combines shipping with storage and customs-processing services.

Switzerland's Kuehne + Nagel International AG (KNIN.VX) and Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG (PWTN.EB) were  fined EUR53.7 million and EUR46.5 million, respectively. Three U.S.
companies--United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), Expeditors International Of Washington Inc. (EXPD) and
UTi Worldwide Inc. (UTIW)--were among those given smaller  fines.

The levies are much smaller than those imposed by a sweeping investigation of the air-cargo sector over the past four years in which regulators in Europe, the U.S. and Asia fined a group of airlines more than $1.5 billion. But they highlight the close ties between rivals in the freight  sector who use each other's services.
Regulators in Switzerland, Brazil and other countries are continuing a coordinated probe of the
freight-forwarding  sector.

Analysts said the latest  fines likely would prompt changes in how  freight  forwarders interact. "I think [they] will be very conscious about discussions they have regarding rates" going forward, said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Kevin Sterling. "[But] there is always going to be collaboration. They've got to talk."

The Commission probe found evidence of four separate cartels colluding on surcharges between 2002 and 2007 on some of the largest trade routes, especially from Europe to the U.S. and between China and Europe.

Panalpina said it was analyzing the Commission decision, though it said the infringements "likely did not affect prices paid" by its customers. The company already has settled with regulators in the U.S., New Zealand and Switzerland over alleged price  fixing.

Kuehne + Nagel also has settled with U.S. antitrust officials, agreeing to pay a $9.8 million  fine, but said it was likely to appeal the Commission ruling.

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal website, WSJ.com.)
"We are of the opinion that the Commission has not correctly investigated the facts," Chairman Karl
Gernandt said.

Most of the largest  freight  players were fined, though units of Germany's Deutsche Post AG (DPW.XE, DPSGY) received immunity after whistleblowers at the companies alerted regulators, while some other firms had fines reduced for cooperating with the probe.
The Commission said cartel members used vegetables as code names when talking about  fixing

HD          EU Fines 14 Freight Companies  EUR169 Million  Over Price Fixing Cartel

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones) The  European Commission fined 14 air-freight-forwarding  companies, including United Parcel Services Inc. (UPS), Switzerland-based Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG (PWTN.EB) and local rival Kuehne + Nagel International AG, a total of EUR169 million for operating a cartel on several routes.
However, the EU's antitrust unit said it would exempt Deutsche Post AG (DPW.XE) unit DHL Global
Forwarding and Exel from  fines because it informed the regulator about the collusion.

TD
Most big operators were fined over the case. The probe concerned price-fixing  in four separate  cartel infringements, including freight-forwarding  services from the U.K. to outside the European Economic Area; from the EEA to the U.S.; from China to the EEA; and from southern China and Hong Kong to
the EEA.
The Commission launched surprise raids of the companies in October 2007.

Kuehne + Nagel were fined about EUR54 million in total. Panalpina were  fined just under EUR50 million. UPS was fined about EUR10 million.

EU antitrust commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the companies involved were "fully aware" of the illegal activities they were engaged in. "These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade lanes," he said. "Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result."

German logistics and mailing company Deutsche Post AG had always said its DHL Global Forwarding division had immunity from any antitrust  fines that the commission may impose on guilty companies
as it was the first one to reveal the existence of the  cartel to the Brussels-based antitrust authority in
2007.

Freight-forwarding consists of organizing the transport of goods including customs clearance, warehousing and ground services. It is traditionally a low-margin, equipment and labor-intensive industry, where friendly rivals have enabled smoother global services.

The cartel investigation launched in 2007 could fundamentally change the way these companies cooperate, industry officials have said.

HD        Freight groups  fined €169m for global  cartel

LP
An unpretentious Italian restaurant on the outskirts of London provided the unlikely backdrop for a multimillion-pound international  freight cartel that attempted to disguise illegal surcharges by using code words such as "fresh marrow" and "asparagus".
Known as the "gardening club" to its members - who included managers from the logistics groups UPS
and DHL - the diners formed one of four distinct cartels  fined €169m by the European Commission.

TD
Between 2002 and 2007, the four cartels, involving 14 companies, illegally set charges on goods sent on important trade lanes between the US, Europe and Asia.

Competition officials broke the  cartel after being approached with incriminating information by Deutsche Post - owner of DHL - which was later awarded immunity from  fines. "The fact that such deliberate organised illegality can still take place today is shocking," said Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner.

"We will continue to fight cartels as our number one priority, because they are the most harmful illegal activity breaching our competition rules." The industry gatherings began as informal get-togethers at the Mamma Mia restaurant, a short walk from DHL's offices in Staines, a plain market town on the outskirts of west London.

But in 2003, soon after the UK introduced electronic declarations for exports, the managers broke the law by conspiring to levy a surcharge for this reporting service. The  freight  forwarding groups were referred to as "greenhouses" while the cartelists worked under codenames: "Velcro", "Head Planter", "Horticulturalist", "Gardener" and "Catweazle", after the bedraggled wizard from a 1970s British TV series.

Pasquale Romano, the restaurateur behind Mamma Mia, said that he "didn't have a clue" about the illegal activities on his premises.

"If they talk business, we don't listen. We concentrate on the food. And the only vegetables here are the ones we cook," he told the Financial Times.

Kuehne & Nagel, the Swiss logistics group, was  fined €53.7m while Panalpina, another Swiss group, must pay €46.5m.

Karl Gernandt, Kuehne & Nagel's chairman, said that he may appeal because the Commission had "not correctly investigated the facts".
UPS also said that it had "concerns" about the judgment.

BRUSSELS, March 28 -- The  European Commission said Wednesday that it has levied  fines worth

the United States.

The companies, which were  fined in violation of the European Union's antitrust law, include affiliate firms of Nippon Express Co. and Kintetsu World Express Inc. in China.

TOKYO, March 29 -- ----------
Keidanren chief welcomes DPJ's accord on sales tax hike bill

TD
TOKYO - Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, on Wednesday welcomed the end to the ruling Democratic Party of Japan's intraparty bickering over a bill for a consumption tax hike.

''I'm relieved,'' Yonekura told reporters. ''Now that intraparty talks have been settled, even opponents (of a tax hike) should unite (with proponents) under the policy,'' added the leader of Japan's most influential business lobby known as Keidanren.
----------
Japan, U.S., EU agree to forge cooperation over rare earths

TOKYO - Japan, the United States and the European Union agreed Wednesday to forge technological cooperation in overcoming the difficulties in procuring rare earth elements due to Chinese export restrictions.

At a meeting in Tokyo held to discuss the recycling of rare earth elements and the development of alternative resources, Japanese industry minister Yukio Edano noted that rare earth minerals are currently indispensable for producing high-tech products.
----------
13 East Asian countries agree to double size of currency swap arrangement

PHNOM PENH - Deputies of finance ministries and central banks of 13 East Asian countries agreed Wednesday to double the size of a regional currency swap arrangement to $240 billion to cope with a potential financial crisis that could hit the region, official sources said.

Meeting in Cambodia's capital, the deputies agreed that each country's contribution to the arrangement, set up under the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization scheme, will be doubled, the sources said.
----------
TEPCO to seek 1 tril. yen public fund injection Thurs.: sources
TOKYO - Tokyo Electric Power Co. will seek an injection of 1 trillion yen in public funds from a
state-backed entity on Thursday to avoid insolvency, as it struggles under the weight of the accident at
its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, sources close to the matter said Wednesday.

But the move is unlikely to be associated with the submission of the company's comprehensive restructuring plan, which is expected to be crafted based on the assumption that the capital injection will take place.
----------
Kyushu Electric eyes curbing outlays by 120 bil. yen

FUKUOKA - Kyushu Electric Power Co. said Wednesday it will reduce about 120 billion yen in investments and expenses in fiscal 2012 from the previous year's projection in the face of expected cost increases for fuel purchases, nuclear safety measures and borrowing.

The regional utility said capital investment will be cut or deferred by 65 billion yen, while outlays for renovation, executive remuneration and other expenses will be trimmed by 55 billion yen.
----------
Toyota to boost production of sport utility vehicle in Canada

The Japanese automaker's announcement that it will invest roughly C$80 million, or about 6.7 billion yen, in its Woodstock plant comes at a time when new vehicle sales hit their highest level in four years in February in the United States.

HD         European Commission fines Expeditors $5.5M for alleged price fixing

The European Commission has fined Expeditors International Inc. of Washington $5.52 million  for allegedly participating in a cartel to control  freight  forwarding prices.

The fine is part of a larger $358 million  European Commission fine against 14 international forwarders that allegedly collaborated in four cartels to control prices.

TD
Seattle-based Expeditors (NASDAQ: EXPD) did not reply to a request for comment late Wednesday.

According to a commission release, Expeditors was one of nine forwarders participating in the "Peak Season Surcharge"  cartel, which allegedly set prices for the shipment of goods from China and Hong Kong to Europe. The peak season name refers to the period, during the fall, when exports rise before the Christmas holidays.

The European Commission release said: "In the 'peak season surcharge' (PSS)  cartel the freight forwarders agreed in so called "Breakfast Meetings" held in Hong Kong on the introduction and timing of a PSS, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run up to Christmas (lasting generally from September to December) and on occasions also discussed the level of the surcharge."

According to a statement from Joaquin Alumnia,  European Commission vice president in charge of competitive policy, the alleged price  fixing  increased costs for European consumers of import goods.

"Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result," he said. "Companies should be aware that crossing the line and colluding on prices comes at a high price, as today’s decision illustrates."

HD     (AE) COMPETITION: Fines €169 million and €86 million for cartels

LP
Brussels, 28/03/2012 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday 28 March, the  European Commission imposed fines totalling €169 million on 14 international groups of companies for participating in four distinct cartels in the air transit sector (see EUROPE 10583). It also imposed a total  fine of €86 million on nine producers of mountings for windows and glass doors.

TD
Freight forwarding. In the first case, the  freight  forwarders colluded on surcharges and charging mechanisms in the use of the British NES (New Export System), and the American AMS (Advanced Manifest System) or taking advantage of the “currency adjustment factor” (CAF) and “peak season surcharges” (PSS). The collusion was principally on the Europe-USA and the China/Hong Kong-Europe routes and duration varied in each of the four cartels. Participants held regular informal meetings, in a
so-called “Gardening Club”, and set prices using a code (the names of vegetables). The main groups involved were Kuehne + Nagel (which was  fined most heavily), Panalpina, Schenker, UPS and Deutsche, through its subsidiaries Exel and DHL. These last two were granted full immunity from  fines as they cooperated with the Commission. Reductions were also granted to: - CEVA (35%) in the NES  cartel, - Agility Logistics Ltd (30%), Schenger and Deutsche Bahn (25%) in the AMS  cartel; - CEVA (50%, Schenker and Deutsche Bahn (20%) and Yusen Shenda Air & Sea Services (5%) in the CAF  cartel; - Schenker (50%) and Agility Logistics (25%) in the PSS  cartel.

Windows. In the second case, the nine companies - Roto, Gretsch-Unitas, Siegenia, Winkhaus, Hautau, Fuhr, Strenger (all of Germany), Maco of Austria and AGB of Italy - held annual meetings between 1999 and 2007 to set prices on this €1 billion market. Roto, which was the first to provide information about the cartel, received full immunity from  fines. The fines on Gretsch-Unitas and Maco were reduced by 45% and 25% respectively in view of their cooperation in the investigation. In all cases, the Commission took into account the situation of the companies.

Energy. As indicated in yesterday's newsletter, the Commission imposed a  fine of €2.5 million on Czech energy companies Energeticky a prumyslovy holding (EPH) and EP Investment Advisors, for obstructing an inspection at their premises by Commission officials as part of an antitrust investigation in 2009.

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2012--
TD
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. ("Expeditors") (NASDAQ:EXPD), the international  freight
forwarding and logistics company, said today that it is the recipient of a EUR4.14 million (approximately
$5.5 million) fine issued by the European Commission ("EC") pursuant to proceedings initiated by the
EC's February 5, 2010 Statement of Objections, which included allegations of anti-competitive behavior.
The EC's decision levied  fines against international  freight  forwarders based on four separate
infringements: New Export System ("NES"), Advanced Manifest System ("AMS"), Currency Adjustment
Factor ("CAF") and Peak Season Surcharge ("PSS"). The EC's allegations against Expeditors were limited
to an alleged unlawful agreement for only PSS, on the South China/Hong Kong to Europe route for the
period of September 21, 2005 to June 23, 2006, which surcharges represented less than $1.5 million in
the aggregate over that time period. According to the EC, PSS  fines were based on:

". . .  freight  forwarders agree[ments] in so called 'Breakfast Meetings' held in Hong Kong on the introduction and timing of a PSS, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run up to Christmas (lasting generally from September to December) and on occasions also discussed the level of the surcharge."(1)

The EC's press release, including details of all  fines issued for the alleged infringements, can be viewed on its website.(1)

Expeditors has vigorously denied having entered into any unlawful agreement with its competitors and aggressively defended its position against these allegations throughout the EC's investigation. As recently as the 16(th) of March, Expeditors further defended its position in a so-called "State of Play" meeting with the EC, which was attended by the Director of the EC's  Cartel Directorate and members of the EC case team.

"We obviously disagree with the EC's decision in this matter; it is particularly disheartening given that we were in discussions with them [the EC] just eight business days ago, where we presented very strong evidence documenting our independent conduct," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe the EC ignored these facts and we have concerns over how the laws were applied, as well as how the fines were calculated. Despite having been issued one of the smaller  fines, it is the
'non-financial' issues more than the financial considerations that concern us most about this ruling. We have stated all along, and strongly reiterate today, that we did not enter into any agreement, in any way, that affected pricing to our customers. The evidence we presented to the EC is very clear as to this matter. It is also somewhat troubling, and a little ironic to us, that the world's largest  freight  forwarder [DHL, the EC's immunity applicant], who allegedly organized, orchestrated and perpetuated these so-called
'Breakfast Club' meetings in Hong Kong, has not been penalized at all for these actions. In our opinion, it's almost as if they've attempted to turn this into a competitive advantage . . . a point we raised in the oral hearing as well," Rose concluded.

Under the EC rules, the company must pay the  fine or provide a bank guarantee even if it makes a decision to appeal the EC's decision, once it receives and analyzes the EC's ruling in its entirety. The company expects to accrue the  fine amount in its first quarter 2012 financial results.

THIRTEEN logistics firms, including UPS, Panalpina and Expeditors , were  fined a total of €169m
(£141.6m) by the  European Commission yesterday for  cartel activities.

The European Commission said the companies fixed prices in the air  freight  forwarding business in four cartels between 2002 and 2007, identifying themselves in their secret talks with code names
such as "asparagus" and "courgettes."

BRUSSELS -- The participants in a  freight cartel were caught not so much red-handed as green-fingered.

Seeking to conceal their price-fixing  activities, employees from  freight  companies like United Parcel Service and Kuehne & Nagel used nicknames like Head Planter, Gardener, Cat Weasel and Horticulturalist, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

TD
They also shared an unusually strong interest in asparagus, ''marrows'' and ''baby courgettes,'' which they discussed in e-mails and during meetings in pubs and restaurants including a traditional Italian establishment near Heathrow Airport.

But rather than sharing tips on gardening, the participants were using the names of vegetables as code words for surcharges on important trade routes between Europe and the United States.

''These participants in these cartels were fully aware of the illegal nature of their activities, and they often took specific measures to try to conceal their behavior,'' said Joaquin Almunia, the European Union competition commissioner. ''Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result.''

The horticultural terminology was used in one of four cartels, known as the Gardening Club. The other cartels, which combined many of the same companies, were also involved in  fixing  prices of various freight  forwarding charges during periods from 2002 to 2007, the commission said.
Mr. Almunia announced total  fines in the case of 169 million euros ($225 million). Kuehne & Nagel, a
Swiss company involved in all four cartels, was  fined 53.7 million euros, the largest amount.

Karl Gernandt, the chairman of Kuehne & Nagel, said his company was considering bringing an appeal because it was ''of the opinion that the commission has not correctly investigated the facts'' and had ''drawn significantly incorrect factual and legal conclusions.''
Panalpina World Transport, also based in Switzerland and involved in three of the cartels, including a
''Breakfast Meetings''  cartel that met in Hong Kong and fixed surcharges on routes between Europe
and China, was fined 46.5 million euros. Panalpina said it might appeal the decision, adding that its
position was ''supported by independent economic evidence, that the infringements likely did not affect
prices paid by Panalpina's customers.''

Deutsche Bahn, and its Schenker and Bax units, and Yusen Air and Sea Service of Japan, were among companies that received reductions in their  fines for cooperating with regulators.
U.P.S., based in the United States and involved in three of the cartels, was  fined 9.8 million euros.

DHL, which was involved in all four cartels, and Exel -- both subsidiaries of Deutsche Post -- were not
fined because they had alerted the antitrust agencies to the cartels.

United Parcel Service Inc. was among 13 logistics companies  fined a total of $225 million Wednesday by European Union antitrust regulators for allegedly being part of a group of cartels that colluded to fix air freight  forwarding prices,  Business First reports.

UPS’s share of the total  fine was about $13 million, according to a news release from the  European        Commission.

TD
The commission said the group fixed air  freight  forwarding prices between 2002 and 2007. UPS (NYSE: UPS) told Reuters the  cartel investigation in Europe started in 2007.
The Atlanta-based package shipping giant has about 50 Central Florida locations.

HD     CARTELS : 169 MN EURO FINE LEVIED ON FREIGHT FORWARDERS WC     473 words

On 28 March, the European Commission fined 14 international groups of companies active in the sector of international air freight  forwarding services a total of €169 million for participating in the period
2002-2007 in four distinct cartels aimed at  fixing  prices and other trading conditions. The  freight forwarders colluded on surcharges and charging mechanisms (which are elements that enter into the final price charged to clients for the services) concerning important trade lanes, in particular the Europe-US
and the China-Hong Kong-Europe routes. Participants and duration varied in each of the four cartels. Kuehne + Nagel Ltd and Kuehne + Nagel International took part in each of the cartels, as did Schenker and DHL, but via different subsidiaries, depending on what was at stake. DHL received full immunity from fines, as it was the first to reveal the  cartel's existence to the Commission.

TD
Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia said: "These cartels affected individuals and companies shipping goods on important trade routes. Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result. Companies should be aware that crossing the line and colluding on prices comes at a high price, as today's decision illustrates".

When the UK decided to introduce an electronic declaration for exports, in 2003,  freight  forwarders agreed on establishing a surcharge on this reporting service: this was the new export system' or NES cartel.

The advanced manifest system' (AMS  cartel) refers to a similar regulatory requirement by the US customs to provide advance information on goods to be shipped to the US. In 2003-2004, in reaction to this similar US regulatory requirement, a group of forwarders agreed to introduce a surcharge for the AMS service, and also agreed not to use the surcharge as a tool for competition.

In the third, currency adjustment factor' (CAF),  cartel, following the appreciation of the Chinese currency (RMB - the local services at Chinese airports were paid for by forwarders in RMB), against the US dollar in 2005, international  freight  forwarders agreed on a shift of contracts from USD to RMB or, if this was not possible, on the introduction of a CAF surcharge and on its level.

Lastly, in the peak season surcharge' (PSS)  cartel the freight  forwarders agreed in so-called breakfast meetings' on the introduction and timing of a PSS, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run-up to Christmas (from September to December), as well as, sometimes, on the amount of the surcharge. The CAF and PSS cartels concerned imports of goods from China-Hong Kong to Europe. The first two cartels concerned exports from Europe to the rest of the world and from Europe to the US.

An unpretentious Italian restaurant on the outskirts of London provided the unlikely backdrop for a multimillion-pound international  freight cartel that attempted to disguise illegal surcharges by using code words such as "fresh marrow" and "asparagus".
Known as the "gardening club" to its members - who included managers from the logistics groups UPS
and DHL - the diners formed one of four distinct cartels  fined €169m by the European Commission.

TD
Between 2002 and 2007, the four cartels, involving 14 companies, illegally set charges on goods sent on important trade lanes between the US, Europe and Asia.

Competition officials broke the  cartel after being approached with incriminating information by Deutsche Post - owner of DHL - which was later awarded immunity from  fines. "The fact that such deliberate organised illegality can still take place today is shocking," said Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner.

"We will continue to fight cartels as our number one priority, because they are the most harmful illegal activity breaching our competition rules." The industry gatherings began as informal get-togethers at the Mamma Mia restaurant, a short walk from DHL's offices in Staines, a plain market town on the outskirts of west London.

But in 2003, soon after the UK introduced electronic declarations for exports, the managers broke the law by conspiring to levy a surcharge for this reporting service. The  freight  forwarding groups were referred to as "greenhouses" while the cartelists worked under codenames: "Velcro", "Head Planter", "Horticulturalist", "Gardener" and "Catweazle", after the bedraggled wizard from a 1970s British TV series.

Pasquale Romano, the restaurateur behind Mamma Mia, said that he "didn't have a clue" about the illegal activities on his premises.

"If they talk business, we don't listen. We concentrate on the food. And the only vegetables here are the ones we cook," he told the Financial Times.

Kuehne & Nagel, the Swiss logistics group, was  fined €53.7m while Panalpina, another Swiss group, must pay €46.5m.

Karl Gernandt, Kuehne & Nagel's chairman, said that he may appeal because the Commission had "not correctly investigated the facts".
UPS also said that it had "concerns" about the judgment.

It was known as the gardening club to its members - the senior managers of global logistics groups who met at Mamma Mia, an unpretentious Italian restaurant in the plain market town of Staines close to Heathrow airport.

But employing code words such as "fresh marrow" and "asparagus", the diners' lunchtime conversation was not about their greens but a cover for a multimillion-pound international  freight cartel that attempted to disguise illegal surcharges.

TD
The club - which included managers from UPS and DHL - formed one of four distinct cartels who were yesterday fined €169m by the European Commission.

Between 2002 and 2007, the four cartels, involving 14 companies, illegally set charges on goods sent on important trade lanes between the US, Europe and Asia.
Competition officials broke the  cartel after being approached with incriminating information by Deutsche
Post - owner of DHL - which was later awarded immunity from  fines.

"The fact that such deliberate organised illegality can still take place today is shocking," said Joaquín Almunia, the European Union's competition commissioner. "We will continue to fight cartels as our number one priority, because they are the most harmful illegal activity breaching our competition rules."

The participants in this  cartel were caught not so much red-handed as green-fingered.

Seeking to conceal their price-fixing  activities, employees from  freight  companies like United Parcel Service and Kuehne + Nagel used nicknames like Head Planter, Gardener, Cat Weasel and Horticulturalist, the  European Commission said Wednesday.

TD
They also shared an unusually strong interest in asparagus, ‘‘marrows’’ and ‘‘baby courgettes,’’ which they discussed in e-mails and during meetings in pubs and restaurants including a traditional Italian establishment near London Heathrow Airport.

But rather than sharing tips on gardening, the participants were using the names of vegetables as code words for surcharges on important trade routes between Europe and the United States.

‘‘These participants in these cartels were fully aware of the illegal nature of their activities, and they often took specific measures to try to conceal their behavior,’’ said the E.U. competition commissioner,
Joaquín Almunia.‘‘Many European exporters and consumers of imported goods may have been harmed as a result.’’

The horticultural terminology was used in one of four cartels, known as the Gardening Club. The other cartels, which combined many of the same companies, were also involved in  fixing  prices of various freight  forwarding charges during various periods from 2002 to 2007, the commission said.
Mr. Almunia announced total  fines in the case of €169 million, or $225 million, on Wednesday. Kuehne
+ Nagel, a Swiss company involved in all four cartels, was  fined €53.7 million, the largest amount.

Karl Gernandt, the chairman of Kuehne + Nagel, said his company was considering bringing an appeal because it was ‘‘of the opinion that the commission has not correctly investigated the facts’’ and had
‘‘drawn significantly incorrect factual and legal conclusions.’’
Panalpina World Transport, also based in Switzerland and involved in three of the cartels, including a
‘‘Breakfast Meetings’’  cartel that met in Hong Kong and fixed surcharges on routes between Europe and
China, was fined €46.5 million. Panalpina said it might appeal the decision, adding that its position was
‘‘supported by independent economic evidence, that the infringements likely did not affect prices paid by
Panalpina’s customers.’’

Deutsche Bahn, and its Schenker and Bax units, and Yusen Air & Sea Service of Japan, were among companies that received reductions in their  fines for cooperating with regulators.
U.P.S., based in the United States and involved in three of the cartels, was  fined €9.8 million.
DHL, which was involved in all four cartels, and Exel — both subsidiaries of Deutsche Post — were not
fined because they alerted the antitrust agencies to the cartels.

GENERAL MOTORS
Opel Persists With Union

TD
On Turnaround in Europe

General Motors Co.'s European Adam Opel AG unit said on Wednesday it will continue talks with labor unions to turn the struggling business around, but it didn't elaborate on any proposals or a possible time frame.

Both sides "agree that Opel needs to operate profitably and take measures to increase revenue, improve margins and reduce costs," Opel said in a statement following a meeting of its supervisory board.

Opel said it aims to "work out an optimal strategy" together with its labor unions to improve the company's financial situation. Labor representatives hold half the seats on the company's supervisory board.

GM's European operations have incurred steep losses over the past decade as restructuring programs failed to bring in anticipated results.

EU Fines Cargo Companies
$225 Million Over Pricing

European regulators  fined 14 air-shipping companies a combined 169 million euros ($225 million) for price fixing,  continuing to focus on the cargo sector in a move that analysts said could force changes in industry practice.

The European Commission announced the fines Wednesday following a six-year investigation into the freight-forwarding  secto.
Switzerland's Kuehne + Nagel International AG and Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG were  fined
53.7 million euros and 46.5 million euros, respectively.

Panalpina said it was analyzing the decision but said its actions "likely did not affect prices paid" by its customers. The company has settled with regulators in the U.S., New Zealand and Switzerland over alleged price fixing.  Kuehne + Nagel has settled with U.S. antitrust officials, agreeing to pay a $9.8 million fine but said it was likely to appeal the commission ruling.

European Union Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the companies involved were "fully aware" of the illegal activities they were engaged in.

More Charges Filed
In Accounting Scandal

Japanese securities regulators ended their probe of Olympus Corp., bringing the inquiry into one of the country's biggest corporate scandals closer to completion. Investigations by police and prosecutors continue, however.

The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission said Wednesday it recommended that prosecutors file additional charges against Olympus and four individuals for their alleged involvement in keeping around $1.5 billion in investment losses off the camera maker's books. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office said it filed those charges against the company and former Chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, former Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori, former company auditor Hideo Yamada and outside investment adviser Akio Nakagawa. The four individuals couldn't be reached for comment.
Olympus was charged with falsifying financial statements.

Olympus, which has admitted hiding investment losses, said that it takes the additional charge seriously and would continue efforts to strengthen its corporate governance.

WIRELESS INDUSTRY EU Reaches a Deal
On Mobile-Roaming Prices

European institutions have reached a deal to impose new limits on consumer prices for mobile roaming, including a new price cap for data roaming, which will progressively bring prices down and eventually allow users to switch operators for calling abroad, the  European Commission said.

The European Parliament is expected to approve the agreement in May and the council in June, paving the way for the new rules to enter into force July 1, the commission said.

For customers using their mobile phone in another European Union country, the cost of a one-minute call wouldn't exceed 29 European cents (39 U.S. cents) as of July 1, and 19 cents as of July 2014, down from 35 cents under the current legislation. An SMS, or text message, would cost no more than nine cents as of July 1 and six cents as of July 1, 2014, down from 11 cents.

HD        Expeditors denies European freight  price-fixing cartel charge

Expeditors International of Washington Inc. has denied participating in a price-fixing cartel, in response to a $5.5 million  fine imposed by the European Commission on Wednesday.

"Expeditors has vigorously denied having entered into any unlawful agreement with its competitors and aggressively defended its position against these allegations throughout the EC’s investigation," said an Expeditors press release issued Thursday.

TD
The Puget Sound Business Journal  reported Wednesday that the  European Commission fined
Expeditors for allegedly participating in a  cartel to control  freight  forwarding prices.

The Expeditors release suggests that Expeditors will pay the  fine as part of the appeals process. Expeditors officials were not available to comment.
Expeditor’s stock (NASDAQ: EXPD) dropped rapidly on the news of the charge, from a high of above
$47 Wednesday to a low of $45.52 late in the trading day Thursday.

The company was co-founded in 1979 by CEO Peter Rose and has expanded to be one of the world’s largest global logistics companies, with $6.1 billion in 2011 revenues and 13,000 employees at 249 locations worldwide.

In the press release, Rose said Expeditors has been fighting this accusation by the EC for some time: "We have stated all along, and strongly reiterate today, that we did not enter into any agreement, in any way, that affected pricing to our customers. The evidence we presented to the EC is very clear as to this matter," he said.

In its own release, the  European Commission said 14 forwarders engaged in four different cartels, with Expeditors allegedly part of the "Peak Season Surcharge"  cartel, which allegedly set prices on exports from China and Hong Kong to Europe during the Christmas season.

HD               Expeditors’ Rose Denies Price-Fixing Allegations

Expeditors International of Washington "vigorously denied" price-setting allegations that resulted in a $5.5 million fine from the European Commission.

"We obviously disagree with the EC's decision in this matter," Peter J. Rose, chairman and CEO of the Seattle-based company , said in a statement Thursday.

TD
The $1.9 billion international freight  forwarder is one of 13 logistics companies the EC  fined a total of $225 million for allegedly fixing  international air cargo rates.
The EC said the logistics companies operated four cartels on major routes between Europe and the
U.S., China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2007.
Among the other companies  fined are Kuehne + Nagel, hit with a $71.5 million  fine, Panalpina,
fined $61.4 million and UPS, which was  fined $13 million.

Deutsche Post's DHL Forwarding unit participated in the cartels but wasn't  fined because it alerted regulators of their activities, according to the EC.
The EC charged Expeditors with conspiring to fix a peak season surcharge on the South
China-Hong Kong to Europe route from September 2005 to June 2006.

In the statement, Rose insisted Expeditors International played no part in any price-fixing cartel but did not say whether the company would appeal the ruling.

"We have stated all along, and strongly reiterate today, that we did not enter into any agreement, in any way, that affected pricing to our customers," he said.

"Despite having been issued one of the smaller  fines, it is the 'non-financial' issues more than the financial considerations that concern us most about this ruling."

Rose said Expeditors International met with EC regulators as recently as March 16, when it argued its position before EC investigators and officials.

"We presented very strong evidence documenting our independent conduct," said Rose. "The evidence we presented to the EC is very clear as to this matter.

"We believe the EC ignored these facts and we have concerns over how the laws were applied, as well as how the fines were calculated," Rose said.

HD        European Commission Imposes € 169 Million  On 14 International Groups Of Freight Forwarders
For Operating  Four Price Fixing Cartels

On 28 March 2012, the  European Commission announced that it had  fined 14 international groups of companies a total of € 169 million for participating in four distinct cartels. According to the press release published by the Commission, the aim of the participants in the cartel was to fix prices and other trading conditions for international air  freight  forwarding services. The freight  forwarders colluded on surcharges and charging mechanisms concerning important trade routes, in particular the Europe-USA and the China/Hong Kong-Europe routes.

Freight forwarders offer door-to-door air  freight  forwarding services to businesses and consumers. The Commission found that, from 2002 until 2007 and in four distinct cartels, the cartelists established and coordinated four different surcharges and charging mechanisms, which are component elements of the final price billed to customers for these services. The participants and duration varied in each of the four cartels.

TD
The first  cartel, referred to by the Commission as the "new export system  cartel", was established when the UK decided to introduce an electronic declaration for exports in 2003. Within this framework, the cartelists agreed on establishing a surcharge on this reporting service and to fix its amount to the size of the customer.

The "advanced manifest system  cartel" concerned a regulatory requirement established by the US customs authorities to provide advance information on goods to be shipped to the US. In 2003-2004, a number of freight  forwarders agreed to introduce a surcharge for this service (i.e., for processing the electronic transmission of such information to the US customs authorities).

As the Commission explains, the "new export system  cartel" and the "advanced manifest system  cartel" related to exports respectively from Europe to the rest of the world and from Europe to the US.

In the third  cartel, the so-called "currency adjustment factor  cartel", following the appreciation of the Chinese currency (RMB) against the US Dollar in 2005, international  freight  forwarders agreed on a shift of contracts from USD to RMB or, if this was not possible, on the introduction of a currency adjustment factor surcharge and its level. According to the Commission, the collusion was driven by the fact that in general, the local services at Chinese airports were paid for by  freight  forwarders in RMB, while their customers were billed in USD, which consequently might have led to losses.

In the "peak season surcharge  cartel", the cartelists agreed in so-called "Breakfast Meetings" held in Hong Kong on the introduction and timing of a peak season surcharge, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run up to Christmas and on occasions also discussed the level of the surcharge.
These two cartels concerned imports of goods from China/Hong Kong to Europe.

According to the findings of the Commission, in most cases, the cartelists took specific measures to conceal the cartel behaviour. For instance, in the "new export system  cartel", the participants organised their contacts in a so-called "Gardening Club" and code names based on names of vegetables were
used when talking about  fixing  prices. On the other hand, in the "currency adjustment  cartel", a specific
Yahoo email account was set up to facilitate exchanges between the cartelists.

The Commission set the  fines on the basis of the 2006 Fining Guidelines. Deutsche Post (including its subsidiaries DHL and Exel) received full immunity from  fines as it was the first undertaking to reveal the existence of these cartels in Europe to the Commission.

HD      Expeditors Gets a EUR4.14 Million  Fine in European Commission Freight Forwarding Case

Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., an international  freight  forwarding and logistics company, said that it is the recipient of a EUR4.14 million (approximately $5.5 million)  fine issued by the European Commission ("EC") pursuant to proceedings initiated by the EC's February 5, 2010 Statement of Objections, which included allegations of anti-competitive behavior.

According to a release, the EC's decision levied  fines against international  freight  forwarders based on four separate infringements: New Export System ("NES"), Advanced Manifest System ("AMS"), Currency Adjustment Factor ("CAF") and Peak Season Surcharge ("PSS"). The EC's allegations against Expeditors were limited to an alleged unlawful agreement for only PSS, on the South China/Hong Kong to Europe route for the period of September 21, 2005 to June 23, 2006, which surcharges represented less than
$1.5 million in the aggregate over that time period. According to the EC, PSS  fines were based on:

TD
". . .  freight  forwarders agree[ments] in so called 'Breakfast Meetings' held in Hong Kong on the introduction and timing of a PSS, to be charged during the peak season transport period in the run up to Christmas (lasting generally from September to December) and on occasions also discussed the level of the surcharge."1

Expeditors has vigorously denied having entered into any unlawful agreement with its competitors and aggressively defended its position against these allegations throughout the EC's investigation. As recently as the 16th of March, Expeditors further defended its position in a so-called "State of Play" meeting with the EC, which was attended by the Director of the EC's  Cartel Directorate and members of the EC case team.

"We obviously disagree with the EC's decision in this matter; it is particularly disheartening given that we were in discussions with them [the EC] just eight business days ago, where we presented very strong evidence documenting our independent conduct," said Peter J. Rose, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe the EC ignored these facts and we have concerns over how the laws were applied, as well as how the  fines were calculated. Despite having been issued one of the smaller  fines, it is the
'non-financial' issues more than the financial considerations that concern us most about this ruling. We have stated all along, and strongly reiterate today, that we did not enter into any agreement, in any way, that affected pricing to our customers. The evidence we presented to the EC is very clear as to this matter. It is also somewhat troubling, and a little ironic to us, that the world's largest  freight  forwarder [DHL, the EC's immunity applicant], who allegedly organized, orchestrated and perpetuated these
so-called 'Breakfast Club' meetings in Hong Kong, has not been penalized at all for these actions. In our opinion, it's almost as if they've attempted to turn this into a competitive advantage . . . a point we raised in the oral hearing as well," Rose concluded.

HD       Illegal mining  ban hits iron ore exports
BY       OUR BUREAU

All iron-ore exporting ports took a big hit in 2011-12 due to various reasons, the most important being the restriction on illegal mining in major ore-producing States. The flow of the mineral from the mines to the ports has reduced to a thin trickle. The Mormugao port, the country's largest ore-exporting port, suffered an estimated 22 per cent decline in throughput as supplies from mines located in Goa and Karnataka dropped sharply. Iron ore accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the port's total traffic. In 2011-12, the port handled a total of 39 million tonnes (mt) of traffic including 29.37 mt of iron-ore exports. The corresponding figures for 2010-11 were 50.02 mt and 40.63 mt respectively.

TD
More than the ban, what is reportedly causing concern is the lack of accountability on the part of some of the non-major ports in the neighbourhood with regard to handling of illegally mined ore even as the Mormuga port authorities go strictly by the no-objection certificates (NOC) issued by the State Government prior to allowing exports of the ore from the port. What is more, the Mormugao port authorities insist on the inclusion of the name of the shipper in the NOC as an additional safeguard. The State Government is yet to respond to it.

European freight  cartels fined €169 million Freight groups forming cartels have been  fined €169 million by the European Commission, says a recent report in the Financial Times. “We will continue to fight cartels as our number one priority, because they are most harmful activity breaching our competition rules,” the Competition Commissioner of European Union has been quoted as saying in the report. According to the report, between 2002 and 2007, four cartels involving 14 companies illegally set
charges on goods sent on important trade routes between the US, Europe and Asia. Kuehne & Nagel, the Swiss logistics group, has been  fined €53.7 million while Panalpina , another Swiss Group, €46. 5 million. The competition officials broke the  cartel after being approached with incriminating information by Deutsche Post, the owner of DHL, which has been awarded immunity from  fines. Interestingly, the venue of the meeting of the  cartel members was an unpretentious Italian restaurant on the outskirts of London. As expected, the owner of the restaurant was totally clueless about the illegal activities on his premises. “If they talk business, we don't listen; we concentrate on food.” Some members of the  cartel have expressed reservation saying the Commission had “not correctly investigated the facts.”

Putin's port project to divert Urals crude oil to Baltic A Baltic Sea oil terminal opened in March by the President-Elect, Mr Vladimir Putin, to boost Russia's direct access to international markets may weaken the country's crude oil price in northern Europe compared with the south. Urals crude oil in northwest Europe was $1.13 a barrel less than in the Mediterranean on Thursday after the start of operations at the Ust-Luga terminal, the most since July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
20-cent premium at the start of March and an average discount of 6 cents in the past year. Russia wants to elevate the role of Urals, which has high-sulphur qualities similar to West Asian crudes, as an international benchmark. Building the new export terminal on its own territory may help the country allay concern that Urals supply is vulnerable to disruption because of political disputes with transit countries such as Belarus and Ukraine and the tanker chokepoint of the Bosporus straits near Istanbul.

HD        Panalpina chief says 'cartel'  label outdated

The head of one of the world's leading  freight  groups by sales has admitted that the sector has earned its reputation for anticompetitive behaviour, but argued that the image is outdated.

Monika Ribar, chief executive of Basel-based Panalpina, acknowledged her company and its peers had a record of cartels and other anticompetitive practices. The comments came on the heels of a €169m European Commission fine against Panalpina and others for operating an international  cartel based on meetings at an unpretentious Italian restaurant near London.

TD
Panalpina has been told to pay €46.5m, while Kuehne & Nagel, also based in Switzerland, was  fined
€53.7m for participating in a  cartel that used code words like "fresh marrow" and "asparagus" to
disguise illegal surcharges.

"It is true our industry has gained a poor record, based on problems in the past," Mrs Ribar acknowledged in an interview at the group's headquarters. "But companies have learned to deal much more seriously with the situation in recent years."

Mrs Ribar, one of very few female executives in the industry, argued change had been triggered by much tougher laws in Europe and the US, and a greater emphasis on ethics among  freight  companies.

She argued that the latest EU  fines reflected past problems that had taken years to investigate fully. "The EU Commission has taken five years to get somewhere. The whole story happened between
2000 and 2005. Our company has changed dramatically in the meantime."

Panalpina, which ranks itself fourth behind DHL, Kuehne & Nagel and Schenker, has had various brushes with regulators. In addition to the latest European crackdown, the group has previously paid almost $82m in a deferred prosecution agreement under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after probes into its Nigerian activities prompted it to pull out of the country.

Panalpina has also lost business from government departments and big companies whose policies forbid them from trading with partners sanctioned for anticompetitive or corrupt practices.

"Now as a chief executive in  freight  you deal more and more with lawyers than with your core business", said Mrs Ribar.

She singled out much tougher enforcement of laws, such as the FCPA, for forcing  freight  companies to become more sensitive to previous practices such as bribing officials to accelerate customs clearance.

Among changes instituted by Mrs Ribar has been elevating compliance, with the appointment of a chief compliance officer reporting directly to the CEO, creating much bigger local compliance teams and increasing focus on corporate ethics.

"Companies have learned to deal much more sensibly with the situation," Mrs Ribar said. "At Panalpina, we haven't left a single stone unturned in re-examining the way we do business."

* Kuehne & Nagel shares slump after sharp Q1 profit drop

* Kuehne eyes price hikes to counter higher  freight  rates
* Company freezes hiring through year-end, CFO tells Reuters
(Adds details from statement) By Katharina Bart
ZURICH, April 16 (Reuters) - Kuehne & Nagel said it would step up the pace of cost-cutting after a drop in first-quarter profits on higher spending from growth initiatives, lower margins and a  fine from the European Commission.

Shares in the  freight  forwarder slid after the company reported a slump in net profit to 68 million Swiss francs ($73.98 million) from 155 million francs in the year-ago period, hit by a 65 million franc fine levied by the European Commission last month for  cartel activities.

"We are confident that the measures implemented as well as solid growth will contribute to an improvement of results in the second half of the year," chief executive Reinhard Lange said in a statement.

Kuehne's stock opened sharply lower on the unexpectedly sharp drop in profits. At 0741 GMT, the stock traded 5.2 percent lower at CHF112.90, bucking a 0.4 percent rise in the European industrial goods and services index.

Bank Vontobel said Kuehne's poor results confirmed its cautious stance on the stock, which it rates at hold.

"The benefits of Kuehne & Nagel's growth strategy continue to reflect in high volume growth but at a cost which depresses margins," Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth said. His target price is 125 Swiss francs.

Kuehne's profits and margins are suffering because the company cannot pass on higher  freight  rates it must pay for capacity quickly enough to clients by hiking prices.

Kuehne's revenue rose to 4.83 billion francs from 4.82 billion francs on seafreight volume growth of 9 percent in the quarter. The company's airfreight volume grew by 4 percent in the quarter.

Specific cost-cutting measures include a freeze on hiring new employees through this year at least, which is expected to reduce total staff rates, financial chief Gerard van Kesteren told Reuters on Monday.
Rival Panalpina reports on May 4.

HD      Commission Smash Window Cartel And 'Freighten' Others

Background

In two recent decisions, the  European Commission ("the Commission") imposed substantial  fines on those operating cartels in breach of EU anti-competition rules.

TD
In the first case, nine companies were  fined a total of €85.876 million for operating an EU wide  cartel in the market for window mountings. Essentially, the  cartel fixed the prices of window mountings by agreeing on common price increases, which would apply to such products. When setting the  fine, the Commission took into account the duration of the  cartel, which lasted from November 1999 until July
2007. The Commission also took into consideration the size of the window mounting market (which is currently estimated at €1 billion) and the high combined market share of the  cartel members (estimated at 80% share for the "turn and tilt" mounting).

In this instance, the  cartel was very well established. A regular pattern of meetings ran every third week in November named the "Permanent Conference". Before the official meeting, participants would meet to agree a set price increase for the following year and surcharges for raw material costs. The parties would also meet throughout the year to discuss how they had implemented the agreed price increase and ensure the success of the  cartel.

One of the companies received full immunity from the  fines under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice by coming forward first to provide information about the  cartel. Fines for two other companies were reduced by 45% and 25% respectively to reflect their co-operation with the Commission's investigation.

Freight Forwarding Cartel

The Commission took a similar firm stance in the second case, which concerned 14 companies who participated in four distinct price fixing  cartels for international  freight  forwarding services. During the period 2002 until 2007 the freight  forwarders colluded on surcharges and charging mechanisms that concerned important trade routes, in particular, the Europe to USA and China/Hong Kong to Europe routes. For each  cartel, participants and duration varied.

The freight  forwarders went to great lengths to conceal their  cartel activities. In one  cartel, the parties organised their meetings under the pretence of a "Gardening Club" where vegetables were used as code names. For example, asparagus and courgettes were code for  fixing  prices.

The Commission fined the participants a total of €169 million for their collusive activities. Akin to the decision discussed above, one of the companies received full immunity from  fines for all four cartels, being the first to come forward to the Commission with information. Other companies received reductions of 5% to 50% reflecting the timing of their co-operation and the extent of evidence given.
Comment

These decisions serve as an important reminder that agreeing prices or any aspect of pricing with your competitors is a serious breach of the competition rules, which can result in very severe penalties.

If you are involved in a  cartel, act fast as you may be able to seek immunity or a substantial reduction from any imposed fine in return for your co-operation. Time really does cost money in this instance.
