BRUSSELS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to  fineJohnson & Johnson and Novartis next month as part of a crackdown against deals delaying the sale of cheaper generic medicines, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

The sanction, the second against so-called pay-for-delay deals after  fines against Lundbeck and eight others in June, underlines the  European Commission's determination to challenge a practice common in the pharmaceutical industry.

TD
In pay-for-delay agreements, brand-name firms pay generic companies not to market rival versions of their medicine which usually cost a fraction of the original drug, though the issue is complicated by patent ownership.

Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have in recent years criticised the practice for inflating consumers' bills and pushing up public healthcare costs.
"The European Commission is likely to issue a decision next month," one of the people said.

In its charge sheet sent to the companies in January, the European Union competition watchdog said the pay-for-delay deal against the generic versions of  fentanyl  hurt Dutch consumers and healthcare providers.

Commission spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, and Novartis declined to comment. Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment.

Novartis shares fell by 1.7 percent after the Reuters report and closed 0.2 percent down at 72.20 versus a flat European healthcare sector.

The Commission has two other pay-for-delay cases in the pipeline involving Israel's Teva and its subsidiary Cephalon, and French drugmaker Servier.

European Union regulators Tuesday  fined U.S. pharmaceutical and health-care company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Switzerland's Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) a combined 16 million euros ($21.98 million) for their collusion in delaying the market entry of a generic painkiller in The Netherlands.

The European Commission said J&J would be fined EUR10.8 million and Novartis EUR5.5 million after their respective Dutch subsidiaries made a pact in 2005 to not distribute a cheaper generic version of the painkiller  fentanyl  in the Netherlands.  Fentanyl is used for cancer patients and is a pain-killer
100 times more potent than morphine, the commission said.

TD
"The two companies shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said in a statement. "Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging in such anticompetitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers."
Regulators said that Sandoz, Novartis' Dutch subsidiary, had been poised to start distributing its generic
fentanyl  supplies but then signed a so-called "co-promotion agreement" with Janssen-Cilag, J&J's
Dutch arm, which gave it "strong incentives" to withhold the drugs from the market.

According to the commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, the agreed monthly payments exceeded the profits that Sandoz expected to obtain from selling its generic product. That deal ended in December 2006 when a third party was about to launch a generic  fentanyl  patch.

The commission also quoted internal documents showing that Sandoz agreed to abstain from entering the Dutch market in exchange for "a part of [the] cake."

Regulators said they had taken into account the duration of the infringement and its gravity when it set the fines.

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union is fining pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Johnson & Johnson a total of 16 million euros (22 million dollars) for delaying the launch of a generic painkiller in the Netherlands, the bloc's executive announced Tuesday.

The drug in question is a cheaper version of  Fentanyl, a painkiller that is 100 times more potent than morphine and is notably used by cancer patients, according to the  European Commission.

TD
"The two companies shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

US-based Johnson and Johnson is being  fined almost 10.8 million euros, with the remainder of the penalty going to Swiss firm Novartis.
In January the commission began investigating a 2005 deal signed between a subsidiary of J&J selling
the painkiller Fentanyl in the Netherlands and rival generic manufacturer Sandoz, a subsidiary of Novartis.

Under the agreement, which ended in December 2006, Sandoz received money for every month that it did not launch a Dutch generic alternative to  Fentanyl, according to the commission.

The EU's competition watchdog cited internal documents on Tuesday according to which Sandoz said it would abstain from entering the Dutch market in exchange for "a part of [the] cake."

Instead of competing, the pharmaceuticals agreed on cooperation so as "not to have a ... generic on the market and in that way to keep the high current price," the commission added in a statement, citing the internal documents.

"Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anti-competitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers," Almunia said.

The commission launched similar probes last year, as part of a sector-wide investigation, alleging that a generic antidepressant medicine and a cardio-vascular drug were both withheld from the market under so-called "pay for delay" agreements.

The pharmaceuticals industry seems to have learned the lesson the  European Commission has been repeating to it since 2009 on potentially anti-competitive patent practices. The executive welcomes this development in its fourth monitoring report on patent settlements in 2012, published on 9 December.

"This report shows that companies are increasingly aware of the competition concerns that some settlements may raise," commented Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "It also demonstrates that the Commission's action has not prevented companies from settling patent disputes in line with
anti-trust rules."

TD
The report points out that the total number of patent settlements increased from earlier years. There were
183 patent settlements concluded between originator and generic companies in 2012, compared with 120
in 2011 (see Europolitics 4237). This increase results partly from the introduction of new legal provisions
in Portugal, but has been steady for the last five years. In most cases, the companies manage to settle
their disputes within the boundaries of EU anti-trust rules, the Commission notes.
PROBLEMATIC SETTLEMENTS

The document highlights the steady decrease in patent settlements considered problematic in the light of anti-trust rules. For the Commission, this development attests to the industry's growing awareness of problematic practices.
In its first report, in 2009, the executive particularly singled out patent clusters, a practice consisting of
filing a large number of patent applications on pseudo-new indications for a medicine, generally staggered
over time, thus complicating things for generic firms, which have to study each patent before putting their
product on the market. Another tactic is to place second-generation products on the market, substitutes
for but not very different from earlier medicines whose patents have expired. The aim is to keep patients
loyal to the particular drug before a generic hits the market, preventing it from making inroads (see Insight
on Big Pharma in Europolitics 4553). The EU Court of Justice condemned this practice in the case of
AstraZeneca, which took its blockbuster Losec off the market before its patent expired to facilitate the
transition to the second-generation product and also made misleading declarations to patent bodies (4544
and 4553).

Other practices are based on litigation. The first involves legal actions for counterfeiting by originator firms against generic firms, a procedure they then drop in return for an out-of-court settlement with the generic company - matched with financial compensation - to postpone the entry of a copy of their product (known as the pay for delay' practice). The Commission opened an in-depth investigation into practices of this
type between several generic firms and Servier aimed at delaying the market entry of a generic version of
Perindopril, a cardiovascular medicine (3892). It sent them a statement of objections in 2012.

The Commision also informed, last January, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis of its objections to an agreement between their Dutch subsidiaries (4291) concerning  Fentanyl, a powerful painkiller.

Since 2011, the executive has had its eye on agreement between Cephalon and Teva aimed at hindering the delay of a generic version of Modafinil, used to treat sleep problems. Last June, it  fined Lundbeck of Denmark €93.8 million and several generic manufecturers a total of €52.2 million for having delayed the placing on the market of generic versions of Citalopram, its flagship anti-depressant (4669).

AMSTERDAM (AP) - The  European Commission has fined pharmaceuticals giants Johnson & Johnson and Novartis a combined $22 million for colluding to delay the entrance of a cheap generic form of a pain killer to the Dutch market.

In a statement, the Commission's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said the two companies "shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine."

TD
The Commission found that after Johnson & Johnson's patent on a patch containing the drug  Fentanyl expired in 2005, it paid Novartis to delay launching a generic version. The delay lasted 17 months, and was more profitable for both companies than competing honestly would have been.
J&J's fine was 10.7 million euros ($14.7 million), and Novartis' was 5.5 million euros.

European Union regulators  fined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novartis 16.3 million euros (dollar
22 million) for blocking the sale of a cheaper generic painkiller and warned others against such
anti-competitive deals.

This is the second penalty by the  European Commission against so-called pay-for-delay deals where brand-name companies pay generic rivals not to sell their versions of a drug at a fraction of the original price.

TD
The practice, common in the pharmaceutical industry, has caught the attention of regulators around the world because it raises consumers' bills and public healthcare costs.

The EU competition watchdog said on Tuesday that the deal between Johnson & Johnson and Novartis meant cancer patients did not have access to the cheaper generic version of fentanyl  for 17 months starting from July 2005. Johnson & Johnson and its Dutch unit, Janssen-Cilag, were fined 10.8 million euros while Novartis and its Dutch subsidiary, Sandoz, were  fined 5.5 million euros. Sources told Reuters last month that the  fines were planned. "Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anti-competitive practices, which harm both patients
and taxpayers," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. The Commission  fined Denmark's Lundbeck and eight others in June in its first pay-for-delay case and has two others in the pipeline involving Israel's Teva and its subsidiary Cephalon, and French drugmaker Servier.

BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators  fined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novartis a total of 16 million euros ($21.95 million) on Tuesday for blocking the sale of a generic painkiller in the Dutch market.

The European Commission said in a statement that the deal between the two companies meant patients did not have access to the cheaper generic version of  fentanyl  for 17 months starting from July
2005.

Johnson & Johnson and its Dutch unit, Janssen-Cilag, were  fined 10.8 million euros while Novartis and its Dutch subsidiary, Sandoz, were  fined 5.5 million euros.
"Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such
anti-competitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers," EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said.
This is the second crackdown by the Commission against so-called pay-for-delay deals where
brand-name drugmakers pay generic companies not to market rival versions of their medicine which
usually cost a fraction of the original drug.

BRUSSELS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - European Union regulators have  fined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novartis 16.3 million euros ($22 million) for blocking the sale of a cheaper generic rival to their painkiller fentanyl.
The EU warned others against such anti-competitive deals.

TD
This is the second penalty imposed by the  European Commission over so-called pay-for-delay deals where brand-name companies pay generic rivals not to sell their versions of a drug at a fraction of the original price.

The practice, common in the pharmaceutical industry, has caught the attention of regulators around the world because it raises consumer bills and public healthcare costs.

The EU competition watchdog said on Tuesday that the deal between Johnson & Johnson and Novartis meant cancer patients did not have access to the cheaper generic version of  fentanyl  for 17 months from July 2005.

Johnson & Johnson and its Dutch unit, Janssen-Cilag, were  fined 10.8 million euros while Novartis and Dutch subsidiary Sandoz were  fined 5.5 million euros. The agreement ended after another drugmaker unveiled plans to sell its own version.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that the  fines were planned.
"Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging in such
anti-competitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers," EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said.
Novartis and Sandoz disputed the regulator's finding.

"(We) reject the Commission's allegation that the 2005 co-promotion agreement was intended to deprive patients in the Netherlands of cheaper medicines. We look forward to putting this historical matter
behind us," they said in a statement.

The Commission fined Denmark's Lundbeck and eight others in June in its first pay-for-delay case and has two others in the pipeline involving Israel's Teva and its subsidiary Cephalon, and French drugmaker Servier.
Proponents of such agreements said they help companies avoid costly and lengthy litigation.

HD     European regulator slaps 16.29 mn euro fine on J&J, Novartis

Brussels, Dec 10 (PTI) The  European Commission today fined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novartis a total 16.29 million euros for allegedly delaying the entry of cheaper generic version of a painkiller in Netherlands.

"In July 2005, their respective Dutch subsidiaries concluded an anticompetitive agreement to delay the market entry of a cheaper generic version of the pain-killer  fentanyl  in the Netherlands, in breach of EU antitrust rules," fair trade watchdog said in a statement.

TD
Fentanyl is a pain-killer which is 100 times more potent than morphine and is used notably for cancer patients, it added.
US-based J&J and its Dutch unit Janssen-Cilag BV were  fined about 10.79 million euros while
Switzerland-based Novartis and its Dutch subsidiary Sandoz BV were  fined around 5.49 million euros.

"J&J paid Novartis to delay the entry of a generic pain killer. The two companies shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine," Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy said.

The commission said J&J initially developed Fentanyl and has commercialised it in different formats since the 1960s. In 2005, J&J's protection on the fentanyl  depot patch had expired in the Netherlands and Novartis' Dutch subsidiary, Sandoz, was on the verge of launching its generic  fentanyl  depot patch.
"However, in July 2005, instead of actually starting to sell the generic version, Sandoz concluded a
so-called "co-promotion agreement" with Janssen-Cilag, J&J's Dutch subsidiary," the commission said.
It added the pact provided strong incentives for Sandoz not to enter the market.

"Indeed, the agreed monthly payments exceeded the profits that Sandoz expected to obtain from selling its generic product, for as long as there was no generic entry," the commission said.
Consequently, Sandoz BV did not offer its product on the market. The agreement was stopped in
December 2006 when a third party was about to launch a generic  fentanyl  patch, it added.

"The agreement, therefore, delayed the entry of a cheaper generic medicine for seventeen months and kept prices for  fentanyl  in the Netherlands artificially high - to the detriment of patients and taxpayers who finance the Dutch health system," it said. PTI KIR KSR

(SeeNews) - Dec 11, 2013 - The  European Commission (EC) Tuesday  fined pharma
majors Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Novartis (VTX:NOVN) just over EUR 16 million (USD
22m) in total for having delayed the entry of a generic painkiller in the Dutch market.
J&J’s share in the  fine is about EUR 10.8 million and Novartis will have to pay about EUR 5.5 million.

TD
The Dutch subsidiary of J&J, Janssen-Cilag BV, and Novartis’ Sandoz BV deprived patients in 2005 from a cheaper version of painkiller  Fentanyl, which is mainly prescribed to patients suffering from cancer.

According to the commission, Sandoz wanted to launch in 2005 its own version of J&J’s  Fentanyl, but Janssen-Cilag convinced its rival not to do it. Sandoz instead received monthly payments, which were higher than the expected profit from the sale of the alternative medicine, the EC said.

The decision should make pharmaceutical firms think twice before engaging in such competition restricting practices, which are harmful to both patients and taxpayers, competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

Pay for delay' strategies, in which a generic drug manufacturer is paid by an originator pharmaceuticals firm to delay the entry of a generic product on the market, can be a very costly practice, as Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novartis have just learned. They have been hit with  fines of €10.798 million and
€5.493 million, respectively.

The European Commission sanctioned them on 10 December for a July 2005 anti-competitive agreement concluded by their respective Dutch subsidiaries to delay the market entry in the Netherlands of a cheaper generic version of  Fentanyl, a painkiller, in breach of EU anti-trust rules. "The two companies shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, of access to a cheaper version of this medicine," commented Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. "Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging in such
anti-competitive practices."

TD
Fentanyl is a painkiller used in particular to treat cancer patients. Its patent, owned by J&J, expired in the Netherlands in 2005. Sandoz, the Dutch subsidiary of Novartis specialised in generic medicines, was about to launch its generic  Fentanyl patch. But it preferred to reach a deal with Janssen-Cilag, J&J's Dutch subsidiary, under which it could obtain, in exchange for holding up market entry of its product, monthly payments greater than the profits it would have made on the sale of the generic drug, for as long as it kept the product off the market. The deal was denounced in December 2006, when a third party was on the verge of launching a generic  Fentanyl patch. In other words, it delayed for 17 months the market entry of a cheaper drug on the market and kept the price of  Fentanyl artificially high in the Netherlands at the expense of patients and taxpayers who finance the Dutch health care system.

On 21 October 2011, the Commission opened an investigation into the practices by these two groups, and in January 2013 sent them a statement of objections (see Europolitics 4291 and 4577).
In 2008 and 2009, it conducted an extensive investigation in the sector that resulted in a report, in July
2009, spelling out which practices were potentially anti-competitive and in the opening of several
procedures, including this one. Last June, it  fined Lundbeck €93.8 million and several generic producers
a total of €52.2 million for having delayed market entry of generic versions of citalopram, its flagship
anti-depressant (4669).

(SeeNews) - Dec 11, 2013 - The  European Commission said yesterday it had imposed  fines of a total of EUR 16.3 million (USD 22.4m) on Swiss Novartis (VTX:NOVN) and US Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) due to the delay of the market entry of a cheaper generic version of pain-killer  fentanyl  in the Netherlands.
Johnson & Johnson will pay EUR 10.8 million, while Novartis'  fine stands at EUR 5.5 million.

TD
In 2005 the protection on  fentanyl,  which has been developed by Johnson & Johnson, expired in the Netherlands and Sandoz, a Dutch subsidiary of Novartis was about to launch its generic  fentanyl  depot patch. The company had even produced the needed packaging material. However, instead of starting
the generic drug sales, Sandoz entered into a "co-promotion agreement" with Janssen-Cilag, Johnson & Johnson's Dutch subsidiary, which offered the Novartis unit strong incentives to not enter the market.
The agreement was cancelled in December 2006 when another company was ready to launch a generic
fentanyl  patch.

Brussels, Dec 11 (IANS) The European Commissionfined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novartis a combined 16 million euros or about $21.95 million Tuesday for delaying market entry of a cheaper generic painkiller in the Netherlands.

European Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said the two companies "shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine," Xinhua reported.

The commission said in a statement that Johnson & Johnson's patent on a patch containing the drug Fentanyl expired in 2005, however in July 2005, it signed a so-called "co-promotion agreement" and paid Novartis to delay launching a generic version.

The delay lasted 17 months, and was more profitable for both companies than competing honestly would have been.

Fentanyl is a pain-killer 100 times more potent than morphine. It is used notably for patients suffering from cancer.
US pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson was  fined 10.8 million euros while Novartis of
Switzerland was 5.5 million euros.

"Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anticompetitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers," said Almunia.

European Union regulators imposed a $22 mil fine on Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) for blocking the sale of a generic version of their fentanyl  painkiller, saying this preventing cancer patients from having access to the cheaper drug for 17 months. It's the 2nd penalty the  European      Commission has imposed over commonly practiced "pay-for-delay" deals, in which branded drugmakers pay off generic-drug makers to not sell their cheaper versions. J&J shares fell 0.3% to
94.14. Novartis fell 0.5% to 78.01.

Brussels, 10/12/2013 (Agence Europe) - On 10 December, the  European Commission imposed fines of
€10,798,000 on the US pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and €5,493,000 on Novartis of
Switzerland. In July 2005, their respective Dutch subsidiaries concluded an anticompetitive agreement to
delay the market entry of a cheaper generic version of the pain-killer  fentanyl  in the Netherlands, in
breach of EU antitrust rules.  Fentanyl is a pain-killer 100 times more potent than morphine. It is used
notably for patients suffering from cancer. The deal was revealed in December 2006, when a third party
was in the process of launching a generic  fentanyl  patch. The cartel delayed the launch of cheaper
generic patches on the market by 17 months, thus artificially keeping up the price of  fentanyl  in the
Netherlands. (FG/transl.fl)

Netherlands.  Fentanyl is a pain-killer which is 100 times more potent than morphine and is used notably

The European Commission has imposed fines of 10 798 000 on the US pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and 5 493 000 on Novartis of Switzerland. In July 2005, their respective Dutch subsidiaries concluded an anticompetitive agreement to delay the market entry of a cheaper generic version of the pain-killer  fentanyl  in the Netherlands, in breach of EU antitrust rules.  Fentanyl is a
pain-killer 100 times more potent than morphine. It is used notably for patients suffering from cancer.

TD
Commission Vice-President Joaquín Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said: "J&J paid Novartis to delay the entry of a generic pain killer. The two companies shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine. Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anticompetitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers."

J&J initially developed Fentanyl and has commercialised it in different formats since the 1960s. In 2005, J&J's protection on the fentanyl  depot patch had expired in the Netherlands and Novartis' Dutch subsidiary, Sandoz, was on the verge of launching its generic  fentanyl  depot patch. It had already produced the necessary packaging material.
However, in July 2005, instead of actually starting to sell the generic version, Sandoz concluded a
so-called "co-promotion agreement" with Janssen-Cilag, J&J's Dutch subsidiary. The agreement provided
strong incentives for Sandoz not to enter the market. Indeed, the agreed monthly payments exceeded the
profits that Sandoz expected to obtain from selling its generic product, for as long as there was no generic
entry. Consequently, Sandoz did not offer its product on the market. The agreement was stopped in
December 2006 when a third party was about to launch a generic  fentanyl  patch.

The agreement therefore delayed the entry of a cheaper generic medicine for seventeen months and kept prices for fentanyl  in the Netherlands artificially high - to the detriment of patients and taxpayers who finance the Dutch health system.

Why did J&J and Novartis conclude that agreement? According to internal documents Sandoz would abstain from entering the Dutch market in exchange for "a part of the cake". Instead of competing, Janssen-Cilag and Sandoz agreed on cooperation so as "not to have a depot generic on the market and in that way to keep the high current price". Janssen-Cilag did not consider any other existing potential partners for the so-called "co-promotion agreement" but just focused on its close competitor Sandoz. Sandoz engaged in very limited or no actual co-promotion activities.
The Commission therefore concluded that the object of this agreement was anticompetitive and infringed
Article 101 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

HD       Johnson & Johnson and Novartis  review options on €16m EU fine

Johnson & Johnson and Novartis are considering appealing against EU antitrust  fines of €16m imposed this week for their agreement to defer generic competition.

In a long-awaited ruling, the  European Commission argued that J&J had paid Sandoz, the generic drugs arm of Novartis, to prevent it launching a lower-cost version of its painkilling patch  fentanyl  in the Netherlands.

TD
The co-promotion agreement, described in internal company documents as a way to share "a part of
[the] cake", meant J&J paid Sandoz more than it would have earned from sales of its rival version over
17 months from July 2005, when its patents expired. The deal stopped once a second generic company
was about to enter the market at the end of the following year.

The ruling comes amid escalating scrutiny by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic into so-called "pay-for-delay" deals allegedly designed to reduce price competition on drugs through payments from patent holders once their exclusivity on a product ends.

The practice was criticised by the  European Commission in a high-level sector inquiry it launched into the pharmaceutical industry.

Drug companies argue that such agreements can provide certainty rather than the risks associated with prolonged litigation with generic rivals over patents.

Novartis, which was  fined €5m, said: "Sandoz BV and Novartis reject the commission's allegation that the 2005 co-promotion agreement was intended to deprive patients in the Netherlands of cheaper medicines. We look forward to putting this historical matter behind us."

J&J, which said it was "studying" the ruling, stressed: "Our objective today is to bring transformational innovative medicines to patients. Once the intellectual property rights for a given product have expired, generic companies should play their role by providing generic versions of medicines at lower prices."

Joaquín Almunia, vice-president of the commission, said the two companies "shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands" by their actions and said the decision "should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anti-competitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers".

Jason Rutt, head of patents at Rouse, a law firm specialising in intellectual property, said: "On the face of it, the Sandoz-J&J deal does seem unfortunate although it's hard to learn much about current practice from a case where the deal was concluded before the sector inquiry. But I don't believe this will lead to better deals between parties. The net effect of all this is going to be to make the pharmaceuticals sector even more cautious than they already are about doing any deals, knowing it can be scrutinised for
anti-competitive practice."
He called instead for greater US-style incentives to promote generic competition.

Posting of workers

Member states’ employment ministers on Monday (9 December) agreed a compromise on the European Commission proposal to bolster the enforcement of the posting of workers directive. In a victory for the French government, member states will be free to decide how to ensure that companies comply with minimum social rules when posting workers, though subject to oversight from the European Commission. Member states will now open negotiations with the European Parliament.

Skype/Microsoft

The European Union’s General Court on Wednesday (11 December) upheld the  European                   Commission’s decision in 2011 to approve Microsoft’s €6 billion acquisition of Skype. The decision
had been challenged by Cisco as a potential breach of European Union competition rules.
Patent settlements

The European Commission on Tuesday (10 December)  finedJohnson & Johnson €10.8 million and Novartis €5.5m for breaking EU rules against cartels. The Commisison found that J&J paid a Novartis subsidiary not to launch onto the Dutch market a generic version of  fentanyl,  which is a blockbuster painkiller developed by J&J for cancer sufferers. The deal delayed entry by generic rivals by more than a year.
Big exporter

Germany’s Federal Statistics Office on Monday (9 December) published data showing that the country’s exports were worth €99.1 billion in October, while it imported goods worth €81.2bn over the same period. As compared with September, exports increased by 0.2%, and imports increased by
2.9%.
Nokia/Microsoft

The European Commission on Friday (6 December) approved Microsoft’s €5 billion bid for Nokia’s handset business.

Section: Business News - The European Commissionfined drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Novartis a combined 16 million euros (21.95 million U.S. dollars) on Tuesday for delaying market entry of a cheaper generic painkiller in Dutch.

European Commission Vice-President Joaquin Almunia, in charge of competition policy, said the two companies "shockingly deprived patients in the Netherlands, including people suffering from cancer, from access to a cheaper version of this medicine."

TD
The commission said in a statement that Johnson & Johnson's patent on a patch containing the drug Fentanyl expired in 2005, however in July 2005, it signed a so-called "co-promotion agreement" and paid Novartis to delay launching a generic version.

The delay lasted 17 months, and was more profitable for both companies than competing honestly would have been.

Fentanyl is a pain-killer 100 times more potent than morphine. It is used notably for patients suffering from cancer.

U.S. pharmaceutical firm Johnson & Johnson was  fined 10.8 million euros while Novartis of Switzerland was 5.5 million euros.

"Today's decision should make pharmaceutical companies think twice before engaging into such anticompetitive practices, which harm both patients and taxpayers," said Almunia. - PNA

HD     Proposal  Would Ban Pay-for-Delay  Deals

U.S. lawmakers Wednesday introduced a bill that would prohibit patent litigation settlements in which a brand drugmaker compensates a generic drugmaker to delay sales of a competing generic drug, commonly referred to as "pay-for-delay" deals.

The Protecting Consumer Access to Generic Drugs Act of 2013, introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), would deem the deals an "unfair and deceptive act or practice" that creates an unfair method of competition, an offense prosecutable under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

TD
The bill would be a boon to the FTC after a Supreme Court decision this summer made prosecuting pay-for-delay agreements an uphill battle.

As part of a heavily anticipated ruling in the case FTC v. Actavis, the high court ruled 5-3 that pay-for-delay agreements are not presumptively illegal, but instead should be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis under a long-standing antitrust test called the "rule of reason" (DID, June 18).

The FTC said at the time the ruling would not dampen its efforts to pursue antitrust charges against drugmakers, but instead would prompt the agency to heighten its scrutiny of patent litigation settlements between brand and generics manufacturers (DID, July 25).

The Rush bill has been referred to the House Energy & Commerce Committee and the House Committee on the Judiciary.

While the U.S. debates changes to law, the EU continues moving ahead with enforcement against pay-for-delay deals. The European Commission last week announced its latest pay-for-delay enforcement case. It has finedNovartis and Johnson & Johnson $22 million for delaying market entry in the Netherlands of a generic fentanyl  patch, a painkiller used by cancer patients.

The Commission also announced on Dec. 10 it is investigating Servier and other pharma companies for potentially delaying the market entry of generic perindopril, a cardiovascular drug, and an agreement between Cephalon and Teva that possibly delayed the entry of generic modafinil, a medicine for sleeping disorders.

HD        Janssen-Cilag not to appeal European fine

(SeeNews) - Dec 16, 2013 - Dutch pharmaceutical firm Janssen-Cilag said Saturday it would not appeal a European  fine for infringement of competition law.
The European Commission (EC) last week  fined Janssen-Cilag's US parent Johnson & Johnson
(NYSE:JNJ) and Novartis (VTX:NOVN) and its Dutch subsidiary Sandoz just over EUR 16 million (USD
22m) in total for having delayed the entry of a generic painkiller in the Netherlands.

TD
Sonja Willems, managing director of Janssen Benelux, said the company had taken measures to prevent similar situations in future.

The EC accused Janssen-Cilag and Sandoz of having deprived patients in 2005 from a cheaper version of painkiller Fentanyl, which is mainly prescribed to people living with cancer. According to the commission, Sandoz wanted to launch its own version of J&J’s  Fentanyl, but Janssen-Cilag convinced its rival not to do it. Sandoz instead received monthly payments, which were higher than the expected profit from the sale of the alternative medicine, the EC said.

The European Commission has finedJohnson and Johnson and Novartis EUR 16 M+ for having agreed to delay the launch of a generic analgesic on the Dutch market. Johnson and Johnson was  fined EUR
10.798 M and Novartis EUR 5.493 M. The case dates back to Jul 2005 when the groups' subsidiaries Janssen-Cilag and Sandoz signed an anticompetitive agreement to delay the market launch of a generic version of fentanyl  (Johnson and Johnson's powerful analgesic used in the treatment of cancer since
1960). A patch version of the product was protected by patent until 2005. Janssen-Cilag agreed to make Sandoz monthly payments of more than its expected profits. The agreement was reported to the authorities in Dec 2006 when another generic producer was preparing the launch of its own patch version of the drug.

European CommissionfinesJohnson & Johnson and Novartis in pay for delay case

TD
The European Commission has finedJohnson & Johnson €10.8 million and Novartis €5.5 million for agreeing to delay the entry into the Dutch market of a generic version of the drug  fentanyl.  The Commission found that the companies entered into a co-promotion agreement which provided Sandoz (the Dutch subsidiary of Novartis) with financial incentives not to launch a generic version on the Dutch market. The Commission concluded that this agreement constitutes a breach of Article 101 TFEU by object.

Click hereThe European Commission has fined eight international banks a total of €1.71 billion for participating in cartels in markets for financial derivatives covering the EEA, in contravention of Article 101
TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. The Commission used the cartel settlement procedure to reach two separate decisions: the first relates to collusion by four institutions (Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and RBS) which participated in a cartel in respect of interest rate derivatives denominated in the euro currency, whilst the second relates to collusion between six institutions (UBS, RBS, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Citigroup and RP Martin) which participated in one or more bilateral cartels in respect of interest rate derivatives denominated in Japanese yen. Barclays and UBS received complete immunity from  fines under the Commission's 2006 Leniency Notice, whilst the remaining companies' fines were reduced by 10% for agreeing to settle. .

Under the agreements, each of the other three companies agreed to submit higher bids than Cirrus, with the aim that Cirrus would win the contracts. The three other companies have been fined a total of £53,410. Cirrus received immunity under the OFT's leniency policy.

UK Office of Fair TradingFines Show Risk for Small Companies and Short-Term Cartels

During December 2013, two UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) cases showed once again that small companies can be fined for cartel infringements in the EU and also that short-term cartels will not be spared.

TD
In the first decision, announced on 6 December 2013, the OFT  fined three companies for engaging in collusive tendering concerning the supply and installation of access control and alarm systems to retirement properties in the UK. A fourth party escaped  fines since it was the whistleblower (first in) under the OFT's leniency programme. The combined value of the at least 65 tenders involved amounted to only around GBP1.4 million. The total  fines on the small companies involved amounted to only around GBP50,000, with one party  fined under GBP2,000.

In the second case, the OFT announced on 12 December 2013 that a prescription medicine supplier, Hamsard, had agreed to pay a  fine of GBP388,000 for entering into a market-sharing agreement with competitor Celesio in the UK. Celesio escaped a  fine entirely since it was the whistleblower. Hamsard's fine was reduced since it also used the OFT's leniency programme (but as second in) and cooperated with the OFT under its settlement procedure, including by agreeing to pay the  fine. This was a short-term cartel, running only between May and November 2011.

The fines in these cases were relatively small but it is clear that being involved in a cartel remains a key risk area for all businesses. Apart from  fines, cartel decisions inevitably give rise to reputational damage and these days it is almost inevitable that customers will bring private actions for damages. Competition compliance programmes remain very important, whatever the size of a business. Apart from reducing the risk of cartel (or other anti-competitive) activity in the first place, a key benefit is the possibility of taking advantage of leniency if the programme catches a cartel.
EC Publishes Latest Pharma Patent Settlement Survey, But Legal Position Still Unclear

The European Commission's (EC) latest report on pharmaceutical patent settlement agreements in the EEA (the EU plus three other countries), covering 2012, was published on 9 December 2013. The EC started these reports after its 2009 competition inquiry into the pharmaceutical sector, which identified settlements that limit generic entry and provide at the same time for a value transfer from the originator to the generic company as potentially raising competition concerns.

The headline finding in the report is that, compared with previous years, the number of such potentially problematic settlement agreements has continued to fall, in 2012 accounting for around 7% of all patent settlements in the pharmaceutical sector in the EEA.

The EC says that this shows the industry's increased awareness of potentially problematic practices. This may or may not be the case, but in any event this area of law remains unclear despite these reports and the EC's June 2013 Lundbeck decision. In that case, the EC imposed a  fine of EUR93.8 million on
Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and  fines totalling EUR52.2 million on several producers of generic medicines for agreeing to delay the market entry of cheaper generic versions of citalopram, a blockbuster antidepressant.


Page 51 of 53 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The EC's very strict approach in that case has been appealed to the EU General Court (GC) and the correct legal position will not be known until the court opines. Meanwhile, legal uncertainty limits the appetite of originators and generics to negotiate patent settlement agreements and indeed probably reduces the likelihood that generic suppliers will challenge patents in the first place (which could in turn skew the findings of the EC's monitoring reports going forward).
It Doesn't Matter What You Call It; "Co-promotion" Agreement  Fined as a Cartel

On 10 December 2013, the EC imposed  fines of EUR10.8 million on Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and EUR5.5 million on Novartis for an "intolerable" agreement to share "monopoly profits" on a pharmaceutical product in the Netherlands. The agreement between the companies was termed a "co-promotion" agreement but was seen and  fined as a cartel.

The case concerned fentanyl,  a painkiller produced and sold by J&J. In 2005, Novartis was preparing to sell its own generic version of  fentanyl,  which was no longer protected in the Netherlands. However, according to the EC, instead of competing against each other, the companies agreed that Novartis would abstain from entering the Dutch market in exchange for "a part of [Johnson & Johnson's] cake". They therefore concluded a so-called "co-promotion agreement" which gave Novartis strong incentives not to enter the market.

In particular, under the pretext of "co-promotion", J&J would make monthly payments to Novartis for as long as there was no generic on the market. Although this case arose in the pharmaceutical sector and concerned generics, this was not a pharmaceutical "patent settlement" case. It was simply a situation in which one party paid another to keep a competing product out of the market. A similar scenario in any other sector would be viewed and treated in exactly the same way.
EU Court Accepts High Market Shares Need Not be Definitive in Tech Deals

An attempt to overturn the EC's 2011 clearance of Microsoft's acquisition of Skype was rejected by the GC in an 11 December 2013 ruling. The GC ruled that, despite Microsoft's very high post-transaction share of a particular market (80-90% of video communications on Windows-based PCs), the EC had been correct to clear the transaction unconditionally.

The GC agreed that even this market share level was not indicative of market power given the particular characteristics of the market in question, which is marked by short innovation cycles and products which are free. Therefore, if Microsoft started to make PC users pay for such a product, this would only encourage them to switch to other providers that continued to offer their services free of charge.

This judgment is very encouraging for parties considering mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures in similar fast-moving markets. If it can be shown that competitors and potential competitors remain able to win customers either through existing or new products, then very high market shares won't be a bar to clearance. The EC, responding to the judgment, emphasized this point by stating that it "...confirms the [EC]'s assessment of new markets and technologies... The [EC]'s decision to clear the transaction did not put the development of innovative products and services at risk. The [EC] will continue to ensure that competition in nascent and fast evolving markets is maintained." This is similar to the U.S. approach, although is not necessarily reflected in other jurisdictions around the world.
State Aid to Professional Football Clubs: Any Economic Advantage Can Amount to State Aid

For the second time this year, the EC has launched an investigation into alleged illegal aid provided by an EU Member State to professional football clubs. On 18 December 2013, the EC announced that it is looking into various support measures granted by Spain to three clubs without approval from the EC. The measures are tax advantages granted to Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Club Bilbao and Club Atletico Osasuna, the transfer of a significant piece of land from the City of Madrid to Real Madrid, and State guarantees issued in favour of Valencia, Hercules and Elche which were used to finance those clubs
when they were in financial difficulties. The EC stated "professional football clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer". Third parties are invited to comment and if the investigation confirms the existence of the allegedly illegal aid, the EC will order Spain to recover from the clubs the value of the benefit plus interest.

The case provides a reminder that, when benefiting from State support (in any form), companies should always ensure that it is State aid compliant. Otherwise, there is a risk of it being recovered later. At the same time, public bodies have an interest in assessing the State aid compliance of their support measures at the outset, since they can be sued for damages (for example by the beneficiaries' competitors) if they grant illegal aid.
