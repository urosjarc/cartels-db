BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union head office imposed  fines totaling 217 million (US$283 million) on  Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst on Wednesday for carving up among themselves the European market for a chemical used to produce detergents, food and cosmetics.
The European Commission fined the companies because they formed an illegal  cartel from at least
1984 to 1999 for rigging markets for the chemical substance  MCAA, which is used also used in
herbicides, plastics and the textile industry.

TD
The companies controlled about 90 percent of the  European market, which was worth about 125 million in 1998.
"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
In 2001,  Akzo Nobel paid US$12 million to U.S. regulators for similar  MCAA offenses.

Kroes' office fined Akzo Nobel NV of the Netherlands 84.4 million (US$110 million). Germany's Hoechst, whose MCAA business was taken over by  Clariant, has to pay 74 million (US$96 million) and Atofina, known as Arkema and part of French giant Total SA, was  fined 58.5 million (US$76 million).

Clariant  AG was not  fined because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

Sanofi-Aventis, which acquired Hoechst through its purchase of drug maker Aventis last year, said Hoechst will consider lodging an appeal with a Luxembourg court after it has officially been notified of the EU fine.

Hans Wijers, chairman of  Akzo Nobel's board of management, said the company was upset its  fine was so large, especially after it worked with EU investigators on the case.

"Since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this 84 million fine," Wijers said, adding that the company had put such anticompetitive actions behind it and now had a "zero-tolerance" policy against  cartel actions.

HD        Akzo Nobel regrets past conduct in former MCAA cartel

Arnhem, the Netherlands, January 19, 2005 - Akzo Nobel has received a verdict from the European Commission for breaching competition law in the European Mono Chloroacetic Acid (MCAA) market between 1984 and 1999.

Since January 2000,  Akzo Nobel has had a company-wide program in place to intensify competition law compliance. The investigation by the  Commission commenced in March 2000 and in view of  Akzo Nobels strong and committed policy to crackdown on any potential  cartel issues, the Company has cooperated fully with the  Commission in its investigations.

TD
Hans Wijers, Chairman of Akzo Nobels Board of Management, said: We regret  Akzo Nobels past conduct in this former MCAA cartel. However, I must say that it angers me that we have to deal with another anti-competition issue of this kind because it means that the vast majority of  Akzo Nobels
63,000 employees are being unfairly tarred with the brush of events that happened many years ago. I am determined that we should put this behind us: with full commitment to ensure that these kind of actions
do not occur again, and zero tolerance for those who undertake any anti-competitive behavior. Since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this EUR 84 million fine. We will study the argumentation behind it to see whether the calculation is fair."

Partly as a consequence of its intensified compliance program,  Akzo Nobel is still involved in investigations by the authorities in the United States, Canada and the  European Union into several alleged violations of respective antitrust laws. The Company has cooperated extensively with the authorities in all of these cases.

In 2000,  Akzo Nobel took a EUR 200 million nonrecurring charge. Based on the developments in a number of pending cases, in mid 2004, the Company adjusted its provision. This  fine was partly provided for. A new update will be given with the annual figures on February 4.

MCAA is used as an intermediate in the preparation of a wide variety of chemicals. It is used as a raw material to produce thickening agents for food, oil, and mining, in personal care products and detergents, agrochemicals, thermo stabilizers for PVC, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals.

London (Platts)-19Jan2005/752 am EST/1252 GMT The  European Commission's Antitrust body has fined Akzo Nobel, Atofina (now known as Arkema) and Hoechst a total of Eur216.91-mil (284-mil) for operating a cartel in the monochloroacetic acid market, according to an EC press release Wednesday. The level of fines confirms the Commissions determination to crack down on companies entering into cartels. Akzo Nobel was fined Eur84.38-mil,  Arkema was fined Eur58.5-mil, and Hoechst was  fined Eur74.03-mil. The  fines on Arkema and Hoechst were increased substantially as both had previously been fined for similar illegal behaviour. "The  Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing.  I will not allow companies to carve up the Single Market amongst themselves and so deny customers the benefits to which they are entitled. The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities and companies that engage in cartels will be  fined heavily.

TD
Where companies have repeatedly violated the EUs antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the  fines as a deterrent, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

London (Platts)-19Jan2005/756 am EST/1256 GMT The  Commission's investigation was triggered by information brought to its attention by one of the cartels participants, in return for immunity under the EC's antitrust leniency program. The EC found that  Akzo, Arkema, Hoechst, and  Clariant  (after it took over Hoechst's MCAA business in 1997) had colluded in secret to share the market and fix prices for  MCAA in the European Economic Area market. Together, the companies involved controlled over 90% of the EEA market for MCAA. In 1998, the last full year of the infringement, the EEA market was worth about
Eur125-mil. MCAA is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and thickeners used in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

The European Commission said it has imposed a  fine totalling E216.91m on  Akzo Nobel NV, Hoechst AG and Arkema (formerly Atofina) for their operation of a  cartel in the chemicals market.

The companies operated a  cartel from 1984-1999 in the market for  monochloroacetic acid which is used in the manufacture of detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and is used as thickener in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Akzo Nobel was fined E84.38m, Hoechst E74.03m and Arkema E58.5m. The three companies control over 90 pc of the market for this chemical in the European Economic Area. In 1998, the last year the cartel was operating, the market was worth around E125m.

The commission said it had increased the  fines on Hoechst and Arkema "substantially" because of their previous involvement in similar illegal behaviour. Neelie Kroes, European competition commissioner, said: "Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the fines as a deterrent."

BRUSSELS, Jan 19 (AFP) -

The European Commission on Wednesday slapped  fines of some 217 million  euros (284 million dollars) on three chemical firms for operating a  cartel to fix the price of a key chemical used in all sorts of household products.

TD
Germany's Hoechst, Dutch company  Akzo Nobel and Arkema (formerly Atofina) of France were rapped for mounting the  cartel from 1984-1999 in the market for monochloroacetic acid (MCAA), used to make detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and is used as thickener in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

"The commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  said EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"I will not allow companies to carve up the (EU) single market among themselves and deny customers the benefits to which they are entitled," she added.

Akzo Nobel was fined 84.38 million euros, Hoechst 74.03 million and  Arkema 58.5 million.
The three companies control over 90 percent of the market for this chemical in the  European Economic
Area. In 1998, the last year the  cartel was operating, the market was worth around 125 million  euros.

The commission said it had increased the  fines on Hoechst and Arkema "substantially" because of their previous involvement in similar illegal behaviour.

Akzo Nobel chairman Hans Wijers said in a statement that he regretted the company's "past conduct" but insisted the size of the  fine was unfair.
"We will study the arguments behind it to see whether the calculation is fair," he said. ed-mt/lt/nh

BRUSSELS (AP) _ The  European Union head office has imposed big  fines on chemical giants Akzo Nobel NV, Atofina and Hoechst AG for carving up among themselves the  European market for a chemical used to produce products from detergents to food to cosmetics.

On Wednesday, the European Commission fined the companies a total of 217 million  euros ($283 million US) because they formed an illegal cartel from at least 1984 to 1999 for rigging markets for a chemical substance called  MCAA, which is used in pharmaceuticals, herbicides and plastics.

TD
``The commission cannot and will not tolerate  price-fixing and market-sharing,'' EU Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.
In 2001,  Akzo Nobel paid $12 million to U.S. regulators for similar  MCAA offences. The commission did not give a breakdown of the  fines.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission Wednesday fined three large chemical companies a total of EUR217 million for operating a cartel to fix prices in the detergents and adhesives market.
E.U. regulators  fined Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) EUR84.4 million, Germany's Hoechst
AG (HOE.XE) EUR74 million, and Atofina, part of French giant Total SA (TOT), EUR58.5 million. [

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  said E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Regulators said their investigation was triggered by information brought forward by one of the  cartel's participants. They found Akzo, Atofina, Hoechst and  Clariant  AG (CLN.VX) colluded in the market for monochloroacetic acid or MCAA. The chemical is used in the manufacturing of detergents, adhesives and thickeners for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.

From 1984 to 1999, the companies allocated volume quotas and customers and agreed on price increases. Together, the companies controlled over 90% of the market for  MCAA in the European Economic Area, estimated at EUR125 million in 1998.

The E.U. Commission added the fines on Atofina and Hoechst were "increased substantially" as both had previously been fined for similar illegal behavior.  Clariant  meanwhile was granted full immunity for being the whistle blower.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis SA (SNY) said Wednesday a EUR74.03 million fine, slapped by the  European Union Commission on one of its former units for operating a chemical product cartel, won't hurt its earnings.
The risk of a  fine had been taken into account, Sanofi said in a statement. [ 19-01-05 1231GMT ]

TD
Earlier Wednesday, the  European Commission said it fined chemical companies Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY), Total SA (TOT), as well as Sanofi's Hoechst AG (HOE.XE), a total of EUR217 million for colluding in the market for monochoroacetic  acid.

MCAA is used to make various products such as detergents and adhesives.
Sanofi, which acquired Hoechst through its purchase of drug maker Aventis last year, said the  MCAA
business was sold to Clariant  AG in 1997.

Sanofi said Hoechst will consider the possibility of lodging an appeal with a Luxembourg court after it has officially been notified of the E.U.  fine. [ 19-01-05 1238GMT ]

Clariant  was granted full immunity by the  Commission for being the whistle blower.

The Commission said the investigation showed that, from 1984 to 1999, the companies allocated volume quotas and customers and agreed on price increases. Together, the companies controlled over
90% of the market for  MCAA in the European Economic Area, estimated at EUR125 million in 1998.

In 2003, Hoechst pleaded guilty and paid a $12 million  fine as part of a separate U.S. investigation into the same matter.

Edited Press Release

AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Dutch chemical, coatings and drug company  Akzo Nobel (AKZOY) said it received a verdict from the European Commission for breaching competition law in the  European Mono Chloroacetic  Acid (MCAA) market between 1984 and 1999.

TD
Since January 2000,  Akzo Nobel has had a company-wide program in place to intensify competition law compliance. The investigation by the  Commission commenced in March 2000 and in view of  Akzo Nobel's strong and committed policy to crackdown on any potential  cartel issues, the Company has cooperated fully with the  Commission in its investigations.

Hans Wijers, Chairman of Akzo Nobel's Board of Management, said: "We regret  Akzo Nobel's past conduct in this former MCAA cartel. However, I must say that it angers me that we have to deal with another anti-competition issue of this kind because it means that the vast majority of  Akzo Nobel's
63,000 employees are being unfairly tarred with the brush of events that happened many years ago. I am determined that we should put this behind us: with full commitment to ensure that these kind of actions
do not occur again, and zero tolerance for those who undertake any anti-competitive behavior. Since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this EUR84M fine. We will study the argumentation behind it to see whether the calculation is fair."

Partly as a consequence of its intensified compliance program,  Akzo Nobel is still involved in investigations by the authorities in the United States, Canada and the  European Union into several alleged violations of respective antitrust laws. The Company has cooperated extensively with the authorities in all of these cases.

In 2000,  Akzo Nobel took a EUR200M nonrecurring charge. Based on the developments in a number of pending cases, in mid 2004, the Company adjusted its provision. This  fine was partly provided for. A new update will be given with the annual figures on February 4.

MCAA is used as an intermediate in the preparation of a wide variety of chemicals. It is used as a raw material to produce thickening agents for food, oil, and mining, in personal care products and detergents, agrochemicals, thermo stabilizers for PVC, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals.

(This updates a story from 1129 GMT with reaction from the companies.) BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission Wednesday fined three large chemical companies a total of EUR217 million for operating a cartel to fix prices in the European market for a chemical used to make detergents and adhesives market.

E.U. regulators  fined Dutch company Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) EUR84.4 million, Germany's Hoechst
AG (HOE.XE) EUR74 million, and Atofina, part of French giant Total SA (TOT), EUR58.5 million.

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  said E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
The investigation was triggered by information brought forward by one of the  cartel's participants
Clariant  AG (CLN.VX). It was granted full immunity for being the whistle blower.

Akzo said it regretted its conduct in the  cartel and would act to make sure such behavior wasn't repeated. The company said it had taken a EUR200 million charge in 2000 to pay for potential  cartel    fines.

But the Dutch company also said it needed to study whether the amount of the  fine was appropriate. The company can appeal to the  European Court of First Justice.

"Since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this EUR84 million  fine," said Hans Wijers, Chairman of  Akzo Nobel's Board of Management.

French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis SA (SY), Hoechst's owner, also said it would consider an appeal. The fine won't hurt its earnings, it added because the risk of a  fine has already been taken into account.
A Total spokesman said it too reserved the the right to appeal.

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  said E.U. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

In the U.S., the three companies have already pleaded guilty to the same charge and paid  fines - though much smaller than what the European authorities are demanding. Hoechst pleaded guilty in
2003 and paid a $12 million  fine. Akzo paid $12 million 2001. Atofina paid $8.5 million in 2000.
The investigation was triggered by information brought forward by one of the  cartel's participants

The European Commission (EC) has imposed a fine of 84.4 mln  euro ($110 mln) on Dutch chemical, pharmaceutical and coatings company  Akzo Nobel NV due to its participation in the so-called Monochloroacetic Acid cartel, the EC said on January 19, 2005.

Besides Akzo Nobel, the EC  fined also French petrochemicals company Atofina Petrochemicals, known as Arkema and part of French oil group Total, which received a  fine of 58.5 mln  euro ($76.2 mln), as well as German chemical group Hoechst, on which a  fine of 74.03 mln euro ($96.47 mln) was imposed. The total value of the  fines, imposed by the EC, stands at 216.91 mln euro ($282.67 mln).

TD
According to the EC, the companies operated a  cartel from 1984 to 1999 in the market for monochloroacetic acid which is used in the manufacture of detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and is used as thickener in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

The three companies control more than 90 pct of the market for this chemical in the  European Economic Area. This market had a value of some 125 mln  euro ($162.9 mln) in 1998, the last year in which the cartel operated.

Three chemicals companies, including  Akzo Nobel, were fined ?217m ($284m) by the European          Commission on Wednesday for operating a  cartel for almost two decades.
Netherlands-based Akzo - which makes chemicals, paints and drugs - was  fined ?84.38m, Hoechst
?74.03m and Arkema ?58.5m for running a  cartel from 1984-1999 in the market for  monochloroacetic
acid, used in thickening agents for food, personal care products and adhesives.

TD
The commission said the companies conspired to control more than 90 per cent of the  European
market worth as much as ?125m a year.

"The commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing.  Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the fines as a deterrent," said Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner.
The commission said it had raised the  fines on Hoechst, part of French pharmaceutical group
Sanofi-Aventis, and  Arkema, the chemicals unit of Total, because of earlier flouting of competition laws.

However, Arkema and Akzo had their fines reduced by 40 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, by cooperating with the commission's investigators.

Hans Wijers, chairman of  Akzo's board of management, said he regretted the company's "past conduct" but complained about the size of the  fine in light of its recent "zero tolerance policy" towards employees involved in price-fixing.

"Since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this ?84m  fine. We will study the argumentation behind it to see whether the calculation is fair," he added.

Akzo said the fine was "partly provided for" out of a provision made in 2000 of ?200m. The company said this provision had been adjusted in mid 2004 "based on developments in a number of pending cases" and said an updated would be given with its its annual results on February 4.

Sanofi-Aventis said on Wednesday it had provided for the  fine and would not suffer an impact to earnings and added that it was considering an appeal.

Hoechst, after several mergers, is now part of France's Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA).
The chemical,  monochloroacetic acid, is used in food, detergents, adhesives, drugs and cosmetics.

Clariant  of Switzerland was part of the cartel after it took over Hoechst's business in 1997, but received full immunity from the Commission for blowing the whistle.

The companies controlled 90 percent of the market in the  European Economic Community for the chemical during the time of the  cartel, from 1984 to 1999.
"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  Competition
Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement. "The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities."
The Commission said in its statement that it considered the violation very serious.
Kroes said she would increase  fines as a deterrent when companies repeatedly violate antitrust rules.

AMSTERDAM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Dutch chemical group  Akzo Nobel (AKZO.AS) said on Wednesday it regretted its role in a  cartel that fixed prices on a widely used chemical, but was disappointed by the "huge"  fine levied by the EU.

"We will study the argumentation behind it to see whether the calculation is fair,"  Akzo Nobel said in a statement, adding the  fine had been partly provided for in previous provisions.

Earlier on Wednesday the European Commission levied an 84.4 million  euro ($110 million) fine for fixing prices in the market for monochloroacetic acid, used to make detergents, adhesives and in food. Atofina, a unit of oil group Total (TOTF.PA), and Hoechst (HOEG.DE) received smaller  fines.

BRUSSELS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Three major European chemicals firms - Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst - were on Wednesday  fined 217 million euros ($283.5 million) by the European Commission for fixing prices on a widely used chemical.

The three firms controlled 90 percent of the  European market for monochloroacetic acid, or MCAA, which is used as a raw material for making thickening agents in food, oil, mining, detergents, adhesives, cosmetics and thermo stabilizers for PVC.

TD
Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands was fined 84.38 million. Hoechst, which after several mergers now is
a unit of France's Sanofi-Aventis, was fined 74.03 million euros. Atofina, the chemical branch of Total
of France now known as  Arkema, was fined 58.5 million euros.

Akzo Nobel said it regretted its action but felt "aggrieved" by the size of the  fine for something that happened years ago and may appeal. Sanofi suggested that it too might appeal, although it saw no impact on earnings.

But those complaints by the violators fell on deaf ears at the  Commission, which considers the violations quite serious.

"Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the  fines as a deterrent,"  European Competition  Commission Neelie Kroes said.

Clariant  of Switzerland was part of the conspiracy after it took over Hoechst's business in 1997, but received full immunity from the  Commission for blowing the whistle on the  cartel, which lasted from
1984 to 1999.

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  Kroes said. "The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities."

Sanofi said in a statement that its affiliate Hoechst would consider whether to appeal the decision to the EU's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

"Hoechst sold its  MCAA business to Clariant  AG in 1997 and has no longer been active in this business since that time," the company said in a statement.

In Arnhem, the Netherlands, Hans Wiljers, chairman of  Akzo Nobel's board of management, said that he regretted the firm's past actions.

But he decried the  fine, saying that "since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities we feel aggrieved about the huge amount." He said the calculation of the  fine would be studied to make certain it was fair.
But he said the  fine was partly accounted for in earlier provisions.

The Commission has also proposed a fine of 217 million euros on Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst, because they organised a  cartel on monochloroacetic acid.

HD          UPDATE 4-Hefty EU fines for 3 chemical  firms in cartel. BY           By David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Three major European chemicals firms - Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst - were on Wednesday  fined 217 million euros ($283.5 million) by the European Commission for fixing prices on a widely used chemical.

The three firms controlled 90 percent of the  European market for monochloroacetic acid, or MCAA, which is used as a raw material for making thickening agents in food, oil, mining, detergents, adhesives, cosmetics and thermo stabilizers for PVC.

TD
Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands was fined 84.38 million. Hoechst, which after several mergers now is a unit of France's Sanofi-Aventis, was fined 74.03 million euros. Atofina, the chemical branch of Total of France now known as Arkema, was fined 58.5 million euros.

Share markets largely shrugged of the  fines. By mid-afternoon shares in  Akzo Nobel were up 0.41 percent at 32.13 euros, Sanofi-Aventis was 0.78 percent lower at 57.60 while Total shares were up
0.25 percent at 163 euros.

Akzo Nobel said it regretted its action but felt "aggrieved" by the size of the  fine for something that happened years ago and may appeal. Sanofi suggested it too might appeal, although it saw no impact on earnings. Arkema said it was waiting for details of the decision before deciding whether to appeal.

But those complaints by the violators fell on deaf ears at the  Commission, which considers the violations quite serious.

"Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the  fines as a deterrent,"  European Competition  Commission Neelie Kroes said.

Clariant  of Switzerland was part of the conspiracy after it took over Hoechst's business in 1997, but received full immunity from the  Commission for blowing the whistle on the  cartel, which lasted from
1984 to 1999.

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing,"  Kroes said. "The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities."

Sanofi said in a statement that its affiliate Hoechst would consider whether to appeal the decision to the EU's Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

"Hoechst sold its  MCAA business to Clariant  AG in 1997 and has no longer been active in this business since that time," the company said in a statement.

In Arnhem, the Netherlands, Hans Wijers, chairman of  Akzo Nobel's board of management, said that he regretted the firm's past actions.

But he decried the  fine, saying that "since we cooperated extensively with the  European authorities we feel aggrieved about the huge amount." He said the calculation of the  fine would be studied to make certain it was fair.

Page 38 of 71 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said the fine was partly accounted for in provisions.

An Arkema spokesman said the matter was "an old issue" and the Total unit had fully cooperated with the commission. Since then the subsidiary had put in place internal regulations for its businesses to fully comply with EU competition rules.

Brussels, 19/01/2005 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the  European Commission decided to fine Akzo Nobel, Atofina (now known as Arkema) and Hoechst a total of € 216.91 for operating a cartel in the market for Monochloroacetic Acid (MCAA). MCAA is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture
of detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and thickeners used in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The fines are broken down as follows:  Akzo Nobel € 84.38 m, Atofina € 58.5 m, and Hoechst € 74.03 m. Swiss company Clariant  received full immunity for being the first to provide evidence of the existence of the cartel to the Commission.

TD
From at least 1984 to 1999, the producers of  MCAA allocated volume quotas and customers, agreed price increases, exchanged information on sales volumes and prices to monitor the  cartel and agreed on a compensation mechanism to ensure implementation of the  cartel arrangements. The participants met regularly and engaged in other contacts to agree and implement the activities of the  cartel. The Commission considered the infringement to be a very serious one due to its nature. In fixing the amount
of the fine the Commission took account of the value of the EEA market for the product, the duration of the infringement, the individual weight of the companies in the infringement, their overall size and the fact that Atofina and Hoechst had previously been sanctioned for similar infringements. The  Commission also had regard to the cooperation given under the  Commission's Leniency Notice by some of the companies involved. n. Atofina and  Akzo were granted reductions of 40% and 25% respectively for the information they provided. As a result, the  Commission imposed the following  fines.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes commented, “The  Commission cannot and will not tolerate price fixing  and market sharing.  I will not allow companies to carve up the Single Market amongst themselves and so deny customers the benefits to which they are entitled. The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities and companies that engage in cartels will be fined heavily. Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the fines as a deterrent.”

HD       EU Imposes Fines on MCAA Cartel

The European Commission has imposed hefty  fines on three producers of  MCAA (monochloroacetic acid), an organic chemical used as an intermediate in the production of various cosmetics, medicines and glues. Hoechst (Germany, an affiliate of French Sanofi-Aventis), Atofina (now part of Arkema, a French firm formerly known as Total) and  Akzo Nobel (Netherlands) have been fined 74m euro (US$95.85m), 58.5m  euro and 85m euro, respectively. Hoechst stopped producing MCAA in 1997,
when it sold the business to Clariant  (Switzerland).  Clariant, which with the other three companies controls more than 90% of the European MCAA market, blew the whistle on the  cartel, which reportedly allocated specific customers with fixed prices.

TD
Significance: Sanofi-Aventis promptly published a statement that the 74m  euro fine was already included as a potential risk in the company's accounts and will therefore have no noticeable impact on operating performance. It is unclear at this stage whether  Akzo Nobel will choose to appeal the Commission's penalty. No action is expected from Atofina, which, according to UK newspaper The Guardian, had its penalty reduced for co-operating the  Commission.

Three European chemical groups - Akzo Nobel, Hoechst and Atofina - were yesterday  fined a total Euros 217m (Dollars 282m) by the European Commission, after Brussels found them guilty of running a cartel and fixing prices.

Akzo Nobel was ordered to pay  Euros 84.38m, while Hoechst - which now belongs to Sanofi-Aventis - must pay Euros 74.03m. Atofina, which is now known as  Arkema, must pay Euros 58.5m. A fourth member of the cartel, Clariant, escaped without a  fine because it was the first company to come forward with information on the group's dealings.

TD
The fines imposed against Hoechst and Atofina were substantially increased because the two had previously been found guilty of  cartel charges in other cases.
Yesterday's decision concerned an agreement to fix prices and share the market for  monochloroacetic
acids.
These chemicals are widely used in detergents, adhesives and thickeners used in foods and cosmetics. The cartel lasted at least between 1984 and 1999, the  Commission said.
During that time "the producers allocated volume quotas and customers agreed price increases, exchanged information on sales volumes and prices to monitor the cartel and agreed compensation mechanisms to ensure implementation of the  cartel arrange-ments", the Commission said.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said in a statement: "I will not allow companies to carve up the single market among themselves and so deny customers the benefits to which they are entitled. The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities and companies that engage in cartels will be  fined heavily." The companies can appeal against the decision, though none has yet decided to do so.

The European commission has fined three chemical groups euros 220m (pounds 153m) and granted immunity to a fourth for fixing the market for monochloroacetic acid, a widely used household and industrial chemical.

Hoechst, Atofina,  Akzo Nobel and Clariant  controlled more than 90% of the  euros 125m European market for the chemical, which is found in detergents, glues, drugs and cosmetics. It is also used as a thickener in some foods.

TD
The Swiss firm  Clariant  was given immunity for blowing the whistle on the meetings at which the four firms allocated volumes and customers, and agreed prices. Hoechst's and Atofina's  fines were increased as they had already been  fined for similar offences but the fine on Atofina (now part of Arkema, the French firm formerly called Total) was later cut by 40% to euros 58.5m for cooperating with the Competition  Commission.

Hoechst, which is now part of the French firm Sanofi-Aventis, was  fined euros 74m; and the Dutch group Akzo Nobel was fined euros 85m.

BRUSSELS:
The European Commission on Wednesday fined three major European chemical companies nearly
217 million for colluding to fix prices in the market for a compound commonly used in detergents, glues
and thickeners, the latest in a string of chemical industry cartels to be quashed by the EU regulator.

TD
The Dutch chemicals group  Akzo Nobel; Atofina of France, which is now known as  Arkema; and Hoechst of Germany secretly set prices and agreed not to compete against one other for sales of the widely used chemical monochloroacetic acid, or MCAA, from about 1984 to 1999, the  commission said.

The cartel is one of about a dozen in the global chemicals industry that EU and U.S. regulators have moved to quash in the past five years. Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have been conducting a running battle to bring the industry into line. But as one case ends others emerge, often involving the same companies.

The commission said that it was losing its patience with repeat offenders. "Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the  fines as a deterrent," said the competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes.

Akzo Nobel was fined last month for participating in a  cartel to fix the price of vitamin B4, commonly used as an animal growth stimulant.

Last year, the  commission fined four chemical companies, including Hoechst, a total of 138.4 million, or $179.8 million, for participating in a  cartel that fixed the price of sorbates, a type of food additive, over a period of 17 years.

A year earlier, Atofina was one of five companies  fined by the commission for running a cartel in the market for organic peroxides, which are used in the manufacture of plastic and rubber. Akzo was also involved but escaped a  fine because it reported the  cartel to the authorities.
Hoechst's MCAA business was bought by the Swiss company  Clariant  in 1997. Clariant  reported the
cartel to the commission and also avoided being fined.

Akzo was fined 84.4 million, Hoechst 74 million and Atofina 58.5 million.

The fines are the largest since 2001, when eight chemicals companies were  fined a record 855 million by the commission for colluding in a dozen different vitamin markets.
Sanofi-Aventis, which took over Hoechst last year through its acquisition of  Clariant, said that the
German unit is considering appealing the  commission's cartel ruling.

"Hoechst sold its  MCAA business to Clariant  AG in 1997 and has no longer been active in this business since that time," the company said.

Hans Wijers,  Akzo's chairman, said in a statement that he regretted the firm's past abuses of  European competition law. "It angers me that we have to deal with another anticompetition issue of this kind," he said, adding that there would be "zero tolerance" for employees involved in cartels in the future.

[HH] EU  fines 3 chemical firms 217 mln  euros for cartel:
Three major European chemicals firms, Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst, were on Wednesday  fined
217 million euros ($283.5 million) by the European Commission for fixing prices on a widely used
chemical. Hoechst of Germany was fined 74.03 million euros, Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands 84.38
million and Atofina -- the chemical branch of Total of France now known as  Arkema -- 58.5 million. The
chemical, monochloroacetic acid, is used in food, detergents, adhesives, drugs and cosmetics.

[HH] Fini: EU Stability Pact must be flexible:

Reform of the  European Union's Stability and Growth Pact must make the bloc's budget rules more flexible, Italian Foreign Minister Gianfranco Fini said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday. “It must be given more flexibility to improve growth," Fini told French daily Le Monde. "Perhaps we could envisage taking into account the public deficit not on a year by year basis but over a three-year cycle. On Tuesday, EU finance ministers set aside differences to report positive preliminary talks on the EU's budgetary rules, leaving the hard bargaining for later while keeping their sights on a deal by March.
[HH] Norway says energy pact with UK ready soon:

A long-awaited energy treaty between Norway and Britain is likely to be finalized and ready for signing soon, a spokesman for the Norwegian Oil and Energy Ministry said on Wednesday. “There are still some small matters that need to be cleared up," spokesman Lars Nermoen said. No firm date has been set for signing the treaty, but Nermoen said it would be "soon." Norwegian Oil and Energy Minister Thorhild Widvey told a conference on Tuesday that Norway and Britain had reached an agreement on a framework treaty, which is for cross-border energy cooperation in the North Sea.
[HH] Morocco's parliament Okays US free trade pact:

Morocco's bicameral parliament approved a free-trade accord with the United States, paving the way for its implementation in two months, a spokesman said on Wednesday. The approval brings Washington closer to its goal of sealing a free trade agreement covering most of the Middle East and North Africa by
2013. Morocco, a staunch U.S. ally, is the second Arab state after Jordan to reach such a deal. Bahrain is about to adopt a similar accord.

HD        EC's antitrust body fines MCAA chemicals cartel $284-mil

The European Commission's Antitrust body  fined Akzo Nobel, Atofina (now known as Arkema) and Hoechst a total of Eur216.91-mil ($284-mil) for operating a  cartel in the monochloroacetic acid market, according a statement released by the EC Jan 19.

The level of fines confirms the  Commission's determination to crack down on companies entering into cartels. Akzo Nobel was fined Eur84.38-mil,  Arkema was fined Eur58.5-mil, and Hoechst was  fined Eur74.03-mil. The  fines on Arkema and Hoechst were increased substantially, as both had previously been fined for similar illegal behavior.

"The Commission cannot and will not tolerate  price fixing  and market sharing.  I will not allow companies to carve up the Single Market amongst themselves and so deny customers the benefits to which they are entitled. The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities and companies that engage
in cartels will be fined heavily. Where companies have repeatedly violated the EU's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing the fines as a deterrent," Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

The Commission's investigation was triggered by information brought to its attention by one of the cartels' participants, in return for immunity under the EC's antitrust leniency program.

The EC found that  Akzo, Arkema, Hoechst, and  Clariant  (after it took over Hoechst's MCAA business in 1997) had colluded in secret to share the market and fix prices for  MCAA in the European Economic Area market. Together, the companies involved controlled over 90% of the EEA market for MCAA. In
1998, the last full year of the infringement, the EEA market was worth about Eur125-mil. MCAA is used in the manufacture of detergents, adhesives, textile auxiliaries and thickeners used in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

Three European chemical firms have been  fined Euro 216.91 million for carving up the market for monochloroacetic acid (MCAA), a chemical used to make detergents, foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The European Commission set fines on Akzo Nobel, Atofina and Hoechst for running an illegal cartel from at least 1984 to 1999. EU regulators said the cartel controlled more than 90% of the European market, which was worth Euro 125 million in 1998. "The Commission cannot and will not tolerate price fixing  and market sharing...  The fight against cartels is one of my top priorities and companies that engage in cartels will be fined heavily", said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Dutch company Akzo Nobel will have to pay  Euro 84.38 million. French oil company Total's chemical unit
Atofina (now known as  Arkema) was ordered to pay Euro 58.5 million. German firm Hoechst - now part
of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis - was fined Euro 74.03 million. The  Commission said the fines on
Atofina (see 2828) and Hoechst (see 2808) were increased substantially as both had been fined before
for running a cartel.

The cartel was exposed by Swiss chemicals group Clariant  which received full immunity under the Commission's antitrust leniency programme. The Commission investigation found that the companies met regularly and kept in close contact to allocate volume quotas and customers, agree price increases, exchange information on sales volumes and prices to monitor the  cartel, and agree on a compensation mechanism to make sure the  cartel's arrangements were carried out.

Atofina and  Akzo supplied information to regulators. In return, Atofina's received a 50% discount and Akzo's fine was cut by 25%. Akzo said in a statement it was angry at the size of the  fine. "Since we cooperated extensively with the European authorities, we feel aggrieved about the huge amount of this Euro 84 million fine. We will study the argumentation behind it to see whether the calculation is fair”, said Akzo chairman Hans Wijers. The company said it launched a competition law compliance programme in January 2000. In December 2004, it was  fined Euro 20.99 million for taking part in an animal feed  cartel (see 2920).

The European Commission recently fined Akzo Nobel, Hoechst (Sanofi-Aventis) and  Arkema (formerly Atofina) EUR 216.91 M for having run a monochloroacetic acid price-fixing cartel between 1984-1999 when they controlled 90% of the European market. Monochloroacetic acid is a chemical intermediate used in the production of detergents, adhesives, textile chemicals and thickeners used in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Akzo Nobel was fined EUR 84.38 M and Arkema and Hoechst EUR 58.5 M and EUR 74.03 M respectively. Clariant, which was also involved in the cartel, was given total immunity for being the first company to cooperate with the  Commission's enquiry. Cooperation from Atofina and Akzo Nobel earned them reductions 40% and 25% respectively in the amount they were fined. Akzo and Hoechst may appeal against the  fines.

* Nova's $110-Million Tax Settlement

Nova Chemicals says it expects to receive a cash payment of approximately $110 million following the resolution of a dispute over the deductibility of foreign taxes prior to 1982. It will be received from an affiliate of a company in which Nova previously had an interest, it says. Nova expects to record an
after-tax gain of approximately $91 million in fourthquarter 2004 results as a result.
* DuPont Photomasks Shuts Facility

DuPont Photomasks says it will close its Kokomo, IN photomask facility by the end of June, resulting in the loss of 10O jobs, about 6% of its total. It is the company's oldest production site, and the market for its products has declined, DuPont Photomasks says. The company says that it expects to record pre-tax charges of $11 million-$13 million related to the closure. Toppan recently made an offer to acquire DuPont Photomasks (CW, Oct. 13, 2004, p. 8).
* Lansco Acquires International Color

Lansco Colors (Montvale, NJ) says it has acquired International Color & Chemical (South San Francisco, CA). Terms were not disclosed. Privately held Lansco says it is the leading supplier of pigments from Asia to North America. Privately held ICC is a leading supplier of products to the flexographic ink industry, Lansco says.
* Rail Woes Force Cutbacks at Pioneer

Pioneer says weather-related rail service disruption on the West Coast forced the temporary shutdown of its Henderson, NV plant, disrupting supply of chlorine, caustic soda, hydrochloric  acid, and sodium hypochlorite. The company has also cut production at its 340,000-tons/ year chlor-alkali plant at Becancour, PQ, also because of rail service difficulties.
* Ineos Buys Foils Business from Solvay

Ineos says it has agreed to acquire Solvay's  euro62-million/year ($81 million) rigid plastic foils business for an undis-, closed amount. The business consists of two companies, Adriaplast (Monfalcone, Italy) and Caleppiovinil (Fucine di Ossana, Italy). They supply foils used for packaging to the consumer products, food, and pharmaceutical industries, Solvay says. The deal is expected to close by the end of this quarter. Buying the business will permit "downward integration" for Ineos's EVC polyvinyl chloride affiliate, lneos says. Separately, lneos says it has completed the acquisition of Rhodia's . U.K. sulfuric  acid business (CW, Dec. 1/8, 2004, p. 7). lneos is also buying Rhodia's U.K. chlor-alkali business; that deal is due to be completed on March 31, lneos says.

* Lanxess Agrees on Salary Savings

Lanxess says it has reached agreement with its staff on an "economy package to cut workforce expenses." The deal aims to generate savings of about  euro20 million ($26 million) in 2005, Lanxess says. It affects "payments made in excess of collectively agreed rates" to workers at the company's German sites, and will result in "significantly smaller budgets for salary increases this year for the company's overseas employees." Management staff in Germany will not receive a pay increase in 2005, Lanxess says. Lanxess will be spun off from Bayer and its shares listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange at the end of this month (CW, Jan. 5/12, p. 7).
* Henkel to Close Unit in France?

Henkel plans to close a powder detergents plant at Reims, France by 2006 with the loss of 195 jobs, according to French press reports last week. The closure forms part of a recently announced restructuring at Henkel, the reports say (CW, Dec. 1/8, 2004, p. 7). Henkel declined to comment on the reports.
* Dor, Bain Sell PP Films Stake

Dor Chemicals (Haifa, Israel) and private equity capital company Bain Capital say they have agreed to sell a 33.3% stake in oriented polypropylene (PP) films producer Dor Film to an undisclosed investor for $20 million. Dor and Bain will each hold 33.3% after the sale.
Celanese IPO Raises $800 Million

Celanese completed its initial public offering of 50 million shares of its common stock at $16/share last week, raising $800 million. Most of the proceeds are expected to go to private equity firm Blackstone Group (New York), which acquired an 84% stake in Celanese last year (CW, April 7, 2004, p. 11). Celanese had initially set the price at $19-$21/share, but faced resistance from buyers and analysts who
contended that the company was overvalued at that level. "We believe that Celanese would be generously valued at $l6/share, in line with where its competitors are trading," Fulcrum Global Partners (New York) analyst Frank Mitsch said in a research report issued before the IPO was completed. Mitsch estimated a fair price of $l4/share, citing Blackstone's remaining 60%-plus holding in Celanese, which will limit shareholder influence, as well as the lower dividend yield and higher debt load that Celanese carries compared to peers. Blackstone purchased an 84% stake in Celanese for  euro3.1 billion ($1.69 billion) including \ debt following a tender offer that took the company private early last year. Blackstone contributed roughly $650 million in equity toward the purchase, and financed the rest with debt.
Cargill to Assume Full Ownership of Cargill Dow

Cargill says it has agreed to acquire Dow Chemical's interest in Cargill Dow, the 50-50 joint venture formed in 1997 to commercialize polylactic  acid (PLA) polymers made from corn sugars. Terms were not disclosed. Cargill Dow spent $300 million to build a 300-million Ibs/year PLA plant at Blair, NE. The business has not performed as hoped, however, and Dow took a charge of $148 million in second-quarter
2004 to cover a loan guarantee for Cargill Dow. Former Dow business group president Kathleen Bader was named chairman and CEO of Cargill Dow earlier last year. Bader recently told CWthat Cargill Dow's sales rose 60% in the first nine months of 2004, compared to the prior-year period, and the number of customers has doubled in the past 18 months, but that the business is still not profitable (CW, Nov.
24,2004, p. 31).
Early-Reporting Specialty Firms Post Higher Earnings

Cytec Industries reported a near doubling of fourth-quarter net income, to $28 million (68 cts/share), excluding $17.1 million in one-time gains, compared to $14.6 million in the year-ago quarter, on sales up
25%, to $451 million. The consensus of analysts' estimates was 65 cts/share, according to First Call (Boston). The performance products division led earnings growth because of strong sales and improved operations, the company says. "Our strong sales momentum continued through the fourth quarter, although raw material and energy costs also continued their upward trend," says David Lilley, chairman, president, and CEO. oil and natural gas costs have not subsided, and many of Cytec's raw materials, including propylene, are in short supply, Lilley says. Cytec's propylene supplier recently Announced force majeure and Cytec expects to be on allocation of about 85% for up to six months, he says. "We are
reviewing the impact of this curtailment and its potential effect on downstream products on Cytec, although we do not expect a significant impact from this on our first-quarter results," Lilley says. The outlook for global demand remains positive, he adds. Cytec says its acquisition of UCB's surface specialties business has been postponed to February because the FTC has requested additional information. 3M, meanwhile, reported net income up 15%, to $720 million, on sales up 8%, to $5.1 billion. Adhesives operating income jumped 29%, to $468 million, on sales up 10%, to $2.1 billion.

GE says operating profits at GE Advanced Materials-which includes GE Plastics, GE Silicones, and GE Quartz-rose 23%, to $247 million in the fourth quarter. Revenues at Advanced Materials were up 21%, to
$2.33 billion. Profit recovery was driven by price increases, GE says. Average selling prices at GE Plastics were up 26%, compared to the year-ago quarter. Operating profits at Infrastructure, which includes GE's water treatment operations, advanced 30%, to $170 million; water treatment revenues were up 19%. GE says it expects strong performance at both units to continue in the first quarter. It forecasts revenue growth of approximately 20% and profit growth of more than 20% at Infrastructure; and revenue growth of 20%, and operating profits growth of more than 50% at Advanced Materials.

Europe Fines Akzo, Arkema, Hoechst for  MCAA Price-Fixing

The European Commission says it has fined Akzo Nobel, Arkema, and Hoechst a combined euro216.91 million ($283 million) for conspiring to fix the price of monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) "from at least 1984 to 1999." Akzo was handed the biggest  fine, euro84.38 million; Hoechst was fined euro74.03 million; and Arkema was fined euro58.5 million. Clariant, which acquired Hoechst's MCAA business in 1997 and alerted the commission to the price-fixing cartel in 1999, was not  fined. Hoechst today is a subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis. Arkema, part of the Total group, was  fined because of the involvement of its predecessor Atofina in the cartel. Total dissolved Atofina last year and split off some of its businesses, including MCAA, to create Arkema. The U.S. Department of Justice earlier  fined Akzo,
Atofina, and Hoechst for fixing MCAA prices in the U.S., and jailed an executive from each company (CW, June 12, 2002, p. 10). The commission fined Akzo last month for its involvement in a choline chloride price-fixing cartel (CW, Dec. 15, 2004, p. 7). It also  fined Atofina and Hoechst in 2003 for their involvement in price-fixing cartels for organic peroxides and sorbates, respectively. "Where companies have repeatedly violated the  European Union's antitrust rules, I will keep increasing  fines as a deterrent," says European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes.  Akzo, Arkema, and Hoechst say they may appeal the fines.
Rhodia Starts Legal Proceedings Against Sanofi-Aventis

Rhodia confirms that it has "started litigation or preliminary legal proceedings in the U.S. and Brazil against Sanofi-Aventis to obtain compensation for environmental liabilities" at Rhodia's Silver Bow, MT and Cubatáo, Brazil sites (CW, Jan. 5/12, p. 7). The estimated cost of cleaning up the Silver Bow site is $50 million-$100 million, Rhodia says. Rhodia inherited the sites from Rhône-Poulenc (RP), which merged with Hoechst in 1999 to create Aventis. Production at both sites ceased before Rhodia was spun off from RP in
1998. Aventis merged last year with Sanofi-Synthélabo to create Sanofi-Aventis, which owns 15% of
Rhodia. Sanofi-Aventis says it has no legal obligation to share the costs of cleaning up the sites, citing a
2003 agreement between Aventis and Rhodia to settle all outstanding claims related to a 1998
environmental indemnification accord between the two companies. Sanofi-Aventis says it "considers the
matter closed and intends to vigorously defend its position." Meanwhile, Rhodia says it plans to include an
additional euro70-million ($91 million) provision in its accounts for expected environmental liabilities
between 2010 and 2020.
Fuji Photo Film Acquires U.K.-Based Inks Producer

Fuji Photo Film Co. (Tokyo) says it has agreed to acquire inks manufacturer Sericol (Broadstairs, U.K.) from private equity capital company Saratoga Partners (New York) for about £123 million ($230 million) in cash. Fuji Photo, the biggest manufacturer of photographic film, expects to complete the deal by the end of February. Sericol says it makes inks for industrial inkjets and screen-printing, and has production in six countries. Fuji Photo says the deal forms part of plans to increase the company's industrial printing sales from ¥240 billion/year ($2.3 billion), to ¥300 billion/year by 2008. Saratoga acquired Sericol from BP in
2003. Fuji acquired Arch Chemicals' microelectronic materials business last year (CW, Dec. 1/8, 2004, p.
9).
Avecia Spins out Pharmaceutical Technology

Avecia says it plans to spin off part of its pharmaceutical technologies portfolio into a new joint venture, Reaxa. The business will be jointly owned by Avecia; Cambridge University (Cambridge, U.K) professor and entrepreneur Steven Ley; an undisclosed private equity capital company; and Reaxa's management team. Avecia will transfer to Reaxa its award-winning PD EnCat encapsulated palladium catalyst technology and product family for the manufacture of pharma intermediates. Reaxa will focus on developing technology in supported reagents and catalysts, and on development services. It aims to sell
its services to the pharma and  fine chemical sectors, says Peter Jackson, v.p./pharmaceutical products at
Avecia, who will also become CEO of Reaxa. Reaxa predicts sales of more than $20 million/year within
4-5 years. The business will have dedicated commercial, manufacturing, and R&D facilities at Avecia's
Manchester, U.K. headquarters. Avecia unveiled Reaxa at the Informex expo in Las Vegas last week (p.
31).

The European Commission has fined Akzo Nobel, Arkema, and Hoechst a total of EUR 216.91 M for
price fixing  in monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) "from at least 1984 to 1999."  Akzo was fined EUR 84.38
M, Hoechst EUR 74.03 M; and Arkema EUR 58.5 M. Clariant, which took over Hoechst's MCAA
business in 1997 and first warned the commission of the cartel, was not fined. Arkema was fined
because its forerunner Atofina was involved in the cartel. Akzo, Arkema, and Hoechst say they may
appeal against the  fines

Fines totalling EUR 217 M have been imposed by the European Commission on three chemical groups, Akzo Nobel, Hoechst, and Arkema for participating in cartel and price fixing  activities from 1984 to 1999 over mono chloroacetic acids. Akzo Nobel was ordered to pay EUR 84.38 M, Hoechst, which now
belongs to Sanofi-Aventis was fined EUR 74.03 M, and Atofina, now known as  Arkema, will pay EUR
58.5 M. Clariant, the fourth member, was not charged because it provided information to the commission.
The fines for Atofina and Hoechst were raised for similar previous action. The companies were found to
allocate volume quotas and exchanged information on sales volumes and prices. Mono chloroacetic  acid
is commonly used in detergents, adhesives and thickeners for foods and cosmetics.

HD          Commission issues cartel charges HYDROGEN PEROXIDE. BY          By TOBIAS BUCK

The European Commission has issued formal charges against 18 companies in the chemical sector, accusing them of operating a  cartel in the market for hydrogen peroxide and similar substances.

The companies charged include Total of France, Degussa of Germany,  Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands, Solvay of Belgium and Kemira of Finland.

TD
A spokesman for the  Commission said: "I can confirm that we have sent a statement of objections (the formal charge-sheet) to Kemira and 17 other  European producers of hydrogen peroxide and its downstream products.

"This statement of objections follows an investigation into allegations that (the companies) agreed on prices, exchanged information on product and sales volumes, agreed on the reduction of production capacity and monitored each other's implementation of this agreement."
Hydrogen peroxide is a substance used widely for bleaching, cosmetics and water treatment.

The 18 companies now have two months to react to the charges, after which the  Commission will decide whether to  fine the groups.

Brussels can impose fines of up to 10 per cent of a company's annual global turnover, though it is rare for the Commission to demand the maximum.

In addition, the company that first came forward with information on the  cartel receives immunity, while others can receive a reduced  fine if they co-operate.

However, the  Commission can also increase penalties for repeat offenders, and with the chemical industry often at the heart of  cartel probes, this could well happen in the latest case.

Akzo Nobel, for example, was found guilty of involvement in a  cartel only this month, a decision that in turn followed a string of probes into  European and international chemical groups, many of which have resulted in substantial  fines.

Earlier this month, the Commission found three European chemical producers - Akzo Nobel, Hoechst and Atofina - guilty of operating a cartel in the market for monochloroacetic acids. The three companies were fined a total of Euros 217m (Dollars 283m).

The chemical industry was also the subject of the biggest cartel fine ever imposed by the EU regulator. In 2001, Brussels ordered eight vitamin producers to pay fines totalling  Euros 855.2m.
The leading conspirators, Roche of Switzerland and Germany's BASF, had to pay  Euros 462m and
Euros 296m respectively.

HD     Getting in a Fix

You would have thought that the series of high-profile antitrust investigations involving chemical firms in the late 1990s-not to mention the hefty  fines they received-would have deterred  price fixing.  Apparently not. DuPont Dow Elastomers, a 50-50 joint venture of DuPont and Dow Chemical, was recently  fined $84 million 'for its role in a conspiracy to fix the price of polychloroprene synthetic rubber that lasted from 1999 until 2002. It is the first action in an ongoing probe of  price fixing  in the polychloroprene industry, says the Department of Justice (DOJ).

TD
DuPont Dow says it will also pay an undisclosed amount to settle a federal class-action antitrust lawsuit related to ethylene propylene diene monomer, another synthetic rubber. DOJ is also believed to be pursuing a price-fixing probe in that sector. These are just the latest in a series of cases filed against companies in the synthetic rubber and rubber chemicals markets involving Bayer, Crompton, Zeon Chemicals, and others, that have yielded more than $200 million in  fines, DOJ says.

The European commission, meanwhile, recently  fined Akzo Nobel, Arkema, and Hoechst a combined euro;216 million ($283 million) for conspiring to fix the price of monochloracetic acid (MCAA). Clariant, which acquired Hoechst's  MCAA business in 1997, blew the whistle on that cartel. Akzo was previously fined for its involvement in a choline chloride  cartel; and Hoechst, and Arkema's predecessor Atofina, were fined in 2003 for participating in cartels for sorbates and organic peroxides, respectively.

The financial cost can be even higher as firms lay themselves open to class-action lawsuits. A group of vitamin makers that were convicted of  price fixing  in the late 1990s had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle cases brought by customers and states. DuPont, which is assuming the liability for the DuPont Dow Elastomers case, is taking a charge of $118 million in its first-quarter accounts to cover antitrust litigation losses. There is also a big personal cost in the form of  fines and possible jail time for many of those involved in such cases.

Then there is also the long-term damage to a company's reputation and its relationship with its customers. Bob Wood, who was named CEO of Crompton last year, says he found relationships with some
customers to be "tense" because of the company's previous involvement in  price fixing.  Crompton terminated or disciplined those involved in  price fixing,  introduced a training program in corporate compliance and business ethics, set up a hotline to deal with any concerns, and also appointed an ethics and compliance officer.

Few firms have been as open as Crompton about how they are dealing with  price-fixing problems. DuPont Dow says it is "moving forward to serve customers with a commitment to the highest standards of ethical and legal compliance," but declined to give further details. However, DuPont and Dow already have detailed business ethics policies that should have also been in place at DuPont Dow. The chemical industry's desire to improve its reputation must extend to its business practices, as well as its
environmental health and safety performance.

The recent wave of cartel cases in the EU chemical industry is set to continue in the coming months, lawyers say. The European Commission this week (1 February) sent formal warnings to 18 companies for suspected price fixing  on hydrogen peroxide and last week  fined Akzo Nobel and two other companies a massive 217 million  euro for operating a  cartel in acid thickening-agents used in industry.

Cartel activity in the chemicals industry is relatively common because of the small number of big players who all know each other and because they have to bargain with large clients trying to get their profit margins right.

TD
The Commission’s Leniency Notice - which lets the first company to inform the Brussels executive about a cartel off the hook - has made it much more attractive for firms to shop their competitors. "It’s big," says one Brussels lawyer acting for several chemical companies. "Once one case comes up companies start looking at other parts of their business and they stumble upon other cartels. We’re going to see more and more of these cases."

The European Commission is to open an enquiry into a hydrogen peroxide  price-fixing cartel which involved 18 producers between 1994-2001. The companies, who are also suspected of fixing production quantities, have been contacted and must reply within 2 months. Kemira, Solvay, Arkema and Akzo Nobel have all confirmed receipt of a communication from the Commission. Akzo Nobel was recently fined $84.3 M by the Commission for its part in a monochloracetic acid cartel and EUR 20.1 M for having participated in a vitamin B4 cartel.

HD       Akzo Nobel Posts 9% Drop in Pharma Sales for 2004, Amid Acquisition Speculation

Global Insight Perspective
Significance Falling pharmaceutical sales have dragged down
Akzo's group performance in 2004, although pharma has retained its margin, despite falling revenues.
Implications Pharmaceuticals are due to benefit from increased investment in
2005. However, failure to restore pharma sales growth in the course of 2005 could make some pharmaceuticals units (especially Active Ingredients) convenient targets for future divestment programmes.
Outlook      Income from the planned divestment of chemicals in 2005 would be used to pay anti-trust penalties recently incurred by the company, although
a large share of the funds is expected to be spent on the acquisition of new technology - or, potentially, a small company. Akzo has not indicated where the acquisitions will be, but Global Insight believes they are most likely to
be in the area of pharmaceuticals - especially high-margin finished pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

Disappointing Results for  Akzo in 2004...

TD
Dutch chemicals and pharmaceutical company  Akzo Nobel has posted relatively disappointing results, with its Pharmaceuticals division leading the way in terms of year-on-year sale decline. The company as a whole posted sales of 12.7bn  euro (US$16.18bn) in 2004, marking a 3% year-on-year contraction. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell by 10% to 1.21bn  euro (US$1.54bn), as the company's autonomous 2% sales growth failed to compensate for negative currency effects and divestments. Net income grew by 42% year-on-year to 856m euro (US$1.09bn), despite the decline in sales, as the company had a non-recurrent gain of 86m euro (US$109.58m), resulting from restructuring charges,
anti-trust provision and the chemicals divestment programme.

Akzo Nobel: 2004 Performance (euro) Pharmaceuticals Coatings           Chemicals
2004            2003               2004              2003              2004
2003
Sales           3.25bn (US$4.14bn) 3.55bn (US$4.52bn) 5.25bn (US$6.69bn)
5.16bn (US$6.57bn) 4.31bn (US$5.49bn) 4.47bn (US$5.69bn)
EBIT            522m (US$665m)     692m (US$882m)    421m (US$536m)    414m
(US$527m)     354m (US$451m)     341m (US$434m) Source: Akzo Nobel

Pharmaceuticals were single-handedly responsible for  Akzo's overall sales decline. When pharmaceutical sales are considered in isolation, the year-on-year sales decline is a staggering 9%. Generic competition for anti-depressant Remeron (mirtazapine), throughout the year in the US and during H2 in Europe, was chiefly responsible for the decline.  Akzo has not yet released product sales figures for the full year, but the company's statement indicates that sales of fertility/hormone treatment products Puregon (follitropin beta) and Livial (tibolone) rebounded in the second quarter. Sales of the innovative contraceptive NuvaRing (etonogestrel/ethinylestradiol) doubled year-on-year, after a slow start after launch.

Given the sales decline in Pharmaceuticals, the division's 2004 performance would have been much worse were it not for  Akzo's radical restructuring efforts, which saw the company's pharmaceuticals unit Organon and active ingredients unit Diosynth combined into one entity. Aggressive cost-cutting allowed Akzo to retain its return on sales for the Pharmaceutical division at 16%, despite the 9% sales decline.
...but Acquisitions and Divestments Ahead

Akzo Nobel said in a statement that the divestment of several more chemicals units is planned for 2005. The units include Ink and Adhesive Resins, Oleochemicals, Salt Specialties, PVC Additives, Solar Salt Australia and Methyl Amines/Choline Chloride, and generated combined sales of 750m  euro (US$955.63m) in 2004.

Meanwhile the company's Chief Financial Officer Rob Frohn reportedly told Dow Jones that  Akzo plans to spend 100m euro-200m euro (US$127.42m-US$254.84m) on acquisitions in 2005.
Outlook and Implications

Despite its falling sales during 2004, the Pharmaceuticals division still produces a higher return on sales than the company's Chemicals and Coatings businesses. While seeking to retain a strong presence in the more profitable aspects of these businesses, especially in areas where it is the global leader,  Akzo is expected to turn its attention to the pharma business in the current year; pharma is likely to be given 12 more months to turn the corner and restore sales growth. Failure to do so would probably result in the divestment of some of the less-profitable pharmaceuticals units - starting with Active Ingredients. At the same time, Akzo is expected to boost its R&D spending on high-margin sectors such as finished pharmaceuticals and biotechnology (through its very own biotech unit, which is currently developing 'flu vaccines). In light of these, the acquisition of pharmaceutical technology or a smaller pharma company is likely in 2005. The divestment of the chemicals units planned for 2005 would provide some much needed revenue for pharmaceutical R&D, although some of the funds will have to be spent on the payment of a recently imposed 84m euro (US$107.03m)  fine from the European Commission, for breaching competition law in the European Mono Chloroacetic Acid (MCAA) market between 1984 and 1999.

The European Commission has continued its campaign against antitrust activities in  European Union (EU) chemical markets and issued charges against 18 companies involved in a suspected conspiracy to fix the price of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and of its derivatives  sodium  perborate and sodium pcrcarbonate. The commission has sent a "statement of objections" to the companies, which it says include Akzo Nobel, Arkema, Degussa, Kemira, and Solvay. All of those companies have confirmed receipt of the statement of objections.

The move follows an investigation into allegations that the companies conspired to fix H^sub 2^O^sub 2^ and derivatives prices between 1994 and 2001, the  commission, says. The  commission raided offices of the companies in 2003 as part of the investigation, it says. NonEuropean producers of H^sub 2^O^sub
2^ include FMC and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical.

The companies have two months to respond to the commission's charges, after which the  commission will decide whether to  fine them. It has the power to impose fines of up to 10% of a company's annual sales. Neelie Kroes, who last year was appointed European competition commissioner, says she intends to impose heavy cartel fines to deter antitrust activities in the EU, and particularly to punish repeat offenders.

Akzo has been fined twice in the past two months for price fixing.  The commission fined the company euro84.38 million ($110 million) for its participation in a monochloroacetic acid (MCAA) price-fixing cartel, and euro20.99 million for its involvement in a choline chloride cartel (CW, Jan. 26, p. 7). Akzo included a euro500 -million provision to cover  cartel fines in its second-quarter 2004 accounts, and a euro600 -million provision for  cartel fines in its fourth-quarter accounts.

The commission fined Arkema euro58.5 million for the involvement of the company's predecessor Atofina in the MCAA cartel. It also fined Akzo, Atofina, and Degussa in 2003 for their participation in a price-fixing cartel for organic peroxides. The commission fined Degussa in 2002 for its involvement in a methionine cartel. -IAN YOUNG

Arkema has already been fined EUR 58.5 M for the involvement of its predecessor Atofina in an MCAA cartel. Fines were also imposed on Degussa,  Akzo and Atofina during 2003 for
fixing the price of organic peroxides. Degussa has also been penalised for being involved in a methionine
cartel.

The European Commission has imposed fines on three chemical groups, Akzo Nobel, the Hochst division of Sanofi-Aventis, and Arkema, after they were found to be engaged in cartel and price fixing activities of mono chloroacetic acids (MCAA) and animal feed vitamins from 1984 to 1999. Akzo Nobel has received a penalty of EUR 84.4 M, Hoechst, which now belongs to Sanofi-Aventis, was fined EUR 74
M, and Atofina, now known as  Arkema, will have to pay EUR 58.5 M. Clariant, which was also involved, was not charged because it supplied information to the commission. The fines for Arkema and Hochst were increased for similar previous action while those of Arkema and Akzo Nobel were reduced by 40% and 25% respectively since the two cooperated with the investigation. MCAA is commonly used in detergents, textiles, plastics, adhesives and thickeners for foods and cosmetics.
