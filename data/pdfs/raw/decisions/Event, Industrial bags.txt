By Sabina Zawadzki and David Lawsky

BRUSSELS, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected to find on Wednesday that a group of European makers of industrial plastic  bags had acted as a cartel, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday.
The full 25-member  Commission is expected to act on Wednesday on a recommendation from
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

The bags, usually made out of polyethylene, are purchased by industry to package everything from fertilizers and animal feed to building materials. The  Commission raided the bagmakers  several years ago.

The members of the  cartel fixed prices, allocated market shares, quotas, customers and deliveries, exchanged information and agreed on the way to calculate prices, the source said.
The Commission is expected to list companies that were involved in the  cartel as Bischof+Klein GmbH
& Co, UPM-Kymmene Oyj , Combipac BV, Plasticos Espanoles SA (Aspla) and Armando Alvarez.
Also listed are Sachsa Verpackung GmbH, Nordfolien GmbH, FLS Plast et FLSmidth & Co , Kendrion NV
and Groupe Gascogne .

Other members the  Commission will list are Bonar Technical Fabrics NV and Low & Bonar PLC , British Polythene Industries PLC , Stempher BV and Koninklijke Verpakkingsindustrie Stempher CV, Trioplast Industrier and Bernay Film.
Companies can face fines of up to 10 percent of annual turnover for  cartel violations.

In some cases, firms may cooperate with the  Commission or turn in other members of the  cartel and receive reduced fines or no fines at all.
This investigation started when BPI applied for immunity from  fines, the source said.

Sometimes one company purchases another, only to find that the purchased company was a member of a cartel. In that case, it sometimes reports the  cartel to the Commission.
A Commission spokesman had no comment.

BRUSSELS, Nov 29, 2005 (DJCS via Comtex) --
A company making plastic bags involved in a price-fixing probe said Tuesday it expects  European
regulators to reach a decision by the end of the year.

TD
British Polythene Industries PLC (BPI.LN), "is expecting some outcome from the investigation by the end of the year," said spokeswoman Caroline Wells.

A Reuters report late Monday, citing a source familiar with the situation, said regulators are expected to find Wednesday that the  plastic bag makers had operated a  cartel. It identified more than a dozen companies including UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM), Bischof+Klein GmbH & Co, Combipac BV, Plasticos Espanoles and Armando Alvaraz.

Regulators have the power to levy  fines up to 10% of a company's turnover for  cartel offenses. But the Reuters report didn't specify whether  fines would be imposed.

British Polythene said it didn't know the outcome of the probe. UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM) said it has been assisting the  Commission's investigation, but didn't know the outcome either.
The Commission was unavailable for comment.

European investigators launched the  plastic bag probe three years ago. The regulator sent "statements of objections" - similar in power and effect to a formal indictment - to the companies in April 2004.

The companies were given time to reply to the  Commission's findings and present arguments and evidence orally.

(Adds share prices)
BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A group of European makers of industrial plastic  bags was fined
290.71 million euros ($342 million) by the European Commission on Wednesday for operating a cartel.

TD
"The level of the fines confirms the  Commission's determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels," the Commission said in a statement. It is one of the biggest  fines ever imposed on a cartel by the EU.

The bags, usually made out of polyethylene, are purchased by industry to package everything from fertilizers and animal feed to building materials. The  Commission raided the bagmakers  several years ago.

The members of the  cartel fixed prices, allocated market shares, quotas, customers and deliveries, exchanged information and agreed on the way to calculate prices, the  Commission found, confirming what a source told Reuters on Monday.

The biggest  fine was 56.55 million  euros, levied against UPM-Kymmene Oyj . The company said it would review the decision and consider further measures.
UPM's shares were down 0.6 percent to 15.92  euros in afternoon trading. It did not receive a reduction in its  fine as others did.
The Commission said it entirely eliminated a planned 52.95 million  euro fine against British Polythene Industries because it was "the first to provide the  Commission with the decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence which allowed inspections (raids) to be organised."
BPI's share price jumped 3.3 percent in afternoon trading to to 436-1/2 pence and its chairman,
Cameron McLatchie, called the Commission decision "gratifying." But he noted the EU still has open an
investigation into an agricultural plastic  films cartel.

The Commission said explicit documents highlighted the operations of the  cartel, which often met when the companies got together as their professional association, Valveplast.

In one case, the firms wrote that they planned "to appoint a leader for each customer in order to coordinate the rise in prices".

In another case, a memo said that "this document and all those relating to Valveplast which indicate figures for allocating markets and prices must be destroyed".
Both price increases and allocation of markets and prices are at the heart of cartels. OTHER  FINES
Bernay Film Plastique was  fined 940,000 euros, with no reduction.

Bischof+Klein GmbH & Co. KG and Bischof+Klein France were  fined 29.15 and 3.96 million  euros, respectively, after a 25 percent reduction.

Bonar Technical Fabrics NV and Low & Bonar PLC were  fined 12.24 million euros, after a 10 percent reduction.
Low & Bonar said it considered the  fine disproportionate and would consider the possibility of an appeal. Cofira-Sac SA was  fined 350,000 euros, after a 25 percent reduction.
Fardem Packaging BV was  fined 34 million euros, with no reduction, sharing that  fine with Kendrion
NV.

Koninklijke Verpakkingsindustrie Stempher CV and Stempher BV were  fined 2.37 million euros, with no reduction.
Nordenia International AG was  fined 39.1 million euros, with no reduction, sharing the  fine with
Nordfolien GmbH, which had a 10 percent reduction.
Plasticos Espanoles SA and Armando Alvarez SA were  fined 42 million euros, with no reduction. RKW AG Rheinische Kunststoffwerke and JM Gesellschaft fuer industrielle Beteiligungen mbH & Co
KGaA were  fined 39 million euros, with no reduction.
Sachsa Verpackung GmbH and Groupe Gascogne were  fined 13.2 million euros, with no reduction. Trioplast Wittenheim SA and Trioplast Industrier AB got a 30 percent reduction down to a 17.85 million
euro fine. They share the  fine with FLSmidth & Co A/S and FLS Plast A/S, which won no reduction.

The European Commission Wednesday fined 16 firms a combined EUR290.7 million for operating a cartel in the market for industrial plastic  bags.

The companies colluded on prices and fixed sales quotas by geographical area, shared orders of large customers and organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, the  Commission said.

The regulator said the level of  fines confirmed its determination to crack down hard on firms taking part in cartels.

"Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalize firms that operate them," said
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.
Finnish company UPM-Kymmene Corp. (UPM) received the highest single  fine of EUR56.6 million. Spain's Armando Alvarez was penalized EUR42 million, Germany's Nordenia International AG
(NOD.YY) EUR39.1 million, Germany's RKW AG EUR39 million, and Bischof+Klein GmbH & Co.
EUR29.2 million.

The Netherland's Kendrion NV (38351.AE) was  fined EUR34 million. The remaining companies received smaller fines.

British Polythene Industries PLC (BPI.LN) was spared any  fine because it revealed the existence of the cartel to European regulators.

After regulators raided in 2002, they found documents showing the companies had operated a  cartel for more than 20 years, agreeing among themselves on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

Sales directors and managing directors made the illegal agreements, often at meetings of their professional association, called Valveplast.

The companies agreed to appoint a leader for each customer in order to coordinate the rise in prices, the commission said.
In 2001, it estimated that market for  industrial bags to be about EUR265 million.
The Commission encouraged any company that suffered damages as a result of the  cartel
operation to sue in their national court and seek damages. Any damages awarded would be imposed
in addition to the E.U.  fines.

BRUSSELS, Nov 30 (AFP) -
The European Union's competition watchdog sought Wednesday to snag a cartel of plastic industrial  
bag makers by slapping fines on 16 firms worth a combined 216 million euros (254 million dollars).

TD
The European Commission said the level of the  fines, the biggest in three years handed down from
Brussels regulators, confirmed its determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels.

"In this instance competitors, with a view to increasing their profits, agreed amongst themselves on prices and sales quotas by geographical area, shared the orders of large customers, organised collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, to the detriment of
competition, their customers and consumers," the  commission said.

Plastic industrial bags are used to pack various products, mainly of an  industrial nature, but also products destined for consumers, such as raw materials, fertilizer, agricultural products, animal feed and building materials.

"Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalise firms that operate them and so jeopardise the very basis of our market economy and harm consumers," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"I am sending a very clear message to company directors that such practices are unacceptable," she added.

The commission said that after surprise inspections of producers in June 2002 and the investigations that followed, it had determined that they had secretly agreed amongst themselves, some for over 20 years, on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

The companies colluded on prices and fixed sales quotas by geographical area, shared orders of large customers and organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, the  Commission said.

The regulator said the level of  fines confirmed its determination to crack down hard on firms taking part in cartels.

"Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalize firms that operate them," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

Finnish company UPM-Kymmene Corp. (UPM) received the highest single  fine of EUR56.6 million.

The Netherland's Kendrion NV (38351.AE) was  fined EUR34 million. The remaining companies received smaller fines.

British Polythene Industries PLC (BPI.LN) was spared any  fine because it revealed the existence of the cartel to European regulators.

After regulators raided in 2002, they found documents showing the companies had operated a cartel for more than 20 years, agreeing among themselves on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

Sales directors and managing directors made the illegal agreements, often at meetings of their professional association, called Valveplast.

The companies agreed to appoint a leader for each customer in order to coordinate the rise in prices, the  commission said.

The Commission encouraged any company that suffered damages as a result of the  cartel operation to sue in their national court and seek damages. Any damages awarded would be imposed in addition to the E.U.  fines.

Low & Bonar PLC -  European Commission Decision

TD
Low & Bonar PLC (the "Company") announced on 10 May 2004 that the Group was one of a number of groups which received a statement of objections from the  European Commission investigating allegations of a  cartel relating to  industrial bags, a market which the Group exited in 1997 following the sale of its Belgian packaging business to BPI.

Following the conclusion of its investigation the  European Commission today notified the Company of the European Commission's decision that the Company and Bonar Technical Fabrics N.V. infringed Article 81 of the European Commission Treaty. The  European Commission has imposed a fine of €12.24 million on the Group out of fines totalling €290 million. The Company and Bonar Technical Fabrics consider the amount of the fine to be disproportionate and will assess the
possibility of an appeal following receipt of details of the decision.

HD     EU slaps plastic industrial bag makers with Euro290-mil  fine (RESEND) WC     212 words

The European Union's competition watchdog sought Wednesday to breakup a cartel of plastic               industrial bag makers by slapping fines on 16 firms worth a combined Euro290-mil ($342-mil). The European Commission said the level of the  fines, the biggest in three years handed down from
Brussels regulators, confirmed its determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels. "In this instance competitors, with a view to increasing their profits, agreed amongst themselves on prices
and sales quotas by geographical area, shared the orders of large customers, organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, to the detriment of
competition, their customers and consumers," the  commission said. Plastic industrial bags are used to pack various products, including fertilizer, agricultural products, animal feed and building materials.

TD
"Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalize firms that operate them," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said. The  commission said that after surprise inspections of producers in June 2002 and the investigations that followed, it had determined that they had secretly agreed amongst themselves, some for over 20 years, on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

1801 GMT. Adding details)

TD
The European Commission has fined 16 firms Eur290.71-mil ($342-mil) for operating a cartel in the plastic  industrial bags market, the EC announced in a statement Wednesday. The cartel is a "clear violation of EC Treaty rules which forbid cartels and other restrictive business practices (Article 81)," the EC said. The EC said the level of the fines, reportedly the biggest in three years handed down by the Commission, "confirms the Commission's determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels." "In this instance competitors, with a view to increasing their profits, agreed amongst themselves on prices and sales quotas by geographical area, shared the orders of large customers, organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, to the detriment of competition, their customers and consumers," the Commission said. Plastic industrial        bags are used to pack various products, mainly of an industrial nature, but also products destined for consumers, such as raw materials, fertilizer, agricultural products, animal feed and building materials. "Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalize firms that operate them and so jeopardize the very basis of our market economy and harm consumers," Competition Commissioner
Neelie Kroes said. "I am sending a very clear message to company directors that such practices are unacceptable," Kroes said. The EC made "surprise inspections of producers in June 2002" on the basis of information brought by one of the members of the  cartel, British Polythene Industries. Investigations that followed showed that the  cartel "had secretly agreed amongst themselves, some for over 20 years, on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain," the EC said. Under the Commission's antitrust leniency arrangements, "BPI enjoyed full immunity for being the first to provide
the Commission with the decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence which allowed inspections to be organized," the EC said.




EXPLICIT DOCUMENT
Detailing its investigation, the EC said that "it was the sales directors

and even the managing directors, often at meetings of their professional association Valveplast, who agreed amongst themselves on various aspects of the  cartel. In a departure from its usual approach, the EC revealed several internal memos it seized during the inspections showing evidence not only that the agreements existed but that the producers were aware that their behavior was illegal. Below are two examples of memos seized: "It was subsequently decided to appoint a leader for each customer in order to coordinate the rise in prices," "In view of the risk taken in this type of meeting and the documentation passed on, this document and all those relating to VALVEPLAST which indicate figures for allocating markets and prices must be destroyed," Together, the producers concerned controlled most of the market in industrial bags in the countries covered by the  cartel. In 2001 the market in  industrial bags in these countries was estimated at some Eur265-mil.


FINES
The Commission regards this cartel as a very serious offence, it said in

Page 34 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the statement. In fixing the amount of the  fines, the Commission took account of the size of the market in the countries affected by the  cartel, the length of time the cartel had been operating, the relative weight of the firms involved and their global dimension. The cooperation offered by some companies that provided useful information for the exposure of the infringement was rewarded in accordance with the Commission's leniency notice. Several other firms had their  fines reduced in return for the information they provided.




ACTION FOR DAMAGES
Meanwhile, the EC announced that "any person or firm affected by

anti-competitive behaviour as described in this case may bring the matter before the courts of the Member States and seek damages, submitting elements of the published decision as evidence that the behaviour took place and was illegal." Even though the  Commission has fined the companies concerned, this does not absolved the companies from being slapped with damage claims, the EC said.




BPI REACTION
"It is gratifying that, after so many years of uncertainty, hard work and

co-operation with the  Commission, the Group has been granted full immunity," commented BPI's Chairman, Cameron McLatchie. "We hope that this marks the end of the matter. BPI is fully committed to ongoing compliance with competition law." The BPI Group has been involved in two separate inquiries by the EC into infringements of competition law. The first inquiry into BPI and a number of its competitors was initiated by the  Commission in August 2001 and related to the agricultural and  industrial plastic  film market. Following the initiation of this inquiry, BPI conducted a comprehensive competition compliance audit, which led to it uncovering certain anti-competitive practices in its  industrial bags businesses in mainland Europe from 1982 until end 2001, the company said. The BPI Group acquired the businesses involved in 1997.

BRITISH Polythene Industries (BPI), the Glasgow-based  plastic bag-maker, got rid of a long-term monkey from its back yesterday after it was let off a E52.95 million (GBP 36m)  fine by the European   Commission.

The firm was part of a group of  European companies found guilty by the EC for operating a cartel, but was excused for being "the first to provide the  commission with the decisive evidence of the cartel's existence".

TD
BPI's share price jumped 3.2 per cent, or 13.5p, to 436p and its chairman, Cameron McLatchie, called the decision "gratifying". But he noted the EU still has to open an investigation into an agricultural plastic  films cartel.

The commission said explicit documents highlighted the operations of the  cartel, including a plan "to appoint a leader for each customer in order to co-ordinate a rise in prices". The other companies all received fines.

HD        FTSE suffers  biggest  one-day slide for six weeks in broad retreat

A WEAKER bullion price pulled the shares of the world's largest gold mine operator, Anglo-American, lower yesterday.
Anglo American shed 2.9 per cent, or 54p, to 1,816p as gold prices fell dollars 4.50 to dollars 495.10.

TD
In the wider market shares were weighed down by weak oils and banking stocks, as well as a wobble for the property sector on concerns an expected boost in the government's pre-budget report might not materialise.
Hammerson lost 2.9 per cent, or 28p, to 955p and British Land dropped 2.3 per cent, or 23.5p, to
979.5p amid uncertainty about whether or not US-style tax-efficient property real estate investment
trusts (REITs) would be introduced in the pre-budget report next week and what form they might take.

British Land was singled out by UBS, which downgraded the stock to neutral after a recent strong run and on uncertainties surrounding REITs, while fellow investment bank Merrill Lynch was also cautious.

Merrill said in a note: "For the companies, a key differentiating feature will be how the conversion tax will impact. British Land is at risk of suffering the highest conversion tax."

Nearly nine out of every 10 blue-chips ended lower, pulling the FTSE 100 index down 67.8 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 5,423.2 by the close of play - its biggest one-day drop in terms of points for six weeks.
Oils and banks accounted for about half of the drop.

Brewer SABMiller, off 46p at 1,027p, and National Grid, down 14p at 536p, added further pressure as their shares traded without the right to the latest dividend.

Analysts said concerns that strong US economic data would trigger more US interest rate rises than forecast were also hitting sentiment, while comments from Bank of England policy-maker David Walton, adding to the view that the bank is in no hurry to lower rates, further dampened the mood.
On the month, however, the FTSE sealed a gain of 2 per cent.

Daily Mail and Evening Standard owner Daily Mail & General Trust led a handful of stocks that ended higher with an 11 per cent, or 74.5p, leap to 750.5p after investors welcomed consensus-beating
full-year results and the prospect of cash being returned to shareholders if the group sold its regional newspaper division.

Europe's biggest home-improvements retailer, Kingfisher, was next in line with a 2.2 per cent, or 4.75p, rise to 225p as dealers said its latest figures were not as bad as expected, despite a 53 per cent fall in profits at its B&Q chain in the third quarter. Software maker Sage also pleased, as it reported profits up in line with forecasts and was upbeat on prospects for 2006. The shares gained 1 per cent, or 2.25p, to
232.25p.

British Polythene Industries gained 3.2 per cent, or 13.5p, to 436p after it was spared retribution when the European Commission fined 16 companies for operating a  cartel in industrial plastic bags. BPI

escaped punishment as it had revealed the existence of the  cartel. Low & Bonar fared less well, with a
fine of GBP 8.4 million. Its shares dipped 3 per cent, or 4p, to 124p.

Forth Ports jumped 3 per cent, or 42p, to 1,464p after fellow ports operator P&O confirmed it had received a bid approach on Tuesday. P&O was steady, up 0.75p at 440.25p, but Associated British Ports dipped 0.25p to 574.75p.

Outside the top flight, steel group Corus jumped 7 per cent, or 3.5p, to 55.75p as it posted third-quarter results ahead of expectations.

THE EUROPEAN Commission fined 16 firms a combined 290.7 million  euros ($342.6 million) for operating a cartel in the market for industrial plastic  bags. After a raid in 2002, regulators found documents showing the companies had operated a cartel for more than 20 years, agreeing on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

The companies colluded on prices and fixed sales quotas by geographical area, shared orders and organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, the commission said. Finnish company UPM-Kymmene Corp. received the highest  fine of
56.6 million euros.

HD           Appeal for leniency  pays off for British Polythene  Industries

BRITISH Polythene Industries, Europe's biggest maker of plastic  bags, was yesterday let off the hook for its part in a  Europe-wide price-fixing cartel - although the European Commission levelled euros-290.7m (GBP179.5m) worth of fines against 16 other companies.
The EC said that although Greenock-based BPI "had been involved in infringing activity", it reduced its
fine by "100-per cent to nil" because of the company's successful application for leniency.

TD
BPI was first raided in 2001 by EC officials investigating alleged breaches of competition law in the
industrial and agricultural plastic  films market.

However, a number of these breaches the EC investigated dated back to 1982, and involved companies that were not acquired by BPI until 1997.

The company had applied for leniency under the EC's notice of July 1996 on the nonimposition or reduction of  fines in cartel cases.

BPI enjoyed full immunity from the  fine for cooperating with the authorities and being the first to provide the commission with the decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence, under an anti-trust leniency arrangement.

Cameron McLatchie, the company's chairman, said: "BPI is fully committed to ongoing compliance with competition law."
Shares in BPI rose 3.2-per cent, or 13.5p, to close at 436p.

Elsewhere, however, 16 firms, including Finland's UPM-Kymmene, the UK's Low& Bonar, Kendrion of the Netherlands, and Denmark's FLSmidth & Co, were  fined for their part in the  cartel.

The commission said the level of the  fines confirmed its determination to crack down hard on firms that take part in cartels.

"In this instance competitors, with a view to increasing their profits, agreed among themselves on prices and sales quotas by geographical area, shared the orders of large customers, organised collusive bidding for invitations to tender and exchanged information on their sales volumes, to the detriment of competition, their customers and consumers, " the  commission's statement said.

British Polythene Industries and partner Combivac yesterday avoided a fine of euros 53m (pounds
40m) after it blew the whistle on a 20-year-old  cartel in industrial plastic  bags. The bags are used to
pack products such as fertilisers and building materials. The European commission said sales
directors and even managing directors had fixed prices and sales quotas by geographical area. The
prices and quotas were agreed at secret meetings to share orders and collude in bidding for tenders.
Sixteen other companies were  fined a total of  euros 291m for their part in the  cartel. David Gow

The European Commission fined 16 firms a combined 290.7 million  euros ($342.6 million) for operating a cartel in the market for industrial plastic  bags. After a raid in 2002, regulators found documents showing the companies had operated a cartel for more than 20 years, agreeing on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain. The companies colluded on prices and fixed sales quotas by geographical area, shared orders and organized collusive bidding for invitations to tender, and exchanged information on their sales volumes, the  commission said. Sales directors and managing directors made the illegal agreements, often at meetings of their professional association, called Valveplast. Finnish company UPM-Kymmene Corp. received the highest  fine of 56.6 million euros.

BRUSSELS, Nov. 30 -- The  European Commission fined 15 makers of plastic bags 290.7 million euros ($324.4 million) on Wednesday for fixing prices, and in a novel approach, presented incriminating documents recovered in raids on the companies.

The commission said the companies colluded on pricing in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain over the last 20 years. The Finnish packaging and paper goods group UPM-Kymmene drew the largest  fine, 56.5 million  euros.

TD
UPM said in a statement on its Web site that it would ''review the decision and consider further measures.''

The cartel also included Plasticos Espanoles and Armando Alvarez, two affiliated Spanish companies, which were jointly  fined 42 million euros, and the German companies Rheinische Kunststoffwerke and JM Gesellschaft fuer industrielle Beteiligungen, which were  fined 39 million euros together. Two other German companies, Nordenia International and Nordfolien, were together fined 39.1 million euros.

Another  cartel member, British Polythene Industries, was not  fined because it was the first of the group to come forward with evidence.

As it announced the  fines, the commission released extracts of documents seized during dawn raids at the companies in 2002. The commission said senior managers, often sales directors and
managing directors, were directly involved, and knew that what they were doing was illegal.

The European Commission yesterday imposed fines of Euros 290.71m (Dollars 343m) on 16 companies for operating a cartel in the market for plastic  industrial bags.

The regulator said the groups had fixed prices and sales quotas, shared the orders of large customers, rigged the bidding process for contracts and swapped information on their sales volumes. This had harmed both their competitors and their customers.

TD
The biggest  fine was imposed on UPM-Kymmene of Finland (Euros 56.55m).

WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: You're in THE SITUATION ROOM, where new pictures and information are arriving all the time. Standing by, CNN reporters across the United States and around the world to bring you the day's top stories.

Happening now, it's 3:00 a.m. in Iraq, a devastating attack on U.S. Marines, and new allegations about a pre-war campaign of disinformation.

TD
In Los Angeles, it's 4:00 p.m. Is there a nurse in the house? It's a crisis across America, but California hospitals resorting to some desperate measures.
And it's 7:00 p.m. in New York, The shock jock's comments sent out shockwaves a decade ago. Is Howard
Stern finally saying he's sorry?
I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM.

It was a stunning blow for U.S. forces in Iraq. A roadside bomb ripped through a foot patrol in Fallujah, killing 10 United States Marines and wounding 11 more. Shortly afterward, a chilling new threat from hostage takers.
Let's go live to senior international correspondent, Nic Robertson. He's joining us with all the details from
Baghdad. Nic?

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, we know that seven of those Marines injured in the roadside bombing attack have returned to active duty, four remain injured. It was several large artillery shells packed full of explosives that were detonated, as that foot patrol passed by, 10 Marines killed. And as we've seen many times, when Marines patrol here, they are quite spaced out on the roads -- each Marine covering the other Marine. So that gives an idea that this must have been a very large blast to catch 21 troops killing 10 of them in its blast.

Twenty-five miles away, U.S. troops today say they have discovered bomb making material. In the town of Ramadi -- Operation Shank, 300 U.S. Marines supported by 200 Iraqi army troops have been going through parts of the town of Ramadi to make it safe for the elections coming just a couple of weeks.
Wolf.

BLITZER: Is there a sense these improvised explosive devices, these other bombs that these insurgents are using, are becoming so powerful that a brand new and more lethal threat is out there right now to U.S. Military personnel?

ROBERTSON: Well, one of the things the military has noticed is that the IEDs, the roadside bombs, the numbers of them decreased over the past few weeks. But they've also noticed, as the insurgents get better capability, they have become more able to make more destructive bombs. One in  Baghdad recently had a double charge in it. It was fired into a vehicle full of a private security detail and it had two explosive
charges that ripped through the vehicle. So, they are becoming more complex. They are becoming better -- the insurgents are becoming better able to improve the lethality, if you will.

Wolf.
Page 55 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BLITZER: And Nic, tell us briefly about this new video broadcast on Arab television about these hostages -- these Western hostages who have been taken over the last few days?

ROBERTSON: Well on that video some of the hostages can be seen speaking, but it's not clear what they are saying. The audio part wasn't broadcast. There is, with this video, a new death threat. If the demands
of the hostage takers, the insurgents are not met, they say, by the 8th of December, then they say they will kill these hostages -- one of them a U.S. Citizen, Tom Fox, 54 years old, a British citizen and two Canadians.
Wolf.
BLITZER: Nic Robertson on the scene for us in  Baghdad. Nic, thank you very much.
The United States death toll, so far this month in Iraq -- and it's a short month so far, December -- stands at
14. Seven hundred and ninety-two American servicemen and women have died there since the beginning
of the year. And the overall death toll from the war in Iraq now stands at 2,127.

The Pentagon is taking heat over allegations of a secret U.S. military operation to plant favorable news stories in the Iraqi news media.
Let's go live to our senior Pentagon correspondent Jamie McIntyre. Jamie?
JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SR. PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Well Wolf, Senator Ted Kennedy calls it
-- the Pentagon -- accuses the Pentagon of having a devious scheme to put propaganda in the Iraqi
newspapers. U.S. military commanders say they're just countering in the information battle space with what
they call truthful and reliable information.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MCINTYRE (voice-over): The Pentagon is not denying the basic charge that a U.S. funded public relations firm took news stories written by the American military, translated them into Arabic, and then paid to get them into Iraqi newspapers. But Pentagon officials told the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a private meeting, that while U.S. commanders in Iraq who approve the stories are still gathering the facts, there was no intent to deceive.

SEN. JOHN WARNER (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: You pick up our papers here in America, you'll see a number of articles, carried in there and there is usually the byline paid for and requested by this organization. And that's generally what they have been trying to do.

Now, it's been discovered in some areas there's an omission of that reference that it's been paid for. And that's -- they're looking into that.

MCINTYRE: The company in question, Washington-based Lincoln Group, has a $6 million contract to place favorable stories in the Iraqi media. In a statement the company says, "The Lincoln Group has consistently worked with the Iraqi media to promote truthfully reporting across Iraq. We counter the lies, intimidation,
and pure evil of terror with factual stories."

At issue is the fact that the Pentagon has one standard for routine public relations and another for what it calls information operations.

KEN BACON, FORMER PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: There is a natural tension between the military wanting to use information operations as a weapon in warfare and others who want to protect the press as a channel for accurate legitimate information.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

MCINTYRE: In the press release, the U.S. military defended information operations as -- quote -- "an effective and valuable tool." It also acknowledged that some articles had been published in newspapers in return for purchasing advertising -- something it said was a customary practice in Iraq.

U.S. military personnel promised that it would review the appropriateness of the process and take action if they found any improprieties. Senator Ted Kennedy is calling for a I.G. investigation, the Pentagon's inspector general to review the whole contract with the Lincoln Group.
Wolf.
BLITZER: Jamie, thank you very much. Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon.

And coming up, accusations of other U.S. government propaganda efforts. Who was behind the so-called selling of the Iraq war. I'll speak live with James Bamford, the author of a provocative article in the new issue of "Rolling Stone" magazine.
In a moment, a CNN exclusive with the director of National Intelligence. But first let's go to CNN's Betty
Nguyen at the CNN Center in Atlanta with a closer look at some other stories making news. Hi Betty.
(NEWSBREAK)
BLITZER: All right Betty, thank you very much. We'll get back with you shortly.
Is America safer now? After 9/11 there were urgent demands to reform the nation's spy agencies. Last year
Congress created a new position aimed at doing just that.
Our national security correspondent, David Ensor, is joining us now with a CNN exclusive. David. DAVID ENSOR, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, in an exclusive first
broadcast interview, the nation's top intelligence officer said the nation is safer since 9/11.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ENSOR (voice-over): The post 9/11 U.S. intelligence community includes a state of the art national counter terrorism center and a new director of national intelligence, the cabinet level job created almost a year ago and filled with Ambassador John Negroponte. But some critics charge the director has yet to fully exert his authority and is off to a slow start.

NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: There you're four words missing, I think, from the way I sense the systems' currently operating with the new director of National Intelligence. Those are speed, intensity, urgency, and accountability.

JOHN NEGROPONTE, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Well, I think the story is quite the contrary.

ENSOR: For the first time since he became the president's top intelligence adviser, Negroponte, agreed to a broadcast interview. He says major changes are well under way.

NEGROPONTE: We've created in the collection area a national clandestine service. We have created an open source center. We have created a national security branch in the FBI.

ENSOR: Critics argue Negroponte has not been forceful enough. Some even say legal changes may be needed to give him more power.
JOHN BRENNAN, FMR. ACTING DIR., NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER: It's up to
Ambassador (ph) Negroponte to really push the limits of his authority. He needs to exert it.
ENSOR: The intelligence director hints he has exerted more power than the public may know. NEGROPONTE: I'm not at liberty to go into all the details, but we've taken some tough decisions that have
implications for substantial amounts of money and resources.

ENSOR: At a White House meeting Negroponte attended this week, though, sources say the issue was the CIA secret prison story. What should Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice tell angry  European governments next week about whether al Qaeda prisoners, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the like, may be on European soil under harsh CIA interrogation?

NEGROPONTE: I would say this is a collective effort that involves the intelligence community and the state department and other interested agencies, but I suggest that it might be best to just stay tuned for Miss Rice's trip.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

ENSOR: No doubt about it, Negroponte is in the hot seat, Wolf, dealing with critics, controversy and a war on terror that is by no means over.
Wolf.

BLITZER: David Ensor, good work, as usual. David Ensor with a good exclusive. Thank you very much. And remember stay tuned to CNN day and night for the most reliable news about your security.
Let's go up to New York now, Jack Cafferty standing by with a little question for this hour. Hi, Jack.
Page 57 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Yeah, we got a little question, speaking of security. How about those nice secure borders we have? Mexican politicians are hitting the campaign trail in the United States. That's because there are millions of Mexican voters living here that could help sway next year's presidential election down there. The Associated Press reports members of President Vicente Fox's party are going to visit four states to try to convince Mexican voters, here in the U.S., to keep his party in office.

The tour was scheduled to begin today in Dallas and San Antonio Texas. They also plan to campaign in California, Illinois, and New York. Also for the first time this year Mexicans living abroad will be ale to vote by absentee ballot. They used to have to go back to Mexico to vote, not any more.

So here's the question, should Mexican politicians be campaigning in the United States? You can email us at CaffertyFile@CNN.com and we'll share some of your thoughts a bit later.

BLITZER: You know, Jack, that a lot of American politicians have to campaign in  Europe or elsewhere because of Americans living around the world can vote absentee in U.S. elections.
CAFFERTY: That's true. I wasn't aware that they actually physically went there to campaign.
BLITZER: I have seen some candidates actually go to various places where there are congregations of
American voters, potentially, and try to get their vote absentee.
CAFFERTY: Those got to be desperate politicians running way behind in the polls. BLITZER: That's true.
CAFFERTY: They have to run off to Belgium to try to run up eight votes.

BLITZER: You know, sometimes in London there are a bunch of Americans. When I was a young reporter in Israel, in Tel Aviv, they use to be -- some politicians would go over there to campaign for American votes in Israel.

CAFFERTY: Well, and there are a lot of Americans in Israel at any given time and of course, there are what, 11 million Mexicans here in the United States...
BLITZER: So, it may not be that unusual for Mexican politicians to be campaigning here. CAFFERTY: Well, it may not, but...
BLITZER: See what our viewers think.
CAFFERTY: Will be interesting what the viewers might think about it, yeah. BLITZER: All right. Thanks, Jack.
CAFFERTY: Yep, see you later.
BLITZER: Coming up, is it the end of a desperate quest? A mother waits for the answer.
Plus David Duke outraged. The former Klansman and wannabe politician gives an anti-Semitic speech in
Syria. We have the tape.

And a little bit later, nursing crisis: Will someone be there when you have to go to the hospital? A reality show trying to end the national shortage.
Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BLITZER: For more than two years a grieving mother has been on a quest. Today what she's been looking for may have been found, the bodies of her murdered children.
CNN's Keith Oppenheim is joining us now from our Chicago bureau with more. Keith?

KEITH OPPENHEIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Wolf. And it does appear to be a promising discovery for this mom who has spent the last two and a half years trying to find out where her murdered children are buried.

In Hudson, Ohio, police have not positively identified two bodies that were discovered. All they told us really was a woman who was walking her dog discovered the bodies and that the general details of the location pretty closely match what investigators had been looking for in the Gehring case.
Page 58 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It was in July of 2003 that Sarah and Philip Gehring were last seen. She was 14, her brother was 11. Their father, Manuel, was arrested in California. And upon arrest he admitted that he shot and killed his two children. He gave a lot of general details as to where the bodies were buried, but never gave a precise location and then seven months after that, he hanged himself in jail.

Last summer I did a story with Terry Knight, when she came to the Midwest, and she was trying to get volunteers in several Midwestern states to help her find the dead bodies of her two children. And today, she was still trying not to be too hopeful that a positive identification had been made.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TERESA KNIGHT, MOTHER OF MISSING CHILDREN: I'm not going down the road yet that this is definitely it, because it just sets yourself up for disappointment. So, I'm going to wait and take it one step at a time.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

OPPENHEIM: She'll be waiting for a forensic examination, which will be done soon, so we may have an identification soon.

One of the interesting things about this case is that the woman who found the bodies, police said this, Wolf, that they wouldn't identify who she was, but that was actually a volunteer specifically looking for the
Gehring children. So if there is a positive I.D. in this case, then Terry Knight's efforts to get volunteers to help find her deceased children may have paid off.
Wolf.
BLITZER: All right, a shocking story. Thanks very much, Keith, for that. Keith.Oppenheim reporting.

And there's a disturbing story coming out of Mexico right now, as well -- a homemade DVD that allegedly shows four drug hitmen confessing to their gruesome crimes, then one of the men being killed.
Let's bring in our Thelma Gutierrez. She's joining us from Los Angeles. Thelma?

THELMA GUTIERREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, that graphic DVD was put in an unmarked envelope and then sent anonymously to a small newspaper in Washington state. Eventually the DVD made its way to a news agency in Dallas, who posted it -- it posted a small excerpt on its Web site. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

GUTIERREZ (voice-over): It was a brutal revelation, caught on tape. Seven minutes of alleged confessions by members of Mexico's so- called Gulf  Cartel, played on the Dallas Morning News Web site believed to have been recorded on May 16.

On the tape, you see four bloodied men sitting in front of a window covered with black  plastic  garbage bags, they are handcuffed. Mexican authorities say the men appear to have been tortured. On tape, the men confess that they are enforcers for the Gulf  Cartel, responsible for kidnapping, torturing, and killing their enemies. The men also claim responsibility for the recent high-profile murder of reporter Guadalupe Escamia. Escamia had been investigating drug  cartel violence along the Texas-Mexico border when she was gunned down outside of the radio station where she worked.

But who's responsible for making this tape and beating the confessions out of the men? The attorney general's office in Mexico recently announced the arrest of 10 people including eight federal agents who worked for the AFI, the Mexican equivalent of the FBI, and a close partner in the war on drugs.
As for the fate of the four bound men, authorities say at least one was executed, shot in the head. (END VIDEOTAPE)
GUTIERREZ: The Mexican officials say they are still investigating the whereabouts of the men on tape and they are looking into other claims made on the tape. Two of the men said that they are former members of the Mexican army who often recruited among their ranks for the Gulf  Cartel -- Wolf.
BLITZER: Thelma Gutierrez thank you very much for that. Thelma reporting from Los Angeles.

Still to come here in THE SITUATION ROOM. It's an explosive allegation within the pages of rolling stone magazine. Was a PR firm involved in the run-up to the Iraq war? I'll ask the author of the article, Jim Bamford. He's standing by.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

Page 59 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BLITZER: Let's check in with CNN's Anderson Cooper for a quick preview of what's coming up on his program tonight.
Hi, Anderson.

ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Hey Wolf, at 10:00 tonight reports of patients euthanized at a New Orleans hospital. It's a story we've been following Katrina. Tonight, new details, could nearly a hundred people have been euthanized -- murdered by staff at local New Orleans hospitals? We'll take a look.

Plus, we're looking to why the scientologists in New Mexico have apparently built a secret compound that houses an elaborate volt. What's more, there are giant crop circle-like symbols next to the compound, only visible from the air. We send our Gary Tuchman to investigate. We'll bring you all that at 10:00.
Wolf.
BLITZER: Sounds good, Anderson, thanks very much, looking forward to it.

A U.S. soldier had one of Saddam Hussein's uniforms auctioned online. Is he allowed to do that? For the answer let's turn to our Internet reporter Jacki Schechner. Jacki?
JACKI SCHECHNER, CNN INTERNET COREESPONDENT: Well the short answer, Wolf, is he -- his
fiance did. Now, take a look at this. This says "Saddam Hussein's Uniform." It turned up on this auction site
last week. Just last night, it went to a Washington collector for $16,000. Now, Manion's is an online auction
house. They were able to verify the authenticity. Taking a specific look at the epaulets there, you can see
Saddam's rank is depicted by what's on the sleeve.

Now Manion's says that this is not the first uniform by Saddam Hussein that they have sold. There was one that was sold back in July of 2003 that went for $24,000.

Now the way this specific one got here is kind of interesting. It was recovered at a tailor shop in an assault on the Baghdad International Airport back in 2003. The soldier gave it to his fiance, who brought it to the auction house in order to raise money for a new house. So, after the 15 percent fee that Manion's gets, the couple walked away with $14,000.
Wolf.

BLITZER: It's interesting, indeed. Thank you very much, Jacki. Just ahead we'll try to separate fact from fiction. We'll take a closer look at a hard-hitting "Rolling Stone" article about spinning pre-war intelligence. The author is standing by to join us.
And later, being Howard Stern means almost having to say you're sorry, just once. You're in the SITUATION ROOM.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BLITZER: We told you at the top of the hour about a Pentagon -- the Pentagon taking heat for allegedly planting stories in the Iraqi news media. There are also some explosive allegations that a public relations firm here in Washington did something similar to the build- up to the war in Iraq.
Let's bring in our Brian Todd. He's joining us with details. Brian?

BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, that's part of a new report that has set off a wave of reaction here in Washington and elsewhere, as the debate continues over the campaign to sell the Iraq war.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

TODD (voice over): Shock and awe, the first blitz on  Baghdad. The culmination of diplomatic maneuvering and the Bush administration's carefully built case for war -- a case that, according to a best selling author
on U.S. intelligence, was partially undertaken as a secret propaganda campaign by a Washington consulting firm.
JAMES BAMFORD, AUTHOR: It's a very wide ranging contract.

TODD: James Bamford in a recent edition of "Rolling Stone" magazine writes that a man named John Rendon and his firm, the Rendon Group, were secretly awarded a $16 million contract by the Pentagon in October of 2001 to target information against the regime of Saddam Hussein.


Page 60 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BAMFORD: And it's for basically propaganda -- creating Web sites, taking part in chat groups around the world, doing broadcasts, coming up with information.

TODD: Or, according to Bamford, misinformation. In the article, he writes -- quote -- "among the missions proposed for the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Influence was one to coerce foreign journalists and plant false information overseas."

And Bamford contends that Rendon had contracts with the CIA at least as far back as 1991, when Bamford claims Rendon had a significant role in the creation of the Iraqi National Congress and the installation of
that group's leader Ahmad Chalabi.

By association, Bamford implies that Rendon Group was a catalyst in the relationship that would eventually lead to Chalabi passing along questionable and often discredited information about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs -- information passed to reporters and the Bush administration.

John Rendon was not available for comment, but his group issued a statement saying -- quote -- "for the record, the Rendon Group had no role whatsoever in making the case for the Iraq war, here at home or internationally. Mr. Bamford's contention to the contrary is flatly untrue." The group also says it does not produce or disseminate false information, and denies Bamford's charge that it participated in chat rooms.

A Rendon Group official would not comment when asked about Bamford's claim that John Rendon has access to the most secret files at the Pentagon.

As for the claim that Rendon's group took part in the establishment and even the naming of the Iraqi National Congress, we spoke to Francis Brooke, an adviser to Chalabi, who says he worked for Rendon's Group in the early '90's.

FRANCIS BROOKE, ADVISER TO AHMED CHALABI: Those arguments are false. Mr. Rendon was a consultant. The Iraqi National Congress was founded independently by Dr. Chalabi, and Mr. Rendon provided consulting services during that period.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

TODD: The Rendon Group would not comment when asked if Francis Brooke ever worked for them. Pentagon officials would not comment when we asked them if the Pentagon ever awarded Mr. Rendon a
$16 million contract.
A CIA official tells CNN the agency will not discuss who it does or does not do business with. Wolf.
BLITZER: Brian Todd reporting for us. Brian, thank you very much.

And the author of that article, James Bamford, is joining us now here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Jim, thanks very much for joining us.
BAMFORD: My pleasure, Wolf.

BLITZER: All right. Well, let's get to some of the specific denials. The denial from the Rendon Group, what you have reported is flatly untrue. The Rendon Group had no role whatsoever in making the case for the Iraq war.
BAMFORD: Well, actually, you know Bob Baer, who was with the CIA for a very long time... BLITZER: Former CIA officer.
BAMFORD: Exactly. In the Middle-East, worked with Chalabi, was in Iraq for a very long time, different missions, his quote is he was responsible for selling this war. I mean, that's what he said.

There's no question that this war was being sold right from 1991 on. That was the primary goal of Ahmed Chalabi to take INC and make it the new government of Iraq, overthrow Saddam Hussein and get the United States to launch a war against Iraq. And that was John Rendon's creation.
BLITZER: But there was legislation in the U.S. Congress to support the removal regime change of Saddam
Hussein, that was passed, what, in '98 during the Clinton administration.
BAMFORD: That's right. But, it goes -- the actual INC was formed back in the early '90s. BLITZER: Right after the liberation of Kuwait.

Page 61 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BAMFORD: That's right.

BLITZER: But what you're saying and what Francis Brooke is denying is that the Rendon Group came up with the whole INC, including the naming of the Iraqi National Congress, and you're sticking by what you wrote.
BAMFORD: John Rendon didn't deny that at all. I mean, he hasn't denied... BLITZER: You met with him the course of doing your reporting?
BAMFORD: Yes. He never denied it.
BLITZER: Did you ask him directly, did you come up with the name Iraqi National Congress?

BAMFORD: Yes. And he had no -- he basically said, yes. I mean he said he was a senior adviser to that whole group from the very beginning. He was the one who helped create the meeting in Vienna. That was where the whole INC was created.

BLITZER: And what you're also saying and you have written in the article is that the U.S. Government, we taxpayers, were paying the Rendon Group to do all this? Were they doing this on behalf of the Kuwaitis, the Saudis or other foreign interests?
BAMFORD: They were doing it on behalf of the CIA. The CIA was paying the Rendon Group. BLITZER: When did the CIA start funding the Rendon Group?
BAMFORD: Around 1991, I think it was '92. Somewhere around there.
BLITZER: Because, as you know, at one point the CIA lost interest in Ahmed Chalabi and the INC. BAMFORD: That's right. That was around 1995. And then the Pentagon started paying Chalabi... BLITZER: This is during the Clinton administration.
BAMFORD: Exactly. That's right.

BLITZER: And so, what about leading up to the war after 9/11? Who is paying the Rendon Group? According to your research to go ahead and create a climate that would justify the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.

BAMFORD: Well the Pentagon had 35 contracts with the Rendon Group over the last four years totaling between 50 and $100 million. And that was for a lot of media work basically creating an information war room for the Pentagon.

BLITZER: Here's what the Rendon Group said, in part, about your suggestion that Rendon, himself, had access to these really top secret information

Mr. Rendon does not have access to classified material in his home or via Internet, and his limited access to such material is no different from that of thousands of other DoD contractors who work for the U.S government.

BAMFORD: Right. What he's saying is he doesn't have access to it in his home, which I completely agree with. He has access to it once he gets in to his office. His clearance, according to the contract with the Pentagon, is enormous clearance. It's one of the largest I have ever seen. It's top secret with about five code words after it, indicating he has access to the most secret information from imagery signals intelligence and human intelligence. I mean, that's right in the contract.
BLITZER: And you're saying you have a copy of this contract? BAMFORD: Of course, yes.
BLITZER: So you have the actual documents in your possession that you could back up...

BAMFORD: He's not denying that doesn't have the clearance. He's denying that he reads the classified documents in his house.
BLITZER: At 3:00 a.m. when you say he wakes up in the morning and starts reading the computer. BAMFORD: Exactly, yes. I don't have any problem with that at all. Sure.

Page 62 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BLITZER: They also -- you also write this. You write, the Bush administration took everything Rendon had to offer. Between 2000 and 2004 Pentagon documents show the Rendon Group received at least 35 contracts with the Defense Department, worth a total of $50 to $100 million.

In their statement, the Rendon Group says the GOP, the government accounting office, the general accounting office and other watchdogs, inspector generals look at how much money they are getting and it's appropriate.

BAMFORD: Well, let the public decide whether -- he actually gets $311 an hour. It's about over $12,000 a week as part of his contract to do public relations work. I mean, if the public thinks that paying $100 million for public relations work in which much of it is secret is  fine, then that's  fine.

BLITZER: But, as you know, as a student of the intelligence community, hiring outsourcing, if you will, private contractors to do some of the -- quote -- "dirty work", that's been going on in the U.S. government forever.

BAMFORD: But not to this extent. I mean, as I point out in the "Rolling Stone" article, the CIA now is 50 percent subcontracted. Fifty percent of what used to be the full-time CIA is now -- half of it is all subcontracted out to contractors.

BLITZER: Fascinating material as usual from James Bamford. You're going to be watched and you're going to be criticized as you have been many times over the years. But we appreciate you joining us in THE SITUATION ROOM.
BAMFORD: Great. Thanks, Wolf.

BLITZER: Thanks very much, James Bamford Here in THE SITUATION ROOM up next, help wanted. Can a Web-based reality series help hospitals find more nurses?
And later, get this, Howard Stern, is it possible that he said something even he thinks is outrageous? You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BLITZER: Here's a look at some of the "Hot Shots" coming in from our friends over at the Associated
Press, pictures likely to be in your hometown newspapers tomorrow. Check these out.

In Puerto Rico, a fallen soldier. The family of 22-year-old Antonio Mendez embrace at his funeral. Mendez was killed in a car bomb attack in Iraq.
In Saadah, Iraq now where a young boy and a Navy corpsman check each other out from a distance. Ten
Marines from the same division were killed yesterday by a roadside bomb.

Brazil where a vampire bat is caught in a net by researchers. The deforestation of the Amazon region has displaced thousands of bats and set them carrying rabies across northern Brazil. They have bitten over
1,000 people in just the past two months. Twenty-three of those people died.
Nashville, Tennessee, the big winners. Betty Taylor (ph) and her husband Bill collect their million dollar
Powerball prize. That's about $750,000 after taxes.
Those are some of today's "Hot Shots", pictures often worth a thousand words.

The U.S. is facing a nursing shortage that's likely to get even worse. Let's go to CNN's Chris Lawrence. He's joining us from Los Angeles with the story. Chris?

CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, almost every week I've heard you talking about companies closing and people getting laid off. This is an industry that is so desperate for people, some students coming out of school here in California can make up to $30 an hour. And some nurses are getting thousands of dollars in signing bonuses to go to a particular hospital. The shortage is getting worse, not better. And companies are going to some pretty extreme measures to try to recruit good nurses.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
LAWRENCE (voice-over): For 12 hours a day, Nurse Amy Morrison is in her scrubs on her feet.

AMY MORRISON, REGISTERED NURSE: Want me to clean her up? Come here, sweetie. LAWRENCE: But this is what she comes home to, a $10 million mansion Morrison shares with five other traveling nurses right on the ocean in Orange County, California. It's all set up as part of a reality show on NurseTV.com. It

Page 63 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
follows the cast in the hospital and out of airplanes, to show potential recruits that nursing is an exciting, important career.

MORRISON: Nurses don't walk down a red carpet and get an award, you know, for the best labor nurse of the year.
LAWRENCE: Morrison has an idea what is going to happen if the shortage doesn't shop.
MORRISON: You're not going to get the care you deserve. You're not going to get the care you need. LAWRENCE: California pays the highest wages in the country, but the state still has one of the lowest
number of nurses compared to its population.
(on camera): Do you see that ratio getting better or getting worse?

ALAN BRAYNIN, ACCESS NURSES: It's getting worse. As the baby boomers age, more nurses are needed.

LAWRENCE (voice-over): Problem is, the average age is nearly 50 years old. That means nurses will be retiring right along with the baby boomers who need them most.

BRAYNIN: A simple example is you go into the E.R. with a broken leg, and you have to wait longer and longer and longer.
MORRISON: Mom's ready to see you again.
LAWRENCE: Morrison says she could have been working even sooner.

MORRISON: I remember when I was actually going through nursing school, I had to wait two years to get into a program.

LAWRENCE: And that's the other problem. Not enough nurses leads to not enough nurses like this who have the qualifications to teach and not enough nursing schools where students can get the training.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

LAWRENCE: Yes, a lot of schools shut down their programs about 10 years ago when there was a nursing surplus. Now they are restarting them, like UCLA next fall. It will help, but this is a bigger, national problem that's probably going to be with us for some time.
Wolf.

BLITZER: Chris Lawrence, doing important work for us. Thanks, Chris, very much. An important story. Some members of Congress are taking note of the looming crisis. They met this week with representatives from the nursing industry.

In our look at news around the world, a notorious former member of the Ku Klux Klan and his fiery words while traveling abroad.
Let's bring in CNN's Betty Nguyen once again from the CNN Center in Atlanta with details. Betty? BETTY NGUYEN, CNN ANCHOR: Wolf, we're talking about David Duke, the former Klan leader and
Louisiana legislator who once ran for Congress. Now, he traveled to Syria recently where he praised that
country's government, met with its members of parliament, and led an anti-Israeli rally. Hundreds of people
believed to be Syrian nationalists were on hand, cheering, waving flags as Duke told them Zionists control
much of the U.S. government and media.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID DUKE, FORMER KLAN LEADER: It hurts my heart to tell you that part of my country is occupied by
Zionists, just as part of your country, the Golan Heights, is occupied by Zionists.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

NGUYEN: Now Duke also accused the U.S. of falsely portraying Syria as a terrorist country. State-run TV covered parts of his trip. The reports did not mention his white supremacist activities or the time he spent in federal prison for mail and tax fraud.
Wolf.

Page 64 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BLITZER: All right, Betty. Thank you very much. Betty Nguyen, at the CNN Center.

Up next, Howard Stern unplugged. Hear why he prayed that the FCC cancer would spread and what he's saying now.
Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BLITZER: It's not exactly an apology but it might be the closest thing to one that Howard Stern can muster. The radio shock jock is offering an explanation for comments he made more than a decade ago that were shocking by any standard.
CNN's Adaora Udoji has the details. (END VIDEOTAPE)
HOWARD STERN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I blurt out anything.

ADAORA UDOJI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's no white flag, but Howard Stern's reflections to CBS News on wishing a former FCC chairman's cancer to spread are surprising.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Al Sikes, the Federal Communication  Commission, "I pray that his prostate cancer spreads into his lungs and his kidneys. I pray to you Jesus, answer my prayers."
STERN: Yes, that is me being outrageous. Breast implants, girls? No? Well, hello.
UDOJI: Outrageousness is exactly what Howard Stern's empire is built on, from sexually explicit talk to comments critics say are derogatory towards women and gays. He's said something to offend just about everyone and his fans love it.

STERN: If you're going to be strong on the radio, you got to let it all out, even the ugly stuff. And you can't apologize for it.
UDOJI: Letting it all out has kept him at the top.

STERN: The point is that I am the star of the radio station. I have the highest ratings on this station. I own this station.
UDOJI: With his show drawing in 12 million people every day, and revenues of $100 million a year.
(on camera): But over the years, the shock jock has also drawn the wrath of the FCC which has repeatedly
fined his employer, Infiniti Broadcasting, for what regulators say is indecent material.
STERN: There's something going on with the FCC.

UDOJI (voice-over): That crackdown triggered Stern's prayer for the chairman's cancer to spread. Turns out it didn't, and Sikes recovered. More than a decade later, Stern has mixed feelings about what he said.
STERN: You know what? I don't know that I would do that now. I'm older. But I'm on the air five hours. And
I blurt out anything in my head. Dangerous? Maybe. You know, do I say things afterwards that I regret? No,
because those are the thoughts in my head, and I share that with the audience.
UDOJI: He's counting on that audience to follow him next month when his show moves to Sirius Satellite
Radio. Since he won't be on public airwaves anymore, he won't be subject to FCC oversight.
STERN: I know that some people find this hard to believe ...

UDOJI: Stern couldn't be more thrilled. He's even put a countdown clock on his Web site ticking off the seconds to what he calls freedom.
STERN: Did you ever wish anyone dead?
UDOJI: And for those who think Stern is shocking now, just wait.

STERN: When I get really angry and fired up and I feel like my back is up against the wall, I will say vicious things. And rather than hide that, I would rather put that out on the radio and let someone see the full range of emotions. UDOJI: Stern says good-bye to the public air waves December 16.

Adaora Udoji, CNN, New York.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

BLITZER: The Bush administration is trumpeting a positive unemployment report as a sign of a robust economy. But how is the economy really doing? Ali Velshi is here in THE SITUATION ROOM with the "Bottom Line." Ali.

ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR: Wolf, there are so many different ways to measure how the economy is doing. But really for most Americans the way that matters most is how you're feeling financially.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

VELSHI (voice-over): To spend money, you have to have money, and to most people that means having a job. Just a few months ago things looked pretty rough. Hurricane Katrina put more than half a million people out of work. But 215,000 jobs were created in America in November alone.

ANDREW BUSCH, FINANCIAL STRATEGIST: What 215,000 jobs means is that 215,000 more people are employed in America. And that's a good thing.

VELSHI: But the economy is not flying all that high. This year has seen some big names declare bankruptcy: two major airlines, and the country's largest auto parts maker. And tens of thousands of layoffs have been announced this year, 30,000 at General Motors alone; 25,000 at Kodak,

Even if you didn't get laid off just the fear of losing your job could slow down your spending. Making money off of your big investment, your home, for instance, makes you feel good, but that could be changing.
BUSCH: We're starting to see that sector cool off a little bit. So that's a major area of concern. VELSHI: Mixed messages. So can President Bush really claim that things are doing well?
BUSCH: He'll certainly do it when it's a good economy. Overall, the great thing about the United States, and I can't underscore this enough, is the ability for us to create jobs and destroy jobs.
VELSHI: The bottom line? Feeling good about your job, you'll probably keep spending. Businesses will
keep hiring and even more people will get jobs. So if you think the economy is doing well, you may have no
one to thank but yourself.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

VELSHI: But in the end, if it's doing well, you'll thank the president. And when it's not doing well, the president might want to be looking for cover.
BLITZER: Good point. Thanks very much. Welcome to Washington.

Again, still ahead, is it good politics or looking for votes in all the wrong places? Jack Cafferty has your answers when we return.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BLITZER: Let's end the week as we began it, with Jack Cafferty here in THE SITUATION ROOM. Jack? CAFFERTY: Mexican politicians, Wolf, are hitting the campaign trail in the United States because there are
millions of Mexican voters here who could help sway next year's presidential elections down there. The
Associated Press reporting members of President Vicente Fox's party will visit four states to try to convince
Mexican voters to keep his party in the office.
The question we asked is, should Mexican politicians be campaigning in the U.S.?

Garrett writes: "Absolutely. Circle the political rally crowds with INS officials. And upon leaving the rally, everyone who can produce valid documentation can stay here. The rest can get on a slow boat to southern Mexico."

Sven writes: "Of course Mexican politicians should be allowed to campaign in the U.S. We should support democracy in all its forms everywhere."
Master Sergeant -- pardon me? Somebody just said something to me, and I didn't hear what it was. Master Sergeant Ellis Flores (ph), retired U.S. Air Force: "I see nothing wrong with it. Don't forget, Iraqis
were voting here in the U.S. not very long ago."
Page 66 of 86 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And Gabriela in Brookline, Massachusetts: "We don't need any more politicians in this country. We're all stocked up here. Haven't we suffered enough?"

Finally, Louise in Montana wrote this about THE SITUATION ROOM theme song: "The reason some of you are having trouble with the music is that it isn't made with musical instruments. It's from an old reel- to-reel cassette of the sound of a washing machine from an era before you were born, and I believe it was meant
to be a nostalgic reminder of the good old days."

BLITZER: That was not the music. I think that was something else. Here it is, let's listen. I want you to go away on your vacation, Jack. I know you're going on vacation in the next few days. You're not going to be here next week. But think about this music while you're gone. Have a great time, Jack. We've got to go.
CAFFERTY: Thank you, and good night. BLITZER: Jack Cafferty.
And to our viewers, don't forget, from now on we're in THE SITUATION ROOM weekdays, 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. Eastern, as well as 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. Eastern.

I'll be back this Sunday for LATE EDITION, the last word in Sunday talk. Among my guests, the president's national security advisor, Stephen Hadley.
Until then, thanks very much for joining us. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. PAULA ZAHN NOW starts right now. Paula is in New York.

It stood out like a sore thumb: Low & Bonar , the industrial materials group, had just been slapped with a euros 12m (pounds 8m) fine by the European commission after an investigation into an alleged cartel in the supply of industrial plastic  bags.

How did the share price respond? Well, it jumped 8p to 133p, of course, having already edged up from the 110p level over recent weeks.

Market shrewdies have clearly been keeping a close eye on Atorka, an Icelandic investment company that has already amassed a 23% stake in the company.

And yesterday, well after the market had closed, the speculative money was proved right as Low & Bonar confirmed that it had "received an approach from a third party which may or may not lead to an offer".

The Icelanders were not named in the statement and there was the usual cautionary stuff, emphasising that the talks were at an early stage but close followers are convinced that Atorka is the putative buyer.

The mood was generally upbeat across the market as a whole yesterday, with prices snapping back smartly after Wednesday's wobble.

Renewed corporate activity - such as news that Punch Taverns is the pounds 2.7bn buyer of its pubs rival Spirit, rather than a private equity player - revived bid talk across a range of sectors. There was also the Wall Street effect, where talk of a fresh assault on the 11,000 barrier on the Dow Jones underpinned trading in London. At the end of the session, the FTSE 100 was showing a gain of 62.9
points at 5486.1, while early evening - after equity trading had ceased over here - the Dow was showing a gain of 125 points at 10,930, suggesting the main British index may have further to run first thing this morning.

The Punch deal rippled through the bars sector, sending Enterprise Inns 11.5p higher to 883.5p, while Luminar rose by 4.5p at 497.5p. JD Wetherspoon , however, slipped 2p to finish at 323p. Punch itself closed up 31p at 861p.

Elsewhere, a rally in the crude price helped heavyweights such as BP put on 15.5p to reach 649.5p, while the gas explorer and distributor BG Group added 14.5p to at 555p.

Chatter about the likely impact of new real estate investment funds buoyed the property sector once again. Notable movers included British Land , up 18p to 997.5p, and Hammerson , which ended the day
18p higher at 973p.

Among the mid-caps, the internet bank Egg was in demand as traders reacted to news - much earlier than expected - that the Prudential is to re-purchase all the stock (21.7%) it does not own. That pushed the price of Egg up 14.5p to 116.75p. The Pru, however, fell 2.5p at 525p.

Approval rerating

Old Mutual , the South African insurer listed in London, surprised the City yesterday by announcing it would now settle for approval from only half of the shareholders of its takeover target Skandia rather than the 90% it had originally been seeking. Old Mutual has pursued Stockholm-based Skandia in the face of persistent disapproval from its target's board and without the support of at least 15% of the Swedish shareholders. The decision to cut the extent of approvals was immediately seized upon by Skandia as demonstrating the Old Mutual management's "lack of confidence" in their offer. The offer remains open until December 16. Shares in Old Mutual, which has secured backing from its own shareholders for the deal, rose 1.75p to 153p.

HD       Denmark's  FLSmidth  to appeal EU cartel fine

STOCKHOLM, Dec 2 (Reuters) - FLSmidth is to appeal a  European Commission fine against a former French subsidiary for operating a  plastic bags cartel, which could leave the Danish firm with a 15.3 million euro ($17.9 million) bill.

"Regarding the  European Commission's decision to impose a penalty for  cartel cooperation, FLSmidth has decided to appeal the decision which the company considers unjustified and not founded in former practice," the company said in a statement on Friday.

TD
The Commission on Thursday fined a group of European makers of industrial plastic bags 290.71 million euros for operating a cartel.
It said unless Trioplast Wittenheim, formerly owned by construction materials group FLSmidth, paid a
17.85 million euro fine, FLSmidth would have to divide the penalty with current owner Trioplast
Industrier.
FLSmidth's share of the amount would be a maximum of 15.3 million  euros.

HD      PACKAGING: INDUSTRIAL PLASTIC BAG CARTEL FINED EURO 290 MILLION WC     301 words

The European Commission has handed out a fine of over euro 290 million to sixteen firms running a cartel in the market for industrial plastic  bags. Sales and Managing Directors of the firms met to agree prices, sales quotas, shared orders for large customers and collusive bids for tenders as well as to share information on their respective sales volumes. The biggest  fines were imposed on UPM-Kymmene Oyj of Finland (euro 56.55 million) and Plásticos Españoles SA/Armando Álvarez SA (euro 42 million).

TD
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that the decision sent "a very clear message to company directors that such practices are unacceptable". The investigations began in June 2002 with surprise inspections of producers, following a tip-off from British Polythene Industries (BPI), one of the members of the cartel. By providing the  Commission with decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence, BPI secured
full immunity for itself. Other firms, including Cofira-Sac and Trioplast, who provided additional information to the Commission, were rewarded with reductions in their  fines.

Internal memos seized during the inspections clearly revealed the existence of agreements and the awareness of participants that their behaviour was illegal. For example, one memo stated that "this document and all those relating to VALVEPLAST [the industry's professional association] which indicate figures for allocating markets and prices shall be destroyed".

The producers concerned controlled most of the market for industrial bags in Germany, Benelux, France and Spain. In 2001, that market was worth an estimated euro 265 million. Plastic industrial bags are used to pack various products such as raw materials, fertilisers, agricultural products, animal feed and building materials.

HD          CUTTING COSTS SCANDAL MONGER: BY          Ken Symon

HOW much does a scandal cost a company? Well, if you are British Polythene Industries the answer is remarkably little.

The Greenock-based  plastic bag supplier neatly sidestepped any fine from the European                   Commission over an inquiry into the slippery practice of price-fixing activities.

TD
This was despite the fact that it admitted that part of its group had been involved in activities that did infringe competition law in the agricultural and  industrial plastic  film market.
The information that BPI supplied to the  Commission sparked a second inquiry by the  European
Union body.

Chairman Cameron McLatchie has said: "BPI is fully committed to ongoing compliance with competition law."

It will be good news for BPI shareholders and it will limit the cost of the scandal but it is a development not expected to win McLatchie many friends in the industry.

But if you ask the same question on cost of Ahold the answer is very different as . . . to be fair . . . is the scale of the scandal.

Scandals cause damage to reputation and resulting loss of business, there is the distraction to senior executive time and all the other internal costs to sort out the mess on a variety of levels.

But the biggest hit to companies is in legal costs. In the case of Ahold, the Dutch food group, the legal cost to date is dollars-1.1 billion (GBP640m).

That is what the company has agreed to pay shareholders to settle a class-action lawsuit, the biggest securities class action by a  European company in the US.

Of course, it could all have been much worse if the company had not received some pretty hefty aid from the banks which stopped it going bust.

The money will go to compensate shareholders who held the shares between 1999 and 2003 when the scandal burst into public view.

Executive board member Peter Wakkie was quoted as saying that it was "substantial compensation" but "not so high that it will bring Ahold into problems".

It marked the passing of one major milestone in the Ahold scandal, although there are still executives waiting to have their day in court on criminal fraud charges.

And it is likely the full legal dues have not been settled over the Ahold affair. The company's auditor during the period in question, Deloitte, is facing legal action from lawyers acting for public pensions schemes in the US. They are seeking damages from the accountancy firm of at least dollars-2 billion (dollars-1.16bn).
Pretty hefty costs indeed.

BRITISH Polythene Industries has escaped a heavy fine after helping the  European Commission to uncover a 20-year-old cartel in Europe's industrial plastic  bags market.

TD
BPI was the first company to provide the EC with decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence and gained full immunity under the EC's leniency procedure for whistle blowers.
The Commission started to investigate the agricultural and  industrial plastic  film market in August 2001. As a result of this BPI conducted a comprehensive competition compliance audit, and uncovered
anti-competitive practices in its  industrial bags businesses in mainland Europe, which BPI acquired in
1997.

BPI said it disclosed this evidence to the EC in November 2001 and applied for leniency. As a result, the EC began a second inquiry, into  industrial plastic bag sales, in 2002 and found that companies had agreed among themselves on sales prices in Germany, the Benelux countries, France and Spain.

The EC said sales directors and managing directors agreed on various aspects of the  cartel, often at meetings of the trade group Valveplast.

An internal memo was discovered stating: "It was subsequently decided to appoint a leader for each customer in order to coordinate the rise in prices." Another said: "In view of the risk taken in this type of meeting and the documentation passed on, this document and all those relating to Valveplast which indicate figures for allocation markets and prices must be destroyed".
These showed that "the producers were aware that their behaviour was illegal", the EC said.

Sixteen companies were  fined a total of e291m. Some had part of their  fines waived for aiding the EC. Others may appeal against the outcome.

BPI chairman Cameron McLatchie said it was gratifying that BPI had been given full immunity. "We hope this marks the end of the matter. BPI is fully committed to ongoing compliance with competition law."

HD      European Commission fines 16 bag makers for price fixing

The European Commission has slapped fines totaling 290 million  euros ($339 million) on 16 industrial plastic  bag makers for operating a price-fixing cartel, some of them for more than 20 years.

A three-year probe into  bag sector practices found that sales directors and even managing directors of competing suppliers, often meeting at their trade association Valveplast, secretly agreed on sales prices for Germany, France, Spain and the Benelux countries, according to the  European Commission.

TD
Quoting from internal association memos, the EC highlighted calls for documents linking Valveplast with
``figures for allocating markets and prices'' to be destroyed.

Documents and other evidence originally was seized by  European Union antitrust inspectors in dawn raids on bag producers in June 2002. The EC probe was launched after British Polythene Industries plc, Europe's top polyethylene film and  bag producer, revealed the  cartel's existence.

Operating cartels is considered a serious breach of EU antitrust legislation and companies found guilty in the past have faced heavy  fines.

Although  fines imposed on some former cartel members were reduced or dropped altogether where a company assisted the EC investigation, other suppliers appeared shaken by the severity of the penalties.

The biggest single  fine of 56.5 million  euros ($66 million) was imposed on UPM-Kymmene Oyj of Helsinki, Finland, in connection with its Rosenlew PE film and sack business. UPM-Kymmene sold that subsidiary, with plants in France and Finland, to Rheinische Kunststoffwerke GmbH (RKW) of Worms, Germany, in December 2000.
Spain's largest PE film converting company, Armando Alvarez SA, and its offshoot, Plásticos Españoles
SA, based in Torrelavega, jointly face a  fine of 42 million euros ($49 million).

Other suppliers  fined large sums include Greven, Germany-based Nordenia International AG and its former unit Nordfolien GmbH of Steinfeld, Germany, with a joint  fine of 39.1 million  euros ($45.7 million); Rheinische Kunststoffwerke GmbH, now a top  European film maker and converter, 39 million  euros ($45.6 million); and German producer Bischof + Klein GmbH & Co. KG, 29.2 million  euros ($34 million). Its French branch, Bischof + Klein France SA, was  fined nearly 4 million euros ($4.7 million).

Smaller fines were imposed on a number of Dutch, French and German  bag producers found to have been involved in the  cartel.
Announcing its decision, EC pointed out it has waived completely the original 53 million euro ($62 million)
fine facing Greenock, Scotland-based British Polythene Industries under European Commission
``leniency arrangements,'' applied because the company was first to provide evidence in the probe.

``It is gratifying that, after so many years of uncertainty, hard work, and cooperation with the  Commission, the group has been granted full immunity. We hope that this marks the end of the matter,'' BPI Chairman Cameron McLatchie said, after the decision was announced.

He acknowledged that the  European Commission still may pursue an original competition law infringement probe, launched in August 2001, into BPI and other producers of agricultural and  industrial films. It was when BPI checked its competition practices companywide that it uncovered evidence of the bags cartel.

In the latest case, several other  bag producers were fined smaller sums, including 12.2 million  euros ($14.3 million) to London-based Low & Bonar plc and its subsidiary Bonar Technical Fabrics NV. That case related to L&B's former heavy-duty sacks and silage stretch-wrap business, Bonar Phormium Packaging NV of Zele, Belgium, which it sold to BPI in 1997.

Following the  European Commission's announcement, L&B called the fine ``disproportionate,'' adding that it will consider appealing once it receives the detailed decision. Those fined should receive the full EC ruling within days.

In Spain, Alvarez admitted shock at the size of the  fine it and its offshoot face. ``We will study the Commission's ruling and prepare a response. But the size of the  fine is incredibly big and out of proportion to the activity involved,'' said financial manager Gonzalo Gomez.

Announcing the  fines, the EC said it had proved that the  bag producers involved were aware their behavior was illegal.

``Together, the producers concerned controlled most of the market in industrial bags in the countries covered by the cartel. In 2001 this was estimated at some 265 million euros [$310 million],'' the EC stated. It called the case ``a very serious offense.''

Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said of the decision: ``Cartels are the worst obstacle to competition and I intend to penalize firms that operate them and so jeopardize the basis of our market economy. ... I am sending a very clear message to company directors that such practices are unacceptable.''

EC has encouraged any company affected by the  cartel's anti-competitive behavior to take the matter to courts of EU member states, using the EC findings to seek damages. If awarded, these damages would be in addition to the  European Commission fines, it said.

The European Commission has imposed a total of EUR 290.71 M ($340 M) worth of  fines on 16 companies for conniving to practice  price-fixing of plastic industrial bags in the Benelux countries France, Germany, and Spain in several cases for more than 20 years until 2002. Among the 16 companies are Fardem Packaging (Edam, Netherlands), Plasticos Espanoles (Torrelavega, Spain) and UPM-Kymmene (Helsinki). UK-based British Polythene Industries, a member of the  cartel, obtained immunity from the  fines after it informed the  commission of the price-fixing scheme.

16 companies have been found guilty of operating a  cartel in the European market for industrial plastic bags. They have been  fined more than EUR 290 M by the European Commission. UPM-Kymmene Oyj, Finland, was  fined EUR 56.55 M and Plasticos Espanoles SA/Armando Alvarez SA was  fined EUR 42 M. British Polythene Industries, itself a member of the  cartel, alerted the authorities in Jun 2002. The company was granted full immunity. Lower fines were imposed on Trioplast and Cofira-Sac which also supplied information to the  Commission. The cartel controlled the majority of the market in Germany, Spain, France and Benelux. The market was estimated in 2001 to be worth EUR 265 M.

HD           UK retailers  call for halt in EU war on Chinese plastic bags

LEADING British retailers are protesting against a threat by the  European Union to impose anti-dumping duties on  plastic bags imported from China, The Times has learnt.

Members of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) have written to Peter Mandelson, the EU's Trade Commissioner, urging him to resist calls from member states to impose protectionist barriers against imports of leather footwear and  plastic bags.

TD
In July the  European Commission launched an investigation into the dumping of  plastic bags by China, Malaysia and Thailand. It is expected to approve retaliatory duties next month on Chinese and Vietnamese leather shoes.
The inquiries into shopping  bags and shoes come after the trade war earlier this year over imports of
Chinese bras and T-shirts, in which the  Commission imposed import quotas.

Every year an estimated 17.5 billion  plastic bags are given away by supermarkets, equivalent to about 290 bags for every person in the UK.

The letter to Mr Mandelson was signed by 13 British retailers, including Stuart Rose, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco, and Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury. It accuses certain EU states of using protectionist measures as a shield against domestic reform.

The letter says: "Retailers will bear the brunt of a policy that favours uncompetitive  European producers at the expense of consumers and those producers who have adapted their businesses to meet the competitive challenge."

Instead, the retailers urge the Commission to leave behind "outdated mechanisms for manageing trade" and focus on reforming Europe's economy.

Last summer the  Commission launched its plastic  bag investigation after 30 EU manufacturers complained that Asian competitors were selling bags for export more cheaply than they were sold on their domestic markets.
Supermarkets and clothing retailers worry that tariffs could add millions of pounds to their costs. In
1997 the EU imposed a 60 per cent retaliatory tariff on  plastic bags from India, accusing their
manufacturers of dumping.

The average plastic bag made in China costs between 1p and 2p, although fancy  bags used by fashion shops could cost double that. A retailer such as Marks & Spencer might use 200 million  bags every year.

A spokesman for the BRC said that the cheapness of the Chinese  bags reflected in part the lower cost of polyethylene in Asia. Referring to the footwear investigation, he said: "Europe should focus on what we are good at, which is design and added value. These investigations are sops to inefficient manufacturers."

SHARES in British Polythene Industries yesterday surged almost 10-per cent after  Europe's largest plastic bag maker, said full-year earnings were expected to exceed market expectations.

Earlier this year, the Port Glasgow-based company reported a 31-per cent rise in halfyear pre-tax profit to GBP10.1m and said it was confident of a full-year result ahead of 2004.

TD
BPI shares closed up 63p at 512p yesterday on the heels of its pre-close trading update.
The company said it will announce its full-year results to the end of December on March 6. "At the same time we advised shareholders of certain issues on trading volumes, margin
compression and energy costs which had the potential to affect the secondhalf results, " BPI said in
statement yesterday.

"We can now report that our business has coped well with these issues and that the results for the full year are likely to exceed current market expectations materially."

Earlier this month BPI was let off the hook for its part in a  Europe-wide pricefixing cartel - although the European Commission levelled Euro90.7m (GBP179.5m) worth of  fines against 16 other companies.

The EC said that BPI "had been involved in infringing activity", it reduced its  fine by "100-per cent to nil" because of the company's successful application for leniency.

A number of these breaches the EC investigated dated back to 1982, and involved companies that were not acquired by BPI until 1997.

HD          BPI shares soar 14 per cent after strong  update

BRITISH Polythene Industries (BPI), the Greenock firm considered  Europe's biggest  plastic               bag-maker, cheered the City yesterday with a trading statement saying it was still on track to beat market expectations for its full-year profits in March. Its shares soared more than 14 per cent to 512p.

The high price of oil has hampered BPI in recent years due to the affect it has on the price of the polymers, which it uses to make its polythene.

TD
The company spooked the market in July with a statement cautioning that further rises in raw material prices could affect its full results.

It had also been hit by the UK's widespread slowdown in consumer spending, as the group's furniture, carpet and DIY customers experience a tough run, meaning they order fewer products.
That came after a trio of alerts in 2004 - a crisis that led to two factory closures south of the Border. Yesterday's share-price rise followed one of more than 3 per cent earlier this month, after it was let off
a GBP 36 million  fine by the European Commission, despite being part of a group of  European firms
found guilty by the EC for operating a cartel.
BPI was excused for being the first company to provide the decisive evidence of the  cartel's existence. BPI, which also makes food packaging for customers such as Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco,
manufactures about 350,000 tonnes a year and is also the largest recycler of polythene waste in the
UK. It has 2,900 staff, including 370 across four Scottish operations.

In the first half, BPI recorded a 31 per cent rise in profits to GBP 10.1m, with sales up to GBP 226m from GBP 189m, and ahead of yesterday's news brokers were forecasting full-year profits of GBP
14.75m, rising to GBP 15.25m.
But the chairman, Cameron McLatchie, indicated it would now beat that figure.

He added that the firm, which has UK bases at sites including Buckhurst Hill in Essex, Scunthorpe and Brampton in Cumbria, had feared lower trading volumes and the impact of rising energy costs would hit earnings in the second half.

"We can now report that our business has coped well with these issues and that the results for the full year are likely to exceed current market expectations materially," he said.
