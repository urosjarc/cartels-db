BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union regulators Tuesday  fined German company William Prym GmbH&Co. KG and Britain's Coats Holdings Ltd a total of euro60 million (US$76.8 million) for running a cartel in the market for  needles.

The European Commission said the companies had also entered into illegal agreements between 1994 and 1999 to share out markets in other haberdashery products such as pins, buttons and zip fasteners.

TD
The EU said the European market for haberdashery was worth over euro1 billion (US$1.28 billion) last year. It said it was imposing  fines of euro30 million (US$38.4 million) each for Coats and Prym because the impact of the  cartel was limited.

Another British company involved in the  cartel, Enatco Group Ltd, was granted immunity by the EU since it came forward to inform regulators about the operation.

"Cartel behavior is the worst kind of antitrust violation since it earns companies illicit profits on the back of customers and, ultimately, end consumers," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

A British company has been  fined €30.2m (£21m) for jointly running a European  cartel in sewing
needles.

The EU said the European market for haberdashery was worth almost 1bn (£700m) last year. It said it was imposing fines of €30.2m (£21m) each for Coats and Prym because the impact of the  cartel was limited.

BRUSSELS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined two needle makers 60 million euros ($76.77 million) on Tuesday for operating a five-year haberdashery cartel, the EU executive said.

Britain's Coats Holdings Ltd and Germany's William Prym GmbH & Co. KG ran a  cartel in the needle market and segmented the European market for  needles, pins, buttons, fasteners and zips between September 1994 and December 1999, the Commission said.

TD
"Cartel behaviour is the worst kind of antitrust violation since it earns companies illicit profits on the back of customers and ultimately, end consumers," outgoing Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.
A third company, Britain's Entaco Group Ltd, received full immunity from  fines for alerting the
Commission to the deals.

"The markets concerned are essential to the garment and leather industry and are also used by end consumers in their daily lives," the Commission said.

The firms entered a series of written agrements to share the  needle market and kept Entaco from competing in other haberdashery markets such as pins or fasteners, it added.

The Commission said its evidence showed Coats, one of Europe's main haberdashery distributors, had forced Entaco into market sharing  agreements with Prym. In exchange, Coats had protected Entaco's "Milward" needle brand from competition.

Privately owned Entaco is the EU's largest manufacturer of hand sewing  needles while Coats is the world's largest supplier of industrial sewing thread, according to their websites.

British company Coats Holdings Ltd and Germany's William Prym GmbH&Co KG have each been  fined
€30 million by European regulators for operating a  cartel in the needle market.

Reporting the ruling yesterday the European Commission said the two firms and their subsidiaries were also guilty of illegal market sharing  agreements between September 1994 and the end of 1999 for other ancillary products such as pins, buttons, fasteners and zips.

TD
Another British company, Entaco, was also involved, but received full immunity from the  fines because it brought the  market sharing  agreements to the Commission's attention.

The three companies are said to have made a series of written agreements under which product markets were shared.

Specifically they shared the  needle market and kept Entaco from competing in other haberdashery markets such as pins or fasteners.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: "Cartel behaviour is the worst kind of antitrust violation since it earns companies illicit profits on the back of customers and, ultimately, end consumers."

Unlike most cartels which consist of price agreements or the allocation of production or sales quotas by country this one solely concerned a pure product and geographic  market sharing  arrangement.

The Commission said evidence showed that Coats forced Entaco into market sharing  agreements with Prym at the manufacturing level. In exchange, Entaco's own private label needle brand 'Milward' was protected from competition by Coats' and Prym's brands.
The European haberdashery market was estimated at more than one billion euros in 2003.

HD     (EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission fines Coats and Prym for cartel on haberdashery market

Brussels, 27/10/2004 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has just imposed fines totalling 60 million EUR on Coats and Prym for having operated a cartel on the needle market with the company Entaco, and for having segmented the European haberdashery products market (needles, pins, buttons, zip and fasteners) between 10 September 1994 and the end of 1999. The Commission gave Entaco full immunity from  fines for producing the proof without which the  market sharing  agreements may never have been discovered. "Cartel behaviour is the worst kind of antitrust violations since it earns companies illicit profits on the back of their customers and, ultimately, end consumers", said Mario Monti. "I am happy that one of the last decisions in this field concerns a product clearly recognisable by consumers", added the Competition Commissioner (before the decision was taken to postpone the investiture of the Barroso Commission).

TD
The Commission found that the British companies Coats Holdings Ltd and Entaco Group Ltd, plus the German William Prym GmbH&Co. KG and their respective subsidiaries violated EU competition rules by signing a series of written agreements which equated in practice to a tripartite agreement, whereby they shared or helped to share the markets for these products. Specifically they shared the  needle market and kept Entaco from competing in other haberdashery markets such as pins or fasteners.

In a press release, the Commission stresses that the affair is quite unique, in that "the infringement concerns a pure product and geographic  market sharing  agreement". Most cartels are agreements on price and, occasionally, the allocation of sales quotas to the various market players. But the ultimate aim
is always to keep prices high to the detriment of clients and consumers. The Commission observes that in this case, product  market sharing  agreements are applied at different levels, those of production and distribution, and to the wholesale and retail markets. The evidence gathered in Brussels reveals that Coats, one of Europe's largest distributors of  needles, played a fundamental role in the tripartite agreement, because it forced Entaco to conclude and implement the  market sharing  agreements concluded with Prym for production, in exchange for protection for its own "Milward" brand of  needles against competition from the two other companies.

The Commission feels that this behaviour is a "very serious" infringement of article 81 of the EU Treaty. The European haberdashery market was estimated at over a billion EUR in 2003, but as the Commission feels that the  cartel's impact was limited, it has imposed the following  fines on the companies: 30 million EUR on Coats and 30 million EUR on Prym. The Commission decided to exonerate Entaco fully from fines, as this company provided it with the information which enabled its decision to be taken.

EUROPE'S antitrust watchdog has hit a Guinness Peat Group subsidiary with a <<sup.>>30.2 million (NZ$55.4 million)  fine for operating a sewing  needle cartel.

The European Commission said centuries-old thread maker Coats Holdings, acquired by Guinness Peat this year, also entered into illegal agreements with German competitor William Prym to divide up European markets for haberdashery products, such as zips, pins and buttons.

Cartel behaviour was the "worst kind of antitrust violation", competition commissioner Mario Monti said. "It earns companies illicit profits on the back of customers."

GPG director and Coats chairman Gary Weiss said Coats disputed the commission's findings. "We fully intend to appeal and to vigorously defend our rights," he said.

GPG had been aware of the matter when it took control of the company in 2003 and a "level of provisioning" had been made within Coats, Dr Weiss said. But the amount earmarked to settle any fine had never been disclosed. Given that Coats intended to appeal, it was too early to estimate the final effect on Coats or GPG, he said.

GPG's New Zealand-based director, Tony Gibbs, said the investment company was obviously concerned about the size of the  fine. "But it's a long way from being settled."
Macquarie Equities investment director Arthur Lim said if the $55 million had to be paid it would cut
GPG's net tangible assets by 6.5 cents a share. "The greater issue is really whether this means
that the earnings of Coats have been artificially high in the past," he said.

GPG shares fell 3c on the New Zealand stock exchange yesterday, to close at $2. They have fallen more than 8 per cent this month.

The commission said Coats, one of the biggest distributors of  needles and other haberdashery products in Europe, forced another British company, Entaco Group, to enter market-sharing agreements with Prym. In return, Coats and Prym gave Entaco's private label needle brand, Milward, protection from competition.

Prym was also fined <<sup.>>30 million, but Entaco was granted immunity because it had brought the arrangements to the regulator's attention.

The commission said the European haberdashery market was worth almost <<sup.>>1 billion last year. It had settled on the  fines because the effect of the  cartel was limited.

SIX Hollywood studios have settled charges of unfair price competition in the sale of films to
pay-television channels in the EU. They agreed to drop a "most favoured studio" clause, obliging
pay-television companies in at least five European countries to pay similar prices. Two studios -
Paramount and NBC Universal - are still holding onto the clause. Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti said he expected the two studios to come around soon.
THE European Commission fined three British companies €60 million for operating a  cartel in the
needle market and for dividing up the European market for haberdashery products.

DRUGS giant Novartis has won EU marketing approval for its Emselex drug, to be used for the treatment of an overactive bladder. Approval was granted for all 25 EU member states as well as Norway and Iceland.

ORACLE has won approval from the  European Commission for its takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a rival software maker application for businesses. The Commission said that even though the proposed
merger reduced the number of big players from three to two, the markets would remain sufficiently competitive.

US AMBASSADOR to the EU Rockwell Schnabel called on businesses to participate actively in the transatlantic Economic Stakeholders dialogue. Agreed at the June 2004 EU-US summit in Ireland, the dialogue aims at developing concrete ideas for eliminating trade barriers between the two blocs.

Shares in Guinness Peat Group recovered yesterday after its largest subsidiary, the world's leading thread company Coats, was fined EUR30 million ($51 million) by the  European Commission earlier this week for operating a cartel in the needle market between 1994 and 1999.

After falling 4 ¢ on Wednesday, the shares gained 7 ¢ to $1.93 yesterday as analysts maintained their optimistic views on the stock and suggested that the Coats' decision would be appealed.

TD
The exposure to the  fines was disclosed, but not quantified, by GPG in presentations to the market when the full takeover offer for Coats was made in April.

Goldman Sachs JBWere said that if an expected appeal was unsuccessful, and Coats was liable to pay the full  fine, its net asset value assessment of GPG would fall by 6 ¢ to $2.01.

However, Goldman said it understood the  fines would be vigorously appealed, since management believed that the factual basis of the decision was flawed and the magnitude of the  fine was excessive.

The broker maintained a short-term "outperform" recommendation and long-term "buy" rating on the stock.

Analysts at UBS yesterday lowered their valuation on GPG by 3 ¢ per share but maintained a "buy" recommendation on the stock.

"We believe Coats has been acquired cheaply by GPG because of the need for a capital injection as the industry works its way through a restructuring process due to the abolition of tariffs and quotas
on apparel by the WTO [World Trade Organisation]," New Zealand-based UBS analyst Stuart
Graham said.

"Coats has a network of established plants in the lower-cost production areas, which are most likely to benefit from the regulation change as customers migrate production."

Ron Brierley's GPG has 31 per cent of its total assets invested in Coats, which has undergone major restructuring in recent years, including moving its manufacturing to Asia, especially China.

UBS said the announcement of a  fine was a negative but it needed to be viewed in relation to the potential restructuring value that may be created in due course.

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Guinness Peat Group Plc chairman Ron Brierley has vowed to take on the European Commission (EC) over its decision to  fine British thread maker Coats 30 mln stg for operating a cartel in the needle market in the 1990s. Brierley described the  fine as "grossly disproportionate" in a statement accompanying the London and Australia-listed group's annual results. "The next stage of these proceedings is a more formal tribunal hearing at which the company has much greater rights of advocacy, which will be actively pursued," Brierley said. Coats is GPG's largest subsidiary, making up almost a third of its total assets. GPG bought into Coats in 2003 after the alleged  cartel behaviour took place and took full ownership at the end of last year. GPG is waiting for the results of two other investigations into Coats by the EC. It has set aside a provision but expects the process could be drawn out over the next two to three years.

TD
GPG reported a drop in pretax profit for 2004 to 34 mln stg from 87.7 mln stg a year earlier after being hit by a combination of lower asset sales, a loss on the Coats business and adverse exchange rates. (1 usd =

Not content with stirring up company boards, Guinness Peat Group's Sir Ron Brierley has vowed to take on the  European Commission.

In his annual statement to shareholders, Sir Ron says he is unhappy with the EC's decision to  fine British thread maker Coats £30 million ($73 million) for operating a  cartel in the needle market in the 1990s.

TD
Coats is GPG's largest subsidiary, making up almost a third of its total assets. GPG wasn't around when the alleged  cartel behaviour took place - it bought into Coats in 2003, taking full ownership at the end of last year.
But Sir Ron has promised to fight the decision. He describes the  fine as "grossly disproportionate". "The next stage of these proceedings is a more formal tribunal hearing at which the company has
much greater rights of advocacy, which will be actively pursued," Sir Ron said in the statement.

GPG is waiting for the results of two other investigations into Coats by the EC. It has set aside a provision but expects the process could be drawn out over the next two to three years.

Sir Ron described GPG's 60 per cent drop in net profit to ££25.3 million last year as a "modest" result, which was hit by write-downs on some investments, unfavourable currency moves and fewer asset sales.

UBS analyst Stuart Graham said it was difficult to interpret the result because of the lumpy nature of asset sales. He said it was important to look at the unrealised gains on GPG's balance sheet, which were £87 million at the end of December.
Since balance date, GPG sold most of its shareholding in hotels-owner De Vere Group, worth about
£33 million.

Sir Ron said GPG would continue to be the major shareholder in life insurer Tower and its funds management spin-off, Australian Wealth Management.

"This is the first significant move by Tower since GPG became involved several years ago and it is very positive for all concerned," he said.

AWM still has to finalise its rights issue underwritten by GPG, which could end up with about 35 per cent of the company.

GPG wrote off its entire £6 million investment in troubled electronic payment machine provider Intellect. It also took a hit from its investment in cash-strapped Capral Aluminium but Sir Ron said GPG was committed to the investment and was underwriting a $32 million capital raising for the company.

OPERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the GrafTech fourth quarter conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today's presentation, instructions will be given for the question and answer session. If anyone needs assistance at any time during the conference, please press star followed by the zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, March 15 of 2005. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Elise Garofalo., Director of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.

ELISE GARAFALO, DIRECTOR INVESTOR RELATIONS, GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD: Thanks, Mary. Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. At this time each of you should have received a copy of our press release. If you haven't and you need a copy, please call Julie Drexler [sp] at
302-778-8244 and we can fax or email you a copy.

TD
Before we get started, I'd like to remind all of you that both this release and this call contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Please note the cautionary language of our forward-looking statements contained in our release. That same language applies to this call. Also, to the extent we discuss any nonGAAP information, you'll find reconciliations at the back of our press release.

This morning on the call we have Craig Shuler, Chief Executive Officer, John Wetula, President of our Natural Graphite line of business, and Corrado Gasperis our CFO. At this point I liked to hand the call over to Craig.

CRAIG SHULER, CEO, GRAFTECH INTERNATIONAL LTD: Thank you, Elise. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining GrafTech's conference call. Today we will take you through our fourth quarter and our full year 2004 highlights, then open it up to questions. In the fourth quarter, net income before special charges was 11 million, or $0.11 per share, as compared to net income of $0.06 per share in the '03 fourth quarter. Net sales increased 23 percent to $232 million, and gross profit came in at 57 million representing
a 26 percent improvement year-over-year. The improvements were mainly due to our graphite electrode business where both sales volume and prices increased.

Graphite electrode sales volume was just under 60,000 metric tons or 13 percent higher than Q4 '03. In our other business segment sales were 26 million as compared to 17 million in 2003. Gross profit was also up about 27 percent primarily driven by increases in electronic thermal management and carbon refractory sales.
Next we'd like to turn to our '04 overall results and achievements. During the year we achieved strong
year-over-year growth. Sales were up over 19 percent to approximately $850 million. Gross profit increased
25 percent to 210 million. EBITDA of 147 million, before special items, represented a 40 percent
improvement over 2003 and a doubling over 2002. Our team has worked hard to improve EBITDA margins
and over the last two years we have grown them from about 11.7 percent to over 17 percent.

Finally, net income of $0.43 per share, before special charges, was more than double 2003. During the year, our team set graphite electrode production records and achieved an annual graphite electrode sales volume of over 220,000 metric tons. Our team also had continued success commercializing advantage technologies. We grew our ETM sales from 2 million to 12 million in 2004.

We expanded our global ETM team and secured orders from industry leaders such as Del, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic in fast growing applications that range from plasma flat screen TVs, to cell phones, to lap
top computers. We received the prestigious R&D 100 Award for the second consecutive year for our break through ETM products.

Turning to capital structure, our team also was successful in making significant improvements to our capital structure and putting several large legacy liabilities behind us. We completed a 225 million convertible debenture issue, securing a very attractive 1 5/8 coupon. We reduced our most expensive debt, our 10 1/4 senior notes, by $58 million. In the past two years we reduced these 10 1/4 notes by $115 million. We recently completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility, securing 215 million in liquidity, reducing the interest rate spread by more than 110 basis points and obtaining less restrictive financial covenance. Our improved financial performance in '04 positioned us for this successful refinance. Our capital structure is now stable with no repayments due until 2010, and has liquidity to support the growth of our businesses.

Finally on the legacy liability front, over the past six years we have paid out more than 400 million to fund legacy anti-trust liabilities. Including more than 70 million to the  European commission and the DOJ in anti-trust  fines during 2004. We are now close to putting these legacy anti-trust liabilities behind us, with only 26 million remaining to be paid to the Department of Justice after the end of 2005. In 2004, we also funded 42 million of defined benefit pension obligations that were frozen in 2003. This achieved almost a
90 percent pension funding status for us in our U.S. pension plan.

This is up from a 50 to 60 percent level just a couple years ago. A year and a half ago we announced that we are terminating our U.S. Post Retirement Medical Plan effective 12/31/05. 2006 forward this will save us approximately 3 to $5 million per year. Also in 2004, we reduced expensive accounts receivable
discounting by approximately $45 million. In total, our actions in this area in 2004 represent over 150 million of legacy liabilities that our team has put behind us.

Finally, closing out '04, we are pleased to announce that our team and our external auditors, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, have both completed the assessment of our internal controls as required by Sarbanes Oxley and concluded that GTI's controls are effective. Sarbanes Oxley, as you will recall, resulted in over $5 million of additional expenses for our company last year. Now turning to the 2005 outlook.

As we stated early last year, we modified the terms and conditions under which we sell graphite electrodes in order to build more flexibility to adjust pricing based on market conditions. After assessing graphite electrode supply demand balance, tightness in the supply of quality  needle coke and rising production costs, including inflation and the continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, we initiated a base price adjustment in December.

We successfully executed a base price adjustment of approximately $440 per metric ton on all orders received prior to November 1, that were subject to our new terms and conditions. The base price adjustment we instituted should not be confused with a surcharge and is not tied to an index or a specific
raw material input. The balance of the '05 melter electrode business has been booked in the $3,500 per ton plus change. As a result of the aforementioned, we expect melter electrode average revenue per metric ton to be up by approximately $600, or 24 percent higher than 2004.

In the nonmelter graphite electrode segment prices -- segment, prices vary significantly due to the variety of end markets an performance requirements across those end markets. We expect average revenue for metric ton in this segment to increase approximately $100 as compared to '04. Based on the actions and results to date, 2005 graphite electrode revenue per metric ton, including both melter and nonmelter segments, is expected to be between 2,900 and $3,000 per metric ton. Approximately 15 to 20 percent higher than 2004.

Graphite electrode sales volume is expected to be 210,000 metric tons for '05. We expect graphite electrode production costs to increase between 10 and 12 percent in '05 versus '04. Half of this increase is due to inflation in cost, especially petroleum coke, energy and freight. The balance is the result of the impact of the weak U.S. dollar on our production facilities outside the U.S. To date, we have secured firm price contracts for approximately 75 percent of our graphite electrode production costs. In 2005, we are targeting at least a 50 percent increase in ETM sales to achieve revenues of 18 to 20 million.

We will continue to develop break through ETM products and solutions that enable our customers to be leaders in designing smaller, lighter, and more powerful electronic devices. We are excited about the opportunities in this business and will continue to invest in people and technologies to grow this business. Based on our 2005 guidance, we expect net income before other income and expense to be about 55 million to 65 million in 2005, or 25 to 50 percent higher than last year.

We expect 2005 free cash flow, before anti-trust and restructuring payments, to be approximately 25 million or an 82 million increase as compared to a cash use of 57 million in 2004. This improvement includes an expected improvement of 60 to 70 million in cash flow from operations. As you read in our press release,
we are transitioning our guidance to cash base measures consistent with how we run our business, incent our employees, and build long term value.


Page 28 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
On a quarterly basis, we will review and discuss in detail key business and cash flow drivers including market conditions, strategic and operational initiatives and other relevant factors expected to affect our business. In addition, because we do not believe that short term guidance is conducive to creating long term value, we will no longer provide quarterly EPS guidance.

Turning to Q1 '05, we expect the first quarter of '05 to be our weakest quarter of the year. In addition to it being a seasonally slow quarter, rising graphite electrode prices last year resulted in customers taking all tons available under their 2004 annual contracts in the fourth quarter. Finally, our recent pricing actions have contributed to our lower Q1 volume. We expect graphite electrode sales volume to be about 45,000 tons in Q1. With that, we would like to open it up to questions, please.

OPERATOR: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question and answer session. If you have a question, please press the star, followed by the one on your push button phone. If you would like to decline from the polling process press the star followed by the two. You will hear a three tone prompt acknowledging your selection.

Your questions will be pulled in the order they are received. If you are on speaker phone, please lift the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Michael Gambardella with JP Morgan. Please, go ahead.
MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Yes, good morning, Craig. CRAIG SHULER: Good morning, Mick. How are you today?
MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: Okay. Good morning. I have a couple questions. First on the cost front, can you give us an indication of the  needle coke cost that you hadn't secured back in November, you know, how much did that go up over the first 90 percent of the prices that you locked in?

CRAIG SHULER: The -- Mike, the  needle coke price has continued to go up virtually every couple of weeks, starting with Q3 when the announcement on the Lamont coker closure came out. And at that point in time, coke prices, depending on the grade, were roughly in the range of 500 to $550 a metric ton. And from that period to today, we've had -- we've seen in the markets, spot prices for petroleum coke rise to
$750 a metric ton plus, so there's been a significant increase from that point in time.

MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: I mean, what is your outlook for '06 on neo-coke? Do you expect just a significant increase over the average cost that you had in '05?

CRAIG SHULER: It's early to tell. This negotiation will usually begin in the middle of this year to the third quarter. But I would expect, if we continue to see the strong oil price and for sure I believe we're going to continue to see the tightness in the quality coke market that we would be anticipating higher petroleum coke prices on '06 than '05. It's early to tell what percentage, but the direction we believe is upward and that will put a greater pressure upward on graphite electrode prices.

MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: And on the -- the 25 percent of your cost for '05 that you haven't locked in yet, what are those costs?

CRAIG SHULER: Mike, those are in the area of three or four buckets. It's natural gas, power, freight and metallurgical coke. Now each one of those we have some hedges in place and some  fixing  for the year. Natural price I would say probably about 75 to 80 percent is open right now. And a lot of that we stayed at the spot rate, which has been bouncing around 6. A lot of that's because the forward curve was so steep and so expense that thus far that's been the right thing to do and we've gotten a better price.

A bit of our power is floating freight. We've done a lot of work securing and  fixing  freight costs, but we still have some carriers that are allowed, if there is a spike in oil, to pass on some surcharges on whether it be bunker fuel or diesel. And then metallurgical coke, as I'm sure you know in the steel industry, has gone short.

We have all the requirement we need, but as far as  fixing  the price, the metallurgical coke industry has been very reluctant to give annual prices and we've probably only fixed out for, oh, about nine months of this year, so we've probably got about one-quarter, the last quarter of this year would be open to price; not supply, just price.
MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: And how much metallurgical coke do you use? CRAIG SHULER: Our annual spend's probably about $20 million.
MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: But, in terms of volume?


Page 29 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: It's -- metallurgic coke is, I believe, around $40 a ton. So, it's running right around $40 a ton. So, we use quite a bit of it. It's gone up. As you know, it's one of our raw materials that's almost almost doubled in price. As you've seen in many of the other, you know, coking, coal, et cetera. Most are 86 to 100 percent up.

MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: And then last question, just on your volume guidance was down quite a bit from where you thought you would have been, and it seems like, you know, with the new 250,000 ton capacity, that you're running about 84 percent of capacity.

Could you talk a little bit about that in terms of, you know, you must have lost some share based on the price initiative that you had started in December? And -- and why are you not seeing others following your price initiative in December?

CRAIG SHULER: Okay. Good. Let me address those, Mike. The first one on our capacity. Right now we can comfortably produce something north of 230,000 tons a year. And you'll recall our target was to exit '05 somewhere around the 250,000 ton range. So right now our capacity sits somewhere around 230 to, call it
240. Last year we sold 222,000 metric tons. We have not given any guidance for '05, so we haven't set any expectations or numbers out there, of course.

But this year, it looks like we will do about 210 and all of that movement, from 222 down to 210 is 100 percent due to our pricing actions. Holding firm on price, trying to bring the price up in , in -- for our product and get a fair price for our product. And I think as you've seen, we initiated I think five increases, last year, in price. Plus a BPA, trying to keep up with raw material increases and, like we said, get to a fair price of our product. And so we were willing to give up volume. We held very firm on that.

As far as the others, you know, it's hard to, you know, speak to their strategy, but obviously, you know, we have initiated most of the price increases in this industry. Over the course of last year, we had some following and movement in the price upwards. In December, of course, we went out with a $4,000 price increase, and for whatever reason, the competition has not moved to that kind of level. I think the last price published by the competition was in January 14 or 15. They were back at 3,650 a metric ton. I really can't speak to why they -- why they stay back at 3,650 a metric ton when we're at 4,000, given all of the petroleum based cost pressures and energy pressures that we have in our industry.

MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: Now, did you get the $0.20 per pound price increase in just the U.S. or have you gotten it elsewhere?

CRAIG SHULER: That's, Mike, you're referring to the BPA and that's 440 a metric ton or U.S. pricing, $0.20 of course.

We were very successful in that program, Mike, and we took the approach that we really had to treat everybody the same. I mean, no one likes price increases, so we treated everybody the same and we executed that virtually 100 percent across the board, everywhere where the contract allowed that.

So that would be U.S., Mexico, western hemisphere, Europe, and Asia. So we had success in virtually every geography, wherever the contract allowed that to take place.
MICHAEL GAMBARDELLA: Okay. Very good. Thank you. CRAIG SHULER: Thank you, Mike.
OPERATOR: thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Levy with Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead.

BRETT LEVY, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO: Can you give a little bit of an update, obviously you guys are spending some money to bring some more capacity online, and also, can you give an update on what you're hearing kind of around the world about additional capacity coming on away from you guys?
CRAIG SHULER: Thanks, Brett. How are you today? BRETT LEVY: Very well, thank you.
CRAIG SHULER: Yeah, we had some opportunities as we've talked the last couple years to de-bottleneck some of our plants. In some cases with a bit of CapEx, in other cases just with process know how, improving the cycle time that we make graphite electrodes. And having six well positioned graphite electrode plants around the world on four continents, you know, the best platform in the industry, we feel one of our competitive advantages is to go ahead and exercise that and execute on those process technology improvements and de-bottlenecking.


Page 30 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So, as you've seen over the last couple of years, we've taken that capability from 180,000 metric tons to
230 and, and as I said earlier, we're probably north of that maybe closer to 240 and our stated goal has
been to try and exit '05 closer to the 250 range. So I think you'll see us continue to, you know, where we
have very attractive de-bottleneck productivity opportunities we'll continue to do that.

And your second question, on what about others? From what we see, we believe our two Indian competitors are doing the same kinds of things in their plants. We believe they're trying to de-bottleneck. They're not building new plants. No one's done that for 30 years. But they're de-bottlenecking their plants and as we've said on prior calls we think they're attempting to get another 15, between the two of them 15 or 20,000-tons out of those -- the plants they have in India. Brett, finally, to your question, obviously we've worked very hard to get a fair price for our product and we've been willing to sacrifice volume to try and execute on that.

And as you see prices up 15 to 20 percent, and I think if you compare that to where some of the competitors are, you'll see that absolutely we've gotten a higher pricing and sacrificed volume if we had to.

BRETT LEVY: All right. And then, can you talk to what CapEx is going to be for '05, kind of the in the current mode and what the major projects will be?

CRAIG SHULER: Yeah, Brett. It will be around 45 to 50 million. The majority of that will be regular working budget to keep the plants running well and productive. There's probably 3, 4 million in there for AET type capital, as we continue to grow that business. As, as you know that's gone very well for us. So probably, you know, 10, 12 percent of that number is pointed toward AET/ETM et cetera. And then there's probably about another 5 to 6 million that I would put in the bucket of kind of de-bottleneck/productivity improvements in our plants.

Where, very attractively, we can de-bottleneck or automate a function or put in some new process technology and really get a much better capability out of it. I think if you talk to the trade, our quality over the last five years has ramped up and improved nicely and we're probably producing the best most stable electrode we have in the last ten years.

BRETT LEVY: All right. Then the last question is a longer-term type question. There's been less and less emphasis in your -- in your press releases and your conference calls on, you know, the Ballard arrangements, car batteries, that sort of thing. Given where the price of fuel is right now, has there been any increased initiative in that direction or, you know -- just can you give a little bit of an update there?

CRAIG SHULER: I sure can, Brett. Brett, our view of Ballard and the opportunities in fuel cells have never been better. And the only reason you may see us talk a little bit less of it, because it's probably out there six to ten years, we've tried not to oversell and get people ahead of it. But obviously, I think you've seen
Ballard make some great advances.

As you know they're our 100 percent exclusive supply arrangement we have with then, where they buy our flow field material out to 2016, and so you've seen their bus program in Europe, in Beijing and Singapore. Very, very successful, tremendous performance results. That's 100 percent our product and I think more recently you see the U.S. government, Japanese government, as you said in some cases in response to oil prices and availability, really start to get on the fuel cell program.

So we think what you're going to see over the next three to five years is much more attention and awareness in this area. We've added people and we have a dedicated team, a strong, strong relationship with Ballard, who, as you know, has probably 85 percent of the fuel cell cars that are out on the road today.

All of those are our product so we see nothing but upside there. And tightness in oil and oil prices really get those programs going and the government grant money flowing to support it.

BRETT LEVY: All right, and last question. On the working capital front, can you give a little bit of guidance for, you know, first quarter or all of '05? Obviously your raw material costs are moving upward. Can you give some sense as to where you see your investment in working capital this year?

CRAIG SHULER: Yeah, Brett, for all of '05 it's probably going to take about 25 to 30 million in working capital. Higher prices for our product in receivables and of course our costs have gone up 10 percent to 12 percent. So 25 to $30 million increase.
BRETT LEVY: Thanks much, guys.
CRAIG SHULER: Brett, thank you very much. Have a good day.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Caldwell with WPG. Please go ahead.

JERRY FARBER (ph), ANALYST, WPG: Hello.
CRAIG SHULER: Yes, sir.

JERRY FARBER (ph): This is Jerry Farber (sp). I guess what I'm trying to reconcile is, you know, you mentioned before it's hard to account for the competitors and that not following with your price increase. Presumably over time, your demand and, you know, capac -- capacity, supply demand situation is related
to steel demand. And, you know, all the data we're seeing is for extremely strong trends in steel output and the like. Are there some geographic pockets or classes of product that might account for the industry being not as tight?

You know, again, the industry being your carbon product, being the raw products not being in total, and quite a supply, demand position or , you know, it just -- it seems a little strange that price increases are not being sustained in the part of competitors with such a tight and high demand market. Can you help us understand why that would be?

CRAIG SHULER: Jerry, we share your observation. The melter EAF electrode segment, our number one segment which is 70 percent of our volume, remains very tight. And I think you hear it from us and you hear it from the competition on their calls, you hear it from the steel industry. So, you're absolutely right. The melter electrode market is tight. It's been tight now for a year and a half.

And there are no geographic pockets that are upsetting, you know, this global balance. Electrodes move around the world. So, it remains tight, and we share with you, you know, how do we understand, given all the cost increases and this is a petroleum based product with energy, why -- why we haven't gotten to a more fair level for our product.

JERRY FARBER (ph): So right now there's no accounting for the lack of price follow-through on the part of your competitors. It doesn't sound like there's any material increase in capacity by your competitors or by yourself, vis a vis the demand situation out there.

CRAIG SHULER: That -- that's correct. Melter electrodes remain tight. Costs are going up, and we will continue to monitor the situation and, as I said, we increase price five times last year plus a base price adjustment as we make every effort to get a fair price for the product and a fair return. Our customers want high performing electrodes at the technology CapEx so...

JERRY FARBER (ph): And, and just following up, in the first quarter, you said there is - a) there's a tough compare, vis a vis last year. Is there's also seasonality that would allow the customer base to shift up from one supplier to another and is that -- does that, does that seasonality change in subsequent quarters where the customers would not have that latitude?

CRAIG SHULER: Jerry, that's spot on. Q1 historically is the slower quarter of the year. It's usually our lowest quarter. And so Q1 we did see some slowness in the market and of course, customers have a chance to use some of the graphite electrode inventory. There is some of that shifting as you talk. But Q2 onward, historically, and what we see in our book, is much stronger.

JERRY FARBER (ph): So the -- is a good part of the decline forecast on an annual basis, which is, I guess, about 12,000 tons or there about?
CRAIG SHULER: That's right. That's right. About 12, 15,000 tons.

JERRY FARBER (ph): Is the bulk of that -- is the bulk of that occurring as you put your forecast together in the Q1 shortfall, or are you building in some declines in subsequent quarters?

CRAIG SHULER: The majority of it's in the first quarter. We've also prudently trimmed a little bit from the subsequent quarter, but most of it is in Q1.

JERRY FARBER (ph): Okay. But...okay, so you're just doing that just to be prudent, as you say. But there's no indication of full year outlook loosening up in terms of the capacity/demand situation.
CRAIG SHULER: That's right, you're correct.

JERRY FARBER (ph): So, it is possible that subsequent to Q1 we -- it's possible given current conditions, we might see the higher run rates that number of people were thinking about given supply demand because, as you know, a lot of analysts' forecasts were in the 230 to 250 range on a full year basis, or you thinking that run rate is now unrealistic in subsequent quarters?
CRAIG SHULER: Yeah. I think the analysts were around 225, 230. JERRY FARBER (ph): Um-humm.
Page 32 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: We would stick firmly with our 210 and we would guide you to that 210.

JERRY FARBER (ph): No, I understand that at 210, but I'm just wondering, again, is it possible that we could see higher run rates because of things so skewed in terms of the, you know, the decline in the first quarter, as you eluded to.

CRAIG SHULER: Well, it's possible. Recall the lower volume is 100 percent due to our stance and firmness on price.
JERRY FARBER (ph): Yeah.
CRAIG SHULER: Not the quality of our product, ability to deliver, et cetera. All of that is superb. JERRY FARBER (ph): Right. Okay, thank you.
CRAIG SHULER: Thank you, Jerry.
OPERATOR: our next question comes from Robert LaGaipa with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. ROBERT LAGAIPA, ANALYST, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: Thank you.
CRAIG SHULER: Morning, Bob. How are you today? ROBERT LAGAIPA: Good, and your self, Craig CRAIG SHULER: Great, thanks.
ROBERT LAGAIPA: I just had a number of questions for you. I guess one, just getting back to the, the volume issue -- the volume decline from the 222 to the 210.

Can you give us some sense of, you know, just -- I know someone had mentioned just from a demand perspective, geographically, where you might be seeing weakness and you mentioned that , you know, the demand out there is, is very strong certainly for steel production globally, but, can you talk about where you're meeting the most resistance, on a geographic basis, relative to these price announcements?

CRAIG SHULER: The one at -- the one we referred to earlier at 3650 is a global price, So I would say it is an all geographies in general, okay? So let's start with that premise.
ROBERT LAGAIPA: Um-humm.

CRAIG SHULER: That's number one. If I look at the more difficult environments, you know, one would, of course, be western Europe, where steel growth and the economies there have been lagging what we've seen, of course, in the Americas and Asia. So, if, you know, kind of a subcategory would be Europe remains still, you know, the two to three type growth. Germany, high unemployment, 11 percent unemployment. So I would say Europe is the more difficult of the group. But globally, we have quite a difference, as we said earlier.

ROBERT LAGAIPA: Right. The other question is, you had mentioned that, you know, the cost. I mean, you know, obviously, from a variable cost perspective, I mean, you're seeing 5 percent lower volumes, but you're seeing the cost jump 10 to 12 percent obviously the pricing's up, you know, quite a bit. But, you know, where I'm trying to get, you know, some sense of reconciliation is, just relative to these -- these base price adjustments, the $440 a ton. And you mention that that applies to the contract that are subject to that adjustment.

Can you give us some color relative to, you know, the percentage of the contracts that are subject to that adjustment versus those that aren't. You know, because if you had contracts for example that, you know, were signed maybe, you know, in their -- late part of summer, early part of summer that may have not been subject to those adjustments, obviously that would -- that would account for the difference there. Can you maybe just, you know, provide some color on that?

CRAIG SHULER: Let me give you first some annual and then maybe a little more detail. Sure. You know, if we look on a year-over- year basis in '03 the average graphite electrode price was about $2,500 a metric ton. And you'll recall we have 70 percent melter and 30 percent nonmelter. And we spoke about the melter, the 70 percent going up $600 a metric ton and the nonmelter going up about $100 a metric ton. And so if you weight those for the 70/30, that's about a $450 increase, add it on to your 2500, you get to the middle
of our guidance, 2950. That's the year over year.

If I give you some color on the BPA, the BPA we applied very evenly to all customers whose orders were received prior to November 1. And we really had no exceptions there. And we tried to treat every customer

Page 33 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
equally, fairly, no one likes a price increase, obviously. We don't like them. We fight like hell. Our customers fight like hell, you know, as they should. But given the cost pressure, et cetera, we executed and we're very pleased with it -- the way it went.

ROBERT LAGAIPA: But were 100 percent of those contracts that you signed subject to that adjustment or is it a number lower than that?

CRAIG SHULER: The only ones that wouldn't have been, Bob, where -- would be some cases where maybe we had a couple multi-year contracts and those were still on, and the language in those contracts didn't provide for that. And then, you know, we've got some other contracts that go Q1 to Q1. It's just a feat
-- we've talked about this before on calls. It's just a feature of some customers purchasing factors -- they're Q1 to Q1 rather than a calendar year. So only in those kinds of exceptions. Other than that all the other customers where our terms and conditions provided for this, we executed.

ROBERT LAGAIPA: But how much of that would represent -- or how much of that would account for the volume? So, in other words, if it's 220,000 tons in 2004, 210,000 in 2005, I mean, do those types of contracts represent 10 percent of the volume, 20 percent of the volume? I'm just trying to get a better sense for that.

CRAIG SHULER: That's a hard one to tell. I mean, remember, we had five price increases last year, we had a BPA, and then we've got, you know, some of the highest prices, you know, out there. So all of the above contributed to that 12 to 15,000 tons we talked about earlier. I think it's hard to color it, which one of those actions. I think standing firm on all those price increases and on the BPA. All of those added up is what resulted in our lower volume.

ROBERT LAGAIPA: Okay. We can follow-up off line on that issue, but, just one last question just in terms of the ETM business, the 18 to 20 million, up from the 12 million. Can you give us a sense for, you know, where that additional revenue is coming from? Or, you know, maybe you can provide some parameters there. Is that the result of 75 percent of the approvals you've had signed over the last three years? Is it, you know, 25 percent of the approvals that would lead to additional upside, you know, as we -- as we move out further? Can you provide some color there as well?

CRAIG SHULER: Well, lot of that growth has been in the laptop arena. You've seen us announce a number of laptop approvals. Especially in the ultra light segment. And you've seen many of the electronic
companies come out with their own ultralight. Del, Sony, Panasonic. And we've been picking up virtually every one of those. So we've announced those.

And this volume you see here is securing the order, and usually a full year of that order and 100 percent share. So, I won't give you the percentage that we still have in the pipeline. I think that's really for our team and that's a competitive arena for us. But what I will say is, as you've seen us announce those approvals, our team has delivered with orders and usually because of the advantaged technology, 100 percent share on those orders.
ROBERT LAGAIPA: All right. Okay. Thanks you very much, Craig. CRAIG SHULER: Bob, thank you very much. Have a good day. ROBERT LAGAIPA: You, too.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Bronchek (sp) with RCB Investment
Management. Please go ahead. Go ahead.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph), ANALYST, RCB INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Hi, guys. Hopefully, this will be the last question on this matter. So, if I understand correctly, there's been whining that you're not raising praces -- prices fast enough, and now that you do raise prices fast, or getting there, clearly, that was an effect on volume as your -- looks like according to SGL, they're -- they're always a half step behind. So that's one factor behind the volume, is that correct?

CRAIG SHULER: That's ab -- that's absolutely right. And we went into this process over the course of last year with the increases knowing that we would be willing and planning on losing some volume.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): And secondly, could you make a guesstimate, obviously, if I were a customer, I would be, you know, take, buying every single possible ton I could, knowing that this industry is just seems to be a half step behind what they can achieve in pricing, ergo I'd want to put as much graphite sitting around at my factory in '04 rather than pay a price in '05. Is that -- how much would you estimate customers just, you know, took a much as they humanly can or -- and that contributed to a shortfall in buying profile?



Page 34 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: Yeah, that's -- that's part of it. Especially in the first quarter. We saw our customers, you know, absolutely calculate every ton they were due under annual contracts in '04 and of course, you know, we adhere to those and they want a delivery in '04, so. We saw that. I think probably our competitors had the same reaction from their customers because of the price increase. And I think every, every steel shop out there tried get as much graphite as they could in Q4. So, that's definitely part of the lower Q1. But the majority, I would say, is the firm stance on, on pricing.
JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): I'm going ask two quick questions. CRAIG SHULER: Please, Jeff.
JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): So maintenance CapEx, however you cut it, if you're this company, runs 40 to $43 million as currently configured. Is that correct? I mean, I call it de-bottlenecking, I mean, you're going to do that every year. You're spending 40 to 43 million. 10 million above depreci -- that, that's the run rate?

CRAIG SHULER: That's right. You know, if you put our productivity improvements, de-bottlenecking and some AET into that category, yeah, you're probably right. Those are probably good numbers.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): And, this company has spent a lot of time on, you know, with your predecessor, on working capital and supply chain management and has had really restructuring after restructuring over the past four years to become a class a company and how it runs its operations. Would you say that you are, you know, this is just a difficult environment, given the price increases, or are you just disappointed with the working capital and operations performance of the Company and how it operated in the past year?

CRAIG SHULER: No. I think on the operations side, we are pleased at what our team delivered, record production. And just as a milestone, we produced more out of the six graphite electrode plants last year than we did out of our ten old graphite electrode plants before the restructuring. So a tremendous accomplishment. A tremendous transformation, getting out of U.S., Canadian, German plants that were high cost, had all the attendant pension and medical issues with them.

So, we're pleased the way the production platform ran. Very pleased. We've got some stellar teams in -- in, you know, from Mexico to Brazil to South Africa, et cetera. Our disappointment would be that we don't think we're getting a fair price for our product, given raw material input, given energy cost, given the demand of our customers to have a superior product that can run and produce high levels of steel, very productively, so it requires some technology, it requires a very stable and high quality production platform. And so our disappointment would be more -- we don't believe we're getting a fair price for our product.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): And given that you talked about compensation of the Company run on a cash basis, would it be fair to say that bonuses for 2004 would be minimal?

CRAIG SHULER: Bonuses for 2004 were zero because we weren't pleased with where we came out on cash. We have a very, very focused team on cash. One of the reasons we're moving away from EPS just to a cash focus, with a company like ours, with the debt and in a very competitive industry, we want everyone in our company focused on cash. So there is a zero cash bonus for '04.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): Okay, now here's the long question. So, this industry had a problem with pricing. People went to jail. Things collapsed. This industry operates on, again, sorry I've never really worked for a living, I work on Wall Street, but -- pricing a commodity based business on an annual basis, I mean is this vestages of a 1920s type mentality?

Go through for us, if you would, exactly what efforts were taken over a year to break this annual pricing and move toward whether it's, you know, volume and not price, whether it's quarterly based, whether it's, you know, putting in the ability to pass at raw materials. You know, where do we stand on that? And what percentage of your annual volume is tied to a, quote, new contract versus old contract? Because I see that as a problem.

CRAIG SHULER: Jeff, back in the first quarter of last year, we were very clear in our conference calls, and we articulated that we were reviewing all of our graphite electrode sales contracts and we were going to embark and move in the direction of building more flexibility into those contracts so that we could price them based on market conditions, supply/demand, raw material, costs, et cetera, et cetera, for the very reason you pointed out, that to go ahead and fix a price for a year in an industry that's got an awful lot of energy based input cost and also an industry that you can't yourself fix all of your costs really wasn't good business.

And so we are very clear with the market, very clear on conference calls, that we were doing this. We explained all of the reasons above on why. And so we went through and we built globally, our contracts, to allow for this kind of activity. What the activity does, it allows us to reprice the contract based on supply/demand, based on market conditions, based on our input cost. It's not tied -- it's not a surcharge. It's
Page 35 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
not tied to a specific raw material index. But to give us that flexibility, like a lot of other industries have, and like the steel industry, for instance.

And so lot of work was done on that, and that was executed as we said on December 1, for all orders received before November 1. And as we said earlier, that's - we're very pleased with the way that's gone.

And we did it in all the geographies and we treated all the customers equally. We think more flexibility in the pricing would be better for our industry, our costs are moving. We have oil sitting at 55 bucks now. And, so, you're right, we have been trying to change the pricing dynamics in this industry.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): Okay. And so, again, what percentage of your volume now for '05 do you think is on a more flexible contract?

CRAIG SHULER: Let's -- I'm not going to give you a number, but I'm going to point you to the, at least the area. Recall we have two segments. And so the melter segment electrode would be the segment that is very tight as we know it. So that's 70 percent of our volume. And in that 70 percent, the majority of that business would be structured that way.

JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): And on, again, on the flexibility concept on their idea of the ninth inning is where you want to be, and 2003-04 were on the first inning, where are you? Is this the first step and you're in the third inning of this process and every year you're going to pound away at it, or...?

CRAIG SHULER: Well, again, it will depend on supply demand in the industry and the other factors that we said go into this. This is obviously the first time it's been done in our industry in, you know, decades. And let's see where, where we go from here. You know, one thing we can say is, and we produce graphite electrodes all around the world, is you know biggest platform, broadest platform of anybody.

So we know graphite electrode costs wherever you want to put them. And none of our competitors are seeing any different raw material input costs than us. If anything, because of our large buy, we're advantaged. So, we -- you got to believe that the entire industry feels, petroleum, energy, natural gas and that these pressures -- these cost pressures are on everybody.
JEFF BRONCHEK (ph): Thank you, guys.
CRAIG SHULER: Thanks, Jeff. Have a good day.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Schenosky with Jefferies and Company. BOB SCHENOSKY, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO: Thank you, good morning.
CRAIG SHULER: Morning, Bob. How are you today?

BOB SCHENOSKY: Good. Craig, can you give us a sense of the number attached related to CapEx that you employed to go from 210 in capacity now up to where you'll be at the end of this year at 250?

CRAIG SHULER: Bob, that's probably, you know, if I take the slice of our capital, that's probably something that's around 10 to 12 million.

BOB SCHENOSKY: Okay, great. And, you know, couple years ago you were adamant about getting capacity up and de-bottlenecking obviously made sense. But can you talk about what the plans are now, if you're going to operate at 210 this year, what the plans would be for those 40,000 tons of additional capacity available?

CRAIG SHULER: Those will depend on market conditions, one. Two, we'll build some inventory. We've been running the last two years, as you all know, hand to mouth and that's resulted in us missing some spa orders last year and the year before. Obviously with today's prices you don't want to miss any of those orders. So we're going to build some inventory. Building that inventory will also allow us to be a little bit more efficient on the supply chain so that we don't have to move produce around so much and we've got it in place. So, we'll use a little bit of that excess capacity for that. And then, Bob, it'ill be on the go forward basis. We'll view market conditions and supply/demand and we'll determine where best to place that, that volume. Obviously, we've talked a lot about other segments and we've done a lot of work in other
segments, in that nonmelter segment, which is very attractive for us. Allows us to fill up plants.

Many times those nonmelter segments are very close to our facilities because of the spread of our facilities. And so time will tell how we exercise that additional capacity. Obviously, we would not be putting in place if we didn't expect that the right time and market conditions to utilize all of it.
BOB SCHENOSKY: So the bulk of it is nonmelter?

Page 36 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: No, no. It can make both.
BOB SCHENOSKY: Okay, so...
CRAIG SHULER: It's flexible. ...You're going to drop down some inventory this year. Is that already built
into your cash flow assumptions? Yes, building some inventory is already built in there. We're going to build
up some inventory because the last two years we've run so tight.
BOB SCHENOSKY: Okay.

CRAIG SHULER: And you want to have inventory today to take care of those spot requirements. And I'll tell you, there's a few spot requirements just because things are so tight.

BOB SCHENOSKY: Right. And just one final question, then. My understanding is one of the Indian producers is unable to get  needle coke that you're actually processing for a competitor. Are you concerned at all about any availability of coke as you get into '06 if you decide to deploy some of this additional capacity?

CRAIG SHULER: We feel very comfortable with our petroleum coke position. We've secured all of our requirements for '05. And being the largest buyer in the world, we feel comfortable that in '06 we will get the coke that we require.
BOB SCHENOSKY: Okay. Thank you.
CRAIG SHULER: Thank you, Bob. Have a good day.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Andrew O'Connor with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. ANDREW O'CONNOR, ANALYST, WELLS FARGO: Craig, good morning, everyone.
CRAIG SHULER: Good morning, Andrew. How are you today?

ANDREW O'CONNOR: Craig, you know, you've already kind of spoken around this, but what needs to take place or come about externally and internally for GrafTech to earn $0.60 this year, $0.60 a share in '05 versus $0.50 in terms of, or sensitivity to the sales volume you projected, cost of production and other factors?

CRAIG SHULER: Andrew, the range we've given, that 50 to 60 fits right down the center of the guidance we've given on sales increase, cost increase, so, we're very comfortable with that range. I know that may not be exactly and as precise as you'd like, but that 50 to 60 embodies the guidance we've given in our press release on the detailed sales numbers, cost increase, et cetera.

One thing I will say is, we see steel continuing to run strong in '05 and, of course, that's probably for every one in the graphite electrode industry, the number one item. And, so, the risk in the plan would be steel does not run strong. We will feel that in the plant, obviously. Or if steel has absolutely outstanding better than expected, what all the analysts are expecting type year, then of course we have the capacity, as we said, to go ahead and move those electrodes at the prevailing price.
ANDREW O'CONNOR: All right. Fair enough. Thanks. CRAIG SHULER: Andrew, thank you very much.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Jeff Cross with Cross Capital Company. Please, go ahead.

JEFF CROSS, ANALYST, CROSS CAPITAL COMPANY: Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the 45,000 metric tons volume. Now, that's a sales volume, not a production volume?
CRAIG SHULER: Yes, Jeff, that's a sales volume.
JEFF CROSS: Okay. So any inventory billed would be production in excess of 45? CRAIG SHULER: Absolutely.
JEFF CROSS: Okay. Let me also ask this. Is that sales, is that all contract sales? So you've factored in no estimate of what you might, might sell in to spot?
CRAIG SHULER: Well, you know, we're pretty deep into the quarter. JEFF CROSS: Right.

Page 37 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: So I would look at the 45,000 as a good strong number.

JEFF CROSS: Okay. So basically it kind of includes just approximately spot sales up until a couple days ago?

CRAIG SHULER: Yeah. Obviously we've had some of that with things being tight. We get those literally every week or two. They pop up around the world, sometimes in a little bit of an emergency situation. And we're, you know, delighted to fill them. It's a great service to customers and not letting a customer shut down.

JEFF CROSS: So, if I think about that 45,000 as -- and probably spot sales opportunities in the first quarter, are the weakest?
CRAIG SHULER: That's right. JEFF CROSS: Typically.
CRAIG SHULER: Well that's right because remember, Q4, everybody took every ton they could off of their
'04 contracts.
JEFF CROSS: Right.

CRAIG SHULER: So, yeah. Spot Q1 would generally be a lighter spot month and then as you go through and people run harder and ramp up, you tend to see more of it.

JEFF CROSS: So if I -- if, if I -- I thought of that as, as -- the 45,000 is probably pretty close, but what I'm getting at is, if it changes, it's only going to go up? It might be 45,400, if you ever carried it out to that many decimal places, but it's not likely to be less than 45,000.
CRAIG SHULER: We feel comfortable with the 45,000.

JEFF CROSS: Okay. But basically you, you ... Okay, you factored in all the spot sales so far but you haven't guessed that there'll be two more in the next two weeks?

CRAIG SHULER: That, that's right. That obviously that happened. But we, we feel very comfortable with the 45 and, like wise, on the annual the 210 and we would point you directly to that 210 for the year.

JEFF CROSS: Okay. Okay. And that just -- that's just basically -- the 210 is kind of interpreted how -- I'll say how deep you expect the spot market to be. If it's less deep, you might be a little low and, and if it's a lot deeper, in other words, if there's more uptake through the spot market, it could be higher.
CRAIG SHULER: That's right. That's a good way to look at it.
JEFF CROSS: Okay. Okay. Well, let's see. I think you've taken care of me. CRAIG SHULER: Jeff, thank you very much for your questions.
JEFF CROSS: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Greg Macosko with Lord Abbett. Please, go ahead. GREG MACOSKO, ANALYST, LORD ABBETT: Yes, thank you.
CRAIG SHULER: Morning, Greg.
GREG MACOSKO: Morning. Could you talk about the book? Your 75 percent book. I assume that's the
158,000 that you have contracted for. How does that relate to the melter versus nonmelter?

CRAIG SHULER: No. The book just to clarify, the book is probably about 85 percent together. Similar to the last year, maybe a little bit lower than last year. And that 85 percent would be pretty equal across melter and nonmelter. So we're 85 percent, maybe it's 88 percent, full for the year and -- on the 210 and that would be equal across segments. No real difference between the segments.

GREG MACOSKO: Okay. And the -- and with regard to the expectation on the 210,000, what production expectation you expect for the year?

CRAIG SHULER: As I said, we'll build a little bit of inventory. We may produce something close to 220, to a little bit over 220. You know, as we said, our machine now can produce that very comfortably. Last year
that was, you know, push everything you could, there's extra cost to do that, so the de-bottlenecking and

Page 38 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the fine work our production team has done lets us produce 220 very, very comfortably. So, you'll see probably 220, 225 we'll produce this year.

GREG MACOSKO: And with regard to the earlier question on needle coke, if you -- if for some reason had to produce 230 or 235, would you have the availability of needle coke? Could you get it? Forget about the price for now. But is, is -- do you have contracts to get that much  needle coke?

CRAIG SHULER: Greg, we feel comfortable that if we had to produce and sell 230, that we could do that and we would be comfortable with our coke to make that happen.

GREG MACOSKO: And could you tell me what is your estimate as to when Chicago  needle coke operation is -- will, in fact, shut down?

CRAIG SHULER: Yes, Greg. Good question. Let me give the latest update that we all have in the public arena around that. You know, I think we highlighted this back in Q3, once it was announced and it was a major development, and we tried to lay that out and give it to everybody so they could understand it. And, that transaction has been done.

The coker has been sold. Now there's been announcement of the actual kind of final date that it's going run to. It looks like it's going to shut down and then convert over to fuel coke which do not make electrodes. It looks like it's going to be about the middle of the year. So, that deal has happened as expected. Has been signed and concluded and we've all got kind of our final notice from the coker management that that
finishes up the middle of the year.

GREG MACOSKO: And do you have an under -- an idea as to how much melter electrodes at this point are being supplied by India and/or China?

CRAIG SHULER: On China, very few. Most of what China does goes into the nonmelter segment, okay? So, let's hold that. So think of China as the vast majority are going into nonmelter segment. The Indians have, as we've said over the last couple years, come up the quality curve and I'm going to guess that the majority of their electrodes go to melt their applications today. We don't have precise figures, but I'm going to say the majority of their electrodes go to the melter application. They're great competitors. We have a lot of respect for them. They run a great business and they're in the melter segment today.

On the highest end furnaces, some of the big furnaces in the U.S., of course, they would be trying to penetrate that. To date they've had some success, in other cases, no success. But I'm sure that part of their target, it's a segment that they're trying to get into and they're already in it in many, many places around the world.
GREG MACOSKO: Do they produce 26-inch electrodes?

CRAIG SHULER: They've been coming up in size. They make 24, absolutely and they've been working on larger diameter. And, not only 26, but they've been making some 28-inch. And I'd say they're up to about a
28-inch diameter. They've been doing that now for a year, year and a half.
GREG MACOSKO: Okay. And then where do they source their -- their high quality coke?

CRAIG SHULER: We don't know for sure, but I'm going to suspect because there's only, you know, four or five of these coke sources around the world, that they go to the same, same ones we do. Conoco, Unical, Seadrift and the Japanese, and then a -- there's a little bit out of -- out of Europe. So I'm, I'm going to -- because it's so tight, I'm sure they've knocked on every one of those doors like everybody else has.
GREG MACOSKO: Thank you. CRAIG SHULER: Thank you, Greg.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Michael Jurinsky (sp) [inaudible] Asset Management. Please go ahead.

MICHAEL JURINSKY (ph), ANALYST: Thank you. Just wanted to just kind of dig in a little more on these volumes issues. 'Cause last year the steel industry had no problems passing through their cost increases in the form of surcharges. And then now here in the first quarter of 2005, I know of at least two instances of steel companies accelerating outages so that to try to, you know, not put a lot of steel out there because demand never picked up like they expected and there's still a lot of inventory out there in the channels.
You know, if I put two and two together here, is it possible that your customers, by not, you know, seeing
the volume there, and your competitors by not raising prices, is it possible that they're seeing a slowdown in
the industry, that you have not picked up on yet?

Page 39 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
CRAIG SHULER: I don't believe so. Yeah, we call on the same shops and, as you know, we have one of the largest sales and customer tech service teams in the industry. So we have a very good global coverage. What we watch, and I, you know, something I can point you towards, is the steel service center inventories.

And if you see those inventories that are plotted every couple weeks, you'll see that, you know, kind of the last couple months of last year and the first month and a half of this year, the inventories ramped up significantly. And they have turned the last set of numbers that came out, they turned dramatically, down. And I mean dramatically. So there was a slowdown.

I'm sure the steel folks worked off some inventory. Some of them took extended outages. I'm talking globally now, not just the U.S. we have to recall, took out some extended outages over the Christmas holidays. We saw that in Europe, we saw it -- some of that in the U.S. And then you even saw a couple announced that were slowing down some, some older facilities, some of that -- in some cases integrated because of concerns over piling up inventory. But I would say right now what we see, we still see strong field demand, we see service center inventories in the U.S. have come down dramatically. They're at very comfortable levels right now. That wasn't the case two, three months ago. And we still see strong demand in Asia and China.
MICHAEL JURINSKY (ph): Okay. Thank you. CRAIG SHULER: Thank you, Mike.
OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Yale Fergain (sp) with Royal Capital. Please, go ahead.

JOHN LANSFIELD (ph), ANALYST, ROYAL CAPITAL: Morning, Craig, this is John Lansfield for Yale, how are you?
CRAIG SHULER: John, how are you today?
JOHN LANSFIELD (ph): Very well, thanks. Say, question. Just trying to clarify, like everyone else, this
210,000 ton volume number. You said that you booked 85 to 88 percent of your -- of your contracts. Is what
you were saying there that you've booked contracts for 180 or 185,000 tons? And the 20 to 25,000 ton
Delta to the 210 is what you're assuming will be spot?

CRAIG SHULER: You're partially correct. Let me walk back. Start with the 210 volume, 80, 85 percent of that is booked. That would bring you up to the, a roughly what ? A 180, 185 number? And the balance is
not spot. The ba... you know, there's a little bit of it in there, but the balance is business that comes up over the course of the year.
Because not everybody comes in to your book right now. Some come up in the middle of the year, that's
just their buying practices, or they have a contract in place, or they buy throughout the year. Not every steel
producer goes and tries to get all of their requirements at one time. Some are -- that's just their purchasing
strategy is every quarter or every six months.
JOHN LANSFIELD (ph): Okay. And can you give -- could you give some sense in 2004 what portion of
your volume was done on spot? There's obviously a lot of -- a lot of room here for -- it would seem to us for
tonnage to be sold at $4,000 a ton, or higher. You know, there's -- there's, there's your excess capacity and
then there's whatever portion of the 25,000 tons, say, that we just talked about, that might be spot.

CRAIG SHULER: The last year, probably five to seven percent was spot. We missed some spot orders because we just couldn't get the tons out of the plant. So you might see five to seven percent and we, you know we may see more of that this year. In the 210, we've tried to factor in what we believe will be all of the contracts and that element of spot. So, again, we'll guide you to that 210.

Biggest determinant will be how steel runs. And like we said, if we -- if steel slows, we will feel that immediately like the other graphite electrode producers and if it run extremely well, well then there will be some upside on that 210. We have that capacity and the capability to deliver above that 210 like you said, at the prevailing prices.
JOHN LANSFIELD (ph): Great. Thanks, Craig. CRAIG SHULER: Thank you. Thanks, John.
OPERATOR: Our last question comes from Brandon Elliott (sp) with Freese Associates. Please go ahead. BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph), ANALYST, FREESE ASSOCIATES: Good afternoon, gentlemen.
CRAIG SHULER: How are you today?
Page 40 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Good. I hate to keep pounding on this spot and this volume question, but the -- in the 210 -- I mean, I guess maybe stepping back first, the spot demand. It sounds like, given what customers took at the end of the year on the old contracts, that you -- spot demand has not been that good here in the first quarter?
CRAIG SHULER: It's been relatively light, that's right.
BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Okay, and how does the competitive pricing, you know, compare versus your
4,000 level currently?
CRAIG SHULER: The competitive pricing right now varies, I would say, around 36, 3650 to $4,000. BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Okay. And I think you guys already said, just to clarify, you think from a raw
materials standpoint you've got capa -- you have the ability to produce beyond that 210 if you had to.
CRAIG SHULER: Brendon, that's correct. Absolutely correct.

BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Okay. And, and the portion spot, I didn't hear if you gave a number that you have kind of budgeted in and that was in that 210? How much of that would be spot?
CRAIG SHULER: Brenden, we usually do five to seven percent in a year in spot.
BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Okay, so, so around that 10 to 15,000 ton category of spot sales? CRAIG SHULER: That's right. And that's factored in, as you said, to the 210.
BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Okay. What about variable cost? I mean, assuming that for some reason, maybe the steel market stays strong or little stronger than people think, and you're able to, you know, do 215, 220 plus. What, what's the variable, you know, cost component of that additional -- how profitable is that additional tonnage?

CRAIG SHULER: Well, obviously that's very attractive for us. You know, to run the platform fuller is extremely attractive and very efficient for us. So, if steel did have a banner year, obviously we would be
very well prepared with inventory, and a team capable, and raw material input to go ahead and deliver on it. So it, it is attractive to us. Very attractive. And typically, from a seasonality standpoint, when would be -- when's the potential for spot to either pick up or for us to get a better visibility on how the spot can shake
out for the year? Is there any seasonal component to that? Well, yeah. I would say maybe a little bit more in the back half of the year. You know, traditionally, you know, again, if steel runs very hard you'll probably see more in the back half than the first half. Some of that's a combination of Q1. Some of that's a combination of, you know, the big offtake in the Q4 the year before. So, that would be our typical, but I would plan on that five to seven. I think that five to seven percent for planning purposes is good, and obviously, you know, we'll keep everyone posted as we go forward and we, of course, watch the steel numbers and steel inventory numbers very very closely.

BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): How much, how much -- just one last. How much of the customer or how much of your volume do you think you lost or had customers come back and cancel on you due to the, to the rapid price increases?
CRAIG SHULER: I'd say that's a good 15,000 tons that we stood firm on. And --

BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Do you think that those customers were able to replace that -- replace that tonnage else where on the market or did they just say, forget it, we're not planning on that kind of volume then, if we have to deal with , you know, spot purchases of electrodes later, then that's going to affect our pricing?

CRAIG SHULER: I think by and large they went to our competition and then there may be a sliver of them, we're not planning on it, but there may be a sliver of that that they haven't secured everything they need yet. But I would say they went and -- went to the competition, who was at a lower price and in some cases, as we discussed, a maybe a much lower price.
BRENDEN ELLIOTT (ph): Great. Thanks, guys.
CRAIG SHULER: Brenden, thank you very much. Have a good day.

OPERATOR: Thank you. I'm going to turn it back over to management for any closing statements you may have.

CRAIG SHULER: Mary, thank you very much. Everyone, thank you for your time today. We look forward to talking to you in another couple months on our Q1 results. Thank you, have a good day.

OVERVIEW

Net income before special charges was $11m, or $0.11 per share, vs. $0.06 in 4Q03. Gross profit was up about 27% primarily driven by increases in electronic thermal management and carbon refractory sales. EBITDA, up $147m before special items represented a 40% improvement over 2003 and a doubling over
2002. GTI expects graphite electrode sales volume to be about 45,000 tons in 1Q05. Q&A Focus: Coke, CapEx, and volumes.
FINANCIAL DATA
A. Key Data From Call 1. 4Q04 net income before special charges = $11m. 2. 4Q04 net sales = $232m. 3.
4Q04 gross profit = $57m. 4. 2004 sales = approx. $850m. 5. 2004 gross profit = $210m. 6. 2005 net
income guidance = $55-65m. 7. 2005 free cash flow guidance = approx. $25m.
PRESENTATION SUMMARY
S1. 4Q04 & Full-Year 2004 Highlights (C.S.) 1. 4Q04 Results: 1. Net income before special charges was
$11m, or $0.11 per share, vs. $0.06 in 4Q03. 2. Net sales increased 23% to $232m, and gross profit came
in at $57m. 1. The improvements were mainly due to graphite electrode business where sales volume and
prices increased. 3. Graphite electrode sales volume was just under 60,000 metric tons or 13% higher than
4Q03. 4. In the other business segments, sales were $26m vs. $17m in 2003. 5. Gross profit was up about
27% primarily driven by increases in electronic thermal management and carbon refractory sales. 2. 2004
Results & Achievements: 1. Achieved strong YoverY growth. 2. Sales were up over 19% to approx. $850m.
3. Gross profit increased 25% to $210m. 4. EBITDA, up $147m before special items represented a 40%
improvement over 2003 and a doubling over 2002. 1. GTI has worked hard to improve EBITDA margins
and over the last two years has grown them from about 11.7% to over 17%. 5. Net income of $0.43 per
share before special charges was more than double over 2003. 6. GTI set graphite electrode production
records and achieved an annual graphite electrode sales volume of over 220,000 metric tons. 7. The Co.
also had continued success commercializing advantage technologies. 8. Grew ETM sales from $2m to
$12m. 9. Expanded global ETM team and secured orders from industry leaders such as Dell, Sony,
Samsung, and Panasonic in fast growing applications that range from plasma flat screen TVs to cell
phones to laptop computers. 10. GTI received the prestigious R&D 100 Award for the second consecutive
year for its breakthrough ETM products. 11. Capital Structure: 1. GTI was successful in making significant
improvements to its capital structure and putting several large legacy liabilities behind it. 2. The Co.
completed $225m convertible debenture issue, securing a very attractive one and five inch coupon. 3.
Reduced its most expensive debt 10.25% senior notes by $58m. 1. In the past two years, the Co. has
reduced these 10.25% notes by $115m. 4. Recently completed the refinancing of its revolving credit facility
securing $215m in liquidity, reducing the interest rate spread by more than 110 BP and obtaining less
restrictive financial covenants. 5. GTI's improved financial performance in 2004 positioned it for the
successful refinance. 6. Capital structure is now stable with no repayments due until 2010, and has liquidity
to support the growth of the businesses. 12. Legacy Liability: 1. Over the past six years, the Co. has paid
out more than $400m to fund legacy antitrust liabilities. 1. Including more than $70m to the European        
Commission and the DOJ in antitrust  fines during 2004. 2. GTI is now close to putting these legacy
antitrust liabilities behind it, with only $26m remaining to be paid to the DOJ after the end of 2005. 3. The

Page 43 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Co. also funded $42m of defined benefit pension obligations that were frozen in 2003. 1. This achieved almost 90% pension funding status for the Co. in its US pension plans. 2. This is up from 50% to 60% level just a couple of years ago. 4. A year-and-a-half ago, GTI announced that it is terminating its US postretirement medical plan effective 12/31/05. 1. 2006 forward this will save the Co. approx. $3-5m per year. 5. Also in 2004, GTI reduced expensive AR discounting by approx. $45m. 6. In total, the Co.'s actions in this area in 2004 represent over $150m of legacy liabilities that the team has put behind it. 13. The Co. is pleased to announce that the team and its external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers had both completed the assessment of the Co.'s internal controls as required by Sarbanes-Oxley and concluded that GTI's controls are effective. 14. Sarbanes-Oxley resulted in over $5m of additional expenses for the Co. in 2003.
3. 2005 Outlook: 1. As stated early last year, GTI modified the terms and conditions under which it sells graphite electrodes in order to build more flexibility to adjust pricing based on market conditions. 2. After assessing graphite electrode supply demand balance, tightness in the supply of quality  needle coke and rising production cost, including inflation and the continued weakness in the US dollar, GTI initiated a base price adjustment in Dec. 1. The Co. successfully executed a base price adjustment of approx. $440 per metric ton on all orders received prior to 11/01/04 that was subject to GTI's new terms and conditions. 2. The base price adjustment that the Co. instituted should not be confused with the surcharge and is not tied to an index or a specific raw material input. 3. The balance of 2005 melter electrode business has been
booked in the $3,500 per ton plus range. 4. As a result of the aforementioned, GTI expects melter electrode avg. revenue per metric ton to be up by approx. $600, or 24% higher than 2004. 5. In the non-melter graphite electrode segment, prices vary significantly due to the verity of end markets and performance requirements across those end markets. 1. The Co. expects avg. revenue per metric ton in this segment to increase approx. $100 vs. 2004. 6. Based on the actions and results to date, 2005 graphite electrode revenue per metric ton including both melter and non-melter segment is expected to be between
$2,900-3,000 per metric ton, approx. 15-20% higher than 2004. 7. Graphite electrode sales volume is expected to be 210,000 metric tons for 2005. 8. GTI expects graphite electrode production cost to increase between 10-12% in 2005 vs. 2004. 1. Half of this increase is due to inflation in cost, especially petroleum coke, energy, and freight, the balance is the result of the impact of the weak US dollar on the Co.'s production facilities outside the US. 9. To date, GTI has secured firm price contracts for approx. 75% of its graphite electrode production cost. 10. In 2005, the Co. is targeting at least 50% increase in ETM sales to achieve revenues of $18-20m. 1. The Co. will continue to develop breakthrough ETM products and solutions that enable its customers to be leaders in designing smaller lighter and more powerful electronic devices. 11. GTI is excited about the opportunities in this business and will continue to invest in people and technologies to grow this business. 12. Based on the 2005 guidance, GTI expects net income before other income expense to be about $55-65m in 2005, or 25-50% higher than 2004. 13. GTI expects 2005 free cash flow before antitrust and restructuring payments to be approx. $25m or an $82m increase vs. a cash
use of $57m in 2004. 1. This improvement includes an expected improvement of $60-70m in cash flow from operations. 4. 1Q05 Outlook: 1. GTI expects 1Q05 to be the weakest qtr. of the year. 2. In addition to it
being a seasonally slow qtr., rising graphite electrode prices 2003 resulted in customers taking all tons available under their 2004 annual contracts in 4Q04. 3. Recent pricing actions have contributed to the Co.'s lower 1Q05 volume. 4. GTI expects graphite electrode sales volume to be about 45,000 tons in 1Q05.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SUMMARY

Q1. On the cost front, can you give us an indication of the  needle coke cost that you hadn't secured back in Nov.? How much did that go up over the first 90% of the prices that you locked in? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) The  needle coke price has continued to go up virtually every couple of weeks, starting with 3Q04 when the announcement on the Lemont coke closure came out. And at that point in time, coke prices, depending on the grade, were roughly in the range of $500-550 a metric ton. From that period to today, we've seen in the markets, spot prices for petroleum coke rise to $750 a metric ton plus. So, there's been a significant increase from that point in time.

Q2. What is your outlook for 2006 on  needle coke? Do you expect just a significant increase over the avg. cost that you had in 2005? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) It's early to tell. This negotiation will usually begin in the middle of this year to 3Q. But I would expect, if we continue to see the strong oil price, and for sure, I believe we're going to continue to see the tightness in the quality coke market that we would be anticipating higher petroleum coke prices in
2006 than 2005. It's early to tell what percentage, but the direction we believe is upward. That will put a greater pressure upward on graphite electrode prices.
Q3. On the 25% of your cost for 2005 that you haven't locked in yet, what are those costs? (Michael
Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) Those are in the area of three or four buckets. It's natural gas, power, freight, and metallurgical coke. In each one of those we have some hedges in place and some  fixing  for the year.
Page 44 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Natural gas, I would say probably about 75-80% is open right now. And a lot of that's, we've stayed at this spot rate, which has been bouncing around 6%. Lot of that's because the forward curve was so steep and so expensive that thus far that's been the right thing to do, and we've gotten the better price. A bit of our power is floating freight. We've done a lot of work securing and  fixing  freight cost, but we still have some carriers that are allowed, if there is a spike in oil, to pass on some surcharges on whether it be bunker fuel or diesel. And in metallurgical coke, as I'm sure you know, in the steel industry has gone short. We have all the requirement we need, but as far as  fixing  the price, the metallurgical coke industry has been very reluctant to give annual prices. We've probably only fixed out for about nine months of this year. So, we've probably got about a qtr., the last qtr. of this year would be open to price. Not supply, just price.
Q4. How much metallurgical coke do you use? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan) A. (Craig Shular) Our annual spend is probably about $20m.
Q5. In terms of volume? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) Metallurgical coke, I believe is around $40 a ton. So, it's running right around $40 a ton. So, we use quite a bit of it. It's gone up, as you know it's one of our raw material that's almost doubled in price. As you've seen in many of the other coking coal, etc., most of those are 86-100% up.

Q6. On your volume guidance, it was down quite a bit from where you thought you would have been. And it seems like with the new 250,000-ton capacity that you're running about 84% of capacity. Can you talk a
little bit about that in terms of -- you must have lost some share based on the price initiative that you had started in Dec. And why are you not seeing others following your price initiative in Dec.? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) Regarding capacity. Right now we can comfortably produce something north of 230,000 tons a year. And you'll recall our target was to exit 2005 somewhere around the 250,000-ton range. So, right now our capacity sits somewhere around 230,000-240,000. Last year, we sold 222,000 metric tons. We have not given any guidance for 2005, so we haven't said any expectations or numbers out there, of
course. But this year, it looks like we will do about 210,000 and all of that movement, from 222,000 down to
210,000 is 100% due to our pricing actions. Holding firm on price, trying to bring the price up for our product
and get a fair price for our product. I think as you've seen, we initiated five increases last year in price. Plus
a BPA (Phonetic), trying to keep up with raw material increases, and like we said, get to a fair price for our
product. So, we were willing to give up volume, we held very firm on that. As far as the others, it's hard to
speak to their strategy, but obviously, we have initiated most of the price increases in this industry. Over the
course of last year, we've had some following and movement in the price upwards. In Dec., of course, we
went out with $4,000 price increase, and for whatever reason, the competition was not moved to that kind
of level. I think, the last price published by the competition was in 01/14/05 or 01/15/05. They were back at
$3650 (Phonetic) a metric ton. I really can't speak to why they stay back at $3650 a metric ton when we're
at $4,000, given all of the petroleum based cost pressures and energy pressures that we have in our
industry.

Q7. Did you get the $0.20 per pound price increase in just the US or have you gotten it elsewhere? (Michael Gambardella - JP Morgan)

A. (Craig Shular) You're referring to the BPA and that's $440 a metric ton or in US pricing $0.20. We look very successful in that program. And we just approached -- we really had to treat everybody the same. I mean, no one likes price increases, so we treated everybody the same. And we executed that virtually
100% across the board everywhere where the contract allowed that. So, that would be the US, Mexico, Western Hemisphere, Europe, and Asia. So, we had success in virtually every geography, wherever the contract allowed that to take place.
Q8. Can you give little bit of an update, obviously you're spending some money to bring some more
capacity online? Can you give an update on what you're hearing around the world about additional capacity
coming on away from you? (Brett Levy - Jefferies & Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) We had some opportunities as we've talked the last couple years to really debottleneck some of our plants. In some cases with a bit of CapEx. In other cases just with process know-how, improving the cycle time that we make graphite electrodes. And having six well-positioned graphite electrode plants around the world on four continents, the best platform in the industry, we feel one of our competitive advantages is to go ahead and exercise that and execute on those process technology improvements and debottlenecking. So, as you've seen over the last couple of years, we've taken that capability from 180,000 metric tons to 230,000 metric tons and as I said earlier, we're probably north of that maybe closer to 240,000 metric tons and our stated goal has been to try and exit 2005 closer to the
250,000 range. So, I think you'll see us continue to, where we have very attractive debottleneck productivity opportunities, we'll continue to do that. Regarding others, from what we see, we believe our two Indian

Page 45 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
competitors are doing the same kinds of things in their plants. We believe they're trying to debottleneck, they're not building new plants. No one has done that for 30 years, but they are debottlenecking their plants, and as we've said in prior calls, we think they're attempting to get between the two of them
15,000-20,000 tons out of the plants they have in India.

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) Obviously, we worked very hard to get a fair price for our product. And we've been willing to sacrifice volume to try and execute on that. As you see price is up 15-20%, and I think if you compare that to where some of the competitors are, you'll see that absolutely we've gotten a higher pricing and sacrificed volume if we had to.

Q9. Can you talk to, what CapEx is going to be for 2005, in the current mode and what the major projects would be? (Brett Levy - Royal Bank of Canada)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) It will be around $45-50m. The majority of that will be regular working budget to keep the plants running well and productive. There is probably $3-4m in there for AET type capital as we continue to grow that business. As you know that's gone very well for us. So, probably, 10-12% of that number is pointed towards AET and ETM, etc. Then there's probably about another $5-6m that I would put in the bucket of debottleneck/productivity improvements in our plants. Very attractively, we can debottleneck or automate a function or put in some new process technology and really get a much better capability out of it. I think if you talk to the trade, our quality over the last five years has ramped up and improved nicely. We're probably producing the best most stable electrode we have in the last ten years.

Q10. There has been less and less emphasis in your press releases and your conference calls on, the Ballard arrangements, car batteries, that sort of thing. Given where the price of fuel is right now, has there been any increased initiative in that direction? Can you give a little bit of an update there? (Brett Levy - Royal Bank of Canada)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) Our view of Ballard and the opportunities in fuel cells have never been better. The only reason you may see us talk a little bit less of it because it's probably out there 6-10 years, we've tried not to oversell and get people ahead of it. But obviously, I think you've seen Ballard make some great advances. As you know, there are 100% exclusive supply arrangements we have with them where they buy our flow field material out to '2016', and so we've seen their bus program in Europe, in Beijing, and Singapore is very successful, tremendous performance results. That's a 100% of our product, and I think more recently you see the US government, Japanese government, as you said in some cases in response
to oil prices and availability, really start to get on the fuel cell program. So, we think what you're going to see over the next 3-5 years is much more attention and awareness in this area. We've added people and we had a dedicated team, strong, strong relationship with Ballard, who has probably 85% of the fuel cell cars that are out on the road today. All of those are our product. So, we see nothing but upside there. Tightness in oil and oil prices, I guess, really get those programs going and the government grant money flowing to support it.

Q11. On the working capital front, can you give a little bit of guidance for 1Q05 or all of 2005? Obviously raw material costs are moving upward. Can you give some sense as to where you see your investment in working capital 2005? (Brett Levy - Royal Bank of Canada)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) For all of 2005, it's probably going to take about $25-30m in working capital. Higher prices for our product and receivables, and of course our costs have gone up 10-12%. So, $25-30m increase.

Q12. What I'm trying to reconcile is -- you mentioned before it's hard to account for the competitors and that not following with your price increase. Presumably over time, your demand and capacity, supply demand situation is related to steel demand. And all the data we're seeing is for extremely strong trends in steel output and the like. Are there some geographic pockets or classes of product that might account for the industry being not as tight. Again, the industry being your carbon product, being the raw products not being total, and quite a supply, demand position or just -- seems a little strange that price increases are not being sustained in the part of competitors with such a tight and high demand market. Can you help us understand why that would be? (Gerry Farber - WPG)

A. (Craig Shular) We share your observation. The melter electrode segment, our number one segment which is 70% of our volume remains very tight. I think you hear it from us. You'll hear it from the competition on their conference calls. You've heard from the steel industry. So, you're absolutely right. The melter electrode market is tight. It's been tight now for a year and a half. There are no geographic pockets that are upsetting this global balance. Electrodes move around the world. So, it remains tight and we share with
you, how we understand given all the cost increases and this is a petroleum-based product with energy. Why we haven't gotten to a more fairer level for our product.

Q13. So, right now there's no accounting for the lack of price follow through on the part of your competitors? It doesn't sound like there's any material increase in capacity by your competitors or by yourself vis-a-vis the demand situation out there, right? (Gerry Farber - WPG)

A. (Craig Shular) That's correct, melter electrodes remain tight. Costs are going up. And we will continue to monitor the situation and as I said, we increased price five times last year plus a base price adjustment as we make every effort to get a fair price for our product and a fair return. Our customers want their
high-performing electrodes as a technology CapEx.

Q14. In 1Q, you said there is a tough compare vis-a-vis last year. Is there also seasonality that would allow the customer base to shift from one supplier to another and does that seasonality change in subsequent quarters where the customers would not have that latitude? (Gerry Farber - WPG)

A. (Craig Shular) That's spot on. 1Q historically is the slower qtr. of the year, usually it's our lowest qtr. And so 1Q we didn't see some slowness in the market. Of course, customers have a chance to use some of the graphite electrode inventory. There is some of that shifting as you talk. But '2Q' onward historically and
what we see in our book is much stronger.

Q15. Is a good part of the decline forecast on an annual basis which is about 12,000 tons or there about? (Gerry Farber - WPG)
A. (Craig Shular) That's right, about 12,000 tons.

Q16. Is the bulk of that occurring as you put your forecast together in 1Q shortfall or are you building in some declines in subsequent quarters? (Gerry Farber - WPG)

A. (Craig Shular) The majority of it is in 1Q. But, we've also prudently trimmed a little bit from the subsequent quarters. But, most of it is in 1Q.

Q17. So, you're just doing that just to be prudent, as you say. But, there's no indication of full-year outlook loosening up in terms of the capacity demand situation. So, it is possible that subsequent to 1Q it's possible given current conditions, we might see the higher run rates that a number of people who are thinking about given supply demand because as you know, a lot of analysts' forecasts were in the 240,000-250,000 range on a full-year basis. Or are you thinking that run rate is now unrealistic in subsequent quarters? (Gerry Farber - WPG)
A. (Craig Shular) Yes, I think the analysts were around 225,000-230,000. We would stick firmly with our
210,000. We would guide you to that --

Q18. I understand the 210,000, but I'm just wondering, again is it possible that we could see higher run rates because things so skewed in terms of the decline in 1Q, as you alluded to? (Gerry Farber - WPG)

A. (Craig Shular) It's possible. Recall the lower volume is a 100% due to our stance and firmness on price, of the quality of our product, ability to deliver, etc., all of that is superb.

Q19. On the volume issue, the volume declined from the 222,000 to the 210,000. Can you give us some sense of just - I know someone mentioned just from a demand perspective, geographically where you might be seeing weakness. You mentioned that the demand out there is very strong certainly for steel production globally. Can you talk about where you're meeting the most resistance on a geographic basis relative to these price announcements? (Robert Lagaipa - CIBC World Markets)

A. (Craig Shular) The one we referred to earlier at $3,650 is a global price. So, I would say it is in all geographies in general. So, let's start with that premise as Number 1. If I look at the more difficult environments, one would, of course, be Western Europe, where steel growth and the economies there have been lagging that we've seen here for in some of the Americas and in Asia. So, kind of subcategory would be Europe remains still with the 2-3% type growth. Germany, high unemployment, 11% unemployment. So, I would say Europe is the more difficult of the group. But globally, we have quite a difference, as we said earlier.

Q20. You had mentioned the cost. Obviously, from a variable cost perspective, you are seeing 5% lower volumes, but you are seeing the cost jump 10-12%. Obviously, the pricing is up on you quite a bit. What I'm trying to get some sense of reconciliation is, just relative to these base price adjustments, the $440 a ton. You'd mention that, that applies to the contracts that are subject to that adjustment. Can you give us color relative to the percentage of the contracts that are subject to that adjustment vs. those that aren't? If you
had contracts for example that were signed maybe late part of summer, early part of summer that may have not been subject to those adjustments, obviously, that would account for the difference. Can you provide some color on that? (Robert Lagaipa - CIBC World Markets)


Page 47 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A. (Craig Shular) Let me give you first some annual color and then maybe a little bit of detail. If we look on a YoverY basis and all three the avg. graphite electrode price was about $2,500 a metric ton. And you will recall we have 70% melter and 30% non-melter. And we spoke about the melter, the 70% going up $600 a metric ton and the non-melter going up $100 a metric ton. And so if you weight those for the 70%, 30%
that's about $450 increase, added on to your $2,500, you get to the middle of our guidance, $2,950. That's the YoverY. If I give you some color on the BPA, the BPA we applied very evenly to all customers whose orders were received prior to Nov. 01. And we really had no exceptions there. And we tried to treat every customer equally, fairly; no one likes a price increase, obviously. We don't like them. We fight like hell. Our customers fight like hell, as they should. But given the cost pressures, etc. we execute it and we're very pleased with the way it went.

Q21. But were 100% of those contracts that you signed subject to that adjustment or is it a number lower than that? (Robert Lagaipa - CIBC World Markets)

A. (Craig Shular) The only ones that wouldn't (Indiscernible) would be some cases where maybe we had a couple multi-year contracts and those were still on, and the language in those contracts didn't provide for that. And then, we've got some other contracts that go 1Q to 1Q. We talked about this before on calls. It's just a feature of some customers purchasing factors that are 1Q to 1Q rather than a calendar year. So, other than those kinds of exceptions, other than that, all the other customers where our terms and conditions provided for this, we executed.

Q22. How much of that would account for the volume? In other words, if it's 220,000 tons in 2004, 210,000 in 2005. I mean did those types of contracts represent 10% of the volume, 20% of the volume? Just trying to get a better sense there? (Robert Logiba - CIBC World Markets)
A. (Craig Shular) That's a hard one to tell. Remember, we had five price increases last year. We had a BTA
and then we've got some of the highest prices out there. So, all of the above contributed to about
12,000-15,000 tons we talked about earlier. So, I think it's hard to color, which one of those actions, I think
standing firm on all those price increases and on the BTA. All of those added up is what resulted in our
lower volume.

Q23. Regarding the ETM business, the $18-20m up from the $12m, can you give us a sense for where that additional revenue is coming from? Can you provide some parameters there? Is that the result of 75% of
the approvals that you have had signed over the last three years? Is it 25% approvals that would lead to additional upside as we move out further? Can you provide some color there as well? (Robert Logiba - CIBC World Markets)

A. (Craig Shular) Lot of that growth has been in the laptop arena. You've seen us announce a number of laptop approvals, especially in the ultra light segment. You've seen many of the electronic companies come out with their own ultra light Dell, Sony, Panasonic, etc. And we've been picking up virtually every one of those. So, we've announced those and this volume that you see here is securing the order, and usually a
full year of that order and a 100% share. So, I won't give you the percentage that we still have in the pipeline. I think, that's really for our team and that is in a competitive arena for us. But what I will say is, as you've seen us announce those approvals, our team has delivered with orders and usually because of the advantage technology, a 100% share on those orders.

Q24. If I understand correctly, there has been whining that you're not raising prices fast enough, and now that you do raise prices fast or getting there, clearly, that was an effect on volume as you -- it looks like according to SGL, but they're always a half step behind. So, that's one factor behind the volume, is that correct? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Craig Shular) That's absolutely right. And we went into this process over the course of last year with the increases knowing that we would be willing and planning on losing some volume.

Q25. Could you make a guestimate, obviously if I were a customer, I would take buying every single possible ton I could, knowing that this industry just seems to be a half step behind what they can achieve in pricing, ergo I'd want to put as much graphite sitting around at my factory in 2004 rather than pay a price in
2005. How much would you estimate customers just took as much as they can and that contributed to a shortfall in buying profile? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Craig Shular) That's part of it. Especially in 1Q, we saw our customers absolutely calculate every ton they were due under annual contracts in 2004. Of course, we adhere to those and they want a delivery in
2004, so we saw that. I think probably our competitors had the same reaction from their customers because of the price increase. I think every steel shop out there tried to get as much graphite as they could in 4Q04. So, that's definitely a part of the lower 1Q05. But the majority, I would say, is the firm stance on pricing.



Page 48 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Q26. Maintenance CapEx, however you cut it, to this Co. $40-43m is currently configured. Is that correct? And I call debottlenecking, I mean you're going to do that over a year. In fact you're spending $40-43m,
$10m above -- that's the run rate? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Craig Shular) That's right. If you put our productivity improvements, debottlenecking, and some AET into that category, yes, you're probably right. Those are probably good numbers.

Q27. This Co. has spent a lot of time on -- with your predecessor, on working capital, on supply chain management and it has had really restructuring after restructuring over the past four years to become a Class A co., and how it runs its operations. Would you say that you are -- this is just a difficult environment, giving the price increases, or are you just disappointed with the working capital and operations performance of the Co. and how it operated in the past year? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) No. I think on the operation side, we are pleased at what our team delivered, a record production. And just as a milestone, we produce more out of the six graphite electrode plants last year than we did out of our ten old graphite electrode plants before the restructuring. So, a tremendous accomplishment, a tremendous transformation getting out of US, Canadian, German plants that were high cost, had all the attendant pension and medical issues with them. We're pleased the way the production platform ran, very pleased. We've got some stellar teams from Mexico to Brazil to South Africa, etc. Our disappointment would be, we don't think we're getting a fair price for our product, given raw material input, given energy cost, given the demand of our customers to have a superior product that can run and produce high levels of steel very productively, so it requires some technology, it requires a very stable and high quality production platform. So, our disappointment would be more -- we don't believe we're getting a fair price for our product.

Q28. Given that you talked about compensation of the Co. is going on a cash basis, would it be fair to say that bonuses for 2004 would be minimal? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)
A. (Corrado De Gasperis) Bonuses for 2004 were zero because we weren't pleased with where we came
out on cash. We had a very focused team on cash. One of the reasons we're moving away from EPS just to
a cash focus, with a co. like ours, with the debt and in a very competitive industry, we want everyone in our
Co. focused on cash. So, there was a zero cash bonus for 2004.

Q29. This industry had a problem with pricing, people went to jail, things collapsed. So, this industry operates on, again, sorry I have never really worked for GTI, I work on Wall Street. But pricing a commodity-based business on an annual basis, I mean this is vestiges of a '1920' type mentality? Go through for us, if you would, exactly what efforts were taken over a year to break this annual pricing and move toward whether it's volume and not price, whether it's quarterly based, whether it's putting in the ability to pass raw materials. Where do we stand on that? And what percentage of your annual volume is tied to a `new contract vs. old contract?` Because I see that as a problem. (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Craig Shular) Back in 1Q04, we were very clear in our conference calls, and we articulated that we were reviewing all of our graphite electrode sales contracts and we were going to embark and move in the direction of building more flexibility into those contracts so that we could price them based on market conditions, supply/demand, raw material, costs etc., for the very reason you pointed out, that to go ahead and fix a price for a year in an industry that's got an awful lot of petroleum and energy based input cost, and also an industry that you can't yourself fix all of your costs really wasn't good business. So, we are very
clear with the market, very clear on conference calls that we were doing this. We explained always the reasons above on why. And so we went through and we built globally our contracts to allow for this kind of activity. What the activity does, it allows us to reprice the contract based on supply/demand, based on market conditions, based on our input cost. It's not a surcharge, it's not tied to a specific raw material index. But to give us that flexibility, like a lot of other industries have, like the steel industry, for instance. So, a lot of work was done on that and that was executed as we said on 12/01/04, for all orders received before
11/01/04, and as we said earlier, we're very pleased with the way that's gone. We did it in all the geographies and we treated all the customers equally. We think more flexibility in the pricing would be better for our industry, our costs are moving. We have oil sitting at $55 now. So, you are right, we have been trying to change the pricing dynamics in this industry.
Q30. What percentage of your volume now for 2005 do you think is on a more flexible contract? (Jeff
Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) I'm not going to give you a number, but I'm going to point you at least to the area. Recall, we have two segments and so the melter segment electrode would be the segment that is very tight as we know. So, that's 70% of our volume and in that 70%, the majority of that business would be
structured that way.


Page 49 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Q31. On the flexibility concept, on the idea of the ninth inning is where you want to be, and 2003 probably we're on the first inning, where are you in the--? Is this the first step and you're in the third inning of this process and every year you're going to pound away at it or -? (Jeff Bronchick - RCB Investment Management)
A. (Craig Shular) Again, as you depend on supply demand in the industry. And the other factors that we
said go into this. This is obviously the first time it has been done in our industry in decades. Let's see where
we go from here. One thing we can say is, and we produce graphite electrodes all around the world, as you
know broadest platform of anybody. So, we know graphite electrode costs wherever you want to produce
them. None of our competitors are seeing any different raw material input costs than us. If anything
because of our large buy, we're advantaged. So, you got to believe that the entire industry fields,
petroleum, energy, natural gas, etc., and that these cost pressures are on everybody.
Q32. Can you give us a sense of the number attached related to CapEx that you employ to go from
210,000 capacity now up to where you'll be at the end of 2005 at 250,000? (Bob Schenosky - Jefferies &
Co.)
A. (Craig Shular) That's probably, if I take the slice of our capital, that's probably something that's around
$10-12m.

Q33. Couple of years ago you were adamant about getting capacity up and debottlenecking obviously made sense. Can you talk about what the plans are now, if you're going to operate at 210,000 this year? What the plans would be for those 40,000 tons of additional capacity available? (Bob Schenosky - Jefferies
& Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) Those will depend on market conditions, one. Two, we'll build some inventory. We've been running the last two years hand to mouth. That's resulted in us missing some spot orders last year and the year before. Obviously with today's prices you don't want to miss any of those kinds of orders. So, we're going to build some inventory. Building that inventory will also allow us to be a little bit more efficient on the supply chain so that we don't have to move product around so much. We've got it in place. So, we'll use a little bit of that excess capacity for that. It will be on the go-forward basis. We'll review market conditions and supply demand and we'll determine where best to place that volume. Obviously, we've talked a lot about other segments and we've done a lot of work in other segments and that non-melter segment, which is very attractive for us, allows us to fill our plants. Many times those non-melter segments are very close to our facilities because of the spread of our facilities. And so, time will tell how we exercise
that additional capacity. Obviously, we would not be putting in place if we didn't expect that at the right time and market conditions to utilize all of it.
Q34. So the bulk of it is all non-melter? (Bob Schenosky - Jefferies & Co.) A. (Craig Shular) No. It can make both. It's flexible.
Q35. You're going to drop down some inventory in 2005. Is that already built into your cash flow assumptions? (Bob Schenosky - Jefferies & Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) Yes, building some inventories already built in there. We are going to build out some inventory because the last two years we've run so tight. And you want to have inventory today to take care of those spot requirements. And I'll tell you, there's a few spot requirements just because things aren't tight.

Q36. My understanding is one of the Indian producers is unable to get  needle coke that you're actually processing for a competitor. Are you concerned at all about any availability of coke as you get into 2006 if you decide to deploy that (Phonetic)? (Bob Schenosky - Jefferies & Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) We feel very comfortable with our petroleum coke position. We've secured all of our requirements for 2005. And being the largest buyer in the world, we feel comfortable that in 2006 we will get the coke that we require.
Q37. What needs to take place or come about externally and internally for GTI to earn $0.60 a share in
2005 vs. $0.50 in terms of our sensitivity to the sales volume you projected, cost of production, and other
factors? (Andrew O'Connor - Wells Fargo)

A. (Craig Shular) The range we've given that $0.50-0.60 is right down the center of the guidance we've given on sales increase, cost increase. So, we're very comfortable with that range. I know that may not be exactly and as precise as you'd like, but that $0.50-0.60 embodies the guidance we've given in our press release on the detailed sales numbers, cost increase, etc. One thing I will say is, we see steel continue to run strong in 2005, and of course, that's probably for every one in the graphite electrode industry the Number 1 item. So, the risk in the plan would be steel that does not run strong, as we will feel that in the plant obviously. Or if steel has absolutely outstanding better than expected what all the analysts are
Page 50 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
expecting type year (Phonetic), then of course we have the capacity, as we've said, to go ahead and move those electrodes at the prevailing price.
Q38. Regarding 45,000 metric tons volume; now that's a sales volume, not a production volume? (Jeff
Cross (Phonetic) - Cross Capital Co. (Phonetic))
A. (Craig Shular) Yes, that's a sales volume.
Q39. So, any inventory build would be production in excess of 45,000 metric tons? (Jeff Cross - Cross
Capital Co.)
A. (Craig Shular) Absolutely.

Q40. Is that all contract sales? So you have factored in that estimate of what you might like to sell into spot? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Corrado De Gasperis) We're pretty deep into the qtr., so I would look at the 45,000 as a good strong number.
Q41. So, basically it includes just approx. spot sales up until a couple days ago? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital
Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) Obviously, we've had some of that with things being tight. We get those literally every week or two. They pop up around the world, sometimes in a little bit of an emergency situation and we're delighted to fill them. It's a part of great service to customers and not letting a customer shut down.

Q42. If I think about that 45,000 as - and probably spot sales opportunities in 1Q are the weakest typically? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) That's right because, 4Q, everybody took every ton they took off of their 2004 contracts. So, yes, spot 1Q would generally be a lighter spot month, and then as you go through and people run harder and ramp up, you tend to see more of it.
Q43. So, if I thought of that as the 45,000 is probably pretty close with what I'm getting at is, if it changes,
it's only going to go up? It might be 45,400, if you ever carried it out to that many decimal places. But it's not
likely to be less than 45,000? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)
A. (Craig Shular) We feel comfortable with the 45,000.

Q44. You factored in all the spot sales so far, but you've haven't guessed that there will be two more in the next two weeks? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) That's right that obviously happened. But we feel very comfortable with the 45,000 and, like wise, on the annual at 210,000. We would point you directly to that 210,000 for the year.

Q45. That's just basically - the 210,000 is kind of interpreted how - I'll say how deep you expect the spot market to be. If it's less deep, you might be a little low and if it's a lot deeper, in another words, if there's more uptakes in the spot market, it could be higher? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)
A. (Craig Shular) That's right. That's a good way to look at it.

Q46. Could you talk about, your 75% book, I assume that's the 158,000 that you have contracted for. How does that relate to the melter vs. non-melter? (Greg Macosko - Lord Abbott)

A. (Craig Shular) No. The book Is probably about 85% together, similar to last year. Maybe a little bit lower than last year. And that 85% would be pretty equal across melter and non-melter. So we're 85%, maybe it's
88% for the year - and on the 210,000 -- and that would be equal across segments. No real difference between the segments.

Q47. With regard to the expectation on the 210,000, what production expectation do you expect for the year? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)
A. (Craig Shular) As I said, we'll build a little bit of inventory. So, we may produce something close to
220,000 to little bit over 220,000. As we said, our machine now can produce that very comfortably. Last
year that pushed everything it could. There's extra cost to do that. So, the debottlenecking and the  fine
work our production team has done that has perhaps (Phonetic) produced 220,000 very comfortably. So,
you would see probably 220,000, 225,000 will produce in 2005.



Page 51 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Q48. On needle coke, if for some reason you had to produce 230,000 or 235,000, would you have the availability of needle coke? Could you get it? Forget about the price for now. Do you have contracts to get that much needle coke? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) We feel comfortable that if we had to produce and sell 230,000, that we could do that and we would be comfortable with our coke to make that happen.

Q49. Could you tell me what is your estimate as to when Chicago  needle coke operation will, in fact, shut down? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) I think we highlighted this back in 3Q04 once it was announced and it was a major development, we tried to lay that out and give it to everybody so they could understand it. That transaction has been done. The coker has been sold and now there's been an announcement of the actual final date that it's going run to. It looks like it's going to shut down and then convert over to fuel coke, which do not make electrodes. It looks like it's going to be about the middle of the year. That deal has happened as expected, has been signed and concluded. We've all got our final notice from the coker management that finishes up the middle of the year.
Q50. Do you have an idea as to how much melter electrodes at this point are being supplied by India and/or
China? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) On China, very few. Most of what China does goes into the non-melter segment. So, let's hold that. So, I think that China is -- the vast majority are going into non-melter segment. The Indians have, as we said over the last couple years, come up the quality curve. I'm going to guess that the majority of
their electrodes go to melter applications today. We don't have precise figures. But I'm going to say the majority of their electrodes go to the melter application. They're great competitors, we have a lot of respect for them. They've run a great business and they're in the melter segment today. On the highest end furnaces, some of the big furnaces in the US, of course, they would be trying to penetrate that. To date they've had some success in other cases, no success. But, I'm sure that part of their target; it's a segment that they're trying to get into, and they're already in, in many places around the world.
Q51. Do they produce 26-inch electrodes? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) They've been coming up in size. They make 24-inch, absolutely, and they have been working on larger diameter. Not only 26-inch, but they've been making some 28-inch. And I'd say they're up to about a 28-inch diameter. They've been doing that now for a year, year-and-a-half.
Q52. Where do they source their high quality coke? (Jeff Cross - Cross Capital Co.)

A. (Craig Shular) We don't know for sure, but I'm going to suspect because there's only four or five of these coke sources around the world that they go to the same ones as we do, Conoco, Unocal, Seadrift and the Japanese, and then there's a little bit out of Europe. Because it's so tight, I'm sure they've knocked on every one of those doors like everybody else has.

Q53. On the volumes issues, because last year the steel industry had no problems passing through their cost increases in the form of surcharges. And then now here in 1Q05, I know of at least two instances of steel companies accelerating outages so that to try to, not put a lot of steel out there because demand never picked up like they expected. There's still a lot of inventory out there in the channels. If I put two and two together here, is it possible that your customers, by not (Indiscernible) the volume there, and your
competitors by not raising prices? Is it possible that they're seeing a slowdown in the industry that you have not picked up on yet? (Michael Joranskhy (Phonetic) - Vinik Asset Management)

A. (Craig Shular) I don't believe so. We call on the same shops and, as you know, we have one of the largest sales and customer tech service teams in the industry. So, we have a very good global coverage. What we watch, something that I can point you towards, is the steel service center inventories. And if you see those inventories that are plotted every couple of week, you'll see that kind of the last couple of months of 2004 and the first month-and-a-half of 2005, the inventories ramped up significantly. And they have turned the last set of numbers that came out, they turned dramatically down. And I mean dramatically. So there was a slowdown, I'm sure the steel folks worked off some inventory. Some of them took extended outages, here I'm talking globally now, not just the US you have to recall, took out some extended outages over the Christmas holidays. We saw that in Europe, we saw some of that in the US. Then we even saw a couple announce that we're slowing down some older facility, in some cases integrated because of concerns over piling up inventory. But, I would say, right now what we see, we still see strong fuel demand. We see service center inventories in the US have come down dramatically, they are at very comfortable levels right now that wasn't the case 2-3 months ago. We still see strong demand in Asia and China.

Q54. Just trying to clarify this 210,000-ton volume number, you said that you had booked 85-88% of your contracts. Is what you're saying there that you've booked contracts for 180,000 or 185,000 tons? And the
Page 52 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
20,000-25,000 ton Delta to the 210,000 is what you're assuming will be spot? (John Hansil (Phonetic) - Royal Capital (Phonetic))

A. (Craig Shular) You're partially correct, let me walk back. Starting with the 210,000-ton volume. 80-85% of that is booked. That would bring you up to roughly 180,000-185,000 ton number. And the balance is not spot, there's a little bit of that in there. But, the balance is business that comes up over the course of the year. Because, not everybody comes in to your book right now. Some come up in the middle of the year, that's just their buying practices, or they have a contract in place, or they buy throughout the year. Not
every steel producer goes and tries to get all of their requirements at one time. Some like (Indiscernible)
just their purchasing strategy is every qtr. or every six months.

Q55. Could you give some sense in 2004, what portion of your volume was done on spot? There's obviously a lot of room here for -- it would seem to us for a tonnage to be sold at $4,000 a ton, or higher. There's your excess capacity and there's whatever portion of the 25,000 tons that we just talked about that might be spot. (John Hansil - Royal Capital)

A. (Craig Shular) Yes. Last year probably 5-7% was spot. We missed some spot orders because we just couldn't get the tons out of the plant. So you might see 5-7%. We may see more of that in 2005. In the
210,000 ton, we've tried to factor in what we believe will be all of the contracts and that element of spot. So, again, we'll guide you to that 210,000 ton. Biggest determinant will be how steel runs. Like we said, if steel slows, we will feel that immediately like the other graphite electrode producers. If it runs extremely well, well then there maybe be some upside on that 210,000 ton. As we said, we have that capacity and the
capability to deliver above that 210,000 ton like you said, at the prevailing prices.

Q56. On the spot and this volume question, but in the 210,000 ton -- I guess maybe stepping back first, the spot demand, it sounds like given what customers took at the end of 2004 on the old contracts that spot demand has not been that good here in 1Q05? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates (Phonetic))
A. (Craig Shular) It's been relatively light, that's right.
Q57. How does the competitive pricing compare vs. your $4,000 level currently? (Brandon Elliott - Rees
Associates)
A. (Craig Shular) The competitive pricing right now varies, I would say around $3,650-4,000.

Q58. Do you think from a raw materials standpoint you have the ability to produce beyond that 210,000 ton, if you had to? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)
A. (Craig Shular) That's absolutely correct.

Q59. Regarding the portion spot, I didn't hear if you gave a number that you have kind of budgeted in within that 210,000 ton? How much of that would be spot? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)
A. (Craig Shular) We usually do 5-7% in a year in spot.
Q60. So, around that 10,000-15,000 ton category of spot sales? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates) A. (Craig Shular) That's right. And that's factored in, as you said to the 210,000 ton.
Q61. What about variable cost? Assuming that for some reason maybe the steel market stays strong or a little bit stronger than people think, and you're able to, do 215,000-220,000 plus ton. What's the variable cost component of that additional? How profitable is that additional tonnage? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)
A. (Craig Shular) Obviously that's very attractive for us. To run the platform fuller is extremely attractive,
and very efficient for us. So, if steel did have a banner year, obviously, we would be very well prepared with
inventory and a team capable on a raw material input to go ahead and deliver on it. So, it is attractive to us,
it is very attractive.

Q62. Typically from a seasonality standpoint, when is the potential for spot to either pick up or for us to get a better visibility on how the spot could shake out for the year? Is there any seasonal component to that? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)

A. (Craig Shular) Yes. I would say maybe a little bit more in 2H05. Traditionally. Again, if steel runs very hard, you would probably see more in 2H05 than 1H05. Some of that is a combination of 1Q05, some of that is a combination of the big off take in 4Q04. So, that would be typical. But, I would plan on that 5-7%, I think that 5-7%, which for are planning purposes is good. Obviously, we'll keep everyone posted as we go forward and we would of course watch the steel numbers and steel inventory numbers very closely.

Page 53 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Q63. How much of the customer or how much of your volume do you think you lost or had customers come back and cancel on you due to the rapid price increases? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)
A. (Craig Shular) I'd say that's a good 15,000 tons that we stood firm on.

Q64. Do you think that those customers were able to replace that tonnage elsewhere in the market or did they just say, forget it, we're not planning on that kind of volume then and if we have to deal with spot purchases of electrodes later, then that's going to affect our pricing? (Brandon Elliott - Rees Associates)

A. (Craig Shular) I think, by and large they went to our competition and then there may be a sliver of them, we're not planning on it, but there maybe a sliver of that, but they haven't secured everything they need yet. But, I would say they went to the competition, who was at a lower price and in some cases as we discussed maybe a much lower price.

HD        COATS GETS £10M FINE OVER PRICES.

BY        COATS, the world¹s biggest maker of industrial thread, has been  fined e15.7 million (£10.6 million) by the European Commission for operating cartels.

The company bore the brunt of e43.5 million of  fines handed out to firms charged with  fixing  prices of thread used in clothing, furniture and a host of other applications. It is a massive blow for Coats, which is already appealing against a e30 million  fine handed out last year relating to its part in a
pins-and-needles cartel.

Coats said it was considering appealing the latest  fine. 'We believe this  fine is disproportionate to the nature of the infringement, the limited size of the individual market and Coats' co-operation with the Commission,' said new chief executive Mike Smithyman.

UK-based Barbour Threads, Hicking Pentecost and Oxley Threads were also penalised today.

Coats isn't saying how much a five-year long European  cartel investigation may end up costing but it has already copped fines of ¤48.5 million.
The alleged market-sharing practices, involving several firms, long pre-date GPG's involvement in
Coats, going back in some instances to the 1970s.

TD
The European Commission began investigating in 2001 and subsequently split its inquiry into three sub-cases.

It ruled on the first, for hand-sewing  needles, in October 2004, fining Coats and British haberdashery firm Prym ¤30 million each. A third firm, Entaco, got off scot-free after confessing its part and giving information to the commission in a "dob-in-your-co-conspirator" deal similar to those offered here by the Commerce Commission.

The commission found the three firms had a series of written agreements sharing out the ¤30 million sewing needle market.
It seems there was no honour among thieves. Coats and Prym were also found guilty of keeping
Entaco out of the market between 1994 and 1999.
Coats is appealing the ruling in the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
Investigation number two, into the ¤30 million market for industrial thread, ended a year later with a  fine
of ¤18.5 million for Coats. It will pay during the next two years.
The third investigation, still ongoing, is into the much bigger ¤1.5 billion zips and fasteners market. Coats' chief executive Michael Smithyman said the size of the market was no indication of how large a
fine the company might cop because Coats' involvement in the alleged  cartel practices was much
smaller than in the previous two cases.

Coats has said it will pay all  fines out of a specially established provision but Smithyman wouldn't say how much had been set aside.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE, COO, SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC: So good morning everybody. Thank you to come here. So we're going to welcome you this morning with the results of the Schneider Electric for 2006 and give you some perspective about the merger with APC, as well as the next phase of new2.

Well certainly, 2006 shows or breaks historical records in terms for Schneider Electric. In terms of organic growth, for the first time, above 10 at 10.7%, and with an EBIT which is above 14 at 14.6% and 1.2% above the historical highs that were taking place last year as well as year 2000.

TD
It's a year that shows we are able to capture opportunities, growth opportunities, thanks to our presence worldwide, our global presence, the construction of a portfolio activities which we integrate around key applications and our investment in innovation. It also shows that we keep on driving our transformation, our back office transformation, our research for efficiency, and we keep on improving our profitability, even if
we were already starting from a pretty high level.

So I'd like to move straight to slide 5, if this wants to work. I'll try the other one. Right. I'll make a zoom first about growth. Certainly, we are in a favorable economic context, we acknowledge it. But we know how to benefit from it and capture the opportunities. Again, in 2006, an organic growth of 10.7% with a very strong fourth quarter again. If we look back at the past three years, it's an average of 9% organic growth over the past three years, and an acceleration in sales growth versus a world GDP in the last few years, with a differential to the GDP of 4%. This was obviously, and we acknowledge it, in a favorable environment, but even this growth is rather much at the top of our industry.

Now if we go to the next slide which is about, and I will manage to manipulate this complicated gadget, but if we go to the next slide, we are looking for efficiency. This time, this was done in a very unfavorable environment, marred by a sweep of currency which was not favorable for Schneider, and marked also by a strong increase of raw materials, especially in the past three years. And still, in that unfavorable environment, we delivered an operating margin in 2006 of 14.6%. It's the third year of improvement, almost one point every year regularly. And in absolute value, because sometimes you have to come back to basic things, it's a doubling of the operating profit since first starting from the 2003 level. So doubling in three years the level of the operating profit.

This was done mainly by cost cutting, streamlining and cutting the back office, simplification of the back office. Again, when we look at that, there is still space for improvement, and we're going to be keeping on driving the new2 plan for efficiency, with simplification, streamlining and making sure we are becoming more global and more efficient.

If I look back at those past three years, it has been a mix of organic growth and a mix of external growth. Organic growth has done most of the job. If I look back three years it's roughly 57% growth. 29% is organic, the rest is external. And we did the integration of the new companies where it's still improving the profitability, which shows that we have a plan on the methodology also for integrating the company that we are working in our platform of Schneider Electric.

So now I'm going to move -- well this as a summary of the performance of the year. Sales, plus 18%; EBITDA, plus 27%; operating income, plus 28%; operating margin EBIT, up 1.2 points; EPS, plus 31%; dividend, plus 33%; and the ROCE, plus 1.2 points.

I'm going to [scroll] through, together with Pierre, through all of these subjects. It should make quite a heavy conference today but we have quite a lot to speak if we put together 2006, APC and the second step, or the second phase of new2.

Page 71 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So moving to the new2 update. Remind you that as an introduction that we are today in a very attractive industry, for many reasons. If we look at our industry, there are still massive needs for electrification. Roughly 1.6 billion people in the world which, who don't have electricity. 1.2 billion people who don't have access to drinkable water, and to get drinkable water you need quite a lot of automation and electricity. You have, for instance, also 600 airports project today in the world where we are well positioned to serve the electrical automation needs. We know that the investment, the electricity consumption will double within the year 2030 because the industry, on every application, is becoming more electricity-intensive. And certainly the move of population to the cities is creating also more space for the development of our industry.

You have to add to that there is pervasion to the automation everywhere. Where people were satisfied with electro-mechanical products, non-communicating products, people want comfort and productivity and they want to be able to control and monitor what is happening from their seat, from their PC. They want to make statistics, they want to consolidate, and this is creating another booster to our industry.

There is, obviously, a fast demand for energy savings, and I believe we have a unique positioning in this field, putting together our capacities of critical power, building automation, and of power automation. There is obviously a growing need for places for our growing presence of application where power is critical, and this is all a game of APC. A growing number of applications which are asking for ultra pure, no interruption kind of power supply.

And, finally, most of our customers consider that electricity automation is [inaudible] and it's core to their business. By the way they are getting more and more complicated, so more and more difficult to master by themselves. And there is a clear trend for outsourcing in our industry and people asking for more services on hi-tech services.
All of these are drivers of this industry which elevates the growth profile of our business.

Now the key strengths of Schneider Electric in front of that, leading positions in Power & Control. We know that we do 65% of our turnover in number one position, 85 in number one or number two position. We have a comprehensive integrated and innovative offering. I'll come back on that, but I think we have one of the most integrated portfolio of our industry. We have things which are combining between specialty activities
to deliver value to our customers in terms of CapEx or in terms of OpEx savings.

We have a wide geographical coverage. We operate today in 190 countries with direct or indirect representation of Schneider in 163 countries. We have a flexible business model, which is based on partnerships, whether it be upstream with suppliers or downstream with integrators, which enable us to deploy fast and to deploy locally with a local -- with a flavor, with more than a flavor, with characteristics of adaptation to the local culture and local habits. And we have a capacity to play a consolidation role in an industry which worldwide, remains fragmented.

It's a business of EUR200 billion that we are playing in, and still the business that we are representing in there, if we consider APC, is a bit more than 15 billion. So there is space for consolidation and we have the capacity, managerially and financially, to create more.

Now I move to the next slide. Remind you the main aspects of new2. I won't go into details, you know them. But new2 is our program for growth, efficiency and people. The main [pieces] for growth are geographical coverage, innovation, adding new activities here in the field of electricity and automation, on capacity to
build solutions, efficiency around rebalancing, optimization on streamlining, on productivity, on globalization. And people, it's around development of competencies and diversities.

I'm going to scroll through the detail of all of these aspects right now, starting by the geographical coverage. And these are figures that we have [voluntarily] put with the perspective of two years. You know that new2 is four years' plan. We've just finished the first set. We're entering now into the second set of new2. So those are compounded averages of the two years. Again, this year while emerging countries was going to represent 31% of our sales, we are coming from 18% in 2001, so that's a growing importance of those geographies into our portfolio. Actually the growth that we had globally in 2006 were rather higher than what you see here. China was at above 17%, India was above 40%, so the dynamics that we have in the emerging countries are confirmed.

Well 2008 will be probably a turning point because we are going to be above 1 billion in China, EUR1 billion of turnover in China. So that confirms also the importance that China is taking in the portfolio of Schneider. But we have also very valuable positions in Russia, in India and in Brazil especially.
Well I was expecting, to be frank, the emerging countries to take a wider space in our portfolio at the end of
2006, but this has to be compounded with the fact that Europe, good old Europe, and North America did
also tremendous growth in 2006. Europe at 9.6%, and my European Executive VPs are asking to qualify for
emerging country status, which they formally refused. And North America at 7.5%. But if you isolate there
the part of Square D because we have there compounded the [50] which is a census, and we know that
Page 72 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this is transitioning business model, therefore the turnover is flat. And TAC, which I spoke about, had had some years of integration therefore not [inaudible] and Square D is at 10% growth in North America. So that makes very strong dynamics for the core businesses of Schneider everywhere in the world. So first bit of growth, geographical deployment and this booster is really well working today.

The second one is about innovation. I'll remind you the key directions for innovation. We are consolidating our R&D centers in mature countries and we opened last year formally Electropole in Grenoble and some of you had the opportunity to visit Electropole. We are also making sure that we are present in high tech countries, in Japan, in the US in Boston, in California, in many places in the US; that we are present in
Germany also. And well, France today is making 30% of this R&D set up. We are making quite tremendous transformations in this field worldwide. To date 30% of the people working in our R&D are software people, and more than 50% are, I would say 60%, are in electronics and software, which shows you also that we
are moving also the [needles] in that part of the organization.

We also recruited last year Bernard Larrouturou who is well known in France because he was the head of the biggest lab in France in the past. And he is bringing his scientific view on big links to the international community from the scientific point of view.
One thing we are developing very much today, it's also application centers. They don't account into our
R&D expenses, but I consider them as a direct extension of our innovation capability into the product. It is a
capability to produce turnkey or integrated solutions for our customers. And we've got today 60 application
centers in 18 countries focused on a certain number of verticals. Let's take the automation system of an
elevator, or well, whatever. Data center application resourcing that we are working on and which are driving
the innovation.

I want to mention also that we have partnerships now with 50 private university laboratories all over the world. It can be the MIT, it can be in Russia, it can be in China and we are developing research programs with them.

In terms of results, the boost new products program launched in 2005 is really accelerating in 2006 with 40 major programs which are concerned by this, which are part of this boost new products program, are growing 50% in 2006, which is much better, obviously, than the average of the Group. And all of the products that we are developing today are what we call future ready. That means they embark intelligence, electronics and communication capabilities. Therefore they are integrated in a package system that can be supervised and monitored from an automation point of view.

Now moving to the next slide. The next booster that we have to growth is building new activities into an integrated portfolio. I'd like you to -- this is not building verticals inside the company. This is building bricks to the electrical solution. We remain extremely focused in our field, which is power & control electrical distribution and automation which we believe are really converging today, especially with the growing need of energy efficiency. You can't make energy efficiency if you don't have control of your installation. So merging the two makes it possible to save energy. And what we started historically from the two blocks at the top, the low and medium ,voltage where we have a very good position, a leadership position in the world today on industrial control.

And over the past three to four years, we've built strong positions in building automation, starting from TAC, and with some major acquisition we did once every year. This is a block now of EUR850 million of turnover. Now we built also very strong block in [inaudible] home control, which is close to EUR1.5 billion of turnover. We developed a strong presence in energy management. For us, energy management has two components. The first one is energy savings, and the second one is making sure that we deliver a no interruption on [inaudible] electricity to critical applications.

Basically managing the new context of energy is not taking the hypotheses that there will be electricity from the grid. Actually the electricity from the grid is missing more and more. Will it be in the emerging world, or will it be in the natural world? You've seen blackouts in Europe in November. You see frequent blackouts in the US, you see frequent blackouts in India, and you see frequent blackouts in China. Managing the electricity is saving energy, but it is also making sure that you can operate and live when there is no electricity, which is the second leg of energy management.

This is, in 2006, a pool of EUR1.3 billion for us. Now, well clearly by the adding of APC we add to that EUR1.8 billion which will make a total pool of around EUR3 billion. I want to add to that services, which are embedded in all of those activities, but the total of the services that we deliver in critical power, in power and automation in all the fields that you see here on building automation are representing in 2006 more than EUR1.1 billion of turnover and growing very fast. You see that these new activities are also participating very actively to the growth of Schneider Electric.

This is around the key application that we always define the residential, the building, the industry, and the infrastructure including the utilities. This is a very integrated portfolio and I come back on that. And I would say that in 2007 after the acquisition and the integration of APC, around 50% of what Schneider will be selling in the field of electricals and automation, was not in the portfolio of Schneider Electric in '99. So it's also a trip of transformation and of construction of complete solutions for our customers.

Moving to the next slide which is the last pillar of our growth strategy. It is the capacity from those activities to be complete solutions. We have here one thing which is typically exemplary of what we do in Schneider. It's not a huge project; it's not a politically visible project. This is a project in Italy where we delivered an integrated system putting together cooling capabilities and GAC securities capabilities, electrical solution capabilities, and cabling capabilities. By putting that, the customer together, the customer is saving on the CapEx because he is unifying his cabling into one unified system. And he's saving also on his energy bill. So that's what we are doing. You don't only need the bricks, you need to be able on the field to put them together and to answer to the customer into integrated solutions.

I'd like to make two slides on energy savings, because this is clearly a big point of focus for Schneider Electric. This is a market that we see today growing at 15% to 20% a year. This is a place where we can propose to our customers where they are 10 to 30% energy savings. This is something that we developed from two origins. One coming from North America, from [PowerLogic] that we got from Square D, on PMI that we acquired two or three years ago, three years ago. Two years ago. In Canada that gives us a very strong presence. In North America and from TAC, that has a strong activity in this field coming from the HVAC control on AGAC energy savings.

We can propose three levels of savings based on the new growth investment and commitment of the customer. One can be done by products enabling energy saving. For instance, when you take an industrial [motor], you put a drive, an electronic drive, you will save energy; 15%. You get to a next step in terms of energy saving if you put intelligence at the top of the system, so this is supervision. On the next step is delivering other new services, consulting in terms of energy efficiency. And we do that based on technology. We don't do facility management, but we can drop at our customers' facilities people who will
make a diagnosis of what's happening and propose remedies. We not only are the doctors, we are also the drug store. What makes a difference with other consultants in this field is that not only we are able to
deliver a recipe for efficiency, but we're also about to implement it in the next phase.

So we give you a few examples that you see here. In industry, motors account for 60% of the electricity usage. So average facility can reduce energy consumption by 10 to 20%. In a building, most of the energy is electricity on many lighting, and HVAC. On the other combining TAC and our capacity in electrical distribution, we can supply energy saving potential of 15 to 30%, and in homes too, it is becoming more and more a demand on using lighting control. Especially on electrical facility control we can deliver 10 to
30% energy saving.

This is something also we are implementing in Schneider. Payback is between two to four years in main applications. Clearly this is market which is boosted by the Kyoto protocol application, the [consensus] of environmental sustainable development that is taking place at the moment in many places in the world, and this is a place where we are going to keep on developing very actively.

So growth around geographical deployment, innovation, new activities, solution capabilities, of which energy efficiency on critical power especially court which we do.

Now I'm going to move to the efficiency part of new2. Well, this is a second era of new2 and we are in line with the objectives we had in terms of rebalancing and in terms of optimization of the manufacturing base. Rebalancing at the end of the second year, we are very balanced. More than EUR500 million of course from high cost countries to low cost countries, of which half of it from the Eurozone to the non Eurozone. You know that we are through at pursuing the double target to be closer to our customers on our growth areas, as well as pursuing the target to be more rebalanced in terms of currency impact.

So this is slightly above target and we are quite confident about the next step that we are going to be able to rebalance the same amount in the second set of new2.

We've kept on optimizing our manufacturing base, boosting up our plans in low cost countries, and [closing] eight more plans into 2006 in the mature countries. And we've stepped up outsourcing. When you see where we are coming in 2004, where 27% of our sales in low cost countries to be compared to 18% of production costs in low cost countries. In 2006 we have 31% of our sales in low cost countries, and already
28% of our production costs in low cost countries.
By the way it's not the only function that we are rebalancing. Take the R&D. The creation of Bangalore and
[Shanghai] in terms of R&D has also contributed to more rebalancing of the cost of Schneider.


Page 74 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Another part of the efficiencies is streamlining of the simplification, with a big emphasis on logistic centers. We've closed ten more logistic centers in 2006. Well we've opened a distribution center in Hong Kong, which will be our hub in Asia Pacific. We are in a very strong transformation in that field with a good effect that already last year our logistics cost decreased in percentage of sales by 80 basis points. There is negative to that which is inventory. As we do this transformation we've created, we've really given in 2006 which was a year of high demand, the priority to customer service. And to do that we have made sure that where we are closing or moving our logistics centers, there will be enough inventory not to have disruptions in our service chain, which grows to a certain inventory increase that we are going to see afterwards with some impact in our working capital.

The other points for plans for efficiency. IT systems, we are keeping on with our bridge program. We are going to be, while the transfer of our IT in Europe has been competent in 2005. This is no new news, but we are now going live in the next coming months with a pilot of bridge, which will be the core system from
Schneider Electric where we have embedded what we think is a target process for every entity in the Group to adapt. Once this will be tested and finalized, we're going to deploy it in the world, and this is when the
real gains are coming inside our IT on many functions of the Group. This is when we can derive a productivity benefit in every process of the Group. But this a key -- we're going to go live with the first system and test it and see if it answers all of our needs, which I'm pretty confident of.

Lean manufacturing. We keep on deploying that. Now many sites have been through that. It's 140 sites at the end of 2006. Six Sigma has a culture for resolution of problems. In the companies, 3,600 committed projects so far and with very good results everywhere. We are going to keep on pushing on that. We have got more people in the company who have a competence in that field. And I would say we've invested but controlled our costs equally in 2006. If you take constant perimeter without the impact of parity, we had a leverage between our base cost on the growth of 3%. The main investment we put was in emerging countries, and in the service activity as well as R&D. Those were the three points of investment for 2006.

Now the people side of new2. Well we have quite a lot going on here, and I don't want if I want to detail everything here because I am not sure it's your main point of focus, but we are doing a lot in this year today. The transformation and describing in terms of technology, in terms of geography and in terms of businesses, are going. For instance, new services, we are going to the Ultra Terminal; the wiring accessories, which is a different kind of culture, are asking for us quite tremendous changes in terms of people and quite a bit anticipation in terms of people.

So we are going to be closing 2006 with 105,000 employees, so quite a big community of people around the world. Our first country in terms of population is still France, with the US just behind, and China has come in as the third population of the Group. I would say once we've closed [Belishi] China will become probably the second population of the Group. When I say probably, it will be the second population of our nation of Schneider. So that's also shift with respect to where we are coming from, which is rather important.

The thing that we are doing is around three axes. Develop the competencies in front of the new challenges. I was speaking about technology, geographies, businesses which are new solution services. Second one is develop diversity, and the third one is improve safety.

On the development of competencies, we have an 80% of the entities of the Group of competency plan which is accessing the talent that we have on the competencies we have, where we have to go within three to five years, what are the gaps and what we have to prepare. We have created in the frame of new2 the Schneider Electric University, with two axes. Managerial and specialties. That means we have developed universities for the sales and marketing, for the supply chain, for the financing.

And more. We have 11 branches like this of key specialties for Schneider. In 2005, we had 3,000 people who went through that Schneider Electric university. In 2006, we had 9,000 people going through Schneider Electric university. On developing the same language, on the same processes, into the same business. We have also 1,000 people that come through the managerial university of Schneider.

We have obviously some commitment into the apprenticeship program for the people coming from France. They know that Henri Lachmann is very engaged into the form of education and it's also good for us.

In the field of electricity, there is a shortage of electricians in the world, because everybody wants to win to finance as you know. But electricity is a very, very nice business. Probably it is that there are people trained to it, and the problem is that they are no people trained to it today enough in the world, and our duty is to train them, and I see that as a tremendous marketing opportunity.

Second point is strengthen through diversity. There is a diversity of nationality. There is also diversity of genders, which is an opportunity in Schneider, with an opportunity, a gap to fill. Nationality we are


Page 75 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
progressing quite a lot. We have now in the 800 top positions of the Group 60 nationalities, actually 59 -- I'm optimistic in life -- nationalities operating.

We have doubled the number of ex-pats to make of Schneider more for melting pot in the next, past three years. We have now, on those ex-pats, also a reflection of those 60 nationalities, and we have in those moves, the 800 people, we have now 15% of women which is not a lot. I agree with that. But it's immensely more than what we had three years ago. And if I take the top position for the Group, this is a place where
we have 20% of women, and we need to develop that more because I am personally tired of homochromatic company.

Improved safety. This is a place where we are pretty happy and proud of what we are doing. We had an objective of decreasing the loss days at work by 20%. We decreased it by 32%. The average that we have today is 0.23 days per person per year, which really places us among the very good companies, the safest companies in the world. And this is something that we keep on working on because it's a big factor of motivation, and we feel responsible for the people working for us.

Last thing I'd like to say is we do employee satisfaction surveys in a regular way in Schneider Electric. We have 78% answer rate which is rather high and shows the motivation and the commitment of the people. And what it shows is that the population of Schneider Electric has a rather strong commitment, a respect to the bench of the industry, and I think it's part of the results. I have a say in this company that the customers experience can't exceed the people experience inside the company, and the more I go inside the company, the more I really believe in that mantra.

So this is about people. Next one is about sustainable development, and this is a barometer of sustainable development that we have put inside new2. I spoke about the accident at work. 100% today of our employees has a basic health insurance. We ensure that 20% of people on the international mobility program are women. Today we're at 15%, but we're at half of the program. As I said, we still have two years to go, and it will be 20%. Donation of -- for responsibility to the community, we have taken the
commitment of donating more than 1 million of equipment to the community, especially for the education of people -- youngsters with difficulties. And we have given 2 million last year. Our [inaudible], our foundation gave 7 million last year to the community.

We ensure that 90% of the sites have a direct commitment in the area of [inaudible] education and integration, and this is happening. Today we're at 85%, so it's growing. I personally visited quite -- some of the sites. In South East Asia we did post Tsunami at the beginning of the year. I visited also the area of Katrina at the beginning of the year, and in both sites we've taken care of health, energy, schools, and reconstruction of what -- of the environment, and I tell you, it's quite moving to go on those places.

In the environment, 100% of sites certified ISO14001. We're at 90% today, and most of the non certified are coming from the acquisitions. Environmental profile for 120 products. It's 65 products that we've done so far; still two years to go. That takes some time to complete that.
Reducing energy consumption per production site by minus 10%. Schneider is consuming an energy of
1300 GW hour a year without transportation, and we are aiming of saving 10% of that. Today we are at 6%,
but again, we are equating -- we are putting under control more sites.

And in terms of corporate responsibilities, we aim at making 60% of our suppliers conforming to the global compact. Today we are just at 16%, so there is a long way to go, but we are working on it and we want to be included in four major [such areas] responsible investment index families, and we are today in three of them.

Last point where I'm going to go pretty fast, but I tell you that in the day to the life in a company, it's very important is the governance of the company. We had the transition in 2006 from governance and from people, from Henri Lachmann to me in terms of people, and from governance to an integrated system, to a double lever system, with a super region board on the management board.

I can tell you from my personal experience that it went exceptionally  fine; very well and smoothly, and we're working well together. We have a diversified supervisory board, mainly industrial and very active. I would say supportive and entrepreneurial. The case EPC reassured it. Meetings which were dedicated. A lot of slide discussions within the board, and a lot of challenge from the board on the operations; almost as challenging as we were on this operation.

It was difficult, but they were really changing the operation before, but once we had secured all the elements [of answer] to the board, very supportive of this operation. A very specific implication of our board on acquisitions. Every project over 250 million is by -- reviewed by the board. Actually in practical, we review most every case together with the board, and there is a yearly review of the past acquisitions to make sure that we are in line with the business plans. And we have two committees, audit committees on remuneration, appointment, and corporate governance committee.
Page 76 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As a summary of that long review of new2 but it's the end, in fact, we are at the mid of the [inaudible] party of the match for new2. Well growth, and these are just the final show indicators. You know that in new2 we have customer satisfaction indexes. We have environment index that we review just before, and we have people index. But for the financial growth of the target, EBIT twice faster at the top of the target. ROCE plus
2 points in two years, which is within the bracket after two years, and just in line with our ambition. On retail and investment, 50% dividend distribution payout ratio. On balance sheet optimization after EPC, but
before capital increase, of 69%, which is beyond what we have said two years ago.
And I now hand the mike to Pierre Bouchut who will go through the financial part of the presentation. PIERRE BOUCHUT, CFO, SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC: Thank you. Well, as you can see, 2006 is for
Schneider Electric, another year of strong progression for its results. Our sales grew by 18% up to
EUR13.8 billion. The organic growth rate is up 10.7%. The impact of acquisition is about 7%, while the euro
foreign exchange situation has almost no impact on our sales trend.

The gross margin improved by 0.7 points up to 41.4%. Our EBITDA grew by 27% and exceeds EUR2.5 billion, and after a deduction of EUR116 million of restructuring costs and asset impairments, an amount which is identical to the amount of last year, our EBIT which is 2,001 million. Its progression is of 28%, and our EBIT margin or EBIT profitability which an all time high of 14.6% as Jean-Pascal already stressed it.

Despite an increase, an average increase of our net debt from one year to another of about EUR700 million, but owing to a tight control -- yes, thank you -- of our interest expenses, but also to a reduction of our effective tax rate from 29.1% in 2005 down to 28.5% in 2006, our net income grew up by 32%, up to
EUR1,309 million and at EUR5.95 per share. Our EPS increased from -- increased by 30.5% from one year to another.
And moving to the following slide. this chart presents the difference -- sorry, the wrong page. The difference
-- the breakdown of the Group, 10.7% organic growth through the different geographies, and at constant
perimeter and foreign exchange rate. Two items are worth noting. First of all, each of our geographic
division has posted a strong growth rate. As you can see Europe plus 9.6, North America plus 7.5, Asia
Pacific plus 17.7 -- plus 15.7, I'm sorry; Middle East, Africa and Latin America plus 16%. And the second
point worth noting is that with 17.1%, our growth has remained practically solid in emerging countries.

The following chart is the analysis of the increase of our EBIT from EUR1,565 million in 2005 up to EUR2,001 million in 2006. Out of 28 points of EBIT progressions, 21 points are explained by organic growth, while 7 points are explained by acquisition. And here again, almost no impact from the euro foreign exchange fluctuation versus the other currencies.

As you can see, with EUR512 million, the volume impact is very significant, while the change in our mix of activities had a negative EUR88 million impact with the growing importance, in particular, of our services sales, and of our solution and product sales with lower EBIT margins. The combined effect of 227 raw material price increases, with an increase of our own sales prices for EUR141 million, had a negative impact here reported at EUR86 million. It is important to note that our sales price increases in the second half of the year for a total of EUR102 million, were more than twice bigger than what we achieved in the first half of the year with EUR39 million.

Then, as you can see, our continued efforts to improve our industrial productivity have generated EUR307 million of savings, while our other operating costs, labor, production labor costs and SG&A, have increased by EUR295 million.

As indicated, our industrial productivity achievements generated EUR307 million savings, as indicated on this chart, which is about equivalent to the EUR304 million savings of last year. Those savings are broken down as follows. EUR97 million savings through improved purchasing conditions, owing to better
negotiation with suppliers, but also to the value engineering of our products, EUR50 million savings through lean manufacturing, as explained by Jean-Pascal, EUR84 million gain from manufacturing rebalancing to low cost country, and, at last, EUR76 million impact generated by industry rationalization coming from closing down of manufacturing sites or regrouping of manufacturing site. All in, such productivity improvement represented 4.5% of our product cost of sales in 2006.

One can derive two lessons from this following chart. First of all, the relative share of our sales in Europe continues to decline. 49% in 2005, 47% in 2006, add the benefit of North America and Asia. Moreover, all our different geographies post solid and homogenous EBIT profitability. In Europe, the EBIT margin increased from 13.5% to 15.4% despite raw material price increases, and despite the fact that we have been slow in Europe to pass over such raw material price increases into our own sales prices, but owing to good productivity improvements and also to a strong volume effect.

In North America, our EBIT margin increased from 13.3% to 14% despite the adverse evolution, as you know, in North America of our mix of business, with [more] services and with residential coming down, and
Page 77 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this has an impact on our EBIT profitability. But owing too in North America, a total and almost immediate transferring of sales prices of the raw material price increases.

In Asia, as you can see, our EBIT margin is steady also at 13%. This reflects, first of all, a significant investment in our manufacturing plans, sales forces, R&D forces in Asia, to boost our dynamism and to increase our market share. And, in addition, Clipsal Asia, which has been consolidated as of January 1, since we took over, January 1, 2006, we took over the management control of Clipsal Asia on that date, and Clipsal Asia is in the process of being turned down, but it's consolidation --
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: No. Not turned down.
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Turned around. But its consolidation has an adverse impact.

At last, in Middle East, Latin America and Africa, the progression from 14% to 15.5% of our EBIT margin is explained by a tight management control of our rapid expansion in that area.

In the same way, one may note on this following chart first of all, the stability of the sales breakdown between electrical distribution, automation and control and critical power, and the very comparable growth rate of operating profits of each of those activities at 25% also. Please note that such reported EBIT margins are calculated after our central cost allocation.

At last, as indicated on this following chart, our EPS has grown by 26% per year over the last three years, and our dividend have grown by 29% per year over the same period, when taking into account the EUR3 dividend per share that we will propose to our shareholders meeting on next April 26. We are pleased also to show that our TSR, total shareholder return, has reached 24% per year over the last three years, and this is based on Schneider share price on December 31, 2006.

As indicated in our 2006 sources and uses of funds, which is now presented, EUR1,921 million of operating cash flow. The repayment of EUR177 million Legrand vendor credit, EUR113 million proceeds from stock option exercises, and a limited additional EUR73 million of debt increase has financed EUR481 million of capital expenditures, EUR413 million of additional working capital needs, EUR493 million of dividends, and EUR1,006 million of acquisition. Here, again, it's worth noting that our free cash flow has progressed by
30% to reach EUR1,107 million.

As Jean-Pascal explained it during the first part of his presentation, in an environment of a strong demand for our products on one hand, and in the context of a very ambitious customer satisfaction program in 2006 within Schneider Electric on the other hand, we succeeded to control the increase of our working capital need from 21.2% to 21.4% of our sales. One must recognize that the relating strong pressure within our supply chain resulted in an inevitable build up of margin of safety with an increase or our inventory day by two days, and a reduction by two days of our payable as well.

Naturally, such good results, combined with the limited growth of our capital employed, result in a sharp progression of our different profitability ratio, as you can see. Our ROCE measured by the ratio of EBITDA after tax divided by capital employed increased from 13.2% up to 14.6% in 2006. Our ROCE measured by the EBIT after tax divided by capital employed increased up to 11.7% in 2006, and at last, our return on equity, measured by the operating cash flow after tax divided by shareholder equity, increased from 18.6% in 2005 to 21.7% in 2006.

Owing to those good results, and to our solid cash generation, our balance sheet structure improved from one year to another with, first of all, an improvement of our interest coverage by our EBITDA from 19 times in 2005 to 24 times in 2006. Second, an increase of our operating cash flow to net debt from 88% in 2005 to 105% in 2006.

Obviously, as evidenced on this chart, our APC acquisition will drastically change our financial structure in our pro forma 2006 accounts. With APC being consolidated, and as of December 2006, and before any capital increase, our operating cash flow to net debt ratio deteriorates from 105% to 32%, while this same ratio but calculated with rating agency adjustments, deteriorates from 66% to 27%, as you can see.

In this context, our announced capital increase with pre-emptive rights, will allow us first of all, to partly refinance the EUR4.3 billion APC acquisition, and on the ongoing already announced other acquisition for a total consideration of EUR800 million. Please note in this respect, that we have announced two acquisitions which have not yet been closed which are [Belishi] in China and [Ulan] in China, which will be closed in the coming weeks and months. And second, will also allow us to benefit for the future from a better leveraged financial structure. Based on better than expected cash generation at year-end 2006 and to our related improved balance sheet structure, we have decided to size down our capital increase, as you know, to EUR1 billion and, as you know as well, we aim for a target a BBB plus rating.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: So now, I'm going to give you an update on APC. Well, I guess, there's a lot of attention in Schneider on the APC integration and, I guess, outside of Schneider on the integration of APC. And I'd like to start by saying that the new business is born. This is a company that -- we have a situation in front that we are in consultation, at the moment in a formal consultation, with representatives of the employees, with the unions, to get it totally approved. But know that, from day one, that means last week when we closed the operation, there was one name of the company, one commercial policy for the company, one letter that went out to all the customers of APC and MGE that same day, and there was one proposed organization chart, which is the organizational chart of the combined entity, the first day of the closing. Quite a lot of intense work that took place in the past three months between the teams of MGE and APC and Schneider Electric.
So well, if you look, we got cleared by the US competition authorities on December 11, by the ones of
European commission on February 8. We got the shareholders approval, as forecasted, on January 16,
2007. The closing was completed on February 14, 2007, which by a touch of delicacy, was also St.
Valentine's Day. You have also to be attentive to the  finer details in the way you close such an operation.
Well, we created that day the Critical power [and cooling] services business units, because we believe that
in this field you have to put together the power and cooling services. Again, brand and commercial policy
defined, to be implemented within one month. We've got one month today where we are going below and
minus one on making sure that everybody is finding his place. Not everybody, by the way, but that the new
organization is done from the two previous organizations. So integration is not taking -- what does that
mean?
PIERRE BOUCHUT: It's hibernating.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Is that to be speaking about Critical Power? To be victim of a power shutdown. Pierre, [inaudible]. So you see that power is critical to many applications. So, anyway, you've got the booklet. Follow me on the booklet. It's good to be back to traditional methodologies.

We've appointed Laurent Vernerey as the Critical Power business unit CEO. Laurent's been with Schneider for a long time. Actually, whatever his name say, he's been most of his time with Square D. He start from
our American organization, and his latest experience was with me in international where he did -- he was the head of the Pacific and did the whole integration of [Kidso] in the Pacific, together with Schneider. So he's coming exactly out from an experience of integration of two organizations in the past few years.

If you move to slide 41, I think, that's it, we see the -- it's put projected organization because it's in consolidation with our unions, but this is the organization. EVP, Laurent Vernerey in charge of the business unit. The Finance Director is also coming from Schneider Electric.
I remind you that when APC was brought, APC was brought because there was no CEO any more. The
CEO was taken away on August 15, and this created the opportunity for us to move on APC.

And then, you have a first line, which is a combination. You have here the picture of one of -- this is Laurent Vernerey. You are going to meet Laurent Vernerey. But the combination of the first line is a combination of the people of MGE on APC.

In broad lines, and to make it simple, MGE takes the lead on large systems and Europe, where they were stronger, and China, because really MGE is very strong there in China. APC is taking the lead on small systems, where they are referenced, on North America, also on the rest of Asia, where they were much better than MGE.

So this is the combination that you have today. You have names behind all of the logos but I tend not to put the names of my direction teams in the public domain too easily, so this is just to give you a flavor of the split of the combination.

The company will be headquartered in Rhode Island, in Providence, which is the headquarter of APC, and the European headquarter will be based in Grenoble where MGE is based. A lot of good work that has been done, and actually faster than I was expecting really. And people, already, are looking at the product road maps, the synergies and their customers.

I don't want to spend too much time. You know that we estimate that critical power is at the core of the strategy of Schneider Electric. It's part of the evolution, the natural evolution of electrical distribution. We are leaders in the world in low voltage electrical distribution, and there are fast growing segments in electrical distribution, in low voltage electrical distribution. Energy efficiency is certainly part of them, and critical power is another one. So it was critical for us to be positioned here. And with that move, our size in this business is probably four times bigger than the next follower.

I remind you also that we have a divestment to operate in the next coming six months. This divestment was asked by the European community, and is just in line with the business spend that was presented during
Page 79 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the acquisition. It's the small systems of MGE that we are going to divest, and this process is already launched.

Now just to finalize by telling you that it's not only about UPS. It's in most of the applications we are talking about. For $1 of UPS there are $1 to $2 more of other Schneider Electric stuff. So by mastering the core of that system, we created space for developing the whole system on developing synergies, of which not all of them are accounted in the business plan of the acquisition.

So today, as a summary, and before moving on to the financial aspect of it where there are some good news also, but I'm pretty -- we are, I think, ahead of the time line in terms of the integration process. We've chosen a bold approach to the integration process because it was the only way to make the synergies, and we think there is no way to wait. There is no interest to wait. And I've found a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of movement and momentum in the teams gathering and developing the new company.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes. This following chart is a comparison between APC Q4 results in 2005 and 2006. You can note very tangible improvements with a sharp 24% increase of sales, which averaged $718 million in Q4 2006 and, above all, a 1.5 point improvement of gross margin up to 33.9%, which is broken down as follows. First of all, a positive 3.1 point impact from productivity improvement and supply chain rationalization. Second, a negative 1.7 impact from raw material price increases. Three, a positive 0.8 point impact of the volume. And, four, a negative 0.7 point impact from sales mix evolution with the growing proportion of services.

You will also note the limited 17% increase of operating expenses and therefore, the resulting 86% jump of the operating profit at $65.4 million on Q4 2006.

These following chart illustrate the steady progression of APC performances all over 2006, with a 20% sales growth, and a regular improvement of its EBIT profitability. I think that projected trends is self speaking, and is a clue of the real restructuring work achieved by APC all over 2006.

As you know, APC will be consolidated into Schneider accounts as of February 15 this year. The goodwill before purchase accounting is of $4.5 billion. The allocation of such goodwill will be decided during 2007. It is worth nevertheless mentioning two things for good understanding in the future of all financial statements. First of all, the annual APC intangible depreciation should be in the neighborhood of EUR70 million, more
or less. And two, over the coming 12 months, APC organic growth will not be reported within our Group's organic growth but as an impact of acquisition.

This following chart reminds you our value creation objective for the APC acquisition. It also provides you with a sensitivity analysis of such of value creation according to the discount right you may use and according to the realization level of the expected synergies. The work done over the last three month by the respective APC and Schneider teams makes us confident in our capacity to implement the announced synergies. Our base case, as you know, and when taking into account $220 million of identified synergies and their five year ramp up, and when using as a discount rate a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%,
is a total value creation, as you can see it on this chart, of the $3.3 billion which translates into value creation of EUR11.5 per Schneider share.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Now we're going to speak about new2. So on a very collective point of view, we are entering 2007 in a very optimistic way. I think we see a business which is good in front of us, very much in the line of what we've seen in the past three years. Well clearly, it was time to review the targets of new2 because we had in two years reached the top of the bracket in terms of EBIT, and it had always been a question of you guys saying, well what's next? How will you manage a second set if you go faster than expected? And the good news is that we went up [any] faster than expected. We had always said that we would reinvest a part of that accelerated growth into development, and we're going to be speaking about that. But certainly we can fix to ourselves a high ambition, and what we communicated to you at the beginning of 2005.

So we are reviewing today the targets of new2 in the following way. In terms of organic growth, two years ago we are saying we should deliver other cycle 5% growth. We are saying now that we should be delivering more than 6%. Well I am saying more because when I see the present environment, I think we are again optimistic about what's coming, but at the same time we have to look across the past ten years and remain humble. It's more important to deliver than to declare, and to make a kind of contest in other [inaudible]. So we are quite bullish on [inaudible] that our model will keep on delivering the future.

In terms of EBIT, we want to deliver something which is up half a point respect our previous declaration; 13 to 15%, but we are going to come back on that and explain where we come from once we have consolidated APC. So APC has a negative impact on then EBIT, and then it's 1 to 1.5 points of improvement that we want to achieve on EBIT in the next coming two years. On the ROCE improvement, we want to deliver plus two points in the next coming two years.

Page 80 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We could have gone for totally new plan for Schneider. I didn't want that -- we didn't want that. There is no [zapping here]. We want to keep on in line with what we have started two years ago. All the transformations we have started two years ago are still valid for today. And I want the company [crew] to be keeping on delivering on the second set along with the axis and the directions that we have initiated in the past two years.

So we are going to be consistently keeping on working on those axes. There is a lot of, to be done on growth. A lot, a lot to be done on efficiency, a lot to be done also on our people delivering.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: So we target for the two coming years an organic growth rate in excess of three points over the world GDP growth rate, i.e., as Jean-Pascal said, higher than 6% all together.

From '95 to 2004, our organic growth rate has exceeded the world GDP growth rate by 1 point. And our initial new2 target, as you know, was an organic growth rate in excess of 2 points over the world GDP growth rate. Actually within a very favorable environment, our business over the last two years in 2005 and
2006, our organic growth rate has exceeded by 5 points the GDP growth rate.

Today owing to our overall good business and geographic repositioning, but also owing to the APC acquisition, we are confident that we can gain over the time one point of annual growth, of annual organic growth. And therefore, our revised target is an organic growth in excess of 3 points over the GDP worldwide growth rate, and which is then higher by 1 point than the original new2 target of 2 points.

With a very similar approach, we target an EBITA margin between 13 and 15% for the second phase of new2. From 1999 to 2004, as you can see, our EBITA margin fluctuated between 11.4 and 13.4%. And here again, with favorable economic environment for business, our EBITA margin has reached 14.7% in
2006. With APC being consolidated in pro forma accounts in 2006, such EBITA margin would have been only of 13.7%. And therefore, when taking into account the impact of APC in our business, in our consolidated accounts, we feel confident that we can grow our EBITA profitability between 13 and 15% for the coming two years. And therefore our new target is 0.5 point higher than the original new2 target for EBITA margin profitability.

This following chart presents the different parameters which we think will influence our EBITA margin in the coming two years. Such parameters account for about 1.5 points improvement for potential over EBITA margin from 13.7 to 15% over those coming two years.

First of all, we are expecting 2 to 3 points improvements coming from lean manufacturing, productivity improvements of our supply chain, rebalancing, pricing and so on.

Second, our investment in manufacturing plants, sales, R&D, R&D forces, sales forces to boost our development in new businesses, but also in new geographies, emerging countries, should reduce our EBITA margin by 0.75 1.25 points.

Three, in the same way our sales mix evolution because of our -- we are dedicated to go into services and solution, with a lower EBITA margin should reduce our EBITA margin by 0.5 to 1 points. And at last, the APC turnaround and implementation of synergies should bring an additional 0 point, positive 0.5 points contribution towards our EBITA margin.

This following chart presents the evolution of the ROCE measured by the ratio of our EBITA after tax divided by capital employed. The capital employed being calculated at book value and this is very important. You know that at constant perimeter from 2004 to 2006 this ROCE progressed from 9.7 to
13.2% owing to our operational improvements, while our acquisition, add the 1.4% dilution effect on this
ROCE.

At the end of 2006, our ROCE is therefore 18.8 -- 11.8%, and the consolidation of APC in 2006 in pro forma accounts even further dilutes this ROCE to 9.3%. Our target therefore for the two coming years is a two points progression of our ROCE to come back to 11.3%, 11.5% objective in 2008.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: And that comes as a conclusion of the president's presentation, but it's a yearly opportunity to give you a more operational feeling about we are doing.

Just as an outlook and as a summary of all this, we are in a business which has a strong growth potential and development potential. We have a business model which is quite unique in our company with -- in our industry, sorry. Operating margin which are high, and we want to keep and we have space to keep on improving them, and a financial structure which enables us to keep on moving organically and externally.

So that comes at the conclusion of the formal presentation and now we thank you for your attention and are happy to take any of your questions. Unfortunately. Where do we start? Nick, start with you? Nick.


Page 81 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NICK PATON, ANALYST, JP MORGAN: Morning everybody. It's Nick Paton here, JP Morgan. First
question on the money that need to spend on APC to actually get the margin up. Has the profile changed of
the cash, because there was charge taken in the fourth quarter I see here for restructuring at APC?
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Is there a charge for restructuring? Can you repeat?

NICK PATON: In the APC numbers, the margin. There was actually some restructuring spend in there as well I think. The margin was excluding that restructuring spend. Could you just give us an update on what that's going to be for the next couple of years?

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes it is. The restructuring costs which have been passed are not taken into account in this reported gross margin.

NICK PATON: Yes, and what will the restructuring charges be for that business for the next couple of years? Has the profile changed from the original acquisition data?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: No there were two sorts of restructuring charges. First of all those they had already announced at the time of our acquisition, and those that we have announced when we made the acquisition. There is no change globally for the combination of the two, and I would say they have already passed -- they have already realized a significant proportion of what they were aiming to realize in 2006.

NICK PATON: And just the second question on the currency impact, could you give us an update on what your guidance is and the currency impact in margins now that the structure of the Group has changed a little bit?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Well you speak now in terms of EBIT -- impact on the EBIT? So it's -- we estimate a 10% swing between the euro to the dollar would cost us in 2006 0.3, 30 basis points, to be compared with 40 basis points the year before, and to be compared with 60 basis points the year before. So we are keeping on our rebalancing. We'll come to you.

MARTIN WILKIE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. Three questions. Firstly on the 800 million of acquisitions in progress, can you give us a little bit more detail of that? I know there was some deals that haven't yet had the proceeds paid but are there other deals that are yet to be announced and could you let us know what those are?

And also on the [inaudible], is it in terms of -- are these deals that you have decided to make or is this a pot effectively that you're keeping in case more acquisitions are coming?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: No. We are speaking about things that were in process and we can't speak about them.

MARTIN WILKIE: Okay, and then you used to have a gearing target of 30 to 40% net debt to equity. Is that target still a valid target, or is that something that you're now moving away from in terms of keeping it out of the balance sheet leverage?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: No, I've explained we are actually looking at the operating cash flow to net debt as a real criteria, and to be even -- to go even more into detail, we are looking at the adjusted operating cash flow to adjusted net debt which is the ratio -- the target that rating agencies are looking at.
MARTIN WILKIE: Okay, and then --.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: So we once again want to position ourselves as a BBB plus company, and this is the way we are looking at our financial structure and not really at debt to equity ratio.

MARTIN WILKIE: Thank you on that. And then another couple of questions. First of all you've given a split of the sales in margin between electrical distribution, automation and critical power. Is that something we can expect going forward each set of results so that we can track particularly how the APC transaction is developing?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Yes, this is something we're committed to during the acquisition and we're going to be back to you with those results of critical power. And we've always given split results according the line of automation and power. Now I tell you this is not the real life of Schneider Electric. The real life of Schneider Electric is done in terms of solutions at the level. Unlike some of our competitors we are not vertically organized by worldwide divisions, and we have countries which are [assembling] most of the solutions. I am saying most, because sometime we have hybrid systems, but most of the solution goes to the customer.



Page 82 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So the P&L decision is taken by the countries close to the customer, mixing together automation products together with power products. So the real life of Schneider Electric is more according to the geographical divisions, which we give a report about, rather than by vertical divisions.

Just it's a thing that you have -- we are not like some other companies as well, really vertically organized across the world, and that makes a big difference.

MARTIN WILKIE: And just one final question. You've talked a lot about obviously energy efficiency, both in industrial and buildings context. There's a big change going through in the lighting market moving away from incandescent and fluorescent towards LED potentially over the next few years. Do you see lighting as a potential opportunity for Schneider in linking that with your building automation over the next several years?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: The interaction between lighting and what we do are more intense, that's for sure. Now we've done a move in lighting in the US because we thought it was more original in the US and it was a way for us to go into the field of the contractors, the architects, the more seminal phase of the electrical distribution. Now we have partnerships with people of the lighting and clearly Philips more than Osram for obvious reasons that you will understand, and this is -- but it's more in the field of partnerships and I think we can live with it.

But we are in interacting, like TEC as a corporation with some of the lighting leaders and especially Philips, on making sure that we propose values from putting our systems together. And I think commercially it makes a lot of sense. At the same time it's all electricity; at the same time in some geographies it makes sense to have them a bit integrated, and we do a bit of lighting also in Asia. But globally I would say we're happy with what we are doing.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: I've got a few questions if I could. When I look at your bridge for the next two years EBIT margin, the thing I was surprised about is the degree of dilution. You talk about from the geographic and business mix, clearly the emerging markets which are below margin and some of your service and other lower margin areas have been growing fast already in '06, and perhaps even in '05, and have added that dilution. But you talk about nearly 2% of your EBIT margin target for the next couple of years from now. Is there a particular change compared to what we've already seen as to why that dilution increases? That was my first question.

And then on APC I wondered if you could give us a feel for, particularly the '07 margin progression. Firstly on the purchase accounting, when you talk about the 70 million, that's just other intangibles, but will there also be any inventory step up which has a particular one year impact? And what's the economic life of those intangibles? Is it a two, three effect or is it a longer effect?

And the underlying business. Nick's question relating to the restructuring cost. You talked about maybe 50 million of integration costs in your first year. Has any of that come forward in the restructuring charge taken in the '06 year in the fourth quarter by APC pre you?

And then just some other questions on guidance. Sorry about this. You've often given a feel for guidance for '07. For the currency, given current rates of the EBIT level, can you give us a feel for what you might expect or should we look at your 10% move impact there?

Raw materials versus price, particularly in the second half you had a headwind. Do you have a feel for the current metal prices, what the raw material headwind this year and what you hope whether you can offset it in terms of prices here?

And finally CapEx. I saw that as a percentage of sales it's dropped from 4 to 3.5. Is there a particular impact -- is there a particular reason for that and how should we look at that this year? Sorry for the long list.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Speaking about the new businesses on the emerging countries, we are speaking about the two year scale. We have said very clearly, and I want to reiterate it, that we would reinvest a part of this faster than expected progress on the EBITA side into the new businesses on the emerging countries. So we have a very good momentum in those places and I think we have to keep on building that presence and that space so we're going to keep on investing.

One thing which is costing us today certainly, is the service development. For one reason is that in services, I'm not speaking about facility management, I'm speaking about, we say, technical added value services, we are speaking about making diagnosis of automation, or diagnosis of electrical distribution. Between the time you recruit somebody in services and the time you produce a result you have one year. And during that year is not producing much. And this is an investment that we are doing. Okay, it's year after year. But it's putting a bit of pressure on our P&L. So this is the thing that we're trying to encapsulate

Page 83 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
here. And, again, it's a guess about the future. And so far, we've been better in delivering than guessing about the future, if I'm practical in my answer.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: If I may answer the questions related to APC. First of all, we have been using those three months to close the deal, then to put together the team to give -- to put together a new organization structure. And as Jean-Pascal said it, I think we did very quickly over the last weeks. We have no -- we have also used those weeks to review our expected synergies. We have no change in the global amount and in the cost of implementation, but we have no further details to give you today on the purchase accounting. It's very technical. We have to look at it in detail. I gave you, I would say, the broad lines. But when it comes to allocating a pot to other items, it's too early to elaborate about it.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, that 70, does it taper down fast? Does it go 70, 50, 20, zero? PIERRE BOUCHUT: No, no, no. This is an average for -- it would be depreciated over a certain period of
time and the outcome of it is EUR70 million charge for, let's say, medium to long-term.
Regarding the integration costs, no change as well for the time being. We'll keep you posted in details, I
think in June, in July, but, for the time being, as we said it, no change.

The second, regarding the -- what we have -- what we -- the, if I understand it correctly, your question was the euro versus dollar FX rate that we had in mind.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. It was neutral for the year but a negative in the second half. Given your hedging, some companies have seen a worst fourth quarter and I wondered whether your first half is going to be particularly bad for the FX impact of the EBIT bridge.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Well, altogether for the year it was about neutral and for the time being there is no [inaudible] effect fluctuation. As we indicated to you, any swing from 10% in one direction, in any direction, has an impact of 0.3% on our EBIT profitability. We have plug euro to dollar at 1.32. So I said that we have been, I would say, fairly conservative. This is it.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Raw material hedging.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Raw material. Well, 80% of our raw material exposure is coming from copper, as you know. 75% precisely. The copper prices are at $6,000 dollars per ton for the time being, as an average, expected average for 2000 -- this is our forecast for 2007, which is much lower than the all time high which has been reached in July, also last year, of $80 per ton. And therefore, we should, everything being equal, benefit from, I would say, a positive impact in the second half of 2007. Because if you remember, raw material prices started to increase sharply as of January 1 last year. So we have also delay impacts. So for the time being, assuming raw material prices stay unchanged, we should be affected again in the first half of the year, and it should be about neutral in the second half.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: I'd like to give us -- to take some caveat on that one. The situation on raw materials is changing at the moment. So we've seen the copper having high evolutions, but copper is not the only thing we are consumer in Schneider Electric. So we've got other materials. And we know that on those other materials there will be a price increase, cost increase. So today we've focused our -- we've aligned our teams at the beginning of the year on raw material increase, which is important, which is not as much as last year, but certainly important. And I've taken a quite pessimistic view to it which means I'm asking also some pricing of the organizations.

Now according how it goes, if you come back to what we said last year, we are starting with an appreciation of the raw materials that was rather optimistic on the reality that in two months it became very pessimistic because of the copper. So we shall review our position in function of that, but today we started the year with indications to [inaudible] which were very negative on that one. On saying, you have to price up to compensate for that. And find the productivity.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. You didn't mention the Ultra Terminal sales. I'm sorry. Just on that prior chart. You gave the breakdown of your automation by sales and some of the smaller pieces, but what sales in '06 was Ultra Terminal?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: '06 it's around -- I said it during the presentation, it's around 1.4, 1.5 billion according to where you integrate the latest companies. And it has grown last year of 8%, which was rather good because there was a strong impact there of the Pacific sales. New Zealand and Australia. And you know that the residential market in Australia and New Zealand, where we are extremely strong with good market shares together with Clipsal and PDL, have been impacted quite a lot. So it's a good business for us. We keep on developing in the line of electrical distribution.

Page 84 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Well, where do we go from there? Give the mike to somebody at the back and then we are going to be back at the front. Make your choice. On the right side. That's exactly the contrary of what we wanted but anyway it's okay.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: You gave the breakdown in November, for large and small systems on APC. Can you tell us what the outcome was and have you seen any improvements there in large systems where obviously APC itself had started a big restructuring program?
And just a very simple question. The timing on the rights issue. More details there. JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: The timing, I will let it to Pierre.
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Well, I said we had the closing on February 14, which is not so long ago. Until that time, we had no, whatsoever, capacity to get into the managerial decisions day to day. So there is a bit of discussion that we had that might have influenced some of the turnaround that you saw in the figures of the last quarter because, well, discussing some of the things we have passed through, but basically we are going to start now really to take the control, together with the new team, of the large systems and the services.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Was the outcome as you expected at the beginning of November? JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: We are pretty much sure. What I would like to say also is that MGE, as our
company, had a terrific end of the year and very good start of the year also, which is well showing the
potential of this business. So we are pretty confident. Now there will be a lot of work. If you look at the year
ahead, most of us will be spending a lot of time on that one on all fronts. We've said, valuation creation is
capitalizing on small systems, point one.  Fixing the supply chain on small systems, point two.  Fixing the
large systems on the services, point three. And point four, getting the synergies out. That's very simple with
the people aligned. When it's simple, as we've clearly said, then there is a chance that we can execute it.
And I think the team has exactly those four points in front of them.
And the second one would be a very simple answer I think.
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes. It's very simple. We'll keep you informed in due time.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: I could have done that one on finance. It was a good try, James. So now we are at the back on the other side.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can I just ask about the pro forma margin guidance of 1 to 1.5% over the 13.7? Just in terms of what you've included in there, am I correct to think that you have included the originally announced synergies, which was about $80 million, but that you are deducting out of there both the intangible asset amortization, which is about 80 million, and also the restructuring?

PIERRE BOUCHUT: No, no. You are wrong. What we are looking at is the EBITA margin. And, therefore, it is after tax but before deduction of intangible depreciation.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And it does include the restructuring? PIERRE BOUCHUT: But it does the restructuring costs absolutely.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Two other questions. First of all just in the net interest line, there was a 50 million capital gain during the year. Was there anything significant there; a sale of marketable securities?
And the second question was on the large systems business of APC, you are still looking for losses in
2009, and I wondered if this was to do with the length of the contracts and the escalation clauses relating to
copper, or whether you just felt that the trading environment would not have improved sufficiently by 2009.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: On the first part of your question yes we made an extra gain on sales of real estate in the course of 2006.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And the total amount was 50 million, correct? PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes that's about it, yes.
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: But the net level of the EUR116 million I was referring to during my presentation, which is I would say the exceptional items, what we used to call, exceptional items, has been unchanged from one year to another, i.e. we did provision some other stuff in front of it.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Right now on the APC large systems; this is a question that was really a lot debated since November 1; the question you're asking. In our presentation of the acquisition we did something
which is probably a bit too accurate or a bit too -- we separated something that we called the best practices and then the synergies. So the best practices was applying to the new company the best practices of Schneider and MGE, point one of value creation.

Point two was the synergies. Actually if you combine the two -- if you combine the two, we are not making losses in 2009. We are balancing in 2009 roughly. Or I think we're going to have, I hope -- I think with a lot of common sense, we can do better. I don't think the long contracts that you mentioned will impact not that long. I mean we're going to carry some of those contracts over the next year to come, and that's clear. And
we're going [run all] them because we have to deal with the customers and take the commitments that were taken, but then going forward on, then we have much more leeway on capacities to redress the situation.

But there is a lot to do. I think the products are great at APC, the power including the integrated system is great, really very good, but the business models, we had extensive occasions to explain it, was not mastered on the part of the business. Very good on the small systems; very not control on the large systems. On the [inaudible] but we have the MGE team who knows how to deal with it.
Yes, where do we go? You first?

LISA RANDALL, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Lisa Randall from Lehman Brothers. Just a couple of questions. Just on the value creation that you've given analysis for APC. Can you confirm that doesn't include any assumptions for price increases on the large systems side please?

Just secondly also on APC. There have been some spurious rumors around perhaps difficulties on the integration. Can you just clarify for us or comment whether there's anything particular relating to the integration of APC and MGE that would create any particular issues?

And then just, thirdly just to check on the guidance that you've given for organic growth for 2006 were greater than 6% for '07 -- sorry, were greater than 6%, that that actually excludes APC's growth for '07. Is that also classified and an acquisitive growth? Thank you.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Thank you. You go or not? So I think we had a problem of understanding of the question because the acoustic is not very good. So I understand that the value creation for APC -- does it include price -- possible price increases? And the answer is yes. Okay?

The difficulties with the integration. I think so far there has been -- I tell you the truth, it has been a lot of heated discussion, debates, rethinks; all of this in a context which is highly qualified, because until you are not the owner of a company and that company is list on the NASDAQ with the regulations, so we are very cautious with everything. But so far I think it's very good because where we come out Thursday with one company, one organization, no discussion about the commercial policy, common approach to the customer and within one month I think we're going to be really operational.

Now we've got tons of things to do. Going from very simple things, like today we have two [invoicing machines] to the customers. Now we want the customers to benefit from the two offers day one. They
might have two invoices during a certain number of months. We have to move the IT; we have to move the legal structures to make it happen.

Is it insurmountable? We've been through [managerial and telemechanic] for more than a few months. We've been through that for many years, so we've taken a much quicker approach to the integration. So far I think we are ahead of the curve in what I see.

The spirit has been really good because when you look at it, APC, it's a move for APC on -- but it's a bit big move for MGE because MGE, we're going to divest a part of the activity. It's never simple for a company to look at that and we've involved the employees on the unions from the beginning through that process. We've done it I think, in a very fair way and a very clear way, and you've not heard much of it inside the press because there would have been major social movements. I mean people have integrated to what we were planning to do.

The boss of MGE [inaudible] is staying with me and he will help me off on new businesses and he will also be a very close on the divestment of MGE, and also very close on the watching how the integration is going forward. So we've got the people on board also on top of the business.

For me, the biggest delicate part of the acquisition will remain the people, because we bought the company because of the people and their competencies. It's not very -- maybe it's very idealistic, but this is how I see a company, and so far the integration of the people -- I've seen people on board, and it has taken us time to explain and to get them on board, and people are pretty excited to be working together.

Page 86 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now we're going to be more precise again. There are a few days behind us and we're going to become much more precise in the next coming months. We're going to have a much clearer picture of the figures because we're going to be deep into the books. We're going to be deeper into the synergies of the task
force and much more precise, accurate and a little focused than we are today. So I think we're going to give you a much better picture in July, but today really we have a good business. Already it's good. When the business is growing fast it creates a lot of space for a lot of things behind that.

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Just to avoid misunderstanding on your first question and your third question. Your first question, did we include in the synergy calculation any price impact? The answer is no, and you know it, and we -- there may be some price increase potential. We'll be looking at that in the coming weeks and months, but in the calculation of the, or estimation of synergies, there is no -- we didn't plug any price increase.
And your second question is about the impact of APC organic growth?

LISA RANDALL: It was just to check your guidance for 2007, which is obviously for organic growth greater than 6%. And you made the comment earlier, you were clarifying that APC will be classified obviously as a
--.
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Absolutely, so it's clear. It will not contribute to the organic growth rate. That's why I
made -- I tried to make it clear during the presentation.

MARK TROMAN, ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: It's Mark Troman from Merrill Lynch. Just three quick questions. Firstly on productivity. You're guiding or did 2, I think 300 basis points, you're guiding 2 to 300 over the next couple of years. How long can that process continue when you look at your organization? Is there still a lot to go for? Would you expect that sort of rate of improvement over the next four, five years or so?

Secondly, can you comment on your ability to maintain pricing in the face of lower copper costs for example in the market place, or is that more of a pass through mechanism?

And thirdly, on the exciting subject of tax, I wonder if you could provide some guidance for 2007 as to the tax rate. Thank you.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: So productivity, I think there is still a lot to do. Obviously when you are speaking about gross productivity, because raw material is something which is much less predictable than
it was once upon a time, but in terms of gross productivity, when you take rebalance it's something which is really starting to yield more inside our portfolio of productivity capability.

There has been more tension this year just on purchasing for good reasons. It's that it was a huge year in terms of demand, so everybody was facing the necessity to produce and deliver. And we've given the absolute priority on delivering our customers, so sometimes we've been a bit less aggressive in negotiating with some of the other suppliers.

But still we have a supplier base which is incredibly diversified, varied and numerous, and there is still a lot of work, lots of work, to do on the globalization of this supplier base. We still have logistic centers that need to be streamlined. We still have manufacturing centers that need to be streamlined. And we're going to
keep on delivering the same kind of actions as we have started. This is why I don't want to change new2 because I think there is so much to be done there.

So that's about productivity. Still space for improvement, and I think that rebalancing will keep on yielding more results as we go forward.

In terms of pricing, we are not in a [geometry of cable], like passing through. When you look at what we've done last year, we've increased our prices by 140 million, which is one point. A lot has been delivered on the second half. To be frank, and I said it already, we didn't see -- we started last year much more optimistic about raw material. We didn't see the rapid increase happening, so we were too slow to pass on
prices at the beginning of the year. I think the catch up in the second part of the year showed that we have, and we should deliver pricing power. We are starting the year on a much more pessimistic view, [voluntarily], and we want to be on the pricing side. But there is not a translation or an indexation like in other parts of the electrical industry. It doesn't work like that.

On taxes, we are working to cut down our ETR, on one hand. On the other hand, APC effective tax rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 22%, so by consolidating APC, it should help us to reduce our ETR over time, so we are confident that we can reduce it, and we are working on that.
Yes?


Page 87 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
TIM ADAMS, ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Tim Adams from Citigroup. Can I just ask two questions? A follow up on pricing. Have you got good momentum on pricing going into 2007, given that you had a poor momentum in the first half of '06? It picked up. Is that momentum continuing into the early part of '07?

And secondly, when will you be in a position to tell us what the commercial plan is on large systems, UPS product groups? Because at the moment you've got the APC product groups, you've got the MGE product groups. At what point in time will you be able to give us the planning that you're going to be taking forward to the customers?

PIERRE BOUCHUT: On pricing, I said it before, I'm pushing, we are keeping on pushing on pricing, because again, it's not all about copper. There are other raw materials which are impacting us, although all of this is quite volatile at the moment, so I want to be on the safe side, not like last year. Now, I'd rather be speaking after rather than before again, but we are working on it. Okay? So there is momentum as we
enter into the year.

The second thing is, about large systems, about APC and MGE, how do we combine the forces? As you know, as we explained during the acquisition, [tangentially] is the APC [per offer] line up in large terms, is more top end with a modular format, scalability, on integrated cooling. So it tends to be more costly. It is more costly. And one of the problems of the large systems of APC, by the way, was to position itself on the market in front of people like MGE, with a costly offer at the price of the value offer, which is what you need at the exact pricing, but for the full Monty of the insulation. That's basically the thing.

As of today, we're going to be proposing through the [same] teams the two offers, all of them saying, as of today. It's as of today. I mean in the next month we're going to put together the teams and people who are speaking mostly to the CIOs of the world, people of APC. We'll have the capacity to propose a top end offer on the MGE value offer. And at the same time, the people are speaking more to the facility management in the IT world, the electrical-technical world, will have the capacity to complement the value offer, which is more fitting their needs, by a top end offer which is scalable on integrating the cooling. So this is the way
we put it, as of today, which creates points of differentiation, which creates capacity to propose full solutions, mixing the two advantages of the two approaches.

And then, on the back of this, people are going to be working on rationalizing the platforms, but that's something which is, I would say, rather easy to do. When I say easy, understanding. There is work to do in that kind of field, because the renewal cycle of those products is much shorter than what you have to face
in electro-mechanical. We are speaking about cycles of five years, so you can really [have all] the platforms in a shorter or faster way than what you do in other parts of our business.
Another question, we'll take two more questions, and then you are free again.

GUY DEBRET, ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE: [Guy Debret] from Societe Generale. I've got a few questions related to your margin target. The new2 targeted margin has a time horizon which is unfortunately 2008, but I think you do expect the margins at APC to continue to progress until 2011. So does that mean that you're confident as of today that you will beat the 13% to15% margin range beyond
2008?

Also, related to the margin drivers, I think there's a slide which is number 52, where you indicate that you expect the margin to improve by one point, or 1.5 points, by 2008, but it seems that you do not take into account the volume growth, or am I wrong in that calculation?
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: No, we are taking into account volume growth. GUY DEBRET: Okay. It's a net effect, or where is that, exactly?
PIERRE BOUCHUT: It's in the first half -- the [223] points, it's included there. GUY DEBRET: Okay, so it's a net effect?
PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes, it's taking into account the 6% organic growth rate. It's assuming that. GUY DEBRET: And related to the first questions?
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: And related to the first question, there's a Chinese proverb that says that the
10,000 [leagues] walk is starting with the first step. We're going to do the first step and we're going to be
back. But again, take the industry, the growth that we have in front of us, and the possible improvements of
margins, yes, there is possibly more to do.

Now, do we want to be speak beyond two years? Who is there wise enough in this room to predict two years from now? It's difficult, but we've spoken to today about the qualitative aspects of our business, the

Page 88 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
way we are putting more growth boosters, and the way we are putting more efficiency boosters, so there is space for progress. And get outside of here with the right message, we are very optimistic about 2007. We see very positively.

GUY DEBRET: Okay, so if we stay in 2007, 2008, how much restructuring do you plan to spend over these two years? And how many logistics centers, manufacturing sites, do you plan to streamline in the coming two years?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Obviously, I can't tell you, because that would be a [inaudible] in French in many cases, but we'll want to keep on doing roughly what we've done in terms of streamlining and simplification. We've said at the beginning of new2 that we wanted a constant perimeter. The issue is that Schneider has also grown quite a lot in the mean time, but we wanted to move close to between 70 to 80 logistics centers. Now there is an effect of perimeter, but this is still a target that we have in mind, and we're going to keep on rationalizing around what we do, regional hubs and more local hubs, which are more satellites around the main hubs.
What was the first question, sorry, I missed it. What was it?

GUY DEBRET: I think it is okay. If I may I've got a last one on the prices. You've managed to raise prices by 1.2% in '06. How does that compare to the historical average for Schneider over the last --?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: That was pretty good actually. It was above, in terms of percentage of turnover, that was above what we did the year before, which was 1%, and we are coming before [of years] where the prices were flat to deflationary sometimes. But rather flat I would say. So it has been the new dynamics in pricing that has taken place in the past two years.

GUY DEBRET: And do you believe it is only due to the volume effect, or due to something a bit more structural, in terms of --?

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: It's mix of many, many things and the price is something that you fight every day, on the market, in front of the customer, and I've been in that position, and it's always a lot of work.

It was a mix of raw materials that was creating the right psychological context. It was a mix also of the way we are positioned in segments, so strong demand obviously.
A last question here?

TOM MELVILLE, ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: Thank you, yes, Tom Melville from Bear Stearns. APC saw a pretty dramatic improvement in its financial performance throughout 2006. Can I just check? The pro forma numbers you've given for '06, including APC, is that taking '06 as a whole, rather than the Q4 run rate?
JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Yes, absolutely.
TOM MELVILLE: Okay. So it should be much better going forward?

PIERRE BOUCHUT: Yes, absolutely, when it comes to two things. First of all, the financial structure [at your end]. And secondly, the EBITA margin; the 13.7 EBITA margin.
TOM MELVILLE: Thank you.

JEAN-PASCAL TRICOIRE: Okay, thank you very much for your attention, and I'm sure that we shall meet again soon. Thank you for your time.

HD          EU Commission Nears Decision  On Buttons Cartel - Sources

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission is nearing a decision whether to  fine companies for running an illegal cartel in the buttons and zippers business, two people familiar with the matter said.

Two of the companies under investigation are the U.K.'s Coats PLC, owned by Guinness Peat Group PLC (GPG.LN), and Germany's William Prym GmbH & Co. The people said other companies also were under investigation, though they didn't name them.

TD
The timing of the commission decision remains unclear. It could come as early as this summer or as late as the end of the year, the people cautioned. The commission has no deadline to decide on  cartel cases. [ 21-05-07 1610GMT ]

The commission fined Coats and Prym EUR30 million each in October, 2004, for  fixing  prices of needles. A third U.K. company involved in the  needle cartel, Entaco Group Ltd., was given immunity from fines for disclosing the price-fixing  to regulators.

Before handing out the fine against Coats and Prym, the commission separated the zippers and buttons  cartel from the needles case, according to one person familiar with the matter. When the  fine was announced, the commission said in a statement that it also suspected the two companies of colluding to keep Entaco from competing in the zippers and buttons businesses.
A William Prym spokesman said it is waiting for the regulators' decision in the button and zippers case. A spokesman for Coats declined to comment.
In 2004, Coats said in its annual report that the commissions investigation into its competitive practices had been split into three sub-cases covering hand-sewing  needles, industrial thread and fasteners. Although the other cases were still pending, it added "full provision has been made for any anticipated eventual payment."
An Entaco official declined to comment.
Coats and William Prym have appealed the commission's 2004  cartel fine. A European Union court in
Luxembourg is expected to rule on the matter by September, said a person familiar with the case.

It was "not unlikely that the zippers and buttons case would be decided after the court had passed judgment on the  needles appeal," the person added.

E.U. regulators can  fine companies up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover, though they almost never reach that level. Companies that are repeat offenders automatically have their  fines increased
50%.
"I can confirm that the commission has an ongoing antitrust investigation into buttons and zippers," said
E.U. Competition spokesman Jonathan Todd. He declined to offer any additional information.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - An EU court on Wednesday trimmed  cartel fines for two groups of companies charged €30 million (US$41.5 million) each for sewing up the market for  needles from 1994 to
1999.

Refusing to fight regulators on the charges was reason enough to cut a  fine for William Prym GmbH & Co. KG and Prym Consumer GmbH & Co. KG by 10 percent down to €27 million (US$37 million), the European Court of First Instance said.

TD
The European Commission should have taken into account Prym's declaration that it did not dispute the charges, it said.

"That declaration is, in itself, sufficient for a reduction to be granted," a court press release said. "Accordingly, the court considers it appropriate to reduce the  fine."

The EU's second-highest court also snipped the  fine for Britain's Coats Holdings Ltd. and J & P Coats Ltd. to €20 million (US$28 million) because EU regulators had not proved that Coats was involved in illegal price-fixing  after March 1997.

Coats, owned by Guinness Peat Group Plc, had also played a lesser role in the  cartel, it said, playing more the role of a mediator.
It did not meet with the main players Entaco and Prym after 1993, nor did it benefit from price  fixing
because Prym never stopped competing over the  needles they both sold.
Entaco received immunity from the 2004  fines because it blew the whistle on the  cartel.

LUXEMBOURG (Dow Jones)--A European court Wednesday reduced antitrust  fines imposed by the European Commission on two suppliers of  needles and haberdashery products, privately owned U.K. thread maker Coats Holdings Ltd. and William Prym GmbH&Co. KG of Germany.
The Court of First Instance reduced Coats'  fine to EUR20 million from EUR30 million and William
Prym's fine to EUR27 million from EUR30 million. [ 12-09-07 0753GMT ]

TD
The commission found in 2004 that three companies Prym, Coats and U.K. based Entaco Group Ltd. had operated a cartel in the needle market and shared geographic markets in other haberdashery products between 1994 and 1999.
Prym and Coats appealed the decision.

The court, Europe's second highest, dismissed Prym's call for the decision to be overturned but it said the commission was wrong to refuse to reduce the  fine after Prym didn't dispute the facts set out against it. A reduction for this is included in E.U. rules.

The court also partially upheld the commission's decision against Coats, but it found the commission was wrong to include wrongdoing by Coats after March 1997 and reduced the  fine accordingly.

The European Court of Justice has reduced  fines imposed by the European Commission against Coats
Holdings Ltd and William Prym GmbH & Co for their participation in a cartel in the needles market.

The two companies were each  fined EUR30m (US$41.6m) in October 2004, after the Commission found that they had joined with Entaco Group in a series of anti-competitive agreements where they shared product and geographic markets between September 1994 and December 1999.

TD
As well as needles, other ancillary products such as pins, buttons, fasteners and zips were covered by the market sharing  agreements. Specifically, the three companies shared the  needle market and kept Entaco from competing in other haberdashery markets such as pins or fasteners.
The court said in a statement today (12 September) that it has reduced Prym's  fine to EUR27m and
Coats’ to EUR20m.
Entaco was not  fined, because it cooperated with the Commission.

HD     CARTELS : COURT REDUCES FINES FOR NEEDLE CARTEL WC    460 words
PD     13 September 2007
SN     Europolitics SC     EURREP LA     English

LP
The EU's Court of First Instance (CFI) has slightly reduced the  fines imposed by the European                Commission in 2004 on two companies for unfair trade practices in the  needles market. For one, it judges that it was necessary to take into account its cooperation during the investigation. For the other, it found an assessment error (Cases T-30/05 and T-36/05).

On 26 October 2004, the Commission stated that three groups of companies, Prym, Coats and Entaco, participated in a series of anti-competitive agreements by which they shared product and geographic markets in the  needles sector between September 1994 and December 1999. Prym and Coats were each fined €30 million. Entaco was not  fined, because it cooperated with the Commission. Prym and
Coats brought actions before the CFI for annulment of the decision and for annulment or reduction of their respective fines.

TD
Concerning Prym, the CFI considers that the Commission was wrong to refuse to reduce the  fine for
non-contestation of the facts, as provided for in the 1996 leniency notice. Prym always expressly declared
that it did not dispute the facts set out in the statement of objections and this declaration is, in itself,
sufficient for a reduction to be granted in accordance with the leniency notice. The  fine is therefore
reduced by 10%, from €30 million to €27 million.

For Coats, the Court finds that the decision is vitiated by an error of assessment in so far as the Commission seeks to establish Coats' liability in respect of the period after 13 March 1997. The Commission has not proved that the agreements signed in 1997 were a continuation of a tripartite  cartel to which Coats was a party. Moreover, Coats did not participate in any trilateral meeting, and thus in any
meeting to implement the Entaco-Prym  cartel, after April 1997. Accordingly, the Court annuls the decision in so far as the decision finds that Coats participated in the  cartel after 13 March 1997. The Court considers that in order to take account of the proven duration of the infringement, which is equivalent to approximately half of the period initially determined by the Commission, the rate of increase on account of the duration of the infringement should be reduced from 50% to 25%, that is, from €10 million to €5
million.

Finally, the Court holds that Coats' role was essentially limited to facilitating the entry into force of the cartel's framework agreement. Since Coats' role is therefore more akin to that of a mediator than that of a full member of the  cartel, the Court considers it appropriate to reduce the amount of the  fine by 20% to take account of those attenuating circumstances.

HD     EU fines seven firms for sewing up market for zips and fasteners

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - EU regulators on Wednesday  fined seven sewing companies €328.6 million
(US$455.7 million) for stitching up the market for zips and fasteners.
The European Commission handed down the largest individual  fine to Japan's YKK Group, charging it
€150 million (US$208 million) while Coats Group of Britain must pay €122 million (US$169.18 million).

TD
It said they and others ran four illegal cartels -- one lasting 21 years -- to coordinate price increases, fix minimum prices, allocate customers, share markets and swap "commercially important and confidential information" for zips, snaps and rivets and attaching machines used widely to make clothes.
"It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to
maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day
by a lot of customers," said EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal but decided to continue anyway," she said.

The overall fine includes a €40 million (US$55.47 million) penalty on Prym Group which the EU executive waived because it was the first to blow the whistle.
The fines for YKK and Coats were reduced because the companies had cooperated with the EU  cartel
investigation.

Smaller fines were levied on others. A. Raymond SARL must pay €8 million (US$11.09 million) while Scovill Group will have to cough up €6 million (US$8.32 million) and Berning & Soehne GmbH & Co. KG was fined €1.1 million (US$1.53 million).
Regulators also fined a German trade association -- Fachverband Verbindungs-und Befestigungstechnik
-- a nominal €1,000 (US$1,386.70).

The EU said it started look into the  cartel on its own initiative after "certain information had been brought to its attention." It led surprise raids on the companies in November 2001, which saw Prym, Coats and YKK come forward with information to seek immunity or a reduction of  fines.

It earlier found Prym and Coats guilty -- along with others -- and  fined them in 2005 for fixing  the price of industrial thread and, in 2004, for a  cartel on the haberdashery market, including needles.
Regulators said the EU zip market is worth some €400 million ($555 million) every year.

The European Commission on Wednesday revealed it had uncovered and severely punished a  cartel
of zip and fastener manufacturers.

The Brussels regulator imposed fines totalling 328.6m ($458.2m) on six companies and a German trade association - the eighth-largest cartel fine imposed by the Commission.

TD
Japan's YKK group received the highest  fine, 150.3m, followed by Coats from the UK with 122.4m and
Germany's Prym with 40.6m.

It is the second time that Brussels has unravelled a cartel in the haberdashery sector, following a 2004 ruling that found several of the same companies guilty of fixing  prices in the market for  needles and pins. Companies that have a previous conviction for cartel abuses are punished much harder than
first-time offenders.

The Commission described the zip  cartel as "very serious", both because it went on in some cases for more than 20 years and because it involved the companies' top management, including managing directors, sales directors and board members. The EU zips market is worth about 400m a year, with another 200m coming from sales of other fasteners such as snap buttons and rivets.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway."

It is understood that the comparatively high  fines imposed triggered debate inside the Commission, amid concerns that the penalties could put some of the smaller members out of business.

However, a spokesman for the Commission insisted that the  fines had been calculated to ensure all companies would be able to continue their operations.

He added that the  fines were "relatively high because of the large size of some of the companies involved, the fact that there were four different cartels and the duration of these cartels".
All the groups have the right to appeal the Commission ruling in front of the Luxembourg-based
European Court of First Instance.

The European Commission yesterday revealed it had uncovered and severely punished a  cartel of zip andfastener manufacturers.
The Brussels regulator imposed  fines totalling Euros 328.6m (Dollars 458.2m) on six companies and a
German trade association - the eighth-largest  cartel fine imposed by the Commission.

TD
Japan's YKK group received the highest  fine, Euros 150.3m, followed by Coats from the UK with Euros
122.4m and Germany's Prym with Euros 40.6m.

It is the second time that Brussels has unravelled a cartel in the haberdashery sector, following a 2004 ruling that found several of the same companies guilty of fixing  prices in the market for  needles and pins. Companies that have a previous conviction for cartel abuses are punished much harder than
first-time offenders.

The Commission described the zip  cartel as "very serious", both because it went on in some cases for more than 20 years and because it involved the companies' top management, including managing directors, sales directors and board members. The EU zips marketis worth about Euros 400m ayear, with another Euros 200m coming from sales of other fasteners such as snap buttons and rivets.

Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, said: "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time.

"The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway."

It is understood that the comparatively high  fines imposed triggered debate inside the Commission, amid concerns that the penalties could put some of the smaller members out ofbusiness.

However, a spokesman for the Commission insisted that the  fines had been calculated to ensure all companies would be able to continue their operations.

He added that the  fines were "relatively high because of the large size of some of the companies involved, the fact that there were four different cartels and the duration of these cartels".
All the groups have the right to appeal the Commission ruling in front of the Luxembourg-based
European Court of First Instance.

European Commission Fasteners Decision

In relation to the  European Commission's decision on fasteners announced yesterday, Coats notes that full details of the Commission's reasoning are not yet available. In the interim, Coats has the following comments on the decision:

- Coats notes the Commission's allegation that between April 1998 and November 1999 European zip manufacturers exchanged price information and in respect of which the Commission has  fined Coats EUR 12.2 million. Coats has at all times fully co-operated with the Commission's investigation into the fasteners market and will carefully study the Commission's conclusions once details are made available before determining whether to appeal against this aspect of the Commission's decision.

- Coats totally rejects the Commission's allegation of a  market sharing  agreement with Prym in the European haberdashery market and in respect of which Coats has been  fined EUR 110.3 million. During the investigation Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event a  fine was time-barred. Contrary to its rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation. Coats will vigorously appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance once the full details of the Commission's decision have been made available. The Court of First Instance last week quashed a large part of the Commission's factual findings in the  Needles case for want of proof or clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission. We have confidence in the impartial, judicial analysis that the Court applies. As well as rejecting the substance of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the  fine is grossly disproportionate to any possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the European haberdashery market. Our customers have certainly not been injured.

- Subject to a review of the details, once received, of the Commission's decision, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of  fines is adequately covered by existing provisions. A guarantee for the original amount of the  fine will be posted for the duration of the appeal. Only once we have completed the appeal process will payment of any  fine, as finally determined by the Court, be made.
- It should be noted that the alleged contraventions occurred many years ago, between 1977 -1999, prior

to the acquisition of Coats by the GPG Group and do not involve any current members of the Coats Board or management team. Anti-competitive behaviour goes directly against company policy and represents a serious disciplinary offence. - It should be stressed that this legacy issue has no impact on Coats current operations which continue to make good progress. Coats acknowledges the full support of its shareholder GPG and its role in the successful development of the business over the last four years.

Edited Press Release

LONDON (Dow Jones)-- Guinness Peat Group's subsidiary, Coats Group, said Thursday it is yet to decide whether it will appeal the  European Commission's decision to  fine Coats EUR12.2 million in relation to price  fixing  in the fasteners market.

TD
However, the Company totally rejects the Commission's allegation of a  market sharing  agreement with Prym in the European haberdashery market and in respect of which Coats has been  fined EUR110.3 million.

The Commission alleged that between April 1998 and November 1999 European zip manufacturers exchanged price information.

Coats said it will carefully study the Commission's conclusions once details are made available before determining whether to appeal against this aspect of the Commission's decision.

Coats said that, during the Commission's investigation into a  market sharing  agreement with Prym in the European haberdashery market, the Company presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted the allegation and demonstrated that in any event a  fine was time-barred.

Contrary to its rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation.
Coats will vigorously appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance once the full details of the
Commission's decision have been made available.
The Court of First Instance last week quashed a large part of the Commission's factual findings in the
Needles case for want of proof or clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission.

The Company has confidence in the impartial, judicial analysis that the Court applies. As well as rejecting the substance of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the  fine is grossly disproportionate to any possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the European haberdashery market.

GUINNESS Peat Group has branded a (Euro)122 million (NZ$230 million)  European Commission fine against its subsidiary Coats outrageous.
"We will undoubtedly be appealing it," GPG's New Zealand director, Tony Gibbs, said yesterday.

TD
The fine was part of (Euro)328 million levied against seven companies for alleged  cartel activity conducted many years ago. It was the final part of a long-running, three-step inquiry the commission has been conducting into the  needle, industrial thread and fastener markets, the latter including production of zips, snap buttons and rivets.

The activity, from 1977 till the late 1990s, pre-dates GPG's involvement with British-based threadmaker Coats. GPG, chaired by investment veteran Sir Ron Brierley, did not take control of the company till 2003 and completed a full takeover the following year.

Coats is already paying (Euro)38.5 million in  fines relating to the  needle and industrial thread markets. Though another  fine was expected, the size of it wasn't.

"What's shaken everyone is the sheer size of this, because the (Coats) zips business is not enormous," Mr Gibbs said.

GPG has made allowances in its accounts for the  fines -- but has never disclosed how much it expected to have to pay. The company's annual report for the year to December 2006 shows general provisions of (PndStlg)124 million (NZ$341 million). But it is not clear how much has been targeted specifically for the  fines -- and Mr Gibbs would not say yesterday.

But he said GPG and its lawyers would be examining the details of the  fine and the adequacy of those provisions. A statement would be issued by Coats today.

GPG shares dropped as much as 11 cents yesterday before recovering somewhat. NZX placed a trading halt on the company just after midday pending an expected material announcement. The shares, which remained in trading halt for the rest of the day, closed down 5c at $1.93.

Some market participants were disappointed GPG had not immediately put out a statement outlining the likely impact of the  fine. "They should be able to come out now and say what the provision they made was," Tyndall Investment Management equities manager Rickey Ward said. "I don't know why they can't disclose that now."

The fine appeared "quite hefty to say the least". The issue would be a short-term negative for GPG, Mr Ward said, but he remained positive about its prospects. "It still looks cheap. It is trading at a massive discount to its asset backing."
For the six months to June GPG reported an after-tax profit of (PndStlg)94 million.

In fining the seven companies, European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes said it was unacceptable major companies had colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets.

A EUROPEAN subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group has been  fined for allegedly fixing  the price of industrial and clothing zippers.
On Wednesday, European authorities  fined haberdasher Coats, which GPG bought in 2003,
122.405 million ($A200 million) for its role in the  cartel.

TD
The European Commission said a series of cartels involved Coats, five other companies and a
German trade association.

In all, the groups were  fined a total of 328.644 million, the eighth largest  cartel fine ever imposed by the commission.

Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: ``It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers.

``The highest management of these companies was well aware that this conduct was illegal, but decided to continue anyway.''

The fine covers four cartels, two of which included Coats. One  cartel, involving Coats and German firm Prym, ran from 1977 until 1998.

``During this period, the two companies agreed to share the whole haberdashery market between themselves,'' the commission said.

``The commission has evidence that in all four cartels high-ranking management (such as managing directors, sales directors, and board members) participated in regular meetings and discussions,'' it said.
Continued Page 50
From Page 49
Prym's fine has been waived because it broke open the  cartel.
Under the Commission's leniency rules, whistleblowers are entitled to full immunity.
Coats'  fine was reduced because it had cooperated with the investigation, the Commission said. Japanese company YKK was  fined the most, at 150.25 million.
The firms can appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance.

Several of the same companies -- including Coats -- have previously been  fined for anti-competitive practices.

Coats was fined 30 million in 2004 for conspiring with Prym and British company Entaco to sew up the European needle market.
GPG put its stock into a trading halt yesterday, pending an announcement involving Coats. Before the trading halt GPG's scrip was off 5 at $1.65.
The announcement did not mention Coats'  fine, or its part in the  cartel. The company's executive director, Gary Weiss, could not be reached.

Sydney - Friday - September 21: (RWE Aust Business News) - Guinness Peat (ASX:GPG) subsidiary
Coats has noted the  European Commission's decision on fasteners announced yesterday.

It rejects the allegation that between April 1998 and November 1999 European zip manufacturers exchanged price information, for which Coates has been  fined E12.2 million.

Coats said it co-operated with the Commission's investigation into the fasteners market and will carefully study the Commission's conclusions once details are made available before determining whether to appeal.
"Coats totally rejects the Commission's allegation of a  market sharing  agreement with Prym in the
European haberdashery market and in respect of which Coats has been  fined E110.3 million," it said.

"During the investigation Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event a  fine was time-barred.

"Contrary to its rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation.
"Coats will vigorously appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance once the full details of the
Commission's decision have been made available.
"The Court of First Instance last week quashed a large part of the Commission's factual findings in the
Needles case for want of proof or clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission.
"We have confidence in the impartial, judicial analysis that the Court applies.

"As well as rejecting the substance of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the  fine is grossly disproportionate to any possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the European haberdashery market.
"Our customers have certainly not been injured."

The alleged contraventions occurred many years ago, between 1977-1999, prior to the acquisition of Coats by the GPG Group and do not involve any current members of the Coats board or management team.

"It should be stressed that this legacy issue has no impact on Coats current operations which continue to make good progress," it said.

"Coats acknowledges the full support of its shareholder GPG and its role in the successful development of the business over the last four years."
GPG shares were last traded at $1.65.

Guinness Peat Group (GPG) says a C122 million ($NZ230m)  fine levied against its subsidiary Coats by the European Commission is "simply outrageous".
"We will undoubtedly be appealing it," GPG's New Zealand director Tony Gibbs said yesterday.

TD
The fine was part of a C328m package of  fines levied against seven firms for alleged  cartel activity conducted many years ago. It was the final part of a long-running three-step inquiry the commission held into the  needle market, industrial thread and fasteners, which includes production of zips, snap buttons and rivets.

The alleged cartel activity, from 1977 to the late 1990s, pre- dates GPG's involvement with Britain's threadmaker Coats. GPG, chaired by investment veteran Sir Ron Brierley, did not take control of the firm until 2003, and completed a full takeover the following year.

Coats is already paying C38.5m of  fines relating to the  needle and industrial thread markets. So while another fine was expected, the magnitude of it was not.

"What's shaken everyone is the sheer size of this, because the (Coats) zips business is not enormous," Gibbs said.

GPG has made allowances in its accounts for the  fines -- but has never disclosed how much it expected to be  fined so as not to prejudice the outcome.

The firm's 2006 annual report shows total general provisions of 124m ($NZ347m). But it is not clear how much has been targeted specifically for the  fines -- and Gibbs would not say yesterday.
"All I can say is Coats does have substantial provisions," he said.

Guinness Peat Group has labelled as "outrageous" a  fine of EUR122 million ($201 million) the European Commission has handed its British-based thread-making business Coats for alleged involvement in a cartel in the zips and fasteners market.

The commission announced the  fine on Wednesday night after completing an investigation into the activities of seven firms in the zips and fasteners market in Europe and other parts of the world.

TD
A Japanese company, YKK, faces the largest  fine, of EUR150 million, as part of total  fines of
EUR329 million.

Guinness Peat took full ownership of Coats in 2004, after the claims of price  fixing  and swapping of commercial information are alleged to have occurred.
The EC alleged one of the four separate instances of  cartel behaviour ran for 21 years until 1998. Guinness Peat director Gary Weiss said the company would launch a vigorous legal fight.
"We regard the decision as being outrageous," he said yesterday.

"We most certainly do intend to vigorously appeal against it once the full decision of the commission is made available."

Coats is the world's largest supplier of threads for industry and apparel, and makes up about one-third of Guinness Peat's portfolio of investments.
Guinness Peat shares went into a trading halt yesterday, after slumping 5¢ to $1.65 in early trading. The EC alleged the seven firms operated four illegal cartels in which they agreed on co-ordinated
price increases, fixed minimum prices, allocated customers and exchanged commercially sensitive
information.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "It is unacceptable that the major fastening technology producers colluded for such a long time to maintain artificial price levels and to share customers and markets for products which are used every day by a lot of consumers."

Guy Hallwright, an analyst at New Zealand stockbroking firm Forsyth Barr, said the zips and fasteners decision was the final leg in three regulatory investigations.
Mr Hallwright said they were "legacy issues" Guinness Peat would have to deal with.
The first decision was a EUR30 million  fine relating to the  needles market, which the EC cut to
EUR20 million after Guinness Peat appealed.

Guinness Peat is considering another appeal on that matter.

A second investigation into the Nordic thread markets resulted in an EUR18.5 million  fine, Mr
Hallwright said.

He said market expectations for the  cartel fines would have been about EUR20 million, and the size of the  fine was a "negative surprise".

European  Commission Fasteners Decision

In relation to the European  Commission's decision on fasteners announced yesterday, Coats
notes that full details of the Commission’s reasoning are not yet available. In the interim,
Coats has the following comments on the decision:
•  Coats notes the Commission's allegation that between April 1998 and November 1999
European zip manufacturers exchanged price information and in respect of which the
Commission has fined Coats EUR 12.2 million. Coats has at all times fully co-operated
with the Commission's investigation into the fasteners market and will carefully study the
Commission's conclusions once details are made available before determining whether
to appeal against this aspect of the Commission’s decision.
•   Coats totally rejects the Commission's allegation of a market       
sharing agreement with
Prym in the European haberdashery market and in respect of which
Coats has been
Page 124 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
fined EUR 110.3 million. During the investigation Coats presented the Commission with
ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event a fine
was time-barred. Contrary to its rights under the European
Convention on Human Rights,
Coats was not permitted to examine the witness who made this allegation. Coats will
vigorously appeal the decision to the Court of First Instance once the full details of the
Commission's decision have been made available. The Court of
First Instance last week
quashed a large part of the Commission’s factual findings in the
Needles case for want of
proof or clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the
Commission. We have confidence
in the impartial, judicial analysis that the Court applies. As well as rejecting the substance
of the decision, Coats believes that the size of the fine is grossly disproportionate to any
possible impact that such an agreement could have had on the
European haberdashery
market. Our customers have certainly not been injured.
•   Subject to a review of the details, once received, of the
Commission’s decision, Coats
remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of
fines is adequately covered
by existing provisions. A guarantee for the original amount of the fine will be posted for
the duration of the appeal. Only once we have completed the appeal process will
payment of any fine, as finally determined by the Court, be made.
•  It should be noted that the alleged contraventions occurred many years ago, between
1977 -1999, prior to the acquisition of Coats by the GPG Group and do not involve any
current members of the Coats Board or management team. Anti-competitive behaviour
goes directly against company policy and represents a serious disciplinary offence.
•   It should be stressed that this legacy issue has no impact on
Coats current operations
which continue to make good progress. Coats acknowledges the full support of its
shareholder GPG and its role in the successful development of the business over the last
four years.

GUINNESS PEAT GROUP'S threadmaking subsidiary Coats is confident it has already made sufficient provisions to meet "eventual payment" of  fines to the European Commission.

GPG, which is planning an appeal against the commission's ruling, has still not disclosed its specific provisions. It does not intend to. The appeal could take about three years.

TD
British-based Coats was this week  fined (Euro)122 million (NZ$230 million) by the commission. This was part of a (Euro)328 million package of  fines levied against seven companies involved in fastener production for alleged  cartel activity from 1977 to the late 1990s. The largest  fine, of (Euro)150 million, was levied against YKK of Japan.

Coats chairman Gary Weiss said yesterday the company would get a bank guarantee to cover the full amount of the  fine during the appeal process. "Only once we have completed the appeal process will payment of any  fine, as finally determined by the court, be made."
GPG's New Zealand director Tony Gibbs reiterated that it would fight tooth and nail against the
fine's size. He stressed, however, that Coats' and GPG's operations were entirely unaffected by the
decision.
GPG shares dropped five cents to $1.88 yesterday.
The alleged cartel activity relates to well before GPG took over Coats, in 2004.

It was the last part of a long- running three-stage commission inquiry, first into the  needle market, then into industrial thread, and finally into fasteners, mostly zips.

GPG and Coats are already paying  fines relating to the earlier inquiries -- one of (Euro)18.5 million and the other of (Euro)20 million. The latter was reduced on appeal last week, from (Euro)30 million.

It may well be harder to interpret the comments of president Jean-Claude Trichet than it was those of
Soviet leaders Brezhnev or Andropov

It's probably easier to get into the Kremlin than it is to penetrate the European Central Bank's Euro Turm (Euro Tower) in Frankfurt. Last week it took me almost a quarter of an hour to get through security after a stony-faced guard at the x-ray machine interrogated me about why I was carrying a ballpoint pen.

TD
It may even be harder to read the runes of ECB statements and of the spoken comments of its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, than it was those of Brezhnev or Andropov. The latter-day Kremlinologists are the journos who, as in the White House press room, take their jealously guarded seats each month and, in a pecking order selected by Trichet, pose a series of elliptical questions for an hour - observed by
ECB-watching economists on EBS (Europe by Satellite) or via the bank's website.

Afterwards, over coffee, water or cigarettes in the smoke-extracting cabin, they shake their heads in confusion and try to work out the line. Last week, after much tortured rumination, the Trichetologists worked it out: the ECB, far from carrying out its threat to raise interest rates to counter medium-term inflationary risks, would cut them - not in March but probably in April. Or maybe May. At the latest.
Well, if that's what Trichet intended to be his message, it wasn't - or so he says. This week has seen the
ECB president and his colleagues, including the hawkish Axel Weber of the Bundesbank, pour cold
water on such interpretations or expectations or hopes. Trichet had said nobody on the ECB's governing
council had argued for a rate rise (or cut, for that matter), he didn't say the bank was ready for
pre-emptive action to contain inflation - and he admitted that the risks to economic growth were real.

It is, as Peer Steinbrück, Germany's stern, liberal finance minister, said after the monthly meeting of EU "ecofin" ministers this week, all a matter of interpretation. Summoning in support Weber, he said he hadn't understood Trichet to be pointing to a shift in policy emphasis - and, anyway, "we need to be
careful that we don't just uncritically adopt what may be important for the US in terms of interest rate cuts and economic stimulus programmes." And he warned off the French from putting political pressure on
the ECB for a rate cut, saying they would be better advised to cut their structural deficit - as he had (masterfully) done in two years to "a big black zero" - and adopt genuine economic reforms. (His French colleague, Christine Lagarde, had gone home early thinking she'd got her government off the hook, yet again, by winning leeway to cut the deficit to zero by, well, 2012 if the economy droops; Steinbrück said, no chance, 2010 remains the target - and so did the rest of his colleagues.)

Nobody has a clue what the outcome of the next few months will be for financial markets, European economic growth or inflation. But one sure bet is that the ECB, while railing against "second-round effects" of higher prices (wage rises), will take a thoroughly pragmatic view about its own policy. If the final quarter growth stats for the eurozone are worse than predicted and its own staff come up with grim prospects next month, after the  European Commission publishes its spring forecast next week, it'll cut borrowing costs.

Political sensitivities, not external political pressure, will prompt it in this direction. The bank is, whatever the Trichet rhetoric about "needle in the compass", less fixated about inflation than is painted. Its president repeatedly points to the millions of jobs it has helped create since its inception. The prospect of it putting that record at risk and of hastening a recession everybody says is not on the cards (yet) is remote. But that's just my interpretation.

Cartel-busters raid the sweetie jar

The cartel-busters and anti-monopoly-hunters are busy across the EU these days, chasing down suspected recidivists in the dawning of liberal free competition. Recently EU and national officials raided the offices of maritime classification (CLASS) firms in the early hours of the morning and this week they descended on chip-maker Intel and retailers such as the DSG group, owners of Currys and PC World, in a long-running case. The raiders helped the EU impose a record &#8364;2bn (£1.5bn) or more in  cartel fines alone last year (money which goes to the community budget).

Some of the busted firms work in the least glamorous segments of industry like synthetic rubber but, now, it's been confirmed that Germany's federal cartel office has raided some of the world's leading chocolate and sweetie-makers over suspected price-fixing  - including Haribo, the Bonn-based company that makes, inter alia, Gummibärs, the tiny fruit gums left in mini-packets on hotel beds across Europe.

As many as seven firms were raided last week, including Nestlé (makers of KitKat), Kraft (owners of Milka), Ferrero Rocher, Ritter (makers of the square bars) and Storck. Haribo has rejected any suggestion of price-fixing,  saying it hasn't even raised prices so far - though one of up to 3.5% may be due in May.

The German authorities appear to suspect that the firms, which all say they are co-operating, have used the increases in milk prices, driven by booming demand in emerging markets and drought, and in overall commodity costs to collude in imposing increases. The firms say they are merely acting to retain their profit margins.

But some of the price increases have been as much as 20% - and even Trichet last week pointed an accusing finger at food manufacturers, saying they were helping to drive up eurozone inflation through "price-setting" in uncompetitive markets. Maybe he could use his job-creation skills, too, by redirecting the swarms of scowling, rude security personnel towards more constructive work as dawn raiders.

Chairman's statement

Results Coats made good progress in 2007 in terms of both profits and cash generation. Its competitive position also continued to improve as a result of substantial investment in the relocation and upgrading of capacity and product range rationalisation in both the industrial and crafts businesses.

Pre-exceptional operating profit (before reorganisation, impairment and other exceptional items) grew by
29% to $158.1 million (2006 - $122.4 million). Profit from the industrial thread business increased by $29.0

million to $132.6 million (+28%), driven by an improved performance in Europe and strong growth in Asia. Crafts profit improved by $6.7 million to $25.5 million, principally as a result of a strong recovery in North American profitability. This was partly offset by weakness in the European crafts business, particularly handknittings, which pushed this business into loss.

Net earnings attributable to equity shareholders more than doubled to $61.8 million, due primarily to the improvement in pre-exceptional operating profit.
Cash flow EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) of
$225.6 million was 22% ahead of the previous year's total of $185.5 million.  European Commission fines
(see below for further details) of $29.8 million (2006 - $7.9 million) were paid in the year, but the net
operating cash flow before reorganisation costs remained strong at $190.7 million (2006 - $172.3 million).

Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Spend on capital projects at $68.8m was also lower than in the previous year (2006 - $78.3 million). Including the realisation of $25.9 million (2006 -
$60.2 million) from the sale of surplus property, reorganisation and capital spend was comfortably covered by internally generated cash flow. Spending on the acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings, net of disposals, amounted to $7.8 million (2006 - $7.5 million). Interest and tax paid at $76.2 million was broadly in line with last year (2006 - $72.8 million).
Excluding the $55.0 million advance from GPG, the Group succeeded in generating a $19.0 million (2006 -
$25.0 million) increase in cash.

Investment, reorganisation and disposals As noted above, the cash investment in new plant and systems amounted to $68.8 million (2006 - $78.3 million). Investment in plant and equipment largely consisted of additional capacity to meet growth in Asia and productivity improvements in Europe. Significant investment continues to be made in upgrading IT systems, including the installation of SAP in all Coats units throughout the world. Spend across the Group was 1.0 times (2006 - 1.2 times) depreciation and amortisation.

Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Approximately 75% of this spend in 2007 was directed towards site closures and restructuring in Europe. As noted at the half year, a major restructuring programme is well underway in Europe crafts, with the objective of transforming the previous structure of country-based organisations - each with its own product range - into a more cost-effective
pan-European business with a single, harmonised product offer. In the process, key products are being redesigned and new supply chains established so that the new pan-European product ranges will be more attractive and offer better value than could have been created by individual countries acting alone. Total numbers employed in the Group fell by 6% to 22,428 (2006 - 23,781) at the end of the year and 83% of employees are now located in low-cost markets. Since 2003 the number of employees in high-cost countries has fallen by more than 40%. Reorganisation cash outflows were partly offset by proceeds from the sale of properties which had become surplus as a result of the Group's reorganisation programme.

Spending on the acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings in existing subsidiaries, net of disposals, amounted to $7.8 million (2006 - $7.5 million). This covers several relatively small transactions, including the acquisition of Free Spirit, a North American crafts patchwork and quilting fabrics business, as well as the acquisition of minority interests in Sri Lanka. The Free Spirit acquisition, coupled with the subsequent launch of a wider range of patchwork and quilting fabrics, has opened up new growth opportunities for Coats in a popular and long-established North American crafts activity.

European Commission Investigation In September 2007, the  European Commission concluded its investigation into European fasteners - the last part outstanding of its general investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed  fines against several producers, including two fines against the Coats plc Group of EUR12.2 million and EUR110.3 million. Following legal advice, the Group has determined not to appeal the EUR12.2 million  fine, which was paid in December 2007.

Page 132 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The EUR110.3 million  fine is in respect of the Commission's allegation of a  market sharing  agreement in the European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects this allegation. During the investigation, Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event a fine was time-barred. Contrary to its right under the European Convention on Human Rights,
Coats was not permitted to examine the only witness who made this allegation. Coats is vigorously contesting the Commission's decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Earlier in September 2007, the Court of First Instance quashed a large number of the Commission's factual findings in respect of the EUR30 million needles fine, levied against Coats in 2004, following its investigation into the European hand-sewing needles market, for want of proof or because of clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission, and reduced the  fine to EUR20 million. A further appeal to the European Court of Justice has now been lodged in respect of this reduced  fine.

As stated in previous reports, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining fines is adequately covered by existing provisions.

Prospects The consistent progress achieved by the industrial business over the last four years has fully vindicated the substantial reorganisation programme during that period. However, given the global downturn, the purchasing power of the consumer in Western markets is expected to be adversely affected, which will impact apparel and footwear sales. The global industrial thread market is therefore expected to be relatively flat in 2008. Notwithstanding this, with major restructuring projects in Western markets largely complete, Coats will use its more competitive cost base to maintain and in some countries grow its market share, in particular within the Asian region.

Some improvement is expected in crafts profitability in 2008. In the Europe market there may be some tapering off of the decline in demand seen since 2005 and a move towards a more stable environment. Benefits will begin to flow through from the latter part of 2008 onwards from the ongoing restructuring and product harmonisation programme, due to a lower cost base and improved supply chains. In North America, it is anticipated that current sales levels and profitability will be maintained.

The Group's programme of relocating and upgrading industrial thread capacity has been successful and has made a substantial contribution to the improvement in industrial profitability. The downturn in
European crafts demand has indicated the need for a greater pace of reorganisation in that market. In light of this, total reorganisation costs in 2008 are expected to remain broadly in line with 2007. Reorganisation projects will continue to free up for disposal surplus properties which, in the past, have significantly
reduced the net spend.

Over the longer term, the Board remains confident that Coats' position in both the industrial thread and crafts markets will deliver further growth opportunities and increases in shareholder value.

The Asian industrial business delivered another good performance. This reflects both the continued growth in the apparel export market in this region, plus the investment made by Coats in additional production capacity and benefits from Coats relationships with global suppliers and brand owners. Sales and profits are broadly based across the region.

European sales continued to be affected by customer migration from Western Europe but this was partially offset by growth in Eastern Europe. However, there was a major recovery in operating profit in Western Europe as a result of reorganisation and investment in previous years.

The Americas continued to be affected by increased penetration of apparel imports from Asia. However, there was further recovery in operating profit as a result of earlier reorganisation and investment.

Crafts sales in Europe were principally affected by reduced demand for handknittings, although all crafts categories were down in an exceptionally weak retail environment for crafts products. With a relatively high fixed-cost base, the reduction in sales pushed the business into loss. The major restructuring is in its second year and will lower the cost base, improve productivity and deliver a harmonised pan-European product offer by 2008/9.

Crafts results in the Americas benefited from a more stable handknittings market in North America and the absence of mark-downs and other one-off charges which affected 2006. In total, sales of handknittings were slightly down on last year as recovery in North America was offset by decline in South America. The acquisition of Free Spirit was successfully completed and contributed to sales growth in patchwork and quilting fabrics.
Investment income and finance costs Finance costs, net of investment income, were $25.4 million (2006 -
$24.9 million). Net interest payable, after including $2.4 million (2006 - $2.7 million) of interest receivable
shown in investment income, was up $5.0m from $37.0 million in 2006 to $42.0 million in 2007, largely due
to $2.9 million additional amortisation of 2004 facility fee charges, given that key bank facilities are
expected to be refinanced in 2008 well before they mature in March 2009. The net return on pension
scheme assets and liabilities increased by $7.4 million to $23.1 million.
Tax The tax charge of $43.2 million (2006 - $26.3 million) represents a rate of 45% (2006 - 46%) on
pre-tax profit of $95.6 million (2006 - $57.1 million). Excluding prior year charges of $1.7 million (2006 -
$7.5 million credits), the tax rate was 43% for 2007 compared to 59% in the previous year. The Group has
significant losses available to reduce future tax payments once profitability, in particular in Europe,
improves.

Profit from discontinued operations The $14.6 million (2006 - $3.2 million) profit from discontinued operations largely relates to the sale of UK property.

Pension and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK and there is a similar arrangement in the USA. The UK scheme shows a recoverable surplus of $21.9 million (2006 - $22.9 million) and the USA scheme shows a recoverable surplus of $35.0 million (2006 - $36.9 million). These surpluses are predominantly included in non-current assets. Employer contribution holidays for these schemes continue to be taken based on actuarial advice.

There are various pension and leaving indemnity arrangements in other countries (primarily in Europe) where the Group operates. The vast majority of these schemes, in line with local market practice, are not funded but are provided in the Group accounts and are predominantly included in current and non-current liabilities.

Balance sheet In the year $55.0 million was received from GPG, largely offsetting the $56.7 million of bank debt repaid. Of this sum, $29.8 million was utilised in making payments in respect of the  European           Commission fines. Coats expects to refinance its main bank facilities in 2008 and the $55.0 million will be repaid to GPG as part of this.

Net debt (including this advance) was slightly reduced to $335.9 million (2006 - $345.7 million), notwithstanding the payment of the  fines. Net gearing (including this advance) was 63% (2006 - 76%).

Equity shareholders' funds increased from $434.5 million to $517.8 million, reflecting the $61.8 million net attributable profit plus net gains of $21.5 million taken directly to reserves, largely in respect of exchange

Chairman’s statement Results Coats made good progress in 2007 in terms of both profits and cash generation. Its competitive position also continued to improve as a result of substantial investment in the relocation and upgrading of capacity and product range rationalisation in both the industrial and crafts businesses. Pre-exceptional operating profit (before reorganisation, impairment and other exceptional items) grew by 29% to $158.1 million (2006 - $122.4 million). Profit from the industrial thread business increased by $29.0 million to $132.6 million (+28%), driven by an improved performance in Europe and strong growth in Asia. Crafts profit improved by $6.7 million to $25.5 million, principally as a result of a strong recovery in North American profitability. This was partly offset by weakness in the European crafts business, particularly handknittings, which pushed this business into loss. The results for crafts and industrial over the last four years provide the context for the current year’s performance. 2007 2006 2005

Net earnings attributable to equity shareholders more than doubled to $61.8 million, due primarily to the improvement in pre- exceptional operating profit. Cash flow EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) of $225.6 million was 22% ahead of the previous year’s total of
$185.5 million.  European Commission fines (see below for further details) of $29.8 million (2006 - $7.9 million) were paid in the year, but the net operating cash flow before reorganisation costs remained strong at $190.7 million (2006 - $172.3 million). Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Spend on capital projects at $68.8m was also lower than in the previous year (2006 - $78.3 million). Including the realisation of $25.9 million (2006 - $60.2 million) from the sale of surplus property, reorganisation and capital spend was comfortably covered by internally generated cash flow. Spending on
the acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings, net of disposals, amounted to $7.8 million (2006 -
$7.5 million). Interest and tax paid at $76.2 million was broadly in line with last year (2006 - $72.8 million).
Excluding the $55.0 million advance from GPG, the Group succeeded in generating a $19.0 million (2006 -
$25.0 million) increase in cash. Investment, reorganisation and disposals As noted above, the cash
investment in new plant and systems amounted to $68.8 million (2006 - $78.3 million). Investment in plant

and equipment largely consisted of additional capacity to meet growth in Asia and productivity improvements in Europe. Significant investment continues to be made in upgrading IT systems, including the installation of SAP in all Coats units throughout the world. Spend across the Group was 1.0 times (2006
– 1.2 times) depreciation and amortisation. Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Approximately 75% of this spend in 2007 was directed towards site closures and restructuring in Europe. As noted at the half year, a major restructuring programme is well underway in Europe crafts, with the objective of transforming the previous structure of country-based organisations – each with its own product range – into a more cost-effective pan-European business with a single, harmonised product offer. In the process, key products are being redesigned and new supply chains established so that the new
pan-European product ranges will be more attractive and offer better value than could have been created by individual countries acting alone. Total numbers employed in the Group fell by 6% to 22,428 (2006 –
23,781) at the end of the year and 83% of employees are now located in low-cost markets. Since 2003 the number of employees in high-cost countries has fallen by more than 40%. Reorganisation cash outflows were partly offset by proceeds from the sale of properties which had become surplus as a result of the Group’s reorganisation programme. Spending on the acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings in existing subsidiaries, net of disposals, amounted to $7.8 million (2006 - $7.5 million). This covers several relatively small transactions, including the acquisition of Free Spirit, a North American crafts patchwork and quilting fabrics business, as well as the acquisition of minority interests in Sri Lanka. The Free Spirit acquisition, coupled with the subsequent launch of a wider range of patchwork and quilting fabrics, has opened up new growth opportunities for Coats in a popular and long-established North American crafts activity.  European Commission Investigation In September 2007, the  European Commission concluded its investigation into European fasteners – the last part outstanding of its general investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed  fines against several producers, including two fines against the Coats plc Group of €12.2 million and €110.3 million. Following legal advice, the Group
has determined not to appeal the €12.2 million  fine, which was paid in December 2007. The €110.3 million fine is in respect of the Commission’s allegation of a  market sharing  agreement in the European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects this allegation. During the investigation, Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event a  fine was time-barred. Contrary to its right under the European Convention on Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the only witness who made this allegation. Coats is vigorously contesting the Commission’s decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. Earlier in September 2007, the Court of First Instance quashed a large number of the Commission’s factual findings in respect of the €30 million needles fine, levied against Coats in 2004, following its investigation into the European hand-sewing needles market, for want of proof or because of clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission, and reduced the  fine to €20 million. A further appeal to the European Court of Justice has now been lodged in respect of this reduced  fine. As stated in previous reports, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining  fines is adequately covered by existing provisions. Prospects The consistent progress achieved by the industrial business over the last
four years has fully vindicated the substantial reorganisation programme during that period. However, given the global downturn, the purchasing power of the consumer in Western markets is expected to be
adversely affected, which will impact apparel and footwear sales. The global industrial thread market is therefore expected to be relatively flat in 2008. Notwithstanding this, with major restructuring projects in Western markets largely complete, Coats will use its more competitive cost base to maintain and in some countries grow its market share, in particular within the Asian region. Some improvement is expected in crafts profitability in 2008. In the Europe market there may be some tapering off of the decline in demand seen since 2005 and a move towards a more stable environment. Benefits will begin to flow through from the latter part of 2008 onwards from the ongoing restructuring and product harmonisation programme, due to a lower cost base and improved supply chains. In North America, it is anticipated that current sales levels and profitability will be maintained. The Group’s programme of relocating and upgrading industrial thread capacity has been successful and has made a substantial contribution to the improvement in industrial profitability. The downturn in European crafts demand has indicated the need for a greater pace of reorganisation in that market. In light of this, total reorganisation costs in 2008 are expected to remain broadly in line with 2007. Reorganisation projects will continue to free up for disposal surplus properties which, in the past, have significantly reduced the net spend. Over the longer term, the Board remains confident that Coats’ position in both the industrial thread and crafts markets will deliver further growth opportunities and increases in shareholder value.

like-for-like basis The Asian industrial business delivered another good performance. This reflects both the continued growth in the apparel export market in this region, plus the investment made by Coats in additional production capacity and benefits from Coats relationships with global suppliers and brand owners. Sales and profits are broadly based across the region. European sales continued to be affected by customer migration from Western Europe but this was partially offset by growth in Eastern Europe. However, there was a major recovery in operating profit in Western Europe as a result of reorganisation
and investment in previous years. The Americas continued to be affected by increased penetration of apparel imports from Asia. However, there was further recovery in operating profit as a result of earlier reorganisation and investment. Crafts Trading Performance

profit** *2006 like-for-like restates 2006 figures at 2007 exchange rates and includes an adjustment to reflect the impact of acquisitions **Pre reorganisation, impairment, and other exceptional items (see note 2) In the following comments, all comparisons with 2006 are on a like-for-like basis Crafts sales in Europe
were principally affected by reduced demand for handknittings, although all crafts categories were down in an exceptionally weak retail environment for crafts products. With a relatively high fixed-cost base, the reduction in sales pushed the business into loss. The major restructuring is in its second year and will lower the cost base, improve productivity and deliver a harmonised pan-European product offer by 2008/9. Crafts results in the Americas benefited from a more stable handknittings market in North America and the absence of mark- downs and other one-off charges which affected 2006. In total, sales of handknittings were slightly down on last year as recovery in North America was offset by decline in South America. The acquisition of Free Spirit was successfully completed and contributed to sales growth in patchwork and quilting fabrics. Investment income and finance costs Finance costs, net of investment income, were $25.4 million (2006 - $24.9 million). Net interest payable, after including $2.4 million (2006 - $2.7 million) of
interest receivable shown in investment income, was up $5.0m from $37.0 million in 2006 to $42.0 million in
2007, largely due to $2.9 million additional amortisation of 2004 facility fee charges, given that key bank
facilities are expected to be refinanced in 2008 well before they mature in March 2009. The net return on
pension scheme assets and liabilities increased by $7.4 million to $23.1 million. Tax The tax charge of
$43.2 million (2006 - $26.3 million) represents a rate of 45% (2006 – 46%) on pre-tax profit of $95.6 million
(2006 - $57.1 million). Excluding prior year charges of $1.7 million (2006 - $7.5 million credits), the tax rate
was 43% for 2007 compared to 59% in the previous year. The Group has significant losses available to

reduce future tax payments once profitability, in particular in Europe, improves. Profit from discontinued operations The $14.6 million (2006 - $3.2 million) profit from discontinued operations largely relates to the sale of UK property. Pension and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK and there is a similar arrangement in the USA. The UK scheme shows a recoverable surplus of $21.9 million (2006 - $22.9 million) and the USA scheme shows a recoverable surplus of $35.0 million (2006 – $36.9 million). These surpluses are predominantly included in non-current assets. Employer contribution holidays for these schemes continue to be taken based on actuarial advice. There are various pension and leaving indemnity arrangements in other countries (primarily in Europe) where the Group operates. The vast majority of these schemes, in line with local market practice, are not funded but are provided in the Group accounts and are predominantly included in current and non-current liabilities. Balance sheet In the year $55.0 million was received from GPG, largely offsetting the $56.7 million of bank debt repaid. Of this sum, $29.8 million was utilised in making payments in respect of the  European             Commission fines. Coats expects to refinance its main bank facilities in 2008 and the $55.0 million will be repaid to GPG as part of this. Net debt (including this advance) was slightly reduced to $335.9 million (2006
- $345.7 million), notwithstanding the payment of the  fines. Net gearing (including this advance) was 63% (2006 – 76%). Equity shareholders’ funds increased from $434.5 million to $517.8 million, reflecting the
$61.8 million net attributable profit plus net gains of $21.5 million taken directly to reserves, largely in respect of exchange differences arising on the translation of operations with functional currencies other than the US dollar. Minority interests fell by $1.1 million to $18.4 million largely as a result of acquisitions. Consolidated income statement (unaudited)

Results

Coats made good progress in 2007 in terms of both profits and cash generation.
Its competitive position also continued to improve as a result of substantial
investment in the relocation and upgrading of capacity and product range
rationalisation in both the industrial and crafts businesses.

Pre-exceptional operating profit (before reorganisation, impairment and other
exceptional items) grew by 29% to $158.1 million (2006 - $122.4 million). Profit
from the industrial thread business increased by $29.0 million to
$132.6 million
(+28%), driven by an improved performance in Europe and strong growth in Asia.
Crafts profit improved by $6.7 million to $25.5 million, principally as a result
of a strong recovery in North American profitability. This was partly offset by
weakness in the European crafts business, particularly handknittings, which
pushed this business into loss.

Net earnings attributable to equity shareholders more than doubled to
$61.8
million, due primarily to the improvement in pre-exceptional operating profit.

Cash flow

EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional operating profit before depreciation and
amortisation) of $225.6 million was 22% ahead of the previous year's total of
$185.5 million. European  Commission  fines (see below for further details) of
$29.8 million (2006 - $7.9 million) were paid in the year, but the net operating
cash flow before reorganisation costs remained strong at $190.7 million (2006 -
$172.3 million).

Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Spend on capital
projects at $68.8m was also lower than in the previous year (2006 -
$78.3
million). Including the realisation of $25.9 million (2006 - $60.2 million)
from the sale of surplus property, reorganisation and capital spend was

Page 151 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
comfortably covered by internally generated cash flow. Spending on the
acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings, net of disposals, amounted
to $7.8 million (2006 - $7.5 million).  Interest and tax paid at
$76.2 million
was broadly in line with last year (2006 - $72.8 million).

Excluding the $55.0 million advance from GPG, the Group succeeded in generating
a $19.0 million (2006 - $25.0 million) increase in cash. Investment, reorganisation and disposals
As noted above, the cash investment in new plant and systems amounted to $68.8
million (2006 - $78.3 million). Investment in plant and equipment largely
consisted of additional capacity to meet growth in Asia and productivity
improvements in Europe. Significant investment continues to be made in
upgrading IT systems, including the installation of SAP in all Coats units
throughout the world.  Spend across the Group was 1.0 times (2006 -
1.2 times)
depreciation and amortisation.

Reorganisation spend was $44.6 million (2006 - $54.5 million). Approximately 75%
of this spend in 2007 was directed towards site closures and restructuring in
Europe. As noted at the half year, a major restructuring programme is well
underway in Europe crafts, with the objective of transforming the previous
structure of country-based organisations - each with its own product range -
into a more cost-effective pan-European business with a single, harmonised
product offer.  In the process, key products are being redesigned and new supply
chains established so that the new pan-European product ranges will be more
attractive and offer better value than could have been created by individual
countries acting alone.   Total numbers employed in the Group fell by
6% to
22,428 (2006 - 23,781) at the end of the year and 83% of employees are now
located in low-cost markets.  Since 2003 the number of employees in high-cost
countries has fallen by more than 40%. Reorganisation cash outflows were partly
offset by proceeds from the sale of properties which had become surplus as a
result of the Group's reorganisation programme.

Spending on the acquisition of businesses and minority shareholdings in existing
subsidiaries, net of disposals, amounted to $7.8 million (2006 - $7.5 million).
This covers several relatively small transactions, including the acquisition of
Free Spirit, a North American crafts patchwork and quilting fabrics business, as
Page 152 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
well as the acquisition of minority interests in Sri Lanka. The Free
Spirit
acquisition, coupled with the subsequent launch of a wider range of patchwork
and quilting fabrics, has opened up new growth opportunities for
Coats in a
popular and long-established North American crafts activity.

European  Commission Investigation

In September 2007, the European  Commission concluded its investigation into
European fasteners - the last part outstanding of its general investigation into
thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed
fines against
several producers, including two fines against the Coats plc Group of EUR12.2
million and EUR110.3 million.  Following legal advice, the Group has determined
not to appeal the EUR12.2 million fine, which was paid in December
2007.

The EUR110.3 million fine is in respect of the Commission's allegation of a market
sharing agreement in the European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects
this allegation.  During the investigation, Coats presented the
Commission with
ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that in any event
a fine was time-barred.  Contrary to its right under the European
Convention on
Human Rights, Coats was not permitted to examine the only witness who made this
allegation. Coats is vigorously contesting the Commission's decision in an
appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in
Luxembourg.

Earlier in September 2007, the Court of First Instance quashed a large number of
the Commission's factual findings in respect of the EUR30 million
needles  fine,
levied against Coats in 2004, following its investigation into the
European
hand-sewing needles market, for want of proof or because of clear misinterpretation of the evidence by the Commission, and reduced the fine to EUR20
million. A further appeal to the European Court of Justice has now been lodged
[ 28-02-08 0702GMT ]


in respect of this reduced
fine.

As stated in previous reports, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated
eventual payment of the remaining fines is adequately covered by existing
provisions.

Prospects



Page 153 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The consistent progress achieved by the industrial business over the last four
years has fully vindicated the substantial reorganisation programme during that
period. However, given the global downturn, the purchasing power of the
consumer in Western markets is expected to be adversely affected, which will
impact apparel and footwear sales.  The global industrial thread market is
therefore expected to be relatively flat in 2008. Notwithstanding this, with
major restructuring projects in Western markets largely complete, Coats will use
its more competitive cost base to maintain and in some countries grow its market
share, in particular within the Asian region.

Some improvement is expected in crafts profitability in 2008. In the
Europe
market there may be some tapering off of the decline in demand seen since 2005
and a move towards a more stable environment. Benefits will begin to flow
through from the latter part of 2008 onwards from the ongoing restructuring and
product harmonisation programme, due to a lower cost base and improved supply
chains.  In North America, it is anticipated that current sales levels and
profitability will be maintained.

The Group's programme of relocating and upgrading industrial thread capacity has
been successful and has made a substantial contribution to the improvement in
industrial profitability.  The downturn in European crafts demand has indicated
the need for a greater pace of reorganisation in that market. In light of this,
total reorganisation costs in 2008 are expected to remain broadly in line with
2007.  Reorganisation projects will continue to free up for disposal surplus
properties which, in the past, have significantly reduced the net spend.

Over the longer term, the Board remains confident that Coats' position in both
the industrial thread and crafts markets will deliver further growth opportunities and increases in shareholder value.

The Asian industrial business delivered another good performance. This reflects
both the continued growth in the apparel export market in this region, plus the
investment made by Coats in additional production capacity and benefits from
Coats relationships with global suppliers and brand owners.   Sales and profits
are broadly based across the region.

European sales continued to be affected by customer migration from
Western
Europe but this was partially offset by growth in Eastern Europe. However, there
was a major recovery in operating profit in Western Europe as a result of
reorganisation and investment in previous years.

The Americas continued to be affected by increased penetration of apparel
imports from Asia. However, there was further recovery in operating profit as a
result of earlier reorganisation and investment.

In the following comments, all comparisons with 2006 are on a like-for-like
basis

Crafts sales in Europe were principally affected by reduced demand for
handknittings, although all crafts categories were down in an exceptionally weak
retail environment for crafts products. With a relatively high fixed-cost base,
the reduction in sales pushed the business into loss. The major restructuring is
in its second year and will lower the cost base, improve productivity and
deliver a harmonised pan-European product offer by 2008/9.

Crafts results in the Americas benefited from a more stable handknittings market
in North America and the absence of mark-downs and other one-off charges which
affected 2006. In total, sales of handknittings were slightly down on last year
as recovery in North America was offset by decline in South America. The
acquisition of Free Spirit was successfully completed and contributed to sales
growth in patchwork and quilting fabrics. Investment income and finance costs
Finance costs, net of investment income, were $25.4 million (2006 -
$24.9
million). Net interest payable, after including $2.4 million (2006 -
$2.7
million) of interest receivable shown in investment income, was up
$5.0m from
$37.0 million in 2006 to $42.0 million in 2007, largely due to $2.9 million
additional amortisation of 2004 facility fee charges, given that key bank
facilities are expected to be refinanced in 2008 well before they mature in
March 2009.  The net return on pension scheme assets and liabilities increased
by $7.4 million to $23.1 million. Tax
The tax charge of $43.2 million (2006 - $26.3 million) represents a rate of 45%
(2006 - 46%) on pre-tax profit of $95.6 million (2006 - $57.1 million).
Page 156 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Excluding prior year charges of $1.7 million (2006 - $7.5 million credits), the
tax rate was 43% for 2007 compared to 59% in the previous year. The
Group has
significant losses available to reduce future tax payments once profitability,
in particular in Europe, improves. Profit from discontinued operations
The $14.6 million (2006 - $3.2 million) profit from discontinued operations
largely relates to the sale of UK property. Pension and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK and there is a similar
arrangement in the USA. The UK scheme shows a recoverable surplus of
$21.9
million (2006 - $22.9 million) and the USA scheme shows a recoverable surplus of
$35.0 million (2006 - $36.9 million).  These surpluses are predominantly
included in non-current assets.  Employer contribution holidays for these
schemes continue to be taken based on actuarial advice.

There are various pension and leaving indemnity arrangements in other countries
(primarily in Europe) where the Group operates. The vast majority of these
schemes, in line with local market practice, are not funded but are provided in
the Group accounts and are predominantly included in current and non-current
liabilities. Balance sheet
In the year $55.0 million was received from GPG, largely offsetting the $56.7
million of bank debt repaid.  Of this sum, $29.8 million was utilised in making
payments in respect of the European  Commission  fines. Coats expects to
refinance its main bank facilities in 2008 and the $55.0 million will be repaid
to GPG as part of this.

Net debt (including this advance) was slightly reduced to $335.9 million (2006 -
$345.7 million), notwithstanding the payment of the fines. Net gearing
(including this advance) was 63% (2006 - 76%).

Equity shareholders' funds increased from $434.5 million to $517.8 million,
reflecting the $61.8 million net attributable profit plus net gains of $21.5
million taken directly to reserves, largely in respect of exchange differences
arising on the translation of operations with functional currencies other than
the US dollar. Minority interests fell by $1.1 million to $18.4 million largely

Good result from Coats helps firm to treble bottom line
Profit has hit record levels at Guinness Peat Group as the investment company fights a big  fine in
Europe.

TD
Net profit for the year ending December 31 was 129 million ($314 million), more than three times the previous year's 36 million.

Ron Brierley, chairman at the NZX- listed but UK-based company, said the main drivers for the result were the sale of shares in Australian Wealth Management and Premier Investments.

The company sold a 19.4 per cent stake in Australian Wealth Management for A$267 million ($308.5 million) in April, 2007 which returned a profit of A$172 million after a two-year shareholding.
Deals including Green's Foods and Nationwide Accident Repair Services and the contribution from
UK-based sewing thread and  needle-craft subsidiary Coats were also important, Brierley said.

However, in September 2007 the European Commission concluded an investigation into the price fixing  of zips and fasteners, imposing fines against several producers including two  fines on Coats Group for 12.2 million ($22.6 million) and 110.3 million.

The company decided to pay the 12.2 million  fine in December but would contest the larger  fine for an alleged market-sharing agreement in the haberdashery sector.
``The EC decision in relation to Coats was an unwelcome and unexpected blow,'' Brierley said.

``Although we were well aware of the uncertainties of the third and final unresolved EC issue, which we inherited as a 1990s legacy in the acquisition of Coats, the administrative  fine of 110 million is totally disproportionate and irreconcilable with the facts as known to us,'' he said.

``We believe that this amount will eventually be proved unsustainable, even to the extent of a complete reversal of the initial finding, when it is eventually subject to higher levels of EC scrutiny.''
A provision for an amount less than the  fine would be held in the accounts of Coats.

Net profit at Coats for the year was US$61.8 million ($75.8 million), up from US$29.9 million, with the industrial thread business starting to show benefits from an expensive restructuring exercise. ``Crafts was relatively weak in 2007 but this is a very well established operation and it is only a matter of time before profits return to more normal levels,'' Brierley said.
Shares closed up 24c yesterday at $1.66.

Guinness Peat Group New Zealand director Tony Gibbs said company profit could be lumpy and activity including restructuring companies did not fit neatly into accounting periods.
``We're not a sausage factory,'' he said.

Forsyth Barr analyst Guy Hallwright said the market had responded positively to the Coats result.

``The two operating divisions industrial, which is the thread business, and crafts are both doing better than people expected probably,'' Hallwright said.

Wellington, Oct 3 NZPA - Guinness Peat Group shares fell 8c to $1.15 today after the company's subsidiary Coats Plc failed to get a reduction in  fines for fixing  the price of sewing  needles.
The 6.5 percent fall in the company's share price also came as the share market plunged 3.273 percent.

TD
GPG, the investment company built up by Sir Ron Brierley in the last two decades, wholly owns Coats, the second-largest zip manufacturer in the world.

Coats has failed in a final bid at the European Union's top court to reduce EU  cartel fines levied against it for fixing  prices of sewing needles, Bloomberg News reported.
The European Court of Justice rejected the company's claim that its role in the  cartel was passive.
A lower EU court decided last year to reduce the company's  fine to 20 million euros ($NZ42.62 million)
from 30 million euros.
The European Commission accused Coats, William Prym GmbH and Entaco Ltd of operating a  cartel
to divide the haberdashery market from 1994 until 1999.
Coats, William Prym and Entaco were Europe's main  needle suppliers. NZPA WGT pjg

PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

As stated in the 7 January Market Update, 2008 was a very unsatisfactory year for GPG. A number of portfolio writedowns have been necessary as a consequence of the global financial crisis although we believe many of these will ultimately recover as a more realistic reflection of intrinsic value. Not so good, are those which are the product of poor investment judgment in earlier years and where we must accept a permanent loss. All of the foregoing was canvassed in the Interim Report but became worse in the second half. Our principal operating subsidiary, Coats, has also been affected by the economic downturn with a disappointing loss of £4 million. However, that arose from an unusual circumstance whereby tax of £20 million exceeded the net profit of £16 million because of country mismatches for which there is no immediate solution other than if, and when, loss making units return to profit, there will be a corresponding offset in the future. Coats will obviously continue to encounter difficult trading conditions during 2009 but that may provide some relative advantages in terms of the company’s outstanding geographic coverage
and its technological superiority over weaker competitors. Coats has manufacturing facilities in 35 countries

and is represented in 71 overall which is quite remarkable for a company with total assets of less than £1 billion and provides reassurance regarding its ultimate value in a better economic cycle. GPG’s formal Accounts show a net loss for the year of £50 million compared with a loss of £42 million to 30 June and a profit of £129 million in 2007. However, all those figures are largely meaningless for present analytical purposes as they contain “exotic” accounting entries which distort actual performance. In today’s volatile market conditions, the January Market Update is considered to be a more useful assessment of GPG’s year end position. Net asset value on that basis was £729 million compared with £878 million in these Accounts – the difference being a more informal overall conservative evaluation. That profile has not changed greatly in the current term other than a further fall in the value of CSR shares and the provision of A$10 million support for Capral Ltd. Net cash has increased, mainly as a result of the sale of MYOB
shares. CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND The Board has decided to maintain the standard 1p dividend and 1 for
10 bonus issue (the 16th in succession, multiplying an original 1990 holding 4.6 times). That recognises the
context of GPG’s 19 year record rather than one unsatisfactory year just completed. The share election
scheme will operate in lieu of cash dividend on the basis of 1 new share for each 25 shares already held.
OUTLOOK We are still focused on returning value to shareholders in 2010 but that must now be qualified
by the unprecedented global financial stringency, the repercussions from which are likely to continue to
emerge for some time to come. Ron Brierley Chairman 27 February 2009 1 Guinness Peat Group plc

Guinness Peat Group plc NOTES TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION 1. The preliminary financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and complies with the disclosure requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange. The accounting policies adopted have been consistently applied to all periods presented. 2. The financial information set out in this announcement does not constitute the Group's statutory accounts for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007. The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2007 is derived from the statutory accounts for that year, which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditors' report on
those accounts included a modified opinion, containing an emphasis of matter paragraph to highlight the significant uncertainty in relation to the  European Commission competition investigation into alleged market sharing  agreements relating to the European haberdashery market. Further details relating to this matter are set out in Note 14. The auditors' report did not contain statements under Section 237(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 1985. Whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been
compiled in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of applicable IFRS, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. GPG expects to publish full financial statements that comply with IFRS and these will be available to shareholders in March 2009. The financial information in this report is unaudited. However, as in the prior year the auditors anticipate issuing a modified audit opinion which, without qualifying their opinion, will contain an emphasis of matter paragraph to highlight the significant uncertainty in relation to the  European Commission competition investigation into alleged  market sharing  agreements relating to the European haberdashery market. Further details relating to this matter are set out in Note 14. Giving due consideration to the nature of the Group’s business and underlying investments as a whole, including the financial resources available to the
Page 175 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Group, the directors consider that the Company and the Group are a going concern and this preliminary announcement is prepared on that basis. The directors of one of the Company's subsidiary undertakings, Capral Ltd, whilst noting that there were significant uncertainties, concluded that it was appropriate to prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis. 3. Group foreign exchange movements - during the year ended 31 December 2008, GPG recognised in operating profit £4 million of net foreign exchange losses which compares with £8 million of net foreign exchange losses in the year ended 31 December
2007. Further net foreign exchange gains of £105 million (2007: £38 million) were recognised in reserves.
4. Profit on disposal of investments and other net investment income includes profit on disposal of fixed
asset investments of £116 million and non-current asset impairment provisions of £66 million.
Administrative expenses include £45 million in respect of impairment of goodwill (2007: £3 million). 5. Tax

The tax charge for the year includes £26 million in respect of the derecognition of deferred tax assets relating to tax losses. This
charge arises from a similar reduction in deferred tax liabilities recognised through the unrealised gains reserve, due to a reduction in
taxable unrealised surpluses during the period. In addition the tax charge reflects the impact of unrelieved losses in certain subsidiary
undertakings.

to the date of acquisition.

8. Other investments - Fixed asset investments within non-current assets are classified under IFRS as available-for-sale investments, and
current asset investments within current assets are classified under IFRS
as held-for-trading investments.
9. (Loss)/earnings per share - The calculation of basic (loss)/earnings per
Ordinary Share from continuing and discontinued operations is based
on (loss)/profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the parent and the weighted average number of 1,412,703,249 Ordinary
Shares in issue during the year.
The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing operations is based on (loss)/profit for the year from continuing
operations attributable to equity shareholders of the parent and the weighted average number of 1,412,703,249 Ordinary Shares in issue
during the year.
The comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been adjusted for the 2008 Capitalisation Issue.
Calculations of (loss)/earnings per Ordinary Share are based on results to the nearest £'000.
10. The net tangible assets (net assets excluding intangible assets) per share at 31 December 2008 were 51.46p (2007: 59.97p).
11. Changes in the issued share capital during the year ended 31 December 2008 comprise the following:


At 1 January 2008

Employee options exercised

63,741

Page 178 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
12. The Chairman's Statement refers to the net asset value of £729 million from the 7 January Market Update. The principal differences between
this valuation and that shown by the balance sheet contained within this preliminary financial information are the basis for valuing
subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures, the impacts of foreign exchange rates and the inclusion of a contingency.

13. Dividends - The directors have approved the payment of an interim dividend of 1.00 pence per share payable on 18 May 2009 and making a
total of 1.00 pence per share for the year. This is subject to a right for shareholders to elect, instead of the cash dividend, to receive one new
Ordinary Share for every 25 existing shares held at the appropriate record date. An interim cash dividend of 0.91 pence per share (adjusted to
reflect the 2008 Capitalisation Issue) in respect of the year ended 31
December 2007 was paid on 16 May 2008 to GPG shareholders.
There are local regulatory differences in the countries in which the
Group’s shares are listed, which can result in different taxation treatment
and timing. This may have a significant effect on the tax treatment of the dividend for shareholders resident outside the UK. Shareholders are
advised to obtain their own professional advice.
The tax treatment of the cash dividend and the scrip dividend alternative, including the availability of tax credits such as franking credits,
will be dealt with more fully in a Circular which will be published at the same time as the Company’s Annual Report (see note 15 below).
Shareholders are recommended to obtain their own professional advice.

14. European Commission Investigation - As noted in previous reports, in
September 2007 the European Commission concluded its investigation
into European fasteners – the last part outstanding of its general investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It
imposed fines against several producers, including a fine against the Coats plc Group of €110.3 million. The €110.3 million fine is in respect
of the Commission’s allegation of a market sharing agreement in the
European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects this allegation.
During the investigation, Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that, in any
event, a fine was time-barred. Coats is vigorously contesting the
Commission’s decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.
Having succeeded in its initial appeal to the Court of First Instance in reducing the needles  fine from €30 million to €20 million, Coats was
unsuccessful in its further appeal to the European Court of Justice. This
fine was paid in the course of 2008.
As stated in previous reports, the Group remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining fine is adequately
covered by existing provisions.

Guinness Peat Group plc
15.   The Annual General Meeting of the Company (the “2009 AGM”) will be held on Thursday 21 May 2009 to
consider, amongst other things, the 2009 Capitalisation Issue. Notice of the 2009 AGM will be incorporated in the
Annual Report which will be published on the Company’s Website at www.gpgplc.com in March 2009. A circular
accompanying the Notice of the 2009 AGM will contain details of the
Interim Dividend, the Scrip Dividend
Alternative and the 2009 Capitalisation Issue. The shares representing the 2009 Capitalisation Issue cannot be
allotted until shareholders have given their approval at the 2009 AGM. In order to accommodate the different market practices of the London
Stock Exchange (“LSE”), Australian
Securities Exchange (“ASX”) and New Zealand Stock Market (“NZSX”), being those markets on which GPG’s
shares are quoted, and subject to approval of the Capitalisation Issue by shareholders, the Stock Events timetable

Chairman’s statement Results Although the overall reported result for the year is disappointing, much has been achieved in 2008, in what has been a very difficult year due to the unprecedented deterioration in global economic conditions, with credit constraints impacting consumers and retailers alike. The year saw oil prices peak at $140/barrel and costs of energy and commodities increase significantly. Together with a weak US dollar for much of the year and strengthening currencies in countries in which Coats has key operations (such as Brazil and Mexico), costs in US dollar terms rose significantly. Sales at the half year stage were 6% up on a buoyant 2007 and were 2% up in the third quarter. However, Coats’ industrial sales are largely driven by demand for clothing and footwear, which fell in the fourth quarter, and Coats’ total sales were 20% down on 2007 in this quarter. This, together with actions to idle plants to conserve cash, resulted in a poor fourth quarter result. Notwithstanding these conditions and a very poor result from
Europe crafts, 2008 operating profits and net debt position demonstrate Coats’ resilience and ability to generate cash in these circumstances. Despite market conditions, Coats’ competitive position and market share continued to improve as a result of the substantial investment that has been made in the last few years in the upgrading and relocation of capacity and from the significant progress in rationalising the product offer in both the industrial and crafts businesses. A pre-exceptional operating profit (before reorganisation, impairment and other exceptional items) of $102.8 million (2007 - $158.1 million) was generated. At the half year stage, profits of $67.5 million were in line with 2007 ($68.4 million). However, they fell below 2007 levels in the second half due to the sales decline in the fourth quarter. A
pre-exceptional operating profit of $109.9 million (2007 - $132.6 million) was delivered by the industrial thread business. While industrial profits exceeded 2007 at the half-year stage, the severe global downturn
in the second half, together with destocking in the supply chain, impacted the demand from the key apparel and footwear sectors. There was pressure on margins from plants operating at below normal utilisation due to the sales shortfall. In addition, the unprecedented volatility in costs referred to above adversely impacted profits as these could not be fully recovered through price increases in the short term. The crafts result was below expectations, with a loss overall of $7.1 million (2007 - $25.5 million profit). In the Americas, crafts sales were 2% up on 2007 and profits were broadly in line. Overall this was a good performance, given the downturn in the North American consumer environment. Profits of $34.5 million (2007 - $44.5 million) were generated from the crafts business in the Americas and Asia. In Europe, where the consumer environment was fragile, crafts sales were 11% down on 2007 levels, primarily due to the weak demand for crafts products, particularly handknittings. On a like-for-like basis, Europe crafts sales were 14% down on 2007, following a 16% like-for-like decrease reported in 2007. The severe downturn in the European crafts market led to operating losses from Coats European crafts business increasing by $22.6 million to $41.6 million. Gross margins were impacted by the rationalisation of the product offer, which resulted in stock from discontinued product ranges being sold at lower than normal margins, partly offset by some price
increases. Distribution and administration costs benefited from reorganisation projects to reduce the cost base, which are continuing, and lower advertising and marketing spend, partly offset by higher freight costs, reflecting higher oil prices during the year, and bad debt provisioning charges. The Europe crafts headcount was reduced by 15% during the year, including from major reorganisation projects in Central
Europe and Scandinavia. Further details on operating performance by region are included in the Operating review. The results for industrial and crafts as reported over the last five years provide the context for the current year’s performance. 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 External sales $m

Net debt Net debt, including amounts owed to GPG of $12.8 million (2007 - $55.0 million), finished the year at $358.8 million (2007 - $335.9 million). Excluding the EC  fine payment in the year of $27.9 million, net debt at $330.9 million was below 2007. This is after investment in new plant and systems and reorganisation projects in the year of $104.3 million. Investment Significant investment continued to be made in the year to support the business through the global downturn, to ensure that the business is well positioned and to grow market share. The capital invested in new plant and systems amounted to $53.6 million (2007 - $68.8 million). Investment in plant and equipment consisted of productivity improvement projects in Europe, including investment to support the rationalisation of the crafts business. In addition, there has been capacity expansion in Asia, although to a lesser extent than in 2007 as the focus has been on increasing the productivity of existing plant and technology. Investment continues to be made in upgrading IT systems, including the installation of SAP in all Coats units throughout the world. Reorganisation spend was $50.7 million (2007 - $44.6 million). Approximately 60% of this spend in 2008 was directed towards restructuring in Europe. This includes the major restructuring of the European crafts business, which is transforming the formerly country-based organisation each with its own product range into a more cost effective pan-European business with a single, harmonised product offer and improved supply chains, and reducing the European crafts distribution and administration cost base. This
restructuring will continue in 2009. Notwithstanding that some functions in Asia which had previously been contracted out were brought in house (resulting in a 784 decrease in contractors in that region), total numbers employed in the Group fell by 2% to 22,081 (2007 – 22,428) at the end of the year. Only 8% of industrial employees and 42% of crafts employees were in high cost countries. Reorganisation cash outflows were partly offset by $14.4 million (2007 - $25.9 million) proceeds from the sale of properties which had become surplus as a result of the Group’s reorganisation programme. European Commission Investigation Having succeeded in its initial appeal to the Court of First Instance in reducing the needles fine from €30 million to €20 million, Coats was unsuccessful in its further appeal to the European Court of Justice. The fine was paid in the course of 2008. As noted in last year’s report, in September 2007 the European Commission concluded its investigation into European fasteners – the last part outstanding of its general investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed  fines against several producers, including a  fine against the Coats plc Group of €110.3 million. The €110.3 million fine is in respect of the Commission’s allegation of a  market sharing  agreement in the European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects this allegation. During the investigation, Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted the allegation and demonstrated that, in any event, a  fine was time-barred. Coats is vigorously contesting the Commission’s decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. As stated in previous reports, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining  fine is adequately covered by existing
provisions. Prospects The present economic situation clearly holds great challenges for all businesses. The world is in economic turmoil, which makes the outcome for the next year difficult, if not altogether impossible, to predict. What is known is that the prices of many commodities and materials used by Coats
Page 184 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
have decreased and the current strength of the US dollar compared to the currencies of many of the countries Coats operates in is improving the competitiveness of these countries. In respect of the industrial business, there are no signs of improvement in consumer demand and the pressures on sales seen in the last quarter of 2008 are expected to continue in 2009. Sales in US dollar terms are also expected to show further decreases due to the weakness of local currencies in Coats’ major domestic markets. In crafts, profitability improvement in 2009 is expected, which is almost entirely dependent on Europe crafts. The European crafts market is expected to continue to decline, but benefits will flow through from the restructuring initiatives taken, including reducing the cost base. In the Americas, it is anticipated that
current sales and profit levels will be maintained. Reorganisation costs in 2009 are expected to remain broadly in line with 2008. It is expected that the Group’s tax rate will reduce as profitability in Europe improves. Gary Weiss Chairman 27 February 2009 Operating review Industrial Trading Performance

However, Coats has gained share in some Asian markets, benefiting from the investment it has made in additional production capacity and from its relationships with global suppliers and brand owners. The volatility of material prices and cost inflation put pressure on margins. Western European sales continued to be affected by customer migration from the region and, in the second half, destocking by customers as economic conditions worsened. There has also been some decline in Eastern Europe, reflecting the general market slowdown and some customer migration as cost pressures increased in this region. The Americas continued to be affected by increased penetration of apparel and footwear imports from Asia, further compounded by weak retail demand. Crafts Trading Performance

operating (loss)/profit** *2007 like-for-like restates 2007 figures at 2008 exchange rates **Pre reorganisation, impairment, and other exceptional items (see note 2) In the following comments, all comparisons with 2007 are on a like-for-like basis There has been further decline in the already weak European retail market for crafts products and sales overall were down 14% on last year. This was mainly driven by the continuing decline in the demand for handknittings. The new harmonised consumer sewings ranges have resulted in share gains in a gently declining market. Good progress has been made through the major restructuring of this business to lower the cost base, improve productivity and deliver a harmonised pan-European product offer. However, this business has a relatively high fixed-cost base and, given the severe downturn in the European crafts market, further restructuring projects are continuing in
2009 to reduce the distribution and administration cost base. Crafts results in the Americas reflect a relatively stable handknittings market in North America and strong growth in handknittings in South America, with some impact from cost pressures. Sales from the relatively new lifestyle fabrics category in North America were also strong and this will be built on in 2009. Overall this was a good performance by the region, given the downturn in the North American consumer environment. Investment income and finance costs Finance costs, net of investment income, were $22.0 million (2007 - $25.4 million). Net interest payable, after including $2.0 million (2007 - $2.4 million) of interest receivable shown in investment income, reduced from $42.0 million in 2007 to $36.2 million in 2008. Coats refinanced in June 2008 with a new main borrowing facility of $625.0 million. In addition, 2008 benefited from $3.0m lower facility fee
amortisation charges than 2007. The net return on pension scheme assets and liabilities decreased by $3.5 million to $19.6 million. Tax The tax charge was $37.8 million (2007 - $43.2 million) on pre-tax profit of
$38.3 million (2007 - $95.6 million). Excluding prior year charges of $3.8 million (2007 - $1.7 million), the tax rate was 89% for 2008 compared to 43% in the previous year. This high 2008 rate reflects unrelieved losses in certain territories, principally in Europe. It is expected that the Group’s tax rate will reduce as profitability in Europe improves. The Group has significant losses available to reduce future tax payments. Discontinued operations The $4.5 million loss in 2008 from discontinued operations largely relates to UK vacant property provisioning. The $14.6 million profit in 2007 principally relates to the sale of a UK property. Pension and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK and
there is a similar arrangement in the USA. The UK scheme continues to show a recoverable surplus, of
$10.2 million (2007 - $21.9 million) and the USA scheme also shows a recoverable surplus, of $32.6 million
(2007 – $35.0 million). These surpluses are predominantly included in non-current assets. Employer
contribution holidays for these schemes continue to be taken based on actuarial advice. There are various
pension and leaving indemnity arrangements in other countries (primarily in Europe) where the Group
operates. The vast majority of these schemes, in line with local market practice, are not funded but are fully
provided in the Group accounts and are predominantly included in current and non-current liabilities. Cash
flow EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) was $169.9
million (2007 - $225.6 million). The net operating cash flow before reorganisation costs remained strong at
$158.4 million (2007 - $190.7 million). Operating cash flow included the benefit of a $41.9 million reduction
(2007 - $3.0 million increase) in net working capital, with lower stock and debtors than at the 2007 year
end. Reorganisation spend was $50.7 million (2007 - $44.6 million). Spend on capital projects at $53.6
million was lower than in the previous year (2007 - $68.8 million), representing 0.8 times (2007 – 1.0 times)
depreciation and amortisation. Including the realisation of $14.4 million (2007 - $25.9 million) from the sale
of surplus property, reorganisation and capital spend was comfortably covered by internally generated cash
flow. Interest and tax paid was $82.4 million (2007 - $76.2 million). Net debt, including amounts owed to
GPG of $12.8 million (2007 - $55.0 million), finished the year at $358.8 million (2007 - $335.9 million).
Excluding the EC  fine payment in the year of $27.9 million, net debt at $330.9 million was below 2007.
Balance sheet Equity shareholders’ funds decreased from $517.8 million to $405.9 million, reflecting the
$8.3 million net attributable loss and losses of $103.6 million taken directly to reserves. These largely
represent exchange and actuarial losses. Exchange losses of $57.9 million (2007 - $34.3 million gains)
arose on the translation of operations with functional currencies other than the US dollar, reflecting the
strength of the US dollar at the year end. Actuarial losses of $35.1 million (2007 - $4.7 million) arose in
respect of the Group’s pension and other post-employment assets and provisions. As noted above, the
Group’s key funded defined benefit plans remain in surplus. In addition, $12.6 million (2007 - $7.0 million)
losses arose on interest rate swaps utilised for hedging purposes and carried at market value. Given the
fall in equity shareholders’ funds (largely as a consequence of exchange rate movements), net gearing
(including amounts owed to GPG) was 85% (2007 – 63%). Consolidated income statement (unaudited)

Chairman’s statement Results Although the overall reported result for the year is disappointing, much has been achieved in 2008, in what has been a very difficult year due to the unprecedented deterioration in global economic conditions, with credit constraints impacting consumers and retailers alike. The year saw oil prices peak at $140/barrel and costs of energy and commodities increase significantly. Together with a weak US dollar for much of the year and strengthening currencies in countries in which Coats has key operations (such as Brazil and Mexico), costs in US dollar terms rose significantly. Sales at the half year stage were 6% up on a buoyant 2007 and were 2% up in the third quarter. However, Coats’ industrial sales are largely driven by demand for clothing and footwear, which fell in the fourth quarter, and Coats’ total sales were 20% down on 2007 in this quarter. This, together with actions to idle plants to conserve cash, resulted in a poor fourth quarter result. Notwithstanding these conditions and a very poor result from
Europe crafts, 2008 operating profits and net debt position demonstrate Coats’ resilience and ability to generate cash in these circumstances. Despite market conditions, Coats’ competitive position and market share continued to improve as a result of the substantial investment that has been made in the last few years in the upgrading and relocation of capacity and from the significant progress in rationalising the product offer in both the industrial and crafts businesses. A pre-exceptional operating profit (before reorganisation, impairment and other exceptional items) of $102.8 million (2007 - $158.1 million) was generated. At the half year stage, profits of $67.5 million were in line with 2007 ($68.4 million). However, they fell below 2007 levels in the second half due to the sales decline in the fourth quarter. A
pre-exceptional operating profit of $109.9 million (2007 - $132.6 million) was delivered by the industrial thread business. While industrial profits exceeded 2007 at the half-year stage, the severe global downturn
in the second half, together with destocking in the supply chain, impacted the demand from the key apparel and footwear sectors. There was pressure on margins from plants operating at below normal utilisation due to the sales shortfall. In addition, the unprecedented volatility in costs referred to above adversely impacted profits as these could not be fully recovered through price increases in the short term. The crafts result was below expectations, with a loss overall of $7.1 million (2007 - $25.5 million profit). In the Americas, crafts sales were 2% up on 2007 and profits were broadly in line. Overall this was a good performance, given the downturn in the North American consumer environment. Profits of $34.5 million (2007 - $44.5 million) were generated from the crafts business in the Americas and Asia. In Europe, where the consumer environment was fragile, crafts sales were 11% down on 2007 levels, primarily due to the weak demand for crafts products, particularly handknittings. On a like-for-like basis, Europe crafts sales were 14% down on 2007, following a 16% like-for-like decrease reported in 2007. The severe downturn in the European crafts market led to operating losses from Coats European crafts business increasing by $22.6 million to $41.6 million. Gross margins were impacted by the rationalisation of the product offer, which resulted in stock from discontinued product ranges being sold at lower than normal margins, partly offset by some price
increases. Distribution and administration costs benefited from reorganisation projects to reduce the cost base, which are continuing, and lower advertising and marketing spend, partly offset by higher freight costs, reflecting higher oil prices during the year, and bad debt provisioning charges. The Europe crafts headcount was reduced by 15% during the year, including from major reorganisation projects in Central
Europe and Scandinavia. Further details on operating performance by region are included in the Operating review. The results for industrial and crafts as reported over the last five years provide the context for the current year’s performance. 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 External sales $m

Net debt Net debt, including amounts owed to GPG of $12.8 million (2007 - $55.0 million), finished the year at $358.8 million (2007 - $335.9 million). Excluding the EC  fine payment in the year of $27.9 million, net debt at $330.9 million was below 2007. This is after investment in new plant and systems and reorganisation projects in the year of $104.3 million. Investment Significant investment continued to be made in the year to support the business through the global downturn, to ensure that the business is well positioned and to grow market share. The capital invested in new plant and systems amounted to $53.6 million (2007 - $68.8 million). Investment in plant and equipment consisted of productivity improvement projects in Europe, including investment to support the rationalisation of the crafts business. In addition, there has been capacity expansion in Asia, although to a lesser extent than in 2007 as the focus has been on increasing the productivity of existing plant and technology. Investment continues to be made in upgrading IT systems, including the installation of SAP in all Coats units throughout the world. Reorganisation spend was $50.7 million (2007 - $44.6 million). Approximately 60% of this spend in 2008 was directed towards restructuring in Europe. This includes the major restructuring of the European crafts business, which is transforming the formerly country-based organisation each with its own product range into a more cost effective pan-European business with a single, harmonised product offer and improved supply chains, and reducing the European crafts distribution and administration cost base. This
restructuring will continue in 2009. Notwithstanding that some functions in Asia which had previously been contracted out were brought in house (resulting in a 784 decrease in contractors in that region), total numbers employed in the Group fell by 2% to 22,081 (2007 – 22,428) at the end of the year. Only 8% of industrial employees and 42% of crafts employees were in high cost countries. Reorganisation cash outflows were partly offset by $14.4 million (2007 - $25.9 million) proceeds from the sale of properties which had become surplus as a result of the Group’s reorganisation programme. European Commission Investigation Having succeeded in its initial appeal to the Court of First Instance in reducing the needles fine from €30 million to €20 million, Coats was unsuccessful in its further appeal to the European Court of Justice. The fine was paid in the course of 2008. As noted in last year’s report, in September 2007 the European Commission concluded its investigation into European fasteners – the last part outstanding of its general investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed  fines against several producers, including a  fine against the Coats plc Group of €110.3 million. The €110.3 million fine is in respect of the Commission’s allegation of a  market sharing  agreement in the European haberdashery market. Coats totally rejects this allegation. During the investigation, Coats presented the Commission with ample evidence which refuted the allegation and demonstrated that, in any event, a  fine was time-barred. Coats is vigorously contesting the Commission’s decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. As stated in previous reports, Coats remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining  fine is adequately covered by existing
provisions. Prospects The present economic situation clearly holds great challenges for all businesses. The world is in economic turmoil, which makes the outcome for the next year difficult, if not altogether impossible, to predict. What is known is that the prices of many commodities and materials used by Coats

have decreased and the current strength of the US dollar compared to the currencies of many of the countries Coats operates in is improving the competitiveness of these countries. In respect of the industrial business, there are no signs of improvement in consumer demand and the pressures on sales seen in the last quarter of 2008 are expected to continue in 2009. Sales in US dollar terms are also expected to show further decreases due to the weakness of local currencies in Coats’ major domestic markets. In crafts, profitability improvement in 2009 is expected, which is almost entirely dependent on Europe crafts. The European crafts market is expected to continue to decline, but benefits will flow through from the restructuring initiatives taken, including reducing the cost base. In the Americas, it is anticipated that
current sales and profit levels will be maintained. Reorganisation costs in 2009 are expected to remain broadly in line with 2008. It is expected that the Group’s tax rate will reduce as profitability in Europe improves. Gary Weiss Chairman 27 February 2009 Operating review Industrial Trading Performance

operating profit** *2007 like-for-like restates 2007 figures at 2008 exchange rates **Pre reorganisation, impairment, and other exceptional items (see note 2) In the following comments, all comparisons with 2007 are on a like-for-like basis The Asian industrial performance reflects a flat Asian apparel export sector, with currency appreciation against the US dollar during the year in many of Coats’ key Asian markets putting pressure on the competitiveness of Asian exports. However, Coats has gained share in some Asian markets, benefiting from the investment it has made in additional production capacity and from its relationships with global suppliers and brand owners. The volatility of material prices and cost inflation put pressure on margins. Western European sales continued to be affected by customer migration from the region and, in the second half, destocking by customers as economic conditions worsened. There has also been some decline in Eastern Europe, reflecting the general market slowdown and some customer migration as cost pressures increased in this region. The Americas continued to be affected by increased penetration of apparel and footwear imports from Asia, further compounded by weak retail demand. Crafts Trading Performance

operating (loss)/profit** *2007 like-for-like restates 2007 figures at 2008 exchange rates **Pre reorganisation, impairment, and other exceptional items (see note 2) In the following comments, all comparisons with 2007 are on a like-for-like basis There has been further decline in the already weak European retail market for crafts products and sales overall were down 14% on last year. This was mainly driven by the continuing decline in the demand for handknittings. The new harmonised consumer sewings ranges have resulted in share gains in a gently declining market. Good progress has been made through the major restructuring of this business to lower the cost base, improve productivity and deliver a harmonised pan-European product offer. However, this business has a relatively high fixed-cost base and, given the severe downturn in the European crafts market, further restructuring projects are continuing in
2009 to reduce the distribution and administration cost base. Crafts results in the Americas reflect a relatively stable handknittings market in North America and strong growth in handknittings in South America, with some impact from cost pressures. Sales from the relatively new lifestyle fabrics category in North America were also strong and this will be built on in 2009. Overall this was a good performance by the region, given the downturn in the North American consumer environment. Investment income and finance costs Finance costs, net of investment income, were $22.0 million (2007 - $25.4 million). Net interest payable, after including $2.0 million (2007 - $2.4 million) of interest receivable shown in investment income, reduced from $42.0 million in 2007 to $36.2 million in 2008. Coats refinanced in June 2008 with a new main borrowing facility of $625.0 million. In addition, 2008 benefited from $3.0m lower facility fee
amortisation charges than 2007. The net return on pension scheme assets and liabilities decreased by $3.5 million to $19.6 million. Tax The tax charge was $37.8 million (2007 - $43.2 million) on pre-tax profit of
$38.3 million (2007 - $95.6 million). Excluding prior year charges of $3.8 million (2007 - $1.7 million), the tax rate was 89% for 2008 compared to 43% in the previous year. This high 2008 rate reflects unrelieved losses in certain territories, principally in Europe. It is expected that the Group’s tax rate will reduce as profitability in Europe improves. The Group has significant losses available to reduce future tax payments. Discontinued operations The $4.5 million loss in 2008 from discontinued operations largely relates to UK vacant property provisioning. The $14.6 million profit in 2007 principally relates to the sale of a UK property. Pension and other post-employment benefits The Group operates a defined benefit plan in the UK and
there is a similar arrangement in the USA. The UK scheme continues to show a recoverable surplus, of
$10.2 million (2007 - $21.9 million) and the USA scheme also shows a recoverable surplus, of $32.6 million
(2007 – $35.0 million). These surpluses are predominantly included in non-current assets. Employer
contribution holidays for these schemes continue to be taken based on actuarial advice. There are various
pension and leaving indemnity arrangements in other countries (primarily in Europe) where the Group
operates. The vast majority of these schemes, in line with local market practice, are not funded but are fully
provided in the Group accounts and are predominantly included in current and non-current liabilities. Cash
flow EBITDA (defined as pre-exceptional operating profit before depreciation and amortisation) was $169.9
million (2007 - $225.6 million). The net operating cash flow before reorganisation costs remained strong at
$158.4 million (2007 - $190.7 million). Operating cash flow included the benefit of a $41.9 million reduction
(2007 - $3.0 million increase) in net working capital, with lower stock and debtors than at the 2007 year
end. Reorganisation spend was $50.7 million (2007 - $44.6 million). Spend on capital projects at $53.6
million was lower than in the previous year (2007 - $68.8 million), representing 0.8 times (2007 – 1.0 times)
depreciation and amortisation. Including the realisation of $14.4 million (2007 - $25.9 million) from the sale
of surplus property, reorganisation and capital spend was comfortably covered by internally generated cash
flow. Interest and tax paid was $82.4 million (2007 - $76.2 million). Net debt, including amounts owed to
GPG of $12.8 million (2007 - $55.0 million), finished the year at $358.8 million (2007 - $335.9 million).
Excluding the EC  fine payment in the year of $27.9 million, net debt at $330.9 million was below 2007.
Balance sheet Equity shareholders’ funds decreased from $517.8 million to $405.9 million, reflecting the
$8.3 million net attributable loss and losses of $103.6 million taken directly to reserves. These largely
represent exchange and actuarial losses. Exchange losses of $57.9 million (2007 - $34.3 million gains)
arose on the translation of operations with functional currencies other than the US dollar, reflecting the
strength of the US dollar at the year end. Actuarial losses of $35.1 million (2007 - $4.7 million) arose in
respect of the Group’s pension and other post-employment assets and provisions. As noted above, the
Group’s key funded defined benefit plans remain in surplus. In addition, $12.6 million (2007 - $7.0 million)
losses arose on interest rate swaps utilised for hedging purposes and carried at market value. Given the
fall in equity shareholders’ funds (largely as a consequence of exchange rate movements), net gearing
(including amounts owed to GPG) was 85% (2007 – 63%). Consolidated income statement (unaudited)

The charge for the year in respect of the Group’s defined contribution arrangements was £6 million (2007: £5 million).
The Group operates three significant defined benefit schemes in the UK , namely the
Brunel Holdings Pension Scheme (“Brunel”),
the Staveley Industries Retirement Benefits Scheme (“SIRBS”) and the
Coats Pension Plan (“Coats UK”) which offer both pensions
in retirement and death benefits to members. In addition, Coats operates the Coats North America Pension Plan (“Coats US”) in
the US as well as various pension and other post-employment arrangements around the globe (most significantly in Germany).

Pension Costs - continued The following disclosures are made solely for the purposes of IAS 19 – Employee benefits and do not include information in respect of schemes operated by associated undertakings and joint ventures. The Group has opted for all of the plans it operates to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense (“SORIE”). Full actuarial valuations of each scheme have been updated to 31 December 2008 by qualified independent actuaries. The major assumptions used by the actuaries were (in nominal terms) as follows:

The estimated contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during 2009 is £8 million. 11. (Loss)/earnings per Ordinary Share Basic (loss)/earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the (loss)/earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent company of £50 million (2007: earnings of £129 million) by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year of 1,412,703,249 (2007: 1,396,110,347). For the calculation of diluted EPS, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares, being share options granted to employees and Capital Notes.

Goodwill impairment comprises the write-off of all goodwill in each of Capral (£37 million) and Gosford Quarry Holdings (£8 million), following re-assessment of estimated future operating cashflows in the light of poor trading conditions. Contained within brands at 31 December 2008 is a balance of £183 million (2007: £134 million) which has been assessed as having an indefinite useful life. The recoverable amount of these brands has been estimated using the value in use and is re-assessed annually by reference to
the discounted cash flow arising from the royalties generated by those brands. The valuation has been based on management’s recent budgets and forecasts covering the period to 31 December 2011, applying a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the relevant business unit and a terminal value including no growth. The pre-tax weighted average costs of capital applied above are in the range of 12.5

Credit risk is minimised as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers. An allowance has been made for estimated
irrecoverable amounts on trade receivables of £16 million (2007: £15 million). This allowance has been determined by reference
to past default experience, and the movements in the allowance are analysed as follows:

All the capital notes are issued by GPG Finance plc (“the Issuer”). During the year, the scheduled election date occurred for the capital notes issued in 2003. Noteholders elected not to roll-over NZ$138 million of these notes and consequently the Company re-purchased them and they were cancelled by the Issuer. The remaining NZ$77 million were rolled over to become the 2008 capital notes (“2008 Notes”). The 2008
Notes bear interest at 9% per annum. The other outstanding issue of capital notes was made in 2006, raising NZ$350 million and bearing interest at a rate of 8.3% per annum (“2006 Notes”). The issue costs for the 2006 Notes amounted to NZ$6 million, and these costs are being charged to the income statement

over the initial six year term of the debt. At 31 December 2008 the unamortised balance of these costs was NZ$3.8 million.

The 2006 Notes have an initial election date of 15 November 2012, prior to which the Issuer will provide terms and conditions on
which noteholders may elect to roll over their 2006 Notes. Noteholders may then elect to retain some or all of their 2006 Notes
for a further period on the new terms and conditions and/or to convert some or all of their 2006 Notes into Ordinary Shares.
Conversion of the 2006 Notes would be at a price of 97% of the weighted average sale price of an Ordinary Share on each of the
five business days prior to the election date. These elections are subject to GPG’s over-riding right (at its option) to purchase for
cash some or all of the 2006 Notes for their principal amount, together with any accrued interest and unpaid interest. In addition
the Company has the right in certain circumstances to purchase for cash some or all of the holder’s 2006 Notes paying the
principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest and a premium which reduces over the life of the 2006 Notes.
The 2008 Notes have an initial election date of 15 December 2013, prior to which the Issuer will provide terms and conditions on
which noteholders may elect to roll over their 2008 Notes. Noteholders may then elect to retain some or all of their 2008 Notes
for a further period on the new terms and conditions and/or to convert some or all of their 2008 Notes into GPG Ordinary Shares.
Conversion of the 2008 Notes would be at a price of 97% of the weighted average sale price of a GPG Ordinary Share on each of
the five business days prior to the election date. These elections are subject to GPG’s over-riding right (at its option) to purchase
for cash some or all of the 2008 Notes for their principal amount, together with any accrued interest and unpaid interest. In
addition, the Issuer or GPG may purchase for cash some or all of the 2008
Notes at any time on giving not less than 180 days’
notice and paying the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued interest and unpaid interest.
GPG has provided subordinated and unsecured guarantees contingent on liquidation of the Issuer or of the Company itself in
respect of the repayment of principal and the payment of interest and unpaid interest due on the 2006 and 2008 Notes. In the
event that the Issuer is in liquidation and the Company is not, these guarantees are only enforceable after the scheduled election
dates for the 2006 and 2008 Notes which next follows the liquidation of the Issuer. These guarantees are subordinated to all
other creditors.

£0.1 billion (2007: £0.1 billion) of such losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £1.2 billion (2007: £0.6 billion) due to lack of certainty regarding the availability of future taxable income. Such losses are only recognised in the financial statements to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that sufficient future taxable profits will be available for offset. At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £313 million (2007:
£259 million). No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 28. Provisions

28. Provisions - continued
In September 2007 the
European  Commission concluded its investigation into European fasteners – the last part of its general
investigation into thread and haberdashery markets which began in 2001. It imposed fines against several producers, including a
fine against the Coats plc Group of e110.3 million. This fine is in respect of the Commission’s allegation of a market  sharing
agreement in the European haberdashery market.Coats totally rejects this allegation.During the investigation, Coats presented the
Commission with ample evidence which refuted this allegation and demonstrated that, in any event, a fine was time-barred.Coats is
vigorously contesting the Commission’s decision in an appeal which has been lodged with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.

Having succeeded in its initial appeal to the Court of First Instance in reducing the needles  fine from e30 million to e20 million,
Coats was unsuccessful in its further appeal to the European Court of
Justice. This fine was paid in the course of 2008.
As in previous years, the Group remains of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the remaining fine is adequately
covered by the existing provision. The Directors believe that disclosure of additional information regarding this provision could be
expected to seriously prejudice the Group’s position, and consequently a number of the Group’s provisions have been disclosed
in aggregate as “provisions” in accordance with paragraph 92 of IAS 37. Subject to full resolution of the matters giving rise to this
provision, a full analysis will be provided in the relevant future financial statements.

Super options are normally exercisable after five years from date of grant. Options exercised during the year comprised 1,800,588 under the 1992 scheme and Nil under the 1994, 2001 and 2002 schemes (all adjusted for the 2008 Capitalisation Issue). No options lapsed during the year. Options granted before 13
December 2002 (the effective date of the reverse acquisition of Brunel Holdings plc) were over shares in GPG (UK) Holdings plc (“GPGUKH”) which changed its name from Guinness Peat Group plc as a result of the reverse acquisition. Options granted since that date are over shares of Guinness Peat Group plc (“GPG”).

Notes to Financial Statements – continued
30. Share Capital - continued
Following the reverse acquisition, certain option holders ‘rolled over’
their rights and thus became entitled to exercise their options
directly into ordinary shares of GPG. As a result of the Step-up Rights contained in GPGUKH’s Articles of Association, the remaining
option holders will receive GPG shares instead of GPGUKH shares, initially on a one-for-one basis, as an automatic consequence
of exercise.
Since the year end, options under the 1992 Scheme have been exercised over 3,968,363 shares, and options under the 1994
Scheme have been exercised over 25,934 shares.

GPG is a strategic investment holding company and it, together with certain of its subsidiaries, is principally involved in managing
a portfolio of cash and investments. The profile of the Group’s financial assets, and in particular the relative balance between cash
and investments, varies during the year depending on the timing of purchases and sales of investments. The currency profile of
the Group’s financial assets is similarly affected by the timing of investment transactions, and tends to vary during the year.
The Group’s main financial instruments comprise: Financial assets:
–   cash and cash equivalents;
–  trade and other receivables that arise directly from the Group’s operations;
–  investments in equity shares with both UK and international exposure. These investments are held as either current or
non-current asset investments; and
–  derivatives, including forward foreign currency contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, contracts for
differences, equity swaps and equity options.

Investments are held for strategic growth or trading purposes. Market values have been used to derive the fair value of all listed
investments and the Capital Notes. Unlisted investments are stated at fair value. For floating rate financial assets and liabilities,
and for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than three months, it has been assumed that fair values are
approximately the same as book values. Fair values for forward foreign currency contracts have been estimated using applicable
forward exchange rates at the year end. The fair values of the equity options, equity swaps and the forward foreign currency
contracts have been determined by third party institutions, based on market rates. All other fair values have been calculated by
discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
Gains and losses on forward foreign currency contracts used for hedging future transactions are not recognised in the income
statement until the exposure to which they relate is itself recognised. Such gains and losses are incorporated in the value of the
transaction being hedged.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are as follows:
–   currency risk;
–   interest rate risk;
–   capital risk;
–   market price risk;
–   liquidity risk; and
–   credit risk.
The Group’s policies for managing those risks are described below and, except as noted below, have remained unchanged since
the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate. GUINNESS               PEAT        GROUP          PLC           55
40. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments - continued CURRENCY RISK The income and capital
value of the Group’s financial instruments can be affected by exchange rate movements as a significant
portion of its financial assets (principally cash and investments) and financial liabilities is denominated in
currencies other than Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. The accounting impact of
these exposures will vary according to whether or not the Group company holding such financial assets
and liabilities reports in the currency in which they are denominated. The Board recognises that the
Group’s Sterling balance sheet will be affected by short term movements in exchange rates, particularly
the value of the Australian, New Zealand and United States dollars. The Board takes the view that the
major currencies in which the Group is invested move within a relatively stable range and that currency
fluctuations should even out over the long term. The Group’s policy is to hold over time a broad balance of
cash and investments in Sterling, Australian dollars and US dollars, being the three currencies in which it
mainly invests. At certain times, the Board will make limited use of forward foreign currency contracts and
swaps to maintain the Group’s relative exposure to the Australian and United States dollars. These
contracts tend to have a maturity of less than three months. Otherwise, the distribution of the Group’s net
assets between the principal currencies in which it does business is driven largely by the availability of
suitable investment opportunities within each country. Coats, Staveley Inc., Capral and T & G use forward
foreign currency contracts to mitigate the currency exposure that arises on business transacted in
currencies other than their own functional currencies. These companies only enter into such foreign
currency contracts when there is a firm commitment to the transaction. The contracts used to hedge future
transactions typically have a maturity of between 6 months and 2 years. INTEREST RATE RISK In 2008,
the Group financed its operations through shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings, commercial bills, and the
Capital Notes. The Capital Notes carry fixed interest rates. The Group’s trading subsidiaries use a mixture
of fixed and floating rate debt. The Group also has access to bank facilities amounting to some £746
million, of which £404 million had been drawn down at year- end. This includes facilities negotiated by
certain trading subsidiaries to meet their local needs. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining an
appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings using interest rate swap contracts. Hedging
activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and risk appetite. The Group’s interest
income does not vary significantly from the returns it would generate through investing surplus cash at
floating rates of interest since the interest rates are re-set on a regular basis. A one per cent. rise in
market interest rates would increase profit before tax by approximately £2 million (2007: £2 million), and
would increase shareholders’ funds by approximately £6 million (2007: £4 million). Trade and other
receivables and trade and other payables are excluded from the following disclosure (other than the
Page 276 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
currency disclosures) as there is limited interest rate risk. CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group manages its capital so as to ensure that the Company and the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, whilst being able to take advantage of opportunities that arise and which are expected to provide profitable returns for shareholders. The Group’s capital structure comprises cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, and share capital and reserves attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company.

CURRENCY EXPOSURE
The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have financial assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
functional currency excluding forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps held as hedges. Foreign
exchange differences arising on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the Group income statement. The table
excludes loans between Group companies that form part of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries on which the exchange
differences are dealt with through reserves, but includes other Group balances that eliminate on consolidation. It also excludes
investments held in equity shares, which are included in the Currency and
Interest Rate Profile of Financial Assets table below.

The investments included above comprise listed and unlisted investments in shares. Deposits of £358 million (2007: £317 million) which have been placed on deposit with banks for a variety of fixed periods, not exceeding three months, earn available market rates based on LIBID equivalents and are for these purposes classified as floating rate cash balances. The Group’s investment portfolio principally comprises equity shares. All such investments have been excluded from the interest rate analysis because the
investments do not have a fixed entitlement to interest. CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The currency and interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities was as follows:

MARKET PRICE RISK
The Group can be affected by market price movements on its equity investments. Since it generally invests for the medium or
long term, the Board does not believe it is economic or necessary to hedge market price risk, which in any event it considers
to be a relatively short term factor. No significant equity investment is made without exhaustive research and unless a margin of
safety has been identified. Once a significant investment has been made, the investment is continually monitored and managed
in the light of new information or market movements. As an active investor, the Group’s objective is to utilise shareholder
influence to enhance the value of its investments and therefore, ultimately, their price. Exposure to price movement is further
mitigated through holding a spread of investments, diversified across a range of sectors and countries.
Equity swaps, equity options and contracts for differences are purchased from time to time as part of the Group’s investment
portfolio. These derivatives do not form a significant proportion of the portfolio, and are subject to the same rigorous research
procedures as other equity investments.
The Group is also exposed to price risks arising from bond investments. GUINNESS               PEAT    GROUP           PLC              59

LIQUIDITY RISK Most of the Group’s investments are listed on a recognised stock exchange and so
could be converted into cash or liquid resources at short notice. In addition, the Group typically holds cash
balances in deposits with a short maturity, and further resources can be drawn through committed
borrowing facilities. In managing liquidity, the Group’s objective is to ensure it has access to the funds
needed to take advantage of any attractive investment opportunities that may arise. During the year the
Group has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements. The Group had the following
undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the
year-end.

HEDGES
During 2008, the Group has hedged the following exposures:
– interest rate risk – using interest rate swaps
– currency risk – using forward foreign currency contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2008, the fair value of such hedging instruments was £Nil
(2007: £Nil).

The options outstanding at 31 December 2008 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.8 years (2007: 7.5 years). The weighted average fair value of share options at the measurement date for options granted during the year was 12.0p (2007: 16.7p). These fair values were calculated using a stochastic valuation model based on the methodology underlying the Black-Scholes model, projecting forward the Company share price using the Black-Scholes model and calculating the value earned when the options are exercised and discounting this back to the calculation date. The assumptions in the model are as follows:

Volatility                                                         20% per annum

Dividend growth*                                                   10% per annum

* to allow for the annual 1-for-10 Capitalisation Issues. The Directors have set the volatility assumption after analysing the historic volatility of the Group share price and taking account of the current levels of equity market volatility. To allow for the effects of early exercise it was assumed that in each simulation the options were exercised as soon as they were “in the money”and these values were averaged to get the overall price. The Group recognised total expenses of £2 million related to equity-settled share-based payments in the year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: £2 million).

Corporate Governance
COMPLIANCE
The Board has put in place corporate governance arrangements which it believes are appropriate for the operation of an
international strategic investment holding company. These arrangements are long established and have served the Company
well so the Board does not seek actively to alter such arrangements merely to ensure adherence with the best practice

recommendations made by regulators from time to time. As a result, GPG
complies with Section 1 of the 2006 Combined Code
referred to in the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services Authority
(“the Code”) where it is beneficial for its business to do so
but, as noted below, it does not fully comply with the Code, or its equivalent in Australia. This position is regularly reviewed and
monitored by the Board. BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board consists of the Chairman,
Sir Ron Brierley, who is a non executive director, and three executive directors.Short biographies
of each of the directors appear on page 6.The Chairman is remunerated by way of share options and although he receives no salary
or directors’fees he is eligible to participate in the staff bonus scheme. He is not appointed for a specified term but, in accordance
with the Company’s Articles of Association, retires by rotation.With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, the
Company is governed by reference to its Articles of Association, the
Code, the Companies Act and related legislation.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Sir Ron Brierley will retire by rotation at the conclusion of the 2009 Annual General
Meeting and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
The Board is responsible for the management of the Group’s assets and operations. The executive directors manage such assets
and operations on a day-to-day basis and are in frequent contact with each other. The executive directors are situated in the UK,
Australia and New Zealand but they have put in place suitable communication and reporting systems which enable them to
have, on a timely basis, a clear appreciation and measure of the Group’s investment activities.
As a consequence of the continuous and detailed evaluation of the Group’s investment activities by the directors, meetings of
the Board tend to be less formal than in companies where the majority of the Board is in one time zone and have separate areas
of responsibility. Instead the Board comes together over a period of days at least three times a year to discuss new or existing
investment matters. These informal meetings will often in due course lead to formal Board meetings to agree and to record
decisions. In this way the Group’s assets are both carefully evaluated before an investment is made and regularly thereafter. In
addition, there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board’s approval.
During the year, the Board met formally on 8 occasions. Sir Ron Brierley and Tony Gibbs attended 6 of those meetings, Graeme
Cureton 5, Blake Nixon 8 and Gary Weiss 7.
The Company has a procedure in place by which directors can seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense if
the need arises. GPG provides certain protections for directors and officers of companies within the Group against personal financial
exposure that they may incur in the course of their professional duties. GPG does not have a ‘senior independent non-executive
director’but all the directors are available to shareholders. Given the geographic distribution of the Company’s shareholders, who
are substantially in New Zealand, the UK and Australia, it is expected that shareholders in those countries will normally speak to their
locally-based director if they cannot speak to the Chairman.There is no formal evaluation method in respect of the Board, nor any
individual director’s performance. No statement to the Board confirming the Company’s financial condition, operational results, risk
management or internal compliance and control systems, as envisaged by
ASX Recommendations 7.3, is considered necessary as all
of the directors are extensively involved in the process of the preparation of the Company’s financial reports.
The interests of the directors, including connected persons, in the share capital of the Company and its subsidiaries are set out

in the Report on Remuneration and Related Matters below. No director, either during or at the end of the year under review, was
interested in any material contract (not being a contract of employment)
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries nor has become so interested since the year end. INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board has overall responsibility for GPG’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The internal controls
are designed to cover material risks to achieving the Group’s objectives and include business, operational, financial and
compliance risks. These controls have been in place throughout the year for GPG and its principal subsidiaries and have
continued in force up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. The internal controls are designed to identify, evaluate and
manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to meet business objectives and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance
against material misstatement or loss. The system is regularly reviewed by the Board, and except as described below, accords with

PEAT       GROUP           PLC             63
GUINNESS

the guidance of the Turnbull Committee issued to companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The internal control process distinguishes between the Parent Group (being the long term structural entities within the Group which hold GPG’s investments), the Operating Subsidiaries and the Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures. The systems operated both at Parent Group and Operating Subsidiary levels are reviewed annually by GPG and the results of these reviews are reported to the Audit Committee and to the Board by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. The Board is satisfied that these systems are operating effectively in all material respects in relation to financial reporting risks. Parent Group The identification and consequent management of risk for the Parent Group is an inherent feature in the investment evaluation process. The principal risk identified is market price risk. The investment evaluation process and its relationship to market risk is described in note 40 to the financial statements, particularly
on page 58. For GPG’s investment activities, information systems are in place to provide directors with a weekly report on cash movements, investment transactions, portfolio holdings and market values. This provides the Board with up to date information enabling them to monitor and review the progress of investment strategies. In addition to the control procedures referred to above, certain other key control procedures are in force at the Parent Group level, such as ensuring that investments are effected at a
local level under the supervision of the relevant local director, ensuring that Board approval is obtained for any investment in excess of £2 million, holding documents of title either within the Parent Group or by a reputable custodian and centralising the settlement of all transactions at the London office. Investments The Operating Subsidiaries,being discrete entities acquired by the Parent Group as investments,have
their own boards of directors who operate and control these businesses independently. As at 31
December 2008, the Group had four major Operating Subsidiaries of which one was wholly owned and
the remainder partly owned. All are involved in activities other than strategic investment. In aggregate, the
Group’s share of the consolidated net assets (including goodwill but excluding Group loans) of the
Operating Subsidiaries (“Group Share”) represents some 52% of GPG’s shareholders’funds of £878
million. At least one GPG director or senior executive is appointed to the board of each of these Operating
Subsidiaries. He is charged with ensuring that the appropriate resources are committed by such
Operating Subsidiary to respond to the requirements of the Code on a basis which in each case is
commensurate with GPG’s Group Share, and that material risks to the value of that investment are
managed. Each Operating Subsidiary’s board has been notified of its responsibilities for identifying key
business risks appropriate to its own business sector and establishing appropriate and relevant control
and compliance procedures. They are also required to acknowledge that they are responsible for their
internal control systems. Coats is by far the Company’s largest Operating Subsidiary (Group Share £307
million). All of GPG’s executive directors sit on the Coats Board and its internal controls are therefore
carefully monitored. Canberra Investment Corporation (“CIC”) (Group Share £29 million) and Capral
(Group Share £44 million) are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, and Turner & Growers
(“T&G”) (Group Share £62 million) is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange: hence these companies
have prime reporting responsibilities to a recognised exchange, whose rules are similar to, but not the
same as, those of The London Stock Exchange. However, it may be that certain of these companies’
control procedures, whilst deemed sufficient by the GPG Board to identify, manage and control the
principal risks to its investments, differ from the more strictly defined requirements of the guidance of the
Code. The Board of GPG has reviewed and accepted the annual reports on internal controls submitted by
CIC, Capral and T&G during the year. The Board also reviews and monitors the internal controls
procedures of its Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures. The Board of GPG is satisfied that each of
its Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures has satisfactory procedures to identify, monitor and
control its major risks, commensurate with the relevant Group Share. At least one GPG director or senior
Page 285 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
executive is appointed to the board of each of its Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures. This enables him to review the investee company’s procedures for dealing with major risks. The Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures are encouraged to review the effectiveness of their own internal controls, but the Group is not able to enforce this and as such Associated Undertakings and Joint Ventures are not normally requested to complete an internal control review each year. Guidance issued by the Financial Services Authority obliges the directors of public companies to consider the need for internal audit. The Board reviews the position annually and considers that the Parent Group is not sufficiently large or
complex to justify a centralised internal audit function. Coats, Capral and T&G consider their operations to be sufficiently widespread to justify their own internal audit functions, and such internal audit functions and the internal audit reports they produce are made available to the Board of GPG.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Commentary on GPG’s key performance indicators (“KPIs”) is included in the Directors’ Report on page 6. GPG does not produce
KPIs dealing with health and safety or environmental matters, but does monitor these areas in relation to its major subsidiaries.
In respect of health and safety, Coats monitors performance by reference to a USA standard measure: the global rate of
reportable incidents was reduced in 2008 compared to 2007. Coats continues to operate an environmental management
programme focusing on the prevention of environmental incidents and ensuring compliance with the Restricted Substances
List. As in 2007, there were no reportable environmental incidents. Coats aims for environmental management systems
consistent with IS014000.
Each of the sites Capral operates must comply with very extensive and detailed Australian regulations both in terms of health
and safety and environmental matters. Its Safety Indicators continue to demonstrate a reduction in frequency of reportable
incidents since 1 January 2005. Capral confirms that all applications for, and renewals of, licences have been granted and all
required consents have been given by relevant authorities in Australia. T&G operates in compliance with best practice in New Zealand in relation
to environmental and employee matters. The company
also monitors incidents under the New Zealand Occupational Safety & Health Regulations.
SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
In May 2008, GPG held an Annual General Meeting in London. The level of proxies lodged for each resolution was announced
following the meeting. In its annual and interim reports and other corporate announcements, GPG endeavours to present an
accurate, objective and balanced picture in a style and format which is appropriate for the intended audience.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has set up an Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee to assist in the execution of its duties. These committees
operate on written terms of reference which are reviewed regularly and the outcome of such committee meetings are reported to
the Board. Each of the committees is authorised, at GPG’s expense, to obtain external legal or other professional advice to assist in
carrying out its duties.The small size of the Board of directors and the fact that they take direct responsibility for all significant
matters affecting GPG, including the appointment of other directors
(should such requirement arise), make the establishment of a
formal procedure for new appointments or a Nomination Committee unnecessary notwithstanding the requirements of the Code.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Blake Nixon, who chairs the committee, and, following his appointment on 25 February 2009,
David Wadsworth BSc (Econ), BA, FCA an independent member. These two members provide the required competence and

Page 286 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
experience in accounting and auditing matters. The Board considers that given the direct participation by all members of the
Board in the operation, structure and financial control of GPG the composition of the Audit Committee is sufficient to ensure the
integrity of GPG’s financial reporting and controls, even though it does not comply with the membership provisions of the Code.
The Audit Committee’s written terms of reference are available for inspection at the GPG London, Sydney and Auckland offices.
The Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and reviewing significant
financial reporting judgements contained therein. It is responsible for making recommendations on the engagement of the
Company’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP.
The Committee is satisfied that its policy on the supply of non-audit services by the Company’s auditor, Deloitte LLP, ensures that
audit objectivity and independence are safeguarded.
The Committee met four times in 2008 in order to discharge its duties under its terms of reference.
“Whistleblower” procedures exist within the major Operating Subsidiaries and the Parent Group.

Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists of Sir Ron Brierley, who chairs the Committee, Blake Nixon and Gary Weiss. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. The Board considers that Sir Ron Brierley has qualities which are sufficient to ensure the integrity and independence of the Remuneration Committee in fulfilling its duties, even though it does not comply with the membership provisions of the Code. The Remuneration Committee’s written terms of reference are available for inspection at the GPG London, Sydney and Auckland offices. The role of the Remuneration Committee is to monitor, review and set GPG’s remuneration policy as set out in the Report on Remuneration and Related Matters on pages 65 to 67. The Committee met once in 2008 in order to discharge its duties under its terms of reference. GOING CONCERN Giving due consideration to the nature of the Group’s business and underlying investments as a whole, including the financial resources available to the Group, the directors consider that the Company and the Group are a going concern and the financial statements are prepared on that basis. The directors of one of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings, Capral, whilst noting that there are significant uncertainties, concluded that it was appropriate to prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis. In reaching their view on going concern, the directors of GPG considered the six categories of risk described in more detail in note 40 to the financial statements. REPORT ON REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors and also related matters such as directors’
interests in shares. It therefore covers issues which are the concern of the Board as a whole, in addition to those dealt with by the Remuneration Committee. Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that remuneration and benefit levels should be sufficiently competitive, having regard to remuneration practice in the industry and the countries in which the Group invests, to attract, incentivise, reward and retain the directors. Each of the executive directors has a contract of service with the Company. These agreements provide for a rolling 12 months’ notice period to be given by the director and are terminable by the Company on giving 18 months’ notice. In the case of early termination by the Company, the director would receive compensation based on the unexpired portion of his notice period. In the event of a change in control, the agreements entitle each director to compensation of two years’ remuneration if he elects to leave within 6 months. (Similar arrangements, on reduced periods, are in
place for certain senior officers of the Company). GPG’s Remuneration Committee considers that it is necessary to offer such rolling contracts and notice periods in order to retain, motivate and in the future recruit individuals of the right calibre and to ensure continuity of the Group’s management. The make-up
of directors’ remuneration varies according to geographical location and the nature of the appointment but includes:

•   Annual benefits: including a competitive basic salary, directors’ fees as appropriate, health and car benefits and life assurance.
Directors are also entitled to performance-related cash bonuses (see below);
•   Long Service Leave based on one month’s leave for every five years worked, applied on a pro-rata basis;
•   Payment for holidays interrupted, curtailed or not taken;
•   Pension contributions: see the Notes below the following table;

Page 287 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
•   Long term incentives: directors are entitled to receive awards of options under the Group’s share option schemes; and
•   Staff bonus scheme: directors are eligible to participate in a non-contractual bonus scheme, under which cash bonuses may
be paid to all staff in the GPG Parent Group. No such bonus will be payable in respect of any year when net profits
attributable to GPG shareholders do not achieve a 12.5% realised return on adjusted IFRS opening shareholders’ funds,
as further adjusted for share issues during the year. If this target is achieved a bonus pool is established by the Remuneration
Committee with reference to profit and the return on shareholders’ funds. There is no ceiling on the bonuses payable to
directors. This scheme is operated in order to remain competitive, having regard to performance bonuses paid by
international investment funds and companies comparable to GPG.

Notes i) Overseas directors’ emoluments, which are paid in local currency, have been translated at the relevant year-end exchange rate. ii) Share options are awarded to directors in accordance with the terms of the Group’s share option schemes, the terms of

which have been approved by shareholders. The Company does not operate any other long term incentive schemes.
It is felt that the grant of options is more appropriate since this contains an element of reward for individual achievement
together with an incentive allied to the Group’s longer term performance. The approach also aligns management’s interests
with those of shareholders. Awards are made in most years in the context of the Group’s recent trading performance, the
individual’s contribution to that performance and his expected performance and contribution in the future. In addition,
awards are calculated having regard to the individual’s existing holdings. Directors are not required to hold their shares for
a further period following exercise of their options.
iii) All executive directors are entitled to direct that a variable amount of their total salary, as determined by the Remuneration
Committee each year, be paid by way of contribution to any pension arrangement which they may establish for the purpose.
iv) All pension contributions are in respect of defined contribution arrangements.
v) Of their total salary, as determined by the Remuneration Committee each year, directors are entitled to direct that a variable
amount be paid in a form other than cash.
vi) Where directors are required by GPG to act as a director of an investee company outside the Parent Group, it is the Group’s

Page 289 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
policy that director’s fees from such entities are paid directly to the
Group.
vii) The tables set out above, and these notes, comprise the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report, being the
disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The directors are required to prepare
financial statements for the Group in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (IFRSs)
and have elected to prepare financial statements for the Company in accordance with UK GAAP. Company law requires the
directors to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Resolution.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other
events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set
out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. Directors are also
required to:

Page 295 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
• select and apply accounting policies properly;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’
report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Pursuant to section 234 ZA of the Companies Act 1985, each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this
Annual Report confirms that:
• so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditor is not aware; and
• he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the business review, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Independent Auditors’ Report INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GUINNESS PEAT GROUP PLC We have audited the group and individual company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Guinness Peat Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and individual company balance sheets, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 41. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is
described as having been audited. This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the group financial statements
Page 296 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing the individual company financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether, in addition, the group financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the annual report. Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.

Independent Auditors’ Report – continued
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its loss for the year then ended;
•  the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation;
•  the individual company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the individual company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
•  the individual company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
•  the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – uncertainty relating to the amount of a potential liability arising from a
European  Commission
investigation
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the disclosures made in note 28 to the financial statements concerning the

Page 297 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
European  Commission competition investigation into alleged market  sharing
agreements relating to the European haberdashery
market. In September 2007, the European  Commission imposed a fine of
C110.3 million (equivalent to £106.6 million at year-
end exchange rates) in relation to these allegations, against which Coats plc has lodged an appeal. Significant uncertainty
surrounds the ultimate outcome of this matter. The directors are of the view that any anticipated eventual payment of the
remaining fine is adequately covered by the existing provision.

Explanatory Note in respect of Resolutions 6 to 11 a) Resolution 6 Under section 80 of the Companies Act
1985 (“the Act”) the Directors are not permitted to allot shares (or other relevant securities such as rights
to subscribe for, or convert securities into, GPG ordinary shares) unless they are authorised to do so by
the Company’s shareholders in general meeting. This resolution, if passed, renews and increases the
Page 300 of 304 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Directors’ authority (given by shareholders at the 2008 AGM) to allot shares and other relevant securities for up to 5 years subject to the maximum amount set out in the resolution, and is consistent with the level commonly proposed by other UK listed companies. The figure of £23,712,885 is equivalent to one-third of the current issued share capital. b) Resolution 7 This resolution, if passed, enables the Directors to carry out the proposed 1:10 capitalisation (“bonus”) issue in respect of all those shares issued and registered
on the Company’s share registers on the relevant Record Date. It is in similar terms to the authority given by shareholders at previous annual general meetings. c) Resolution 8 In accordance with the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association, this resolution, if passed, enables the Directors for up to 5 years to offer a Scrip Dividend Alternative (“SDA”) without the need to seek shareholders’approval on each occasion an SDA is proposed. It extends by approximately one year the 5-year authority granted by shareholders in 2008. d) Resolution 9 This resolution is to enable the Directors to allot shares either for a rights issue to existing shareholders or (up to the specified amount) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders exactly in proportion to their existing shareholdings (which would otherwise be required under UK statutory pre-emption rights contained in section 95 of the Act). This resolution, if passed, renews and increases the Directors’ authority (given by shareholders at the 2008 AGM) for up to
5 years to allot shares and other equity securities for cash, in appropriate circumstances, subject to the maximum amount set out in the resolution, and is consistent with the level commonly proposed by other UK listed companies. The maximum amount is 5% of the current issued share capital. e) Resolution 10
This resolution, if passed, renews and increases the authority (given by shareholders at the 2008 AGM) to allow the Company to re-purchase up to 213,273,695 ordinary shares representing approximately 15% of the current total issued share capital of the Company and again the proposed level is consistent with that commonly adopted by other UK listed companies. f ) Resolution 11 At last year’s Annual General Meeting, new articles of association were adopted which include a provision allowing general meetings of the Company to be called on the minimum notice period provided for in the Companies Act 2006. For general meetings other than AGMs the minimum notice period permitted by the Companies Act 2006 is currently
14 days. The 2006 Act provisions relating to meetings are due to be amended with effect from August
2009, as a result of the UK implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive. One of the
amendments to be made will, in accordance with the Directive, increase the minimum notice period for
listed company general meetings to 21 days, but with an ability for companies to reduce this period back
to 14 days (other than for AGMs) provided that two conditions are met. The first condition is that the
Company offers facilities for shareholders to vote by electronic means and this will be subject to regulation
by the UK Government when it implements the Directive. The second condition is that there is an annual
resolution of shareholders approving the reduction in the minimum notice period from 21 days to14 days.
The board is therefore proposing Resolution 11 as a special resolution to approve 14 days as the
minimum period of notice for all general meetings of the Company other than AGMs. The approval will be
effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is proposed that the approval be renewed. All references
to ‘days’ in this paragraph shall be interpreted as ‘clear days’.

8    As at the date of this Annual Report, the Company has 1,422,773,154
Ordinary Shares in issue, carrying one vote each.

9   In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting
so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with
instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that
shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and
the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more
than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder
has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will
be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate
representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative.
10  A copy of this notice has been sent for information only to persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy
information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (a
“Nominated Person”). The right to appoint a proxy
cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person: they can only be exercised by the member.
