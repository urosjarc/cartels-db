SUMMARY

Germany has an independent judiciary and a fair legal system which is not open to political interference. Contracts can be enforced and the judicial system is reasonably efficient, if sometimes slow. There is extremely little risk of expropriation, but there is some regulatory risk in the field of utilities, notably telecommunications. Intellectual property protection is good and improving. German accounting practices are increasingly being replaced by international accounting standards. The Bundeskartellamt, which oversees the application of competition rules, has a well established reputation for being impartial. However, it can be over- ruled by the economics minister if national interests are considered to be involved.
ANALYSIS
* There is foot-dragging on the liberalisation of utilities (Moderate risk).

In recent years, there has been substantial liberalisation of the telecommunications and, to a lesser extent, energy markets; a reversal of these reforms is very unlikely, but there is a risk that still necessary
regulatory measures to complete market liberalisation will be delayed. The government is now planning to establish an energy regulator, but it will probably take some time to become effective. In postal and telecommunications markets, there are concerns that the government plans to sell its remaining shares in its former national monopolies and so has an interest in boosting their share prices, which would be negatively affected by better regulation improving the position of competitors. In view of the dire financial situation of  Deutsche Telekom, which is still partly state-owned, there has been a deceleration in the opening of the telecommunications sector after lobbying on the part of  Deutsche Telekom. Competitors of former national utilities should take this bias into account in their planning.
* The government obstructs foreign takeovers of German companies (Moderate risk).
Germany has blocked a proposed EU takeover directive banning certain forms of protection against
hostile takeovers. There is considerable concern, both in the general public and among politicians on both
sides of the political divide, about hostile foreign bids for German companies, particularly in the media

sector. Foreign companies interested in taking over German firms and creating cross-EU businesses in sensitive sectors will require extensive legal advice.
BACKGROUND Enforceability of Contracts
Contractual arrangements are secure in Germany, and the courts and judicial system have a high degree of respect for commercial law and private contracts. Firms encounter few problems enforcing contracts although legal costs can be high.
Independence of the Judiciary

Both the judiciary and the civil service are highly professional. The courts are decentralised, reflecting the country's federal system, with separate supreme courts to deal with cases on commercial, tax, labour and constitutional issues. There is no question as to the independence of the judiciary.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

The German government welcomes foreign investment that provides new jobs. There are no real limitations on new foreign investments and no permanent currency or administrative controls on such investments. However, the government frowns upon some foreign takeovers of German firms.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) rose to a record level in 2000. However, this record high was largely the result of a hostile takeover of a German mobile phone company, Mannesmann, by Vodafone-AirTouch of the UK which generated an inflow in the first quarter alone of US$156bn and a total inflow of US$194.8bn for the year as a whole. This amounted to more than the total inflow in the previous ten years, and lifted Germany's share of total EU FDI stock to 19% (US$461bn). German companies in the energy and telecoms fields have become increasingly attractive to foreign concerns as a result of ongoing
liberalisation efforts. Still inward investment fell back to US$32bn in 2001, but is estimated to finish up at a total of US39.5bn in 2002.

Foreign takeovers of German firms still arouse resistance and the German government opposes hostile takeovers. New EU takeover rules that had been in the making for over a decade were struck down by the European Parliament in July 2001, partly because of strong German opposition. The rules would have required the management of any  European company to remain neutral regarding a bid by another company, be it friendly or hostile. The irony of the German approach is that German firms are major investors overseas where they benefit from a more liberal attitude from foreign governments.

Once established in Germany, foreign firms are treated fairly. They have the right to take alleged violations of EU regulations on public contracts to a complaints council or court. When both qualified investors and former owners (from pre-1945) stake a claim to land or property, the investor will be given priority, and the former owner will be paid compensation instead. Foreign investors are also pleased that many German firms, starting with DaimlerChrysler (then Daimler Benz) in 1993, are choosing to move from their own German accounting framework (HGB) to the more globally accepted international accounting standards (IAS) or US GAAP standards.

The Office of the Commissioner for Foreign Investment in Germany (Buro des Bundesbeauftragten fur Auslandsinvestitionen in Deutschland), formerly called the Federal Centre for Foreign Investment, is the best contact for companies looking to invest in Germany. It offers information about the domestic corporate environment, business practices and facilitates contacts in the business community, and it can set up investors with economic development authorities. Primary information about Germany as a business location is available from the commercial departments of German embassies or from the Association of German Chambers of Commerce (Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag), which has offices in major cities worldwide.
There are no local-content requirements in Germany. Unfair Competitive Practices
Germany has an active antitrust programme. Its legal basis is the Law Against Restraint of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen-- GWB, BGBl I 1999, S 2546). It prohibits horizontal agreements and controls vertical agreements that restrict competition and abuse a dominant position. It also forbids concerted practices, bans resale-price maintenance and establishes preventive and retroactive controls for mergers. However, there is a different attitude for telecommunications, with the regulator recently having changed the rules to assist the state- controlled  Deutsche Telekom.
The GWB was amended as from January 1999. The changes include these provisions:

Page 5 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* a total ban on cartels from the moment they are agreed-not just when they take effect;
* an end to exemption for export and import cartels;

* an end to the need for an investigation by the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) of abuse of a dominant position before injured parties may file a lawsuit;

* an automatic investigation of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) with combined turnover exceeding Euro500bn (US$445m, previously Euro250m, US$223m). Deals must be registered with the cartel office after the fact if the deal is worth Euro500m or less.

The other important law in this policy area is the Law Against Unfair Competition (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb, RGBl S 499, revised version from 2000, BGBl I S 1374). The Rebate Law, which limited the ability of retailers to give rebates to their customers, was abolished in 2001.

Suppliers are free to sell to whomever they wish, as long as there are alternative sources of the item in question. In addition, retailers may now take claims of unfair competition to the civil courts. The GWB also protects small retailers from the effects of mergers and acquisitions, and it prevents further consolidation among the largest retail chains.

The Federal Cartel Office, together with state officials, is responsible for implementing Germany's antitrust rules. Its interventions against competition-restricting mergers can affect foreign as well as domestic acquirers, but there is no evidence that the law is applied more stringently to foreign firms. The Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) can overrule the agency's decisions. The economics minister may overrule a decision of the Federal Cartel Office if he finds an overriding public interest--a
right used just six times to date. Interventions by the Federal Cartel Office have led to stiff penalties for cartel offenders. Present regulations provide for  fines of up to Euro500,000 and three times the profits resulting from an infringement of the law.

German companies are also subject to the jurisdiction of the EuropeanCommission, which has the right to ban mergers and acquisitions it believes might exploit dominant market positions. Although a market- dominating position is not in itself illegal, the law prohibits the abuse of a dominant position. For example, a firm that uses its market dominance and monopoly profits in one product area to undercut prices and eliminate competitors in another would be charged with illegal abuse. Where such abuse is found, the cartel authorities may forbid the practice and invalidate contracts that constitute the abuse, or it may impose penalties. Mergers that create or strengthen market-dominating positions may be prevented or dissolved.
Intellectual Property Rights

Patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial designs and models are legally recognised in Germany. Under German law, an exclusive licence may be granted, and the recipient may in turn grant sub-licences. Enforcement of patent and trademark laws is rapid and satisfactory, with penalties for infringements roughly equivalent to what it would have cost to obtain a licence. Nevertheless, Germany is not completely free from piracy.

Research into German trademarks was greatly eased with the July 1999 launch of DEPATIS, a public research database of all outstanding German trademarks and patents and all applications. The database has been available since mid-2001 on the Internet (www.depatis.de).

The 1994 trademark law (Markengesetz, BGBl I S 3082, 1995 I S 156) aligned German trademark law with other EU states and recognised three-dimensional and aural trademarks alongside visual and word trademarks.

A registered trademark is valid for ten years and can be protected indefinitely in ten-year increments. A registered trademark can be deleted before the end of a ten-year time span only upon application of the trademark owner or of a third party, in the following circumstances (among others): if the trademark name is a term of everyday use (for example, if the trademark "Camera" would be used for a camera); if somebody has proof of an older right to the name; or if the trademark has not been used for more than five years.

A third party that claims to have older rights than the applicant may challenge the registration of a trademark at any time. The date of application to the Patent Office is crucial in determining the party with priority. The Patent Office itself does not investigate any prior claims of others in the trademark register but leaves it to the owners of existing rights to assert their priority. If an objection is raised, the office compares the older (objecting) trademark with that of the applicant. A similarity with an existing mark deemed potentially confusing to the public would be enough for a rejection of an application, provided the

Page 6 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
objecting party's trademark and the new applicant's mark were to be used for goods of the same or similar kind.

A patent or trademark holder can get an injunction to halt an alleged abuse only if the matter is urgent (for instance, if the offence occurs during a trade fair). A licensee may sue against infringement of the
licenser's patent, if the contract so stipulates or involves an exclusive licence. Many foreign licensers grant
German licensees the right to take immediate action against infringements.

Litigation costs resulting from a conflict over a licensing agreement can exceed  Euro50,000 because of a rather expensive procedure for solving complaints. These are resolved either through a local court, where the plaintiff must wait 6-9 months, or through private arbitrators (within three weeks), who are usually provided by local or international chambers of commerce. There is no appeal procedure against an arbitrator's decision, and fees are  Euro1,000-2,500 a day.

As trademark disputes are quite common, many are settled by so-called delimitation agreements, whereby the challenged party agrees to use his trademark in a restricted manner (for example, only for certain goods or in connection with specific alterations to the new mark to differentiate it from the existing mark). Such agreements are also used to make the prior holder of a mark withdraw his objection against the registration of the trademark.
Price Controls

No general price controls exist in Germany, though the Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) watches for price increases that apparently stem from an abuse of dominant market positions. The cartel office interprets "excessive" price increases as a possible abuse of market dominance and institutes proceedings against companies thus implicated. In addition, direct price controls include maximum prices (for example, on rent), minimum prices (mainly for agricultural products, in accordance with EU regulations) and price-calculation ordinances (for example, for public utilities and insurance premiums). Around one-fifth of the German consumer price index is composed of the prices of state-regulated items.

Under the Law Against Restraint of Competition (Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschrankungen), there is now a general ban on price policies which are meant to force competitors out of the market. The burden of proof has been moved to the firm under accusation. In 2000 the cartel office began to prevent companies from selling products at prices below production costs. The first companies this new rule was applied to were the retail chains Wal-Mart, Aldi Nord and Lidl, which were found to have used their market
dominance routinely to undercut the competitors' prices by selling certain products below cost.

AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission has delayed publishing findings of a probe into possible inflation of mobile phone charges for international "roaming" by U.K. and German operators, the Financial Times reports.
The paper said the delay, likely until August, was caused by the complexity of the case.

Operators could face large  fines, if the  Commission decides prices have been inflated. Operators affected by the matter include Vodafone PLC (VOF) and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DT).

Responding to an ex parte letter filed by MCI with the FCC earlier this month, Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) said it never had tried to whipsaw the company: "Indeed, the record shows that the opposite is true, with MCI attempting to use the FCC process as leverage in its negotiations with PLDT." In its letter filed April 16, MCI charged that PLDT was "continuing to whipsaw MCI" by using "blockage of MCI's traffic as leverage to obtain agreement solely on" PLDT's terms. PLDT said it opened its direct circuits to MCI Feb. 28 after the parties signed an interim termination rate agreement for the Feb.
28-March 31 period on terms favorable to MCI. However, the company said that on March 12, the Philippines telecom regulator ordered it to close direct circuits to U.S. carriers that refused to pay Filipino carriers a "fair and reasonable" rate.

TD
PLDT said it had extended the agreement "as far as it thought it reasonably could" until April 15 to give the parties more time to reach agreement. "If PLDT had sought 'leverage' over MCI, it would not have opened direct circuits... in the first place, and it certainly would not have kept direct circuits open until April
15," PLDT wrote. It said the  Commission's order requiring U.S. carriers to stop payments to Philippines carriers "stood in the way of agreement. With the negotiations deadlocked, no agreement on price, no prospect on payment and the effect of the" Philippines telecom regulator order, "PLDT could not continue to provide direct connections to MCI," it said.

Deutsche Telekom may face a fine from the European Commission because of excessive prices in local telephone circuits, sources said at the EU Commission in Brussels Wed. The  fine may be small because DT still is operating in a regulated area, they said. A recent study by Deutsche Bank Research said the German telecom market still lacked competition because of the dominance of  DT (CD April 16 p9). The Regulierungsbehoerde fuer Telekommunikation und Post (RegTP), the regulatory body, must decide on DT's demand to raise prices for sharing subscriber lines to more than 17 euros per month.  DT competitors already pay more (12.48  euros per month) than  DT end customers (11.83 euros). DT has a
75.9% share of the fixed telephony market and 96% of local calls. Critics said the incumbent used that position to deploy its broadband DSL services faster and more effectively than its competitors. While there are 100 DSL providers,  DT's share still tops 95%. Alternative techniques that would have made it possible to route around  DT's last mile, such as Wireless Local Loop technology, couldn't match  DT's price strategy and pace of deployment, they said. The uptake of cable modem services (with 2/3 of German households passed) was blocked by  DT's slow movement in selling the TV cable network, and the unique situation that the last mile of the cable was split from the main network and owned by hundreds of small and medium local companies. -- ME

COMMISSION MEETING

Kemppinen said the  Commission weekly meeting next Wednesday would vote on a state aid scoreboard, changes to aid rules for small and medium sized entreprises, the preliminary draft budget for 2004 and the Austrian economic stability programme.
It would discuss various competition points such as the joint venture between DaimlerChrysler and
Deutsche Telekom to introduce a toll system for lorries on German motorways.

The Commission would also decide on a medical equipment joint venture between two German companies Siemens and Draegerwerk, said Kemppinen.

The EU executive would discuss the re-organisation of the Competition Directorate General, especially the sections involved in the fight against cartels and abuses of dominant positions.

The Commission would adopt a non-binding proposal, or communication, to improve investment in research, raising the level from 1.9 percent of GDP to 3 percent where two thirds of the funds would come from the private sector.

The suspension of preferential sugar imports from Serbia and Montenegro would also be discussed, said Kemppinen.

EU-AIRLINES

The European Commission said on Friday that it would propose relaxing EU-wide rules on airport slots to allow airlines to cope with a fall in demand due to the war in Iraq and the outbreak of the SARS disease.

The Commission, which oversees competition and antitrust agreements in the  European Union, said in a statement that it wanted to relax "use it or lose it" rules which mean that airlines could lose slots at airports which they do not use.

"This aims to enable air carriers to adjust capacity in view of falling demand caused by war in Iraq and the recent outbreak of SARS," it said.

It said that under its proposal, which has to be approved by the  European Parliament and EU governments, the derogation from the rules would last for the summer season, from March 30 to October 25.

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission's antitrust commissioner plans to levy a fine against Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) in June for hindering access to its telephone-line network by overcharging competitors, German magazine Focus reports.

After months of investigation, antitrust commissioner Mario Monti plans to  fine the company an amount "in the low double-digit million"  euro range, Focus says.

TD
Despite liberalization and new telephone operators,  Deutsche Telekom still controls 96% of
Germany's telephone connections, the magazine says.

Deutsche Telekom spokesman Hans Ehnert said Sunday the report was speculation, and since the company hadn't been informed about the  fine, it had no comment on the matter.

HD        Ireland to miss out on high-tech toll system. BY        By BARRY MCCALL.

Irish toll roads will not have the technology in place to give motorists access to the new standardised electronic tolling systems proposed for EU-wide introduction in 2005.
According to a recent report, the  European Commission is to propose harmonising toll systems in the
EU, in a bid to cut queues and boost the electronics industry. The  Commission wants a single
electronic tolling system available for all major EU roads for trucks and coaches by 2005 and for cars by
2010. The new standard would allow carmakers to build the electronic boxes required into their vehicles.
The plan, which needs approval from EU governments and the  European Parliament, would force
countries such as France, Italy and Spain which have their own systems to adapt them to the EU
standard which will use satellite positioning, rather than the microwave technology commonly used at
present.

TD
Here, due to the current system being used for awarding roads toll operating contracts, motorists could end up with 10 different systems. Therefore, a lorry driver who will be able to travel thousands of kilometres across Europe without stopping to pay a toll may have to stop half a dozen times just to get from Cork to Belfast. Under their contracts, Irish public-private partnership (PPP) road concessionaires are allowed to choose their own methods of cash and electronic tolling. Indeed, there is no compulsion for them to have electronic tolling systems at all.

"This is because we did not want to place anyone at a competitive disadvantage by specifying one system or another," says Brian Cullinane of the National Roads Authority (NRA). "There are problems associated with harmonised tolling in any case. There are legal and technological issues. For example, would a central clearing house like that in use by the banks have to be established to collect the tolls? What happens when it's impossible to collect from someone in a different jurisdiction?" While these are very real concerns, it is understood from  Commission sources that mobile telephone technology could be used for toll collection. Each vehicle would have an electronic device to which the owner's mobile phone is connected. As each toll point is passed an amount is added to their phone bill and collected in the same way as roaming call charges.

Cullinane does admit that we are unlikely to have the standardised technology available on time in this country. "We won't have it soon enough", he says. "But, if the new standard comes as a result of a European directive, it will have to be transposed into Irish law and the toll roads operators will have to implement it." According to a spokesperson for the Department of Transport, the minister is committed to introducing the most up-to-date technology to ensure rapid movement through tollbooths without tailbacks.

"The minister has requested his Department and the NRA to examine all aspects of the use of free-flow systems for tolling in the future," he says. "The minister has had a number of meetings with the NRA at which he made his views known on the need to incorporate in future PPP contracts the use of the most sophisticated electronic tolling systems available. PPP contracts provide the NRA with the right to require tolling changes during concession period." Conor Faughnan of the AA believes that  European standard systems will be adopted by the toll operators because of the service standards imposed upon them by the Department and the NRA.

"It's a similar situation to that of catalytic converters," he says. "Everyone assumes that a catalytic converter is a legal requirement but it's not. The requirement is an emissions standard and the device is

Page 14 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the best means of achieving that. I think that, if the Department and the NRA impose strict enough service standards, it will mean that toll operators will have to adopt best practice in technology and this will be the European standard. "However, the AA would be concerned if Irish systems were out of kilter with the rest of Europe - we are against tolling but, if we're going to have a bad system, let's have a good bad system."

One fly in the ointment is a report that the EU Commission is about to approve a joint venture deal between DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Telekom to collect German road tolls. This would give the joint venture a veritable monopoly of technology on German roads and probably mean that it would become the de facto  European standard. Truck-maker Volvo, itself a major developer and manufacturer of electronic fleet management systems, says it may challenge this in the  European Court of Justice. A legal wrangle at this stage could well delay any standard well past the hoped for introduction date of
2005.

While not everyone supports road tolling, it's almost universally accepted as a method for cash strapped governments to raise finance for future road building and maintenance programmes. As a result 10 stretches of Ireland's proposed new motorway network under the National Development Plan are earmarked for tolling.

Several European governments have indicated that new motorway schemes will have to be financed by some form of tolling. Tolls are not without their problems, however. Toll plazas create points of congestion along the road network as cars queue to get through. The French have come up with one solution: when a queue reaches a certain length the gates are opened and all cars are allowed through free until the queue is eliminated.

Electronic tolling systems are  fine if the only toll roads you drive on are using the same ones. However, at present if you travel from Ireland to France and down into Spain you will encounter at least three different systems requiring you either to stop and pay cash at each toll booth or make arrangements in advance to prepay for the different technologies in use.

The European Commission denied on Monday that it was on the brink of fining  Deutsche Telekom tens of millions of euros for charging high fees for access to its local network, rebuffing a German media report. A spokesman for the  Commission said a committee of officials from  European Union member states' competition authorities had met to discuss  Deutsche Telekom, but denied a claim made in a report by German news agency DPA that a fine was imminent. "No proposal for a  fine was made. No discussions on a possible fine took place," the Commission said in a statement. A spokesman for Deutsche Telekom said the company had not received any information about a  fine and declined to be drawn further. The Commission is investigating the fees  Deutsche Telekom charges when it leases telephone lines to its competitors, after alternative carriers complained to Brussels their monthly rental was more than what the German operator charged its own customers.

TD
Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecoms carrier, charged its competitors a monthly access fee of
12.48 euros until last week, when the German telecoms regulator cut this fee. The new rate of 11.80
euros set by the regulator is just a nudge under  Deutsche Telekom's end-customer fee for a standard
analogue line of 11.83  euros per month.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission Monday took an important step toward concluding its investigation of Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) for allegedly abusing its dominant position on the local German telephone market.
Regulators "presented a decision on  Deutsche Telekom" to a committee of antitrust authorities, said
Tilman Lueder, an E.U. spokesman.

TD
But Lueder said no proposal for a  fine was made and there were no discussions on a possible  fine.
"The discussions focused exclusively on the draft decision," he said.

The Commission has been investigating  Deutsche Telekom for denying competitors access to the local telephone grid. The former monopoly controls over 95% of that market.
Press reports in recent weeks have said the  Commission is preparing a fine in the tens of millions of
euros by late June or July.

If member state regulators agree with the  Commission decision, a second meeting could be called to propose a fine within the next few weeks, Lueder said.

The Commission is frustrated with the slow pace of deregulation in the local telephone market. Telcos were required to open their local networks to competitors in January 2001 but so far progress has been slow.

In a report last year, the  Commission said incumbents opened just over 1 million lines to rivals out of nearly 187 million lines. In Germany, 4% of lines were opened.

Market opening means allowing rivals to rent  Deutsche Telekom's copper wires and resell them. But there is practically no business case for rivals in Germany because of  Deutsche Telekom's high rental fees. In some cases, officials say end customers pay lower fees than the wholesale prices Deutsche Telecom charges to competing telephone companies.
"Deutsche Telekom charges so much for access that no one wants the line," said a  Commission
official.

Deutsche Telekom denies the charges, saying the company has opened the market more than many other incumbents in other countries. While newcomers rent 855,404 lines in Germany, they only have
20 lines in Portugal and 93 lines in Greece.

Brussels, 05/05/2003 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has announced that, on Monday, it presented a decision regarding Deutsche Telekom to the Advisory Committee of the Member States. Discussions focused exclusively on the draft decision proposed by the Commission, and no proposal for a fine was made. The  Commission explains that the issue of a potential fine is never discussed in the first meeting of the Advisory Committee and that "there is always a second meeting to discuss this issue should the Commission wish to propose a fine". We recall that Deutsche Telekom's behaviour regarding Internet access is currently under close scrutiny from the European Commission.

The European Commission will adopt at the end of May or beginning of June its conclusions on an inquiry concerning Deutsche Telekom. The German operator is suspected of blocking access by its competitors to its local telephone network by enforcing excessively high access rights. Those competitors of Deutsche Telekom seeking access the local network (opened up to competitors since April 25) must pay a right of entry to the semi-state-owned operator, which controls the basics of the local network in Germany. The  Commission believes that Deutsche Telekom has fixed these entry costs at too high a level, thus hindering free competition. A spokesman for the European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, said on May 5 that a consultative committee made up of representatives from the competent authorities in the Member States, had discussed the  Commission's position on the affair on May 5.

TD
In a press statement on May 5, the  Commission says that no decision has been taken on imposing a
fine on Deutsche Telekom and in any case that this aspect is never discussed during the first meeting of
the consultative committee. The committee will meet again to announce a decision on the  fine that the
Commission may impose on Germany's traditional operator, the statement said.

The Commission denied on May 5 that it was about to  fine Deutsche Telekom (DT) up to tens of million Euro for anti-competitive behaviour in the local telephone communications market in Germany. The Commission said that it had merely presented a decision on  DT to a committee of officials from Member States' competition authorities. "No proposal for a  fine was made. No discussions on a possible  fine took place. The issue of a potential  fine is never discussed in the first meeting of the Advisory Committee," the Commission said in a statement. The move came following reports by the German news agency DPA that a fine was imminent.The  Commission is investigating the fees  Deutsche Telekom charges for leasing telephone lines to competitors. Competitors on the German market had complained to the Commission that DT was charging them a monthly access fee of  Euro 12.48, when it was charging only Euro 11.83 to its end customers for monthly line rental.

TD
The German telecoms regulator has now cut the amount  DT charges to its competitors to  Euro 11.80.

The case is part of an ongoing drive by Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, to force former monopoly telephone companies to speed up and facilitate competition, especially in the fast Internet access market, by granting other companies access to local telephone lines under fair and
non-discriminatory terms. At issue is the so-called 'last mile', which links residential customers and small and midsize enterprises to local telephone exchanges. Local infrastructure, frequently referred to as the
'local loop', is vital for the provision of telephone and Internet services.  DT still controls nearly 98% of the local network in Germany.

OLIVER Letwin's initiative on authority's assault on soft targets will strike a chord with drivers. Roundhead governments' enthusiasm for regulation has seen us saddled with ever more restrictions and rules. The principal sufferers are those who tax and insure their cars, drive with care and discretion, obey as many of the laws as they can remember, and when they do slip up, obediently pay the  fine.

Blessed the meek may be, but they are more likely to inherit parking tickets and penalty points than anything St Matthew had in mind. Speeding joyriders in untaxed cars flout laws, and because the authorities find them difficult to track down, pay no  fines or in many cases face no prosecution. They ignore driving bans and carry on creating havoc.

The meek swell the crime clear-up rates and fulfil police targets, while authority basks in the satisfaction of looking as though it is Doing Something.

Take the London congestion charge. Support, even mine, for the principle of paying for road space will ebb away if the system fails, and with nine out of 10 appeals against congestion charges upheld, it looks as though it is badly flawed.
Drivers whose cars have been photographed within the area are  fined 80 pound. It is reduced to #40 if it
is paid within two weeks. Anybody who believes they are being wrongly accused can write to Transport for
London (TfL) but are unlikely to make much headway. TfL has pictures to prove their guilt. Quite a lot of
accused pay up rather than go through the cumbersome appeal procedure. This means taking the case to
congestion charge arbiters appointed by the Lord Chancellor.

TfL has won only 71 of the 1,125 cases contested so far. It did not even contest 949 of them, which suggests they could have been dealt with perfectly well on the first approach, but the bureaucrats thought they could bully the alleged offenders into paying up. It lost 94 cases following evidence presented to the arbiter. Eleven drivers withdrew their appeals.

From the beginning there was scepticism over the dependence on photographing number plates. The Fleet Street Motoring Group raised it at our meeting with Professor David Begg of the  Commission for Integrated Transport. He told us fraud was almost impossible. The Department of Transport introduced licensing of number plate manufacturers, yet it was patently obvious the crooks would be one step ahead. It does not take much ingenuity to create stick-on numbers and apply them to suitably lookalike cars.

The case of Marcos Losekann, whose Chrysler PT Cruiser racked up #2,000 in speeding, bus lane infringements, parking and congestion charge penalties inside six weeks, shows that car cloning works. Losekann's protests were disputed by TfL. The company handling enforcement turned down his representations. They had the pictures. The  fine was doubled and he was told a county court summons would follow.

Losekann locked his car away but the penalties kept coming. He turned detective, tracked down the impostor and called the police. To his surprise they were not much interested, although they could see the fraudulent plates, the Visible Identification Number (VIN) had been scratched out (an offence) and it
looked as though the vehicle had been stolen. It had.

Yet it was only when Losekann got in touch with the press that action occurred and the  fines were withdrawn. His case backs up Oliver Letwin's cause precisely.

The highhandedness of TfL, police inaction, the whole culture of fastening on soft targets because they are easier to track down, passing up criminals because they are more difficult to catch, are symptoms of the malaise. TfL has another 3,135 appeals to come. This may look manageable against the 220,000 penalty notices that have been issued, but together with the 1,125 already dealt with, it amounts to 4,260.

If Losekann's cloned Chrysler is any guide, and nine out of 10 are upheld, that looks like 3,834 frauds. When 3,000 motorists a month are reporting their cars have been cloned, something is seriously amiss.

Road tolls and congestion charging will spread, but the technology needs to improve and the inner-city transport systems, such as Edinburgh's proposed trams, need to be in place before they are implemented. Crude cameras taking number plate pictures will not do. We are a long way off equipping Britain's 30 million vehicles with electronic chips or intelligent number plates, impossible to copy and read by roadside sensors. Yet they would be able to monitor uninsured, untaxed, and MoT cheats.

DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Telekom's joint initiative for a German road toll system using satellite telematics has just won conditional approval from the  European Commission. Telematics are on-board electronic systems much hyped in the 1990s, and although it turns out not many drivers want internet connections or expensive satellite navigation systems, they represent the only hope for fraud-free congestion charging.

Telematics will come once the industry agrees standards, and even if hopes for enriching their creators from entertainment and information systems are likely to be dashed, they will tell dealers when a car is likely to break down, or where it has had the accident. Telematics will also tell the bosses where their reps are.

Berlin, Hamburg and Munich are among cities contemplating congestion charges. A study by Deloitte Consulting found 73 cities in 15  European countries examining schemes, many taking active steps, but there will be vigorous opposition from the meek majority unless the fraudsters are effectively eliminated.

HD           EU To Rule On Deutsche Telekom Fine Next Week - Sources

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission will decide next week whether to  fine            Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) for alleged unfair pricing practices within Germany's local telephone network, sources close to the investigation said.
One source said any fine will be only "symbolic." Press reports in recent weeks have said the  fine
may be in the tens of millions of  euros.

TD
"The Commission won't go for the maximum  fine amount," the source said.

The Commission suspects DT of abusing its dominant position in the local phone network and handicapping rivals.

The investigation, launched in May 2002, followed complaints that  DT was squeezing competitors by unfairly setting wholesale retail tariffs for high-speed Internet connections.

The probe is part of E.U. antitrust chief Mario Monti's campaign to open local telephone networks to promote competition and make broadband cheap and accessible. The  Commission says incumbents, like DT, are "preventing the development of the competition in broadband services."

DT has launched a vigorous defense and says prices are largely set by the national regulator. The German giant also says it has opened more than 2 million lines to competitors, which is far more than any other incumbent  European operator.

But competition is still limited in Germany. Annegret Groebel, an official at the German telecoms regulator RegTP, said Thursday that  DT's rivals still only operate about 6% of the country's broadband lines.

The fine, which is due next week, may turn out to be a slap on the wrist, but it would mark the first ruling of its kind against an incumbent telecom operator since the 1980s, according to Andy Tarrant, regulatory affairs director at  European Competitive Telecommunications Association.

SUMMARY

Legal and regulatory risks will be very low. The judiciary is fiercely independent and the legal system will remain highly transparent. Contracts will almost always be enforceable, provided they meet the requirements of the state in which they will apply and are not vaguely worded. Compliance with individual state legal and regulatory requirements can often be under- estimated by foreign investors. The risk of expropriation will be negligible, but restrictions on foreign investment in transport, telecommunications and certain defence-related sectors will continue. Investors will benefit from very high protection of property rights, including those pertaining to intellectual property. Price controls will continue on some regulated monopolies, such as power utilities, in an otherwise unfettered market.
ANALYSIS
* The regulatory framework becomes more onerous (High risk).

President George W Bush came to power with the express intent of paring down the federal government's role in the economy, planning to cut back regulation and intervention. However, the September 11th attacks and a spate of corporate scandals from Enron to WorldCom have prompted radical policy reversals. While the terrorist attacks triggered federal bailouts of the airlines and insurance industry, the
collapse of confidence in US corporate governance has generated a plethora of new regulations. Scandals on Wall Street, especially those involving corporate governance, accounting, and conflicts of interest
within investment banks, have received special attention, and the mood in Washington against corporate malfeasance has hardened, culminating in the unexpectedly swift passage in July 2002 of the Corporate Responsibility Bill.

The new law, among other things, sets up an independent oversight board for the auditing profession, stiffens penalties for corporate wrongdoers and requires more extensive financial disclosure by companies. A number of measures designed to strengthen the accountability of senior corporate officers have also been introduced by the Securities and Exchange  Commission. Chief executives and chief financial officers of US-based companies with revenue of more than US$1.2bn in 2001 must now swear under oath, and in writing, that the figures in their financial reports are correct, to the best of their

knowledge. Foreign investors will need to familiarise themselves with these new regulations and pay close attention to further changes to the regulatory environment.
* Barriers to foreign investors increase in strategic sectors (Low risk).

Although foreign investors will continue to enjoy unrestricted access to most of the US economy, the government could increase limitations on foreign investment in sectors deemed sensitive to national security. Restrictions on foreign ownership in transport, telecommunications and energy generation will be strictly enforced and may be tightened, while more business operations associated with defence-related work could be classified and put beyond the realm of foreign investment.
BACKGROUND Enforceability of Contracts
The US has a sophisticated legal system, but one in which contractual arrangements are almost always secure. Contracts must, however, be properly structured and meet the requirements of the state in which the contract will be enforced. The need to comply with individual state legal and regulatory requirements is often under-estimated by foreign firms establishing operations in the US.

Owing to the litigious nature of US society, and the ready availability of legal services, vaguely worded contracts will often be challenged by business partners, and can be invalidated by the courts. Once established, however, most courts--whether at the local, state or federal level--will reliably and
even-handedly enforce contracts.

The US legal system is highly transparent; new laws and legal standards are generally published quickly, whether by local, state or federal jurisdictions. The system is not, however, easily discernible; any contractual undertaking beyond the most basic requires the advice of an experienced attorney. Despite attempts by some business associations to simplify contractual arrangements, legal advice remains a necessity, especially when establishing operations in more than one state.

The US is a common law country. The legal system of every state is based on the common law, except Louisiana (which is based on the French civil code). Common law has no statutory basis; judges establish common law through written opinions that are binding on future decisions of lower courts in the same jurisdiction. Broad areas of the law, most notably relating to property, contracts and torts, are traditionally part of the common law. These areas of the law are mostly within the jurisdiction of the states, and thus state courts are the primary source of common law. The area of federal common law is primarily limited to federal issues that have not been addressed by a statute.

All courts follow a strict set of procedural requirements. In 1938, the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which are periodically updated and renewed by the US Judicial Conference. They are uniform in all federal jurisdictions, although each federal court may also adopt additional rules. Every state court has its own set of rules, which are typically not as detailed or strict as the federal rules. In courts of original jurisdiction, judges are usually provided with juries to decide all questions of fact. The right to a jury is generally guaranteed by the federal Constitution in federal cases, and state constitutions typically contain similar provisions which apply in state cases.

Every level of the federal courts has the power to interpret the federal Constitution and federal laws and regulations. The courts also exercise judicial review over federal statutes and agency actions, and determine the constitutionality of federal and state laws. To the extent any statute or agency action is found to be unconstitutional, it is invalid. Federal courts also interpret federal legislation and federal agency rules and decisions.
Independence of the Judiciary

Consistent with the structure of the US legal system, judges serve on local, state and federal benches. At all levels, but especially so at the state and federal levels, judges are widely viewed as independent and non- partisan. While they will, in extraordinary cases, come under pressure from governments or private individuals to rule in their favour, there have been relatively few cases of wide-ranging judicial misconduct.

Judicial independence in the federal legal system is rooted in five principles: the constitutional protections afforded judges; the independent administration of the judiciary by the judiciary; a well- established disciplinary system; the manner in which conflicts of interest are addressed; and the assurance that decisions will be implemented.

The US Constitution ensures that federal judges cannot be removed by the government, except in extraordinary cases of misconduct. In such an instance, the judge would be subject to impeachment and trial before, respectively, the US House of Representatives and the Senate. This impeachment power has,

Page 27 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
however, been used rarely, and then only to remove judges for various forms of personal misconduct. Judges essentially serve for life, and so are less likely to be influenced by transient political issues.

The independence of the judiciary is also protected by the rules under which judges operate. A high-level body, the Judicial Conference of the United States, sets rules of procedure for judges; in effect, the judiciary controls the environment in which judges operate, minimising the chance of political interference. These detailed rules also provide a framework within which judges must operate, limiting the opportunity for bias or prejudice in the administration of the law.

Judges are also restrained by a formal system of judicial discipline, which applies in cases where a judge is accused of misconduct--but where the offence does not rise to the level of an impeachable act. Chief judges are required to investigate complaints against a federal judge, which may lead to a reprimand, a freeze on the assignment of new cases or a request that the judge retire. Judges also face a legal requirement to disqualify themselves in cases where they may have a conflict of interest; they must also investigate whether family members have a financial interest in a case that comes before them.

Finally, the reliability of the legal system is underpinned by the efficacy of judicial decisions. Simply put, virtually all legal decisions are carried out, both because they are enforced by the authorities, but also because of the tradition of the rule of law in the US. In extraordinary cases where a state or local government is unwilling to honour a court's judgement--as happened in the 1950s and 1960s when some states refused to desegregate schools--federal marshals can be empowered by the courts to carry out their decisions.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

As a matter of principle, the US does not engage in the nationalisation of industries. US courts have upheld the constitutionality of nationalisation or expropriation of property for public use (provided prompt, adequate and effective compensation is paid and subject to court review). It is highly unlikely that the federal government would exercise this authority over a property solely because it is foreign owned.

No general federal laws govern new investments or expansions by domestic or foreign firms. Foreign investors need not register with the federal government, though the Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States monitors acquisitions by non-US interests. Furthermore, like many countries, the US maintains restrictions on investment in specific sectors deemed sensitive to national security.
By federal law, the areas limited or closed to foreign investment include the following:

* Foreign ownership may not exceed 25% of domestic air-transport firms and coastal or freshwater shipping enterprises.

* Foreigners may purchase up to 49% of a US airline but may own only 25% of voting shares--though US and foreign airlines have sought to evade some of these restrictions by forming alliances. The Justice Department keeps a close eye on the airline industry for any non-competitive behaviour.

* Hydroelectric power companies require a licence from the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, which may issue such permits only to US citizens or domestic corporations. The issue of the degree of foreign ownership of a domestic corporation has never arisen in this area, and there are no specific regulations on this. A company that is the recipient of a voluntary transfer of such a licence must file with the commission for approval of that transfer (a process covered by the Code of Federal Regulations, 18
CFR Section 131.20).

* Foreign firms and individuals may be barred from obtaining operating licences to use certain nuclear materials.
* The Defence Department restricts work on classified US government contracts.

* Foreign firms may invest in communications industries (like telephone, telegraph, radio and television) but may not obtain a licence to broadcast or otherwise transmit. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and US communications laws bar any company that is more than 25% foreign owned from purchasing US telecommunications firms. The FCC may waive this restriction, however, as it deems necessary.

In late April 2001, despite heated opposition from several US lawmakers, the FCC unanimously approved Deutsche Telekom's US$26bn takeover of VoiceStream Wireless. The FCC approved the merger because it would serve the public interest by giving US consumers an additional option for wireless service. Opponents to the sale believed the company's backing by the German government would give it

an unfair advantage over US competitors, but this did not prove to be the case in the two years following the sale.

Most states impose only minor restrictions. Federal laws or treaties sometimes pre-empt state legislation. Other state and local regulations affecting foreign investment generally pertain to ownership and use of land and natural resources, supervision of professions and matters related to intrastate commerce. In a few states, most notably Kansas, foreigners are still not permitted either by law or by administrative policy to establish deposit banks.

Thanks to the interstate bank branching law passed at the end of 1994, however, all states are open to foreign branches (as well as domestic branches) since June 1st 1997. All foreign banks need an operating licence from the state in which the US headquarters is located. Federal law generally prohibits foreign
bank branches from accepting the retail deposits of US residents. The Federal Reserve Bank serves as the federal regulator of all state-licensed foreign branch banks and agency banks.

The US banking system has been in the throes of fundamental change since the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall act--the Depression-era law separating commercial lending from securities underwriting and separating insurance companies and banking enterprises.

Some states, including North Carolina, North Dakota and Tennessee, ban insurance companies controlled by governments, foreign or US.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (within the Department of Commerce), foreign-owned assets in the US ended 2001 at US$943.2bn, compared with US$952.4bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US securities other than US Treasury securities were a record US$498.4bn in 2001, up from the previous record of US$485.6bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US shares were US$127.2bn in 2001, down from US$192.7bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US bonds were a record US$371.2bn in 2001, up from US$294.1bn in 2000.

Net foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States was US$157.9bn in 2001, down from US$287.7bn in 2000. The vast majority of FDI inflows, some US$143.5bn, originated in  Europe. The greatest inflow of FDI to the US during 2001 came from, in descending order, Germany, the UK, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Local-content requirements per se do not exist. Numerous "Buy American" provisions, however, have been imposed at the federal, state and local government levels. For example, federal funding from the Federal Transit Administration requires that at least 50% of the final cost of components used in the construction of buses and underground rail systems be of US origin.

The US government generally regards the promotion of competition and economic efficiency as the central goal of its antitrust policy. Price controls are generally not a part of this equation, except for public utilities and a few other industries. As a result, the US market is well known for a highly competitive atmosphere in which the government is involved only as a regulator.

The Justice Department and 19 states won a lawsuit against Microsoft in early April 2000 when a US District Court judge ruled the company had repeatedly violated antitrust laws. Specifically, the court found that Microsoft's efforts to protect its Windows (operating system) monopoly against competitors exceeded bounds, as did its attempts to monopolise the market for browsers (software used to navigate the Internet) by linking Windows to its Internet Explorer software. An appeal against the ruling began in April 2001 before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The judges hearing the appeal decided not to uphold a lower court's order to break up the company.

The US Justice Department, in an effort to end the protracted litigation, decided to accept a settlement deal, which, many point out, was less stringent than previous court orders. Despite the Justice Department's agreement, there are nine states pursuing their own cases against Microsoft.
The key statutes governing US antitrust policy are the Sherman and Clayton acts and the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Both the Department of Justice and the
Department of Commerce have issued important guidelines on vertical and horizontal mergers and
pre-merger notification. These guidelines spell out how facts concerning imports and foreign capacity are
used in defining markets, calculating market share and weighing the likely competitive consequences of a
merger. New vertical- restraint guidelines have just been implemented.

Regulators are also homing in on antitrust issues raised by contracts between the makers of brand-name and generic drugs. The Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) announced plans in November 2000 to

Page 29 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
investigate generic- drug competition to study whether agreements between generic and brand- name drug makers have delayed access to generic products.

The FTC, which administers the fair-competition provisions of the applicable laws, uses both persuasion and litigation to enforce them. The FTC works closely with the Department of Justice to avoid duplicating enforcement activities. It follows similar policies in disclosing proposed consent decrees and allowing public comment for 60 days before taking a final vote on the settlement. The  commission is also active in challenging monopolistic practices stemming from restrictions on the use of patents and licensing.
However, Congress has prohibited the FTC from using authorised funds to petition for the cancellation of a registered trademark on the grounds that it has become a generic name.

The FTC's BusinessLine publications clarify otherwise ambiguous laws and rules. The full text of the guides on advertising, credit, labelling, money, online commerce and a series of "compliance guides" elucidating FTC rules is available on the FTC's website.

One antitrust exemption (granted by the Webb-Pomerene Act) allows groupings for the promotion of US exports in order to help US firms compete abroad against foreign companies or cartels. This was greatly broadened by the Export Trading Company (ETC) Act of 1982, which not only permits antitrust immunity for specific certified export activities but also allows bank holding companies to have equity participation in ETCs. Any such agreement must be carefully reviewed with the Department of Justice and the FTC. Applications under the ETC Act are reviewed by the Department of Commerce in conjunction with the Department of Justice. Applications by bank holding companies are reviewed exclusively by the Federal Reserve Board.

Besides clarifying the applicability of US antitrust law to international transactions, the ETC Act provides for a certification process for companies wishing to establish an ETC. With the concurrence of the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce can issue an Export Trade Certificate of Review granting antitrust immunity to these companies if the following stipulations are met: there can be no substantial weakening of competition in the US, no unreasonable upward pressure on US prices, no unfair methods of competition and no US resale or consumption of exported goods. Private suits may not be brought for more than actual damages against ETCs thus certified.
Intellectual Property Rights
The US has a well-developed system of licensing that protects patents, trademarks and copyrights. Each
of these has its own set of rules and procedures. The Patent and Trademark Office (of the US Department
of Commerce) issues patents and trademark registrations. Copyrights may be filed with the Copyright
Office of the Library of Congress.

A US patent may be obtained by any person who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or any new and useful improvements of these. US patent laws make no distinctions based on the inventor's citizenship. Patents are issued to individual inventors, who may assign or license their rights. It is legal and customary to require employees to assign their patent rights to their employers.

The basic law specifying the subject matter for which a patent might be obtained and the conditions for patentability took effect in 1953 (see Title 35 of the US Code). The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended US patent law to expand protection for owners of US process patents. Now, any person who, without authority, imports into the US or sells or uses in the US a product made outside the country but using a process patented in the US may be liable. Moreover, as a result of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs), on January 1st 1996, US patent law was expanded to include the importation and offer for sale of patented products and processes as acts of infringement.

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted 184,051 patents in 2001, compared with 176,084 in 2000. According to IFI Claims, a North Carolina firm, the top ten recipients of private-sector utility patents were IBM (US, 3,453); NEC (Japan, 1,966); Canon (Japan, 1,877); Micron (US, 1,643); Samsung Electronics (South Korea, 1,451); Matsushita (Japan, 1,447); Sony (Japan, 1,392); Hitachi (Japan, 1,283); Mitsubishi (Japan, 1,210); and Fujitsu (Japan, 1,208). Increased staffing in the USPTO and greater efficiencies have cut the filing and approval time to an average of 23 months.

Bill 1948 passed in November 1999 requires that all patent applications filed in the US and in another foreign country be published 18 months after filing. The bill also states that published applications will constitute prior references that can be applied to deny a patent to another applicant, in effect treating them as prior inventions and not as mere prior publications.

A US trademark relates to any word, name, symbol or device that is used in the trade of goods or services to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services and to distinguish them from the goods or services
Page 30 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
of others. Trademarks may be obtained to prevent the use of confusingly similar marks by others, but they may not be used to keep others from manufacturing the item or offering the services concerned.

Trademark rights in the US are now acquired through common law "use requirements" and not, as in many countries, through first registration. US law does allow for the filing of an intent-to-use application, however, which provides a constructive first-use date based on the filing date. To receive the registration, use must be proved. So, a trademark's continued use is necessary for the protection to remain in effect. A US trademark right is acquired through adoption and by use of a mark on goods or in connection with services, or by filing an intent-to-use application that is supported by later use.

Customs Service regulations went into effect in March 1999 that include an amended "affiliate exception", intended to avoid consumer confusion. Under the rules, foreign goods that are different from US goods bearing a legal trademark are not detained if the merchandise bears a conspicuous label that should include the following words: "This product is not a product authorised by the United States trademark owner for importation and is physically and materially different from the authorised product." The new regulations also provide a standard to determine whether goods are "physically or materially different". Courts have historically been against the affiliate exception espoused by the Customs Service, and it remains to be seen if they will be more receptive to its new form.

In March 2001 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board's final rejections of three applications to register "phantom" marks, so-called because they include placeholders to denote multiple, unspecified elements. It is expected that the appeal court's ruling will bring consistency to the USPTO's approach to similar applications for phantom marks in future.

Under the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright protection in the US is automatically extended to "original works of authorship" at the time of their creation. This provides the owner with exclusive rights to reproduce and sell a work. Works that can be copyrighted include motion pictures, sound recordings and computer software.
Trade secrets are considered a form of property. Since enactment of the Economic Espionage Act of
1996, the US Department of Justice has been granted jurisdiction (previously left to the states) over the
protection of trade secrets. The Justice Department's newly organised section on computer crime and
intellectual property is the responsible agency. Under the general outline of the trade-secret doctrine, the
owner of a trade secret has the right to use it to his economic advantage. The law also protects the holder
of a trade secret against disclosure gained by some improper means, such as theft, wiretapping or even
aerial reconnaissance. Trade-secrets law does not offer protection, however, against discovery by fair and
honest means, such as independent invention, accidental disclosure or reverse engineering.

The holder of a US patent, trademark or copyright may sue the infringer through the US federal court system, though the process can be long and costly. The holder may also obtain an injunction and may sue for damages. If a foreign patent holder licenses his patent in the US, he may still be able to sue directly an infringer if the licence agreement allows.

Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, is an attractive alternative to federal patent litigation involving international trade, which typically lasts many years. Under this section, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates infringement claims.

As a result of changes stemming from the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for investigations based on complaints filed prior to January 1st 1995, the ITC must make its final determination not later than one year (18 months in more complicated cases) from the publication of
notice about the start of an investigation in the Federal Register. For investigations based on complaints filed after January 1st 1995, the ITC must conclude its investigation as quickly as possible and must, within 45 days of its start, establish a target date for issuing a final declaration.

The amended code also eliminates the need to prove "injury" to the domestic industry and provides for expedited consideration of requests for temporary relief (such as temporary exclusion orders and temporary cease- and-desist orders) if there is reason to believe a violation has occurred. In the event of a temporary exclusion order, entry may be only under bond. The result of a successful claim can be drastic: an infringing product is generally excluded from entry into the US market.

The Copyright Act does impose certain limits on holder rights. Limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners include the doctrine of "fair use" (Section 107), which permits the use of copyrighted information for news reporting, teaching, research and a few other pursuits, and the allowances for "compulsory licensing" (Section 115) when royalty payments are made. The basic law was most recently amended by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of October 1998, and the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, also of 1998. The Supreme Court upheld the first of these two laws against legal challenges in January 2003.

A federal appeals court in New York issued a ruling in November 2001 in a case that highlighted the issues at stake on intellectual property in the digital age (perhaps even more than the Napster case). This case concerned the right to publish information that discloses how to circumvent copy- protection devices in digital video discs (DVD). It was the first major challenge to a 1998 amendment to the federal copyright law, dubbed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), making it illegal for anyone to try to circumvent copy-protection programs.

The issue came to the fore when a Norwegian programmer wrote a program called DeCSS, which allows users to bypass copy protections on DVDs. The lawsuit came about when a computer magazine published the code. The result is a clash between the need for copyright against two core First Amendment
principles: the right of the magazine to publish the code (free speech) and the right of users to deploy the code in order to reclaim their ability to make fair use of copyrighted material. While the computer magazine lost in the New York case, other courts have subsequently ruled in favour of opponents of the DMCA.

The consequences of these cases are already becoming evident: researchers at Princeton University announced that they broke through the copy- protection technologies of a new online music format proposed by the industry. The university cannot publish their findings, however, without violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Despite efforts to prevent the researchers' findings from being made public, many programs have begun to make use of the findings.

The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 imposes criminal penalties for trafficking in goods or services bearing a counterfeit mark. The act authorises seizures, steep  fines and a possible prison term.

One important trend in this area is the development of closer links between intellectual property laws and trade policy. An amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 linked the benefits of the Generalised System of Preferences to protection of US intellectual property rights abroad. The 1984 Trade Act enabled the government to bring unfair-trade-practice cases against countries in which intellectual property protection is found to be lacking. The 1986 "Statement on the Protection of US Intellectual Property Rights Abroad" detailed problems in this area, including the absence or inadequacy of national laws and enforcement. It also outlined a series of multilateral, bilateral and domestic initiatives in response. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 increased the government's leverage in using trade policy to compel foreign governments to increase their protection of US intellectual property rights.

Beginning January 1st 1996 certain creative works of non-US origin that had been in the public domain in the US had their copyright protection automatically restored. These included books, movies, sculptures, paintings, music, photographs, computer software and anything else that is eligible for US copyright protection. Congress changed US copyright law to this effect in late 1994 when it ratified the trade agreements that created the World Trade Organisation. The owner of a work that originated outside the US can now claim infringement of copyright in the US, but only after filing a notice of intent to enforce a restored copyright. This notice may be filed either with the Copyright Office or directly with the party using the work. The Copyright Office has additional information about works whose owners have filed such notices.
Price Controls

Price controls are rare in the United States, but they do exist for some regulated monopolies (like utilities and the postal service), and certain states and localities control residential rents. The most recent imposition of price restrictions was approved on May 2nd 2002, when the state legislature of Hawaii approved price caps on petrol prices, which have historically been higher than in any other US state.

The bill allows the state's Public Utilities  Commission to set a maximum price on petrol based on an average of prices in West Coast markets. Profit margins for dealers are to be capped at US$0.16 per gallon on regular unleaded petrol. The national average for regular unleaded petrol was US$1.40 per gallon in early May, but it ranged from US$1.60 to US$1.88 per gallon in Hawaii. Opponents contend the law is an attempt to appease consumers in an election year and will ultimately result in higher prices as supply decreases because of diminished competition.

The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission agreed to limited, temporary price constraints on wholesale electricity in California in 2001. After months of refusing the state's demands for price caps, the commission voted 2 to 1 to put a lid on California's wholesale electricity prices starting on May 1st 2001, but only when the state's supplies slip low enough to trigger an energy emergency. The caps remained in place until September 2002.

Brussels denies Deutsche  fine claim
The European Commission last week denied German press reports that  Deutsche Telekom faced a
'low double-digit million-euro' fine, following a near year-long inquiry into the German company's
overcharging of rivals for use of its local networks.

TD
'The European Union denies that a  fine has been set,' said a spokesman. He said a draft decision had been reached, but the  fine would be fixed later this month.

The inquiry followed complaints by Arcor and other competitors that the former telecom monopolist's charges continue to hinder fair competition in Germany. Arcor claimed the e12.50 a month access fee almost equals Deutsche Telekom's charges to its own retail customers.

The Commission could fine Deutsche Telekom anything from a nominal sum to 10 per cent of the group's turnover for breach of EU anti-trust rules.

BRUSSELS, May 19 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is expected to  fine Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) millions of  euros on Wednesday for using its dominance to stifle new competition, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.

A European Commission advisory committee met on Monday to recommend an exact amount for the fine, the source said.

TD
The Commission is expected to find that the former incumbent telephone operator used two different methods to prevent would-be competitors from entering the market for voice and data, maintaining 98 percent of the market for itself.

What competitors needed from  Deutsche Telekom was access to the wire running from the central office switch to a customer's home or office.

Deutsche Telekom charged more for wholesale access to the wire than it did a retail subscription, making it uneconomic for rival firms to compete, the  Commission has alleged.

Deutsche Telekom changed its pricing practices, but not enough. The  Commission determined that the margin was not even enough to cover  Deutsche Telekom's own downstream costs.

In determing cost, the  Commission used the weighted average of four retail telephone services - voice, Internet, ADSL high speed Internet, and ISDN high-speed data and voice.

The Commission's action stems from complaints by Mannesmann Arcor and local and regional carriers in Germany.

Deutsche Telekom's annual meeting of shareholders was set for Tuesday in Frankfurt.

A top European Commission competition official confirmed on Tuesday that  Commission documents made clear German telecoms giant  Deutsche Telekom had breached EU competition rules. Commission Director General for Competition Philip Lowe said the  Commission was now examining proposals for fines against Europe's largest telecoms carrier, for stifling competition in the local phone network, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Lowe was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cartel conference in Germany's former capital of Bonn. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the  Commission was expected to  fine Deutsche Telekom millions of euros for using its dominance to hamper competition. It was expected to find that the former incumbent telephone operator used unfair methods to prevent would-be competitors from entering the market for voice and data, maintaining 98 percent of the market for itself.

HD           EU To Fine D Telekom EUR12.5M In Antitrust Probe-Source

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission plans to fineDeutsche Telekom AG (DT) EUR12.5 million for alleged unfair pricing practices within Germany's local telephone network, a German government source said Tuesday.

Germany's competition watchdog approved the move, paving the way for a formal  Commission decision on Wednesday. It's the first time the  Commission has found an incumbent operator guilty of abusing its dominant position since 1982.

TD
An E.U.  Commission spokesman had no comment.

Last May, the  Commission charged DT with abusing its dominant position in the local phone network and handicapping rivals. Regulators said  DT's rivals were being squeezed out of the market for voice and data connections, including high-speed Internet or broadband services.

The investigation followed complaints by Mannesmann Arcor AG - Vodafone Group PLC's (VOD) German fixed-line unit - that  DT was unfairly setting tariffs for wholesale and retail connections.

"At one point we had to pay EUR12.48 per month for wholesale connections while  DT's residential customers paid EUR11.82," said Mannesmann Arcor spokesman Thomas Rompczyk said earlier Tuesday.

The DT probe is part of E.U. antitrust chief Mario Monti's campaign to open local telephone networks to promote competition and make broadband cheap and accessible. Under E.U. rules, incumbents must give rivals access to the wire running from their central office switch to a customer's home or office.

Incumbents like DT have been "preventing the development of the competition in broadband services," the Commission said last year.

DT officials argued that prices were largely set by the national regulator. The German giant also said it has opened more than 2 million lines to competitors - far more than any other incumbent  European operator.

But competition still is limited in Germany. Annegret Groebel, an official at the German telecoms regulator RegTP, said that  DT's rivals still only operate about 6% of the country's broadband lines.

LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) -  European shares looked set to open flat-to-weaker on Tuesday after Wall Street stretched its losses overnight, as investors reassess the outlook for company profits having previously raised their hopes of a recovery.
Britain's biggest clothing retailer Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) and Danish security giant Group 4 Falck
(FALCK.CO) head the list of companies reporting as the results season winds down.

Investors will also keep an eye on  Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), which holds its AGM.
"We need to see some evidence of a bounce (in profits) and we're not going to get that in the
short-term," said Nigel Cobby, managing director for  European equities at JP Morgan, recognising the
risk to earnings as a result of a strong  euro.
But in upbeat comments that gave no hint of a rate cut, European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg said prospects are brightening for a gradual euro zone recovery later this year.


Financial bookmakers in London expect Britain's FTSE 100 to open 10 points down, with Germany's Dax index          opening flat-to-10 points weaker and France's CAC-40         to dropping 21.

Citibank in Frankfurt saw the  euro zone Euro Stoxx 50 index dipping 17 points to 2,231 points.

European indices fell sharply on Monday to the bottom of their recent trading range, having previously bounced by more than 20 percent fropmm their multi-year lows.

In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.14 percent at 8,493 points and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite ended 2.97 percent lower.
The Dow had been down 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq had been 1.9 percent weaker when most
European markets closed.
The following stocks are likely movers: MARKS & SPENCER (MKS.L)
Britain's biggest clothing retailer is expected to report a full-year pre-tax profit before exceptionals ranging from 684 to 720 million pounds, up from 646.7 million in 2001/02, according to Multex Global Estimates. But investors will be most keen to hear about current trading after unusual factors clouded trends in its fourth quarter.

BONN, Germany, May 20 (Reuters) - A top  European Commission competition official confirmed on Tuesday that  Commission documents made clear German telecoms giant  Deutsche Telekom had breached EU competition rules.

Commission Director General for Competition Philip Lowe said the  Commission was now
examining proposals for  fines against Europe's largest telecoms carrier, for stifling competition in the
local phone network, confirming an earlier Reuters report.

TD
Lowe was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a cartel conference in Germany's former capital of
Bonn.
A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the  Commission was expected to
fine Deutsche Telekom millions of euros for using its dominance to hamper competition.

It was expected to find that the former incumbent telephone operator used unfair methods to prevent would-be competitors from entering the market for voice and data, maintaining 98 percent of the market for itself.

What competitors needed from  Deutsche Telekom was access to the wire running from the central office switch to a customer's home or office.

Deutsche Telekom charged more for wholesale access to the wire than it did a retail subscription, making it uneconomic for rival firms to compete, the  Commission has alleged.

The Commission's action stems from complaints by Mannesmann Arcor and local and regional carriers in Germany.

The European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros ($14.8 million) on Wednesday for charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks. The Commission said new prices set by German regulators on May 1 were still too high and that the company must reduce them immediately.  DT will face another review in two months. "DT, with a market share of 95 percent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement. A spokesman for  Deutsche Telekom blasted the decision and said the German telecoms giant may appeal to EU courts. "We can't comprehend that decision. These are regulated prices," said the spokesman. He said the company would decide about legal measures when it
had seen the full decision. A  Commission spokesman dismissed the Telekom statement, saying German regulators set maximum, not minimum, rates.

TD
The spokesman said Telekom must either raise some rates and lower others or cut rates overall to end its legal violations. "They have to stop immediately and the  Commission will review in two months whether they have complied," Tilman Lueder told reporters.  Fine doesn't hurt A telecommunications analyst in London said that for  Europe's largest telecoms operator, which reported first-quarter revenues of 13.6 billion euros last week, "this  fine in itself is a minor irritation, it doesn't really hurt". While the first-quarter earnings beat expectations, however, some analysts warn that the company's future performance partly hinges on how it copes with rising competition for local, fixed-line calls. Shares in  Deutsche Telekom
were little affected by the news, trading up 1.2 percent at 12.04  euros by 1224 GMT, outperforming a weaker German blue-chip index DAX as well as the  European telecoms index. Telekom's competitors need access to the wire running from the local telephone exchange to the customer's home or office. The Commission said that from 1998 to 2001, the former monopoly telephone service provider charged new entrants higher fees for wholesale access than it charged its own retail customers for fixed-line subscriptions, making it impossible to compete. Starting in 2002 Telekom adjusted its prices so that the wholesale price was lower than retail. But the  Commission said the difference was so narrow that Telekom itself could not have made money at that rate. In determining cost, the  Commission used the weighted average of four retail telephone services - voice, Internet, ADSL high speed Internet, ISDN
high-speed data and voice. The  Commission's action stems from complaints by Vodafone's German fixed-line operator Arcor and local and regional carriers in Germany.

HD    EU head office fines Deutsche Telekom for unfair pricing

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union Wednesday slapped  Europe's largest phone company, Deutsche Telekom AG, with a heavy fine for unfair pricing practices within Germany's local telephone network and warned others it would continue to clamp down on abuses.

The EU's executive  Commission fined Germany's former state-owned monopoly 12.6 million  euro (USD14.7 million) following a probe centering on the abuse of a dominant position in the local market. It ruled Telekom prevented rivals entering the market for voice and data connections, including high-speed Internet or broadband services.

TD
EU antitrust watchdog Mario Monti said Telekom charged competitors higher fees for access to its local network than it charged its own subscribers, leaving new entrants no margin to compete for end consumers.

"This is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring overall prices down," Monti said in a statement.

"That is why we have acted against unfair prices by  Deutsche Telekom and are determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature," he said, warning other market players in the 15-nation EU to play by the rules.

The EU launched a probe into  Deutsche Telekom a year ago, based on complaints from several rivals that seek access to the lucrative German market.

The practice has helped Telekom maintain a market share of 95 percent even though its home market has been open to competition since 1998.

On calculating the  fine, the Commission took into account the gravity and duration of the abusive behavior and concluded Telekom had committed a "serious abuse" on both points.

HD      Deutsche fined E12.6m over loop access

The European Commission has fined Deutsche Telekom E12.6m for charging what were deemed
"unfair prices" for providing access to its fixed telecommunications network, the so-called local loop.

The Commission said the German telecom abused its dominant position by charging new market entrants higher fees for wholesale access to the local loop than what its subscribers pay for fixed line subscriptions.

TD
Last year, Eircom settled a dispute with regulators over the price it was charging rivals such as Esat for access to its local loop.

The Commission said such practices discourage new companies from entering the market and reduce price competition for consumers. "This is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring the overall prices down," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. "That is why we have acted against unfair prices by  Deutsche Telekom and are determined to be vigilant on any infringments of this nature." The local loop is the physical circuit between a customer's premises and the telecommunications operator's - in this case  Deutsche Telekom - local switch.

HD          EU Fines Deutsche Telekom EUR12.6M For Unfair Pricing
WC         577 words

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Wednesday finedDeutsche Telekom
AG (DT) EUR12.6 million for unfair pricing practices within Germany's local telephone network.

The is the first time that the  Commission has found an incumbent operator guilty of abusing its dominant position in more than 20 years.

TD
The probe focused on the local phone network. The  Commission said DT used its dominant position to prevent rivals entering the market for voice and data connections, including high-speed Internet or broadband services.

DT, Europe's largest telecoms company, charged competitors higher fees for access to its local network than it charged its own subscribers. This constituted a clear case of "margin squeeze" because it leaves new entrants no margin to compete for end consumers, the  Commission said.
These unfair practices have helped  DT maintain a 95% market share, even though the market in
Germany has been open to competition since 1998, it added.

Companies found guilty of using unfair pricing practices in the E.U. can be given tough penalties. Maximum fines run as high as 10% of an offender's worldwide annual revenue, although such hefty penalties are rare. Last year,  Deutsche Telekom reported a turnover of EUR53.7 billion.

On calculating the  fine, the E.U. Commission took into account the gravity and duration of the abusive behavior. It concluded that Deutsche Telekom had committed a "serious abuse" on both points. However, it also noted that the company had steadily adjusted its tariffs in a positive manner, a
process that was impeded by regulatory changes after 2002.

The five-year investigation followed complaints by Mannesmann Arcor AG - the German fixed-line unit of Vodafone Group PLC (VOD) - that  Deutsche Telekom was unfairly setting tariffs for wholesale and retail connections.

"At one point, we had to pay EUR12.48 per month for wholesale connections while  DT's residential customers paid EUR11.82," Mannesmann Arcor spokesman Thomas Rompczyk said.
"DT must reduce wholesale prices immediately" following the decision, said  Commission spokesman
Tilman Lueder.

Lueder said the Commission would see in two months whether the abuse had ended and if further measures were necessary.

The DT probe is part of E.U. antitrust chief Mario Monti's campaign to open local telephone networks to promote competition and make broadband cheap and accessible.

"This is clearly harmful to consumers because competition between operators in the best means to bring overall prices down," Monti said, "That is why we have acted against unfair prices by  Deutsche   Telekom and are determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature."

Under E.U. rules, incumbents must give rivals access to the wire running from their central office switch to a customer's home or office.

Incumbents like DT have been "preventing the development of the competition in broadband services," the Commission said last year.

So far only 1 million lines have been opened to competitors in  Europe, the Commission said. Ironically, most of them are in Germany, but even here rivals still only operate about 5% of broadband lines.
A Deutsche Telekom spokesman said the company hasn't yet received the decision. Once it does, the
Bonn-based operator will analyze the decision and then comment, the spokesman said. "At first
glance, it's incomprehensible," he said.

AMERICAN MARKETS OUTLOOK: U.S. stocks are expected to open in a cautious frame of mind as fears of fresh terror attacks weigh on investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average future is down 23 points, and the Nasdaq 100 future is down 2.5 points. Spreadbettor Cantor Index picks the DJIA to open down just 3 points, or 0.1% at 8488.36, while the Nasdaq is seen up 0.5 point, or 0.1% at 1491.59. "The lack of positive economic data is nerve-racking in the extreme and the negative comments about the greenback and possibly declining interest rates do stock markets few favors," said one trader. He added that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's appearance before Congress later Wednesday will be closely monitored.

TD
EUROPEAN MIDDAY MARKETS:  European shares are lower due to nervousness over terrorist activity and on indications the U.S. share markets will be suffering a down day Wednesday. The FTSE 100 index is down 1.3%, while the CAC-40 index is down 1.5%. The dollar is also lower in reaction to the
heightened terrorist threat in the U.S. and a TV interview with George Soros in which he said he is going short of the dollar in the wake of the abandonment of the strong dollar policy.  European bonds are
mixed as the market awaits Greenspan's testimony before Congress at 1330 GMT.

BRUSSELS, May 21 (Xinhua) - The European Commission (EC), the executive arm of the  European Union (EU), on Wednesday fined Deutsche Telekom (DT) 12.6 million euros (about 14.8 million US dollars) for thwarting competition.


The EC said in a statement that the German telecom giant was charging start-up rivals too much to access its local networks. The EC has found that
DT charged new entrants higher fees for
wholesale access to the local loop than DT's subscribers paid for fixed line subscriptions.
"This discourages new companies from entering the market and reduces the choice of suppliers of telecom services as well as price competition for consumers," said the EC.
Since 1998, DT has been legally obliged to provide competitors

TD
access to its local loops. In spite of this clear obligation,  DT, with a market share of 95 percent, remains the dominant provider for broadband and narrowband retail access, the EC said.

"This is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring the overall prices down," said EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

He added that the EC's action stemmed from complaints by numerous new entrants in the German telecommunications market.

The European Commission fined German telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom 12.6m euro
(US$14.76m) for unfair pricing practices today (21 May 2003). In a statement, the Commission said
that the  fine was due to Deutsche Telekom's abuse of its dominant position when providing access to
its local loops. It further stated that Deutsche Telekom charges companies higher fees for wholesale
access to the local loop than what its subscribers pay for their fixed-line subscriptions, thus discouraging
new players from entering the market and reducing price competition for consumers.

The following are the main stories from Wednesday's German newspapers:
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG

TD
- The head of the German doctor's lobby says the government's planned health reforms will only stir up mistrust between patients and doctors by restricting the choice of doctors and rationing medical services.

- The majority of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) regional state members groups say they support the key aspects of his planned programme for social and welfare reforms, but say they also want to implement their own amendments to it.

- The European Commission is set to fine Germany's telecoms giant  Deutsche Telekom on Wednesday 10 to 15 million euros for abusing their position as market leaders to unfair advantage against competitors.
HANDELSBLATT

- German rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DBN.UL) is to sack two board members, the heads of passenger traffic and marketing, amid ongoing criticism of its new price system and weak revenues from long-haul trips. Company chief Hartmut Mehdorn said that penalties for ticket cancellations would be drastically reduced.

- Germany's powerful engineering worker's union IG Metall say strikes will begin in eastern Germany in early June after talks between employers and unions over the introduction of a 35-hour-week in eastern Germany break down.

- The head of German beverage group Brau und Brunnen, Michael Hollmann, (BBAG.DE) says Germany's second biggest bank HVB Group (HVMG.DE) is ready to sell its 55 percent stake in the loss-making drinks company, which posted an operating loss of 25.6 million  euros for 2002.
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG

- Finance Minister Hans Eichel and SPD parliamentary floor leader Franz Muentefering are at loggerheads over government spending on local communities provided for by Schroeder's planned social and welfare reforms. From the sum of six billion  euros originally earmarked, Eichel plans to spend only 1.6 billion on communities, and use the remainder to pay off national debt, with Muentefering saying the communities should receive the full sum.
- Economy Minister Wolfgang Clement calls for the involvement of German firms in the reconstruction of
Iraq on an official visit to Washington. Clement also said political differences did not extend to the core
of the friendship between the two countries.

- Transport Minister Manfred Stolpe says he is confident of getting parliamentary backing for the introduction of highway tolls for trucks from September. Federal states governed by opposition conservative parties have now agreed on a compromise toll with the government of 0.124  euros per kilometer, lower than the 0.15 originally planned.

DIE WELT

- Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank, warns Germany risks becoming mired in a "debt trap" if the current economic slump does not improve and the government continues to borrow.

- The heads of Germany's leading companies are opposed to government measures to put a cap on their earnings after the idea was mooted by Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries. Volkswagen boss Bernd Pischetsrieder dismissed the idea as absurd, saying competition for top managers was an international matter.

- Leading German gas supplier Ruhrgas (EONG.DE) posts an increase in net income of 63 million euros to 554 million euros for 2002 despite a drop in turnover to 11.9 billion  euros from 13.3 billion euros, partly owing to a decline in gas prices.
BILD

- Increasing numbers of mobile phones are defect-ridden according to a new survey, with 27 percent of users recording a complete breakdown of their phone.

BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros ($14.76 million) on Wednesday for killing competition by charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks.

But the  Commission said Deutsche Telekom had not yet solved the problem, even as late as the adoption of new prices on May 1, 2003.

TD
"DT, with a market share of 95 percent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement.

Competitors need access to the wire running from the  Deutsche Telekom central office switch to a customer's home or office.

The Commission said that from 1998 to 2001 the former incumbent telephone operator charged new entrants higher fees for wholesale access than  DT's subscribers paid for fixed line subscriptions, making it impossible for them to compete.

Starting in 2002,  DT adjusted its prices so that wholesale was lower than retail, but even then it was still not enough to cover  DT's own downstream costs - resulting in continued "margin squeeze".
The Commission said the problem still existed.

"Even after the latest reduction of the wholesale prices by the German regulatory authority, which became effective on 1 May 2003, this margin squeeze remains in place," the  Commission said in a statement.

(Adds EU demand for immediate compliance) By David Lawsky
BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros ($14.8 million) on Wednesday for charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks.

The Commission said new prices set by German regulators on May 1 were still too high and that the company must reduce them immediately.  DT will face another review in two months.

"DT, with a market share of 95 percent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement.

A spokesman for  Deutsche Telekom blasted the decision and said the German telecoms giant may appeal to EU courts.

"We can't comprehend that decision. These are regulated prices," said the spokesman. He said the company would decide about legal measures when it had seen the full decision.

A Commission spokesman dismissed the Telekom statement, saying German regulators set maximum, not minimum, rates.

The spokesman said Telekom must either raise some rates and lower others or cut rates overall to end its legal violations.

"They have to stop immediately and the  Commission will review in two months whether they have complied," Tilman Lueder told reporters.

FINE DOESN'T HURT

A telecommunications analyst in London said that for  Europe's largest telecoms operator, which reported first-quarter revenues of 13.6 billion  euros last week, "this  fine in itself is a minor irritation, it doesn't really hurt".

While the first-quarter earnings beat expectations, however, some analysts warn that the company's future performance partly hinges on how it copes with rising competition for local, fixed-line calls.

Telekom's competitors need access to the wire running from the local telephone exchange to the customer's home or office.

The Commission said that from 1998 to 2001, the former monopoly telephone service provider charged new entrants higher fees for wholesale access than it charged its own retail customers for fixed-line subscriptions, making it impossible to compete.

Starting in 2002 Telekom adjusted its prices so that the wholesale price was lower than retail. But the Commission said the difference was so narrow that Telekom itself could not have made money at that rate.

In determining cost, the  Commission used the weighted average of four retail telephone services - voice, Internet, ADSL high speed Internet, ISDN high-speed data and voice.

The Commission's action stems from complaints by Vodafone's German fixed-line operator Arcor and local and regional carriers in Germany.

BRUSSELS, May 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission fined German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros ($14.8 million) on Wednesday for charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks.
The Commission said lower fees set by the German regulator on May 1 were still too high and that
Europe's largest telecoms carrier must either reduce them immediately or hike prices for
end-consumers, which would help smaller rivals to compete.

TD
"DT, with a market share of 95 percent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access," said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a statement.

A spokesman for  Deutsche Telekom blasted the decision and said the German telecoms giant may appeal to EU courts.

"We can't comprehend that decision. These are regulated prices," said the spokesman. He said the company would decide about legal measures when it had seen the full decision.

As a former monopoly, many of  Deutsche Telekom's fees are fixed by the German telecoms regulator, including both the line rental it charges rivals and subscription rates for consumers.

But a Commission spokesman dismissed the Telekom statement, saying the regulators set maximum, not minimum, rates. The spokesman said Telekom must raise consumer fees or lower wholesale fees to end its legal violations.

"They have to stop immediately and the  Commission will review in two months whether they have complied," Tilman Lueder told reporters.

Deutsche Telekom last year asked for approval to raise monthly rates for plain voice subscriptions by
99 cents, but the regulator only allowed a 33 cent hike. Sources close to the regulator have said they
might reconsider their decision after an EU  fine.

FINE DOESN'T HURT

A telecommunications analyst in London said that for  Europe's largest telecoms operator, which reported first-quarter revenues of 13.6 billion  euros last week, "this  fine in itself is a minor irritation, it doesn't really hurt".

While the first-quarter earnings beat expectations, however, some analysts warn that the company's future performance partly hinges on how it copes with rising competition for local, fixed-line calls.

Shares in Deutsche Telekom were little affected by the news, trading up 1.9 percent at 12.13  euros by 1501 GMT, outperforming a weaker German blue-chip index DAX as well as the  European telecoms index.

Telekom's competitors need access to the wire running from the local telephone exchange to the customer's home or office.

Starting in 2002 Telekom adjusted its prices so that the wholesale price was lower than retail. But the Commission said the difference was so narrow that Telekom itself could not have made money at that rate.

Spokesman Reijo Kemppinen said that following the midday briefing on Wednesday, there would be a press conference by Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pedro Solbes on public finances in  European Monetary Union (EMU) 2003. - - - -
TOBACCO-BYRNE
Kemppinen said that the World Health Assembly had unanimously adopted a global Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Geneva on Wednesday.

"Health Commissioner David Byrne welcomes the adoption as a historic moment and the first ever international treaty for public health," he said.

"The European Union has played a leading role in developing and promoting tobacco control policies within the Community and in this process. The Convention that is adopted now represents the outcome of three years of negotiations. It signals the commitment of governments all over the world to fight the tobacco scores," he added.

GENERAL INTEREST SERVICES

Spokesman Gerassimos Thomas said the Commission has adopted a green paper on Wednesday to stimulate a discussion on the role of the European Union in promoting provision of high-quality public services. It is the first time that the Commission has launched a full review of its policies relating to services of general interest.

The Green Paper opens the debate on the overall role of the  European Union for defining the objectives of general interest that are pursued by those services and on the way they are organised, financed and evaluated.

"It also underlines the significant contribution of the internal market and of the competition rules to modernising and improving the quality and efficiency of many public services," he said.

"It will be completed by the 15th of September, it is a public consultation and on the basis of the contribution we will receive, we will make a proposal," he added.

Kemppinen said the  Commission, on Wednesday had taken the decision to accept the request of Eurostat  Director General Yves Franchet and Director Daniel Byk to be transferred to new posts for the duration of the on-going investigations by  European anti-fraud office (OLAF).
"This is not a disciplinary measure. Mr Franchet and Mr Byk asked for this because they want to
protect the interest of this institution and the  Commission accepted it because we want to give them a
proper chance to defend themselves against all allegations.

"Second, the  Commission has decided to assist them in preserving their reputation and their rights to defence. Third, it has requested the Directorate General for Budget to analyse the audit reports drafted by Eurostat  with respect to compliance of Financial Regulation in this case.

"Finally, the  Commission has decided on the principle of introducing its own complaint in investigation opened by the Paris public prosecutor in order to protect the Communities civil and financial interests," he said.
"This Commission takes these allegations very seriously," he added.

Brussels, 20/05/2003 (Agence Europe) - On Wednesday, the  Commission is expected to impose a  fine of several million euros upon Deutsche Telekom for abuse of dominant position, Reuters says, reproaching it for having prevented access by possible competitors to the German market for telephone and telematic communications in order to keep a market share of 98%. More particularly, the dispute originates in obstruction to uncoupling of the local loop, this last part of the network which links the telephone office switch to a customer's home or office, on the part of  Deutsche Telekom. According to the Commission, the German operator applies more for wholesale access to the wire than it does a retail subscription, making it uneconomic for rival firms to compete.  Deutsche Telekom had already, for the first time, reviews its tariffs downward but not sufficiently, says a source familiar with the dossier.

Mannesmann Arcor and local and regional operators have complained to the  Commission about this situation.

The European Commission is widely expected to announce its decision on whether to  fine Deutsche    Telekom for preventing competitors access to markets on May 21. The advisory committee met on May
19 to make a final decision, but no announcement is expected until the  Commission's weekly meeting on Wednesday. However, there has been much speculation that the German incumbent will have to pay up tens of millions of  Euro for its behaviour in the local telecommunications market (see  European Report
2775, same Section).Since 1998, when  Deutsche Telekom was forced to allow its competitors access to the 'local loop', other firms have only managed to take five percent of the market. As a result, prices for consumers have not fallen since the market was supposedly opened up. "The full benefits of competition are not playing a role in Germany", a spokesman for the  Commission's Competition department told European Report.

TD
The problem is that  DT has been charging its competitors more for line rental than it charges its end users. Hence, the competitors would have to create negative efficiencies to make any profit on the market. According to the spokesman, 15 firms complained to the  Commission, including Arcor, which was the first to sign an access agreement with  DT in 1998.

BRUSSELS, May 21 -- The  European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros, or
$14.7 million, today for overcharging competitors for access to its local phone network.

The commission, the year-round executive arm of the  European Union, said that from 1998 to 2001, Deutsche Telekom charged competitors more for access to its network than it charged its retail customers. Saying that this made it impossible for rivals to compete, the  commission concluded that Deutsche Telekom was abusing its dominant position during this period.

TD
The company attracted regulators' attention before other former state telephone monopolies because Germany was the first  European Union country to try to deregulate its telecommunications market, opening it to competition.

But five years after deregulation was introduced,  Deutsche Telekom still controls 95 percent of the German phone market that includes fixed-line phone links, high-speed Internet access and data transfer services.

The commission noted that while wholesale rates were reduced in 2002 and again at the beginning of this month, Deutsche Telekom was still unfairly squeezing rivals' profit margins.
It gave the company two months to reduce wholesale rates further, or face further sanctions.

''Many new entrants have tried to compete with the incumbent operator,'' said Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner. ''None of them has been able to reach a significant market share.''

Deutsche Telekom said it did not understand the rationale of the  commission's decision. ''All prices are set by the German regulator,'' a spokesman, Hans Ehnert, said. He added that the company would check the situation before issuing a more detailed response to the decision.

The commission acted in response to complaints from 16 competitors in 1998 and 1999. It declined to disclose the names of those filing the complaints, but these are said to include companies that set up fiber optic telecommunications networks in western German cities including Cologne, Dusseldorf, Dortmund and Hanover.

The rivals' fiber optic lines do not extend beyond local phone exchanges, which is why they need access to Deutsche Telekom's ''last mile'' phone lines to homes and businesses to compete for subscriptions to services like high-speed Internet access.

A European Union law on opening local phone networks was passed at the end of 2000, but progress in other European markets has been even slower than in Germany. A survey conducted by the commission in November showed that only one million phone lines in the 15 nations of the  European Union had been opened to competition. Some 855,000 of those are in Germany. And Britain has only

Page 91 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
1,500 local phone lines where rivals are competing with the BT Group, formerly the monopoly widely known as British Telecom.

''In many countries, there is almost no take-up by competitors,'' the  commission's spokesman on competition matters, Tilman Luder, said. ''The fact that we are taking action against Germany today doesn't mean there is a special problem in the German market. It just means that  Deutsche Telekom was legally obliged to unbundle its local loop before other former state monopolies.''

Mr. Monti warned other former monopolies that similar antitrust investigations against them could follow. ''We are determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature,'' he said.

Although wireless LAN (WLAN) still is at a "very early stage of development" in Western  Europe, with most launches in late 2002-early 2003, it "has become an important issue" there and would keep growing in 2003-2004, Pyramid Research analyst Nicholas McQuire said.

TD
He said enterprise and business traveler segments would bring a "greater opportunity" for WLAN takeoff
in the long term, "provided there is integration with cellular platforms." McQuire said WLAN was a threat to
existing GPRS access services: "While mobility demands are increasing, 3G rollout continues to delay
driving WLAN expansion." He said WLAN was a "cheap and easy" alternative to cellular data access, and
WLAN terminals were "proliferating courtesy of aggressive vendor push." By 2005, he projected, 100% of
all new notebooks purchased would have embedded Wi-Fi capability, and by 2007, almost 7 million
WLAN laptops would have entered the Western  European marketplace: "We don't expect 3G services [to
be fully deployed] across Western  Europe market until 2004, and WLAN will have plenty of time to take
roots." However, he said, high access prices have "inhibited demand for Wi-Fi" in the region, as WE users
on average paid "much more than their U.S. counterparts for WLAN access. Widespread uptake will be
achieved when rates reach a level of parity with the U.S." The overall WE average for unlimited access is
about 80 euros, McQuire said: "This price is too high and has to drop at least 50%... across  Europe to
stimulate demand." He said demand had been also inhibited by a perception of poor security despite the
correction of flaws: "WEP's [Wired Equivalent Privacy] vulnerability has been the biggest stumbling block.
Yet poor security has been exaggerated in similar measure as enthusiasts have overhyped WLAN."
McQuire said "land grab" had taken priority over customer service, with rollouts focusing on cafes and not
on corporate hubs: "Retail hot spots in cafes have failed to capture lucrative enterprise customers,
traditionally the early adopters." Also, he said, few national and international roaming services were
offered to customers. Enterprises and business traveler hubs would drive the adoption of Wi-Fi, McQuire
said: "Airports, train stations and enterprises have the largest concentration of business 'road warriors,'
the most active wireless data users." He said the case for enterprise WLAN was "justified in terms of
productivity gains and infrastructure improvements. Enterprise services could be linked seamlessly to
travel and retail hot spots." He said 6% of enterprises in Western  Europe would deploy WLAN by 2007:
"Users are looking into receiving higher bandwidth service from WLAN, they don't expect to receive
regular DSL." In a separate study, Infonetics Research said worldwide WLAN hardware revenue hit
$481.9 million in the first quarter and was expected to reach $2 billion for the full year. It said access point
revenue grew 12% in the first quarter to $304.7 million. It said access points based on the 802.11g draft
standard accounted for $33.5 million in revenue in their first full quarter of shipping, an immediate 11%
share of access point revenue, which was forecast to rise to 28% of the total access point revenue by the
end of the year. -- SP

The European Commission (EC) said it fined Deutsche Telekom (DT) 12.6 million euros for charging anticompetitive tariffs for access to its local networks. The EC said DT, which still held 95% market share even though the German telecom market had been open to competition since 1998, was charging new entrants higher fees for wholesale access to the local loop than  DT's subscribers paid for fixed line subscriptions: "This constitutes a clear case of margin squeeze because it leaves new entrants no margin to compete for downstream retail subscribers." The EC said the margin squeeze remained even after the latest reduction of wholesale prices by the German regulatory authority RegTP, which became effective May 1: "This discourages new companies from entering the market and reduces the choice of suppliers of telecoms services as well as price competition for consumers." EC Competition Comr. Mario Monti said

such practice was "clearly harmful to consumers" and said the  Commission was "determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature."

A number of larger service providers in the U.K. for the first time will have to contribute to the U.K. Office of Telecom (Oftel) running costs under new funding arrangements released Wed. However, the regulator said it would remove an "unnecessary burden" of paying fees by 100 smaller service providers after July
25, when the new EC communications directives become effective. Under the current arrangements, license holders under the Telecom Act pay a fee for funding Oftel. However, Oftel said the new EC directives would abolish telecom licenses, replacing payment of fees with administration costs charges, which would be paid by electronic communications companies with an annual turnover of at least $8.2 million. Oftel also said it wouldn't require advance notification from the companies providing electronic communications services, allowing them to offer the services without having to inform Oftel first as long as they met the general requirements. Oftel Dir. Gen.-Telecom David Edmonds said "those companies who [are] subject to regulation should pay the costs of that regulation." He said he expected that Oftel's funding arrangements would be passed to the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is to replace Oftel at the end of the year: "However, it will be up to Ofcom to decide how they develop future funding
arrangements."

FLAG Telecom said it would enhance its  European network through an agreement with Verizon.

The European Commission (EC) has fined the German telecommunications company  Deutsche           Telekom 12.6 mln euro ($14.7 mln) for alleged unfair pricing practices, the EC said on May 21, 2003.

According to the EC, Deutsche Telekom charged new entrants on the telecommunications market higher fees for local network than Deutsche Telekom subscribers paid for fixed line subscriptions. The higher fees lead to discouraging of new companies to enter the telecom market and hindering the price competition, the EC added. Deutsche Telekom had been legally obligated to allow competitors to access its local network in 1998. Deutsche Telekom has a market share of 95 pct in Germany and is the dominant provider of telecommunications services and broadband Internet in  Europe. [Editor's note: Deutsche Telekom posted an 850 mln euro ($989.8 mln) net profit for the first quarter of 2003, compared to a net loss of 1.8 bln  euro ($2.1 bln) for the same period of 2002.]

DEUTSCHE Telekom has been fined GBP 9 million by the  European Commission for charging rivals too much to gain access to its local networks.
The Commission said new prices set by German regulators on May 1 were still too high and ordered
Deutsche Telekom to reduce them immediately.

TD
Competition commissioner Mario Monti said: "Deutsche Telekom, with a market share of 95 per cent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access."

But a spokesman for  Deutsche Telekom blasted the decision and said the German telecoms giant may appeal to EU courts. He said: "We can't comprehend that decision. These are regulated prices."

However a Commission spokesman dismissed Deutsche Telekom's statement, saying German regulators set maximum, not minimum, rates.

He said the group must either raise some rates and lower others, or cut rates overall to end its legal violations. "They have to stop immediately and the  Commission will review in two months whether they have complied," he said.

Deutsche Telekom's competitors need access to the wires running from the local telephone exchange to the customer's home or office.

The Commission said that from 1998 to 2001, the former telecoms monopoly charged new entrants higher fees for wholesale access than it charged its own retail customers for fixed-line subscriptions.

A test case over internet access and the "local loop" finally drew to a close yesterday when the
European Commission imposed a symbolic fine of Euros 12.6m ( $14.7m) on  Deutsche Telekom and
ordered it to change its pricing policy in the next two months.

After a four-year investigation, the Brussels competition authority found  DT guilty of abusing its dominant position by charging competitors higher fees to use its local network than it did customers.

TD
Local loop unbundling, in which former incumbents have to allow high-speed internet companies to use their networks, has been a central  European Union policy for the past three years.

Many companies prefer to buy internet access wholesale from incumbents, because of the cost of the physical infrastructure for the local loop.

In a statement, Mario Monti, competition Commissioner, said that in Germany there was "very little effective unbundling of the local loops and  DT, with a market share of 95 per cent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access". The  Commission has also been looking at a similar case involving Wanadoo, France Telecom's internet arm, which it alleges has been offering internet services below cost.

Hans Ehnert, spokesman for  Deutsche Telekom, said: "We really cannot understand the rationale for this decision because our prices are set by RegTP (the German telecommunications regulator).

"And why should we be made responsible for the earnings of rival companies?"  DT charges competitors Euros 11.80 a month for access to the local loop against  Euros 11.82 for its customers. The access charge for rivals, effective since the beginning of May and set for the next two years, was set by RegTP last month and represented a 5.45 per cent drop from its previous level.

The Commission said the "margin squeeze" between  DT's competitors and clients was still in place, but reduced the fine from an original Euros 14m, partly because of the role of RegTP.

DT, which has accused competitors of seeking access to its network while refusing to share the huge investments its construction and maintenance entailed, said it would study the  Commission's arguments before deciding whether to appeal.  www.ft.com/telecoms

EU Fines Deutsche Telekom Over Fee Practices

TD
BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom AG 12.6 million  euros ($14.8 million) for its pricing practices within Germany's local-telephone network.

The commission said Deutsche Telekom used its dominant telecommunications position to prevent rivals from entering the market for voice-and-data connections, including high-speed Internet or broadband services.

Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecom company, charged competitors higher fees for access to its local network than it charged its own subscribers, the  commission said. This constituted a clear case of "margin squeeze" because it leaves new entrants no margin to compete for end consumers. It added that those practices helped  Deutsche Telekom maintain a 95% market share, even though the market in Germany has been open to competition since 1998.

Companies found guilty of using unfair pricing practices in the  European Union can be given tough penalties. Maximum  fines run as high as 10% of an offender's world-wide annual revenue, though such hefty penalties are rare.  Deutsche Telekom reported revenue of 53.7 billion  euros for 2002.

A Deutsche Telekom spokesman said the company would comment as soon as it received and analyzed the commission's decision.

NATO Agrees to Support Polish Mission in Iraq

BRUSSELS -- The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to support the Polish peacekeeping mission in Iraq, overcoming some of the bitter trans-Atlantic divisions the war there caused and leaving open the option of a greater role for the alliance in Iraq.

The United Nations Security Council is expected this week to consider a resolution that would lift economic sanctions on Iraq, allow the U.S.-led coalition to continue running the country and give the U.N. a limited role in Iraq. Taken together, the NATO decision and passage of the U.N. resolution would signal that the U.S. and  Europe are prepared to work together.

Poland, which contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition, will be in charge of one of the three peacekeeping zones. Looking for broader legitimacy, and some logistical support, the Poles asked NATO for technical assistance. NATO's role will stop far short of a full-scale involvement, but it sends an important political message.

NATO moved surprisingly quickly to approve the Polish request, in sharp contrast with the acrimonious monthlong talks held this year about defending Turkey from any Iraqi attack. During that discussion, France, Germany and Belgium opposed approving the defensive measures, arguing that doing so

Page 103 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would signal the inevitability of war with Baghdad. Eventually, NATO managed to push through the proposals, but only after isolating France and damaging the unity of the alliance.

This time, all three countries backed the Polish request -- in part because they wanted to avoid plunging the alliance into another crisis.

Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, welcomed the decision to support Poland as a sign that the alliance has overcome its crisis.

Malaysian Premier Tries to Spur the Economy
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced a larger-than-expected
7.3 billion ringgit ($1.92 billion) stimulus package as well as measures to boost domestic demand in an
effort to prop up Malaysia's slowing economy.

The size of the package, combined with a surprising interest-rate cut, indicates that the government is increasingly concerned about a weakening economy. Many analysts expected about two billion ringgit in new spending commitments. In addition to the spending plans, the government introduced an array of temporary tax cuts that will save targeted businesses about 800 million ringgit.
In March, Kuala Lumpur cut its projection for this year's inflation-adjusted growth to 4.5% from between
6% and 6.5%, and economists had anticipated further downward revisions. But Dr. Mahathir, who is
also finance minister, said he still expects to meet this year's 4.5% growth target.

To promote consumer spending, the government cut to 9% from 11% mandatory pension contributions by salaried private-sector workers, and it will pay Malaysia's nearly one million civil servants a one-time bonus.

Malaysia also cut the central bank's "intervention rate" -- the interest rate at which it lends to commercial banks -- to 4.5% from 5%.

Brazil to Look Into Report on AES and Enron

SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Potentially deepening AES Corp.'s troubles in Brazil, the Brazilian energy minister said she will investigate a news media report that AES and Enron Corp. colluded during bidding for a state utility privatized in 1998.

AES is struggling to retain that utility, Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de Sao Paulo SA, after defaulting on a $1.2 billion loan from the government's national development bank, BNDES. The allegation raised in a Financial Times report may strengthen those in BNDES who want to strip AES of control of Eletropaulo, Brazil's biggest utility, rather than renegotiate the debt.

Mauro Arce, a Brazilian official who was involved in the 1998 auction, said yesterday that no illegal act was committed by AES. Even if an impropriety is found, it is doubtful that the government could take punitive steps against AES, because the deadline for appeals against the privatization has passed. But

Page 104 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
the matter could spark a political ruckus: Many members of the governing leftist Workers Party have long sought an inquiry into the previous government's massive sale of state utilities and telephone companies.

The Financial Times reported that hours before the auction for Eletropaulo, AES, acting on behalf of a consortium of foreign and Brazilian investors, signed a deal with Enron promising lucrative contracts to the Houston company if it didn't bid for Eletropaulo. The consortium that included AES won Eletropaulo for the minimum price of $1.78 billion.

Although the AES consortium was apparently unaware of it, Enron had already dropped out of the bidding, officials close to Enron said. A company spokesman confirmed that Enron signed the reported deal with the AES consortium after "we received the approval of outside Brazilian counsel. But when it appeared that this may not have been accurate advice, we rescinded the deal immediately and took no benefit from it," he said.

An AES executive in Arlington, Va., said AES is conducting a probe into the allegation. The AES-linked executives involved in the bidding process, Tom Tribone, Luiz David Travesso and Oscar Prieto, have denied involvement in the reported deal. None of the three still works for AES.
-- Jonathan Karp

BRASILIA -- Brazil's central bank left interest rates unchanged, despite calls for cuts by some cabinet members.

Brussels, 21/05/2003 (Agence Europe) - As indicated (see  EUROPE yesterday p 21), on Wednesday, the Commission decided to fine Deutsche Telekom EUR 12.6 million for charging anti-competitive tariffs for access to its local networks. The Commission says that the German company imposes the higher tariffs on this part of the network than its competitors making competition impossible. In a communique the Commission says that DT has 95% of the retail access market to broad an narrow band.

THE European Commission has fined Deutsche Telekom EUR 12.6 million for charging its rivals too much for access to its local networks - and given the company two months to change its prices.

The ruling follows complaints from rivals in the EU's biggest phone market, who claimed they were squeezed out of sectors such as broadband internet `DSL' services by the German giant.

TD
Officials found  Deutsche Telekom had charged competitors more for access to its local networks than it charged retail customers from 1998-2001.

That changed last year, but the difference between wholesale and retail tariffs was still not enough to enable rivals to operate a profitable service and compete with a company that enjoys a 95% share of the German phone sector.

Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said: "That is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring the price down."

Deutsche Telekom said it might appeal against the ruling, adding that its prices are regulated by the
Germany telecom watchdog RegTP.

The European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom AG 12.6 million euros ($14.8-million U.S.) related to its pricing practices within Germany's local-telephone network. The commission said Deutsche Telekom used its dominant telecommunications position to prevent rivals from entering the market for voice-and-data connections.

BRUSSELS:

The European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom AG 12.6 million ($14.7 million) on Wednesday for overcharging rivals for access to the German company's local phone network. The  commission said that from 1998 to 2001, the company charged competitors more for access to the so-called local loop of
phone lines that run between homes and local phone exchanges than it charged its retail customers, making it impossible for rivals to compete.

TD
The commission decided that Telekom had abused its dominant position during the period. By commission standards, the  fine is relatively small because it covers a relatively short period. Wholesale prices were reduced in 2002 and again at the start of this month, but the  commission said Telekom was still unfairly squeezing rivals' margins for profit. It gave Telekom two months to reduce wholesale prices or face further sanctions.

Many new entrants have tried to compete with the incumbent operator, the competition commissioner, Mario Monti, said. None of them has been able to reach a significant market share.

A Telekom spokesman, Hans Ehnert, said the company did not understand the rationale of the decision. All prices are set by the German regulator, he said. Germany was the first in the  European Union to pass laws intended to unbundle its local telecom loop to open access to competitors. But five years after the laws were passed, Telekom still controls 95 percent of the market, the  commission said. A European Union law on local loop unbundling was passed at the end of 2000, but progress in other European markets has been even slower than in Germany. A survey by the  commission in November showed only about 1 million phone lines in the EU had been opened up to competition and 855,000 of those were in Germany. By comparison, in Britain, there are only 1,500 local phone lines where rivals are competing with the former British public monopoly, BT Group PLC.

The fact that we are taking action against Germany today doesn't mean there is a special problem in the German market, a  commission spokesman said. Monti warned other former monopolies that they too might face similar investigations.

HD   Slovak Telecom Claims it Needs Six Months to Elaborate a New RIO. WC  359 words

BRATISLAVA, May 22, (SITA) - Dominant fixed-line telecommunications operator Slovak Telecom (ST) claims it is unable to elaborate the reference interconnection offer (RIO) for leasing local loops sooner than six months. However, the revised telecommunications act adopted in parliament on Wednesday obliges the dominant operator to elaborate the offer and technically prepare interconnection of networks within sixty days. Vice-president of Slovak Telecom's communications department Jan Kondas maintains that unawareness of deputies about problems and complexities of the RIO elaboration process has played a significant role in voting on the revision. "None of the deputies who voted for the revision has any
experience from drawing up a reference interconnection offer," said Mr. Kondas in response to the adopted revision.

TD
The representative of Slovak Telecom maintains that it has taken over one year for dominant telecommunications operators in  European Union countries to elaborate reference interconnection offers. He added that apart from economic matters linked with the interconnection price and calculation of relevant costs and profit, the operator must address security of the network. Slovak President Rudolf Schuster must sign the revision to make it into law. The revision unbundles local loops, changes license proceedings and strengthens the powers of market regulator, the Telecommunications Office. President Schuster has vetoed an almost identical bill last year and afterwards parliament failed to re-approve it. In effect, although Slovak Telecom no longer has the monopoly for fixed-line voice service in Slovakia, no other operator on the
market can provide the service because of protracted negotiations on an interconnection of networks. Slovak Telecom, controlled by German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom, lost more than 8 percent of its customers last year. This week, the European Commission has fined the former German monopoly EUR 12.6 million for charging rivals too much for access to its local loops in Germany.  Deutsche Telekom holds 51 percent in Slovak Telecom. The Slovak Ministry of Transport, Postal Services and Telecommunications owns 34 percent, and governmental privatization agency the National Property Fund (FNM) holds the remaining 15 percent. (EUR 1 = SKK 41.174 on May 22).

ECONOMICS

* Hopes of further cuts in interest rates rose sharply after minutes of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee showed that its vote to hold borrowing costs this month had members divided five to four in favour of no change. The division was the sharpest since January 2001.

TD
* A surprise surge in tax receipts in April, the first month of the financial year, failed to prevent a worse than expected outcome for the cash position of the public finances. The public sector net cash requirement last month slid into the red by £200 million, confounding City forecasts for a £2 billion surplus. The disappointment was despite a 5.5 per cent rise in tax revenues compared with the same month last year.

* Gordon Brown provoked new charges of government "cronyism" after he picked four prominent figures with strong ties to Labour as replacement non-executive directors for the Bank of England.

* Mortgage lending continued to rise strongly in April, with a gain of £5.2 billion. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said gross mortgage lending totalled £21 billion in April, just below the record £21.2 billion figure for last July. Loans for remortgaging totalled £10.7 billion.
* The Bank of England's annual report revealed that its pension fund is projected to sink into deficit to
the tune of £293 million in 2003, against a surplus of £206 milllion last year. The deficit emerged despite
a higher projected return on equities in the fund of 8.8 per cent.

* Managers of unit trusts will be free to charge performance-related fees as a result of a sweeping overhaul of the rules on investment funds by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator.

* South Africa's Investec reported a £56 million annual pre-tax loss, compared with a £45 million profit last time, dragged down by provisions in its US business.

51 per cent surge in full-year operating profits to 737.23 billion yen ( £3.85 billion). Net profits grew 33
per cent to Y495.17 billion on sales of Y6.829 trillion.

* As a result, Renault has predicted that Nissan would contribute  Euro 859 million ( £612 million) to its first-half net results. The French carmaker had previously estimated that its Japanese partner would contribute about  Euro 750 million to its first-half earnings.

The European Union slapped German telecom giant  Deutsche Telekom AG [NYSE:  DT] with a $14.7 million fine for unfair pricing practices within Germany's local telephone network, and warned that it would do the same for similar abuses. The EU's executive  commission ruled DT prevented rivals from entering the market for voice and data connections, including high-speed Internet or broadband services. The EU launched a probe into  DT a year ago, based on complaints from several rivals that seek access to the German market.

Earlier this month, DT reported a first-quarter profit of 853 million  euros (US $979million) compared to a loss of 1.8 billion euros (US $2.1 billion) a year ago. The results marked the company's first quarterly profit in almost two years.

HD     TELECOMMUNICATIONS - DEUTSCHE TELEKOM FINED EURO 12.6 MILLION FOR OVER-CHARGING.

The European Commission fined Deutsche Telekom Euro 12.6 million on May 21 for charging its competitors too much for access to its fixed telecommunications network. "We have imposed this  fine because we found that  Deutsche Telekom was abusing its dominant position by charging new entrants higher fees for access to its copper wires than it was charging end users", said a Commission spokesman. "We want competitors to have competitive wholesale access prices." DT now has two months to cease its anti-competitive behaviour.

TD
Deutsche Telekom has been legally obliged to provide competitors access to its local loop since 1998. However, with a comfortable market share of 95%, it remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access. The fact that  DT has been charging more to its competitors for access than it charges end users has discouraged companies from entering the market and meant that those who have tried have not been able to reach significant market share. "This is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring the overall prices down", said Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. His spokesman told  European Report that 15 firms have complained to the Commission, including Arcor, which was the first to sign an access agreement with  DT in 1998.Margin squeeze.

The abuse regards both wholesale and the retail access to the local loop. Regarding wholesale access, DT is the sole network operator in Germany which has nation-wide coverage. New entrants need access to this infrastructure on a wholesale basis. Between 1998 and 2001,  DT charged competitors more for access at wholesale level than it charged subscribers for access at retail level. This is called 'margin squeeze' as it leaves no real possibility for other firms to compete for downstream retail subscribers. Prices were lowered in 2002 and the German regulator forced  DT to cut prices again in 2003, but neither of these two moves eliminated the margin squeeze.-

The German Government introduced mandatory unbundling in 1998. Community law was brought in two years later, with Regulation 2887/2000 on unbundled access of the local loop. The local loop is normally copper wires between customers' premises and the operator. Other technical infrastructures are possible, including fibre-optic networks, satellites and cable, but these are not yet sufficiently developed to compete with the copper wire network that has been built over a century.

Unbundling is seen as key for spreading electronic communications services and developing competition in this field, which is increasingly important with new internet-based technologies. However, it is not happening fast enough. The  Commission's December 2002 Implementation Report (COM (2002) 695) showed that only a million subscriber lines have been unbundled in  Europe. Most of these (855,000) are in Germany, due to the national requirement to unbundle in 1998.

On Wednesday, the  European Commission decided to fine German telco  Deutsche Telekom E12.6m for price discrimination against rivals seeking access to its fixed-line telecommunications network. A statement from the Commission said that  Deutsche Telekom (DT) was charging new entrants to the German
market higher fees for access to the so-called local loop than what  DT subscribers were paying for fixed-line subscriptions.

The practice meant that new companies were being discouraged from entering Germany's expanding telecommunications market, and consumers were being denied the proper choice of telecom companies. Neither were consumers benefiting from lower prices resulting from free competition, the  Commission said.

TD
According to  Commission sources, several of  DT's rivals had complained about the discrimination and the
E12.6m fine was "in line with the gravity and duration of the abuse."  DT has been legally obliged since
1998 to provide competitors with access to its local loop infrastructure. But the  Commission said DT had
done very little to achieve this.

"Since 1998,  DT has been legally obliged to provide competitors access to its local loops. In spite of this clear obligation, there is still very little effective unbundling of the local loops and  DT, with a market share of
95 per cent, remains the dominant provider of broadband and narrowband retail access. Many new entrants have tried to compete with the incumbent operator.

None of them has been able to reach significant market share, not least because  DT charges competitors higher fees for local loop access than it charges its end users," Competition Commissioner Mario Monti stated in a statement.

"This is clearly harmful to consumers, because competition between operators is the best means to bring the overall prices down. That is why we have acted against unfair prices by  Deutsche Telekom, and are determined to be vigilant on any infringements of this nature," Mario Monti added.

DT was therefore abusing its dominant position through unfair prices, the Commission insisted, adding that despite five years of open competition in the EU telecommunication markets, DT had 95 per cent of the German market, with rivals sharing the remaining 5 percent. As the only telecommunications network with nationwide coverage in Germany,  DT is obliged under EU rules to open up use of its infrastructure to rival companies.

HD         Deutsche Post Buying  Spree Could Face New EU Challenge

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Just as Deutsche Post AG (G.DPW) faces regulatory headaches in the U.S., the German mail giant confronts a new challenge in  Europe that could hamper its acquisition strategy.

TD
U.S. competitor United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is joining with German consumer and express mail groups to complain that Deutsche Post uses high stamp prices within its letters monopoly to help fund acquisitions such as its recent $1.1 billion takeover of Seattle-based Airborne Inc. (ABF).
They want E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to reinvigorate a dormant probe into Deutsche
Post and threaten a  fine that would force stamp prices lower.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. government is already investigating Deutsche Post's purchase of Airborne
- the third-biggest U.S. delivery company and owner of its own air-cargo fleet - for violating federal laws
limiting foreign control of U.S. airlines.
If a judge agrees in August that Airborne's ultimate parent is German, that could set back Deutsche
Post's expansion and derail U.S. regulatory approval.

In Europe, antitrust czar Monti won't be reviewing the Airborne deal but could still deal a blow to Deutsche Post's strategy through his campaign against state-controlled companies that use public money to grow their businesses. Deutsche Post is nearly 70% state-owned.

Armed with nearly EUR40 billion of annual sales, Bonn-based Deutsche Post is much more than a dull national post office. It's become a global logistics giant.

Since 1997, it has made about 40 major acquisitions, buying up local and international delivery services including Brussels-based DHL International Ltd., Switzerland's Danzas, U.K.-based Securicor PLC's (U.SCC) distribution business - and most recently Airborne.

The expansion has put Deutsche Post on a collision course with Atlanta-based UPS, which complains that its German competitor unfairly received government subsidies.

In the past two years, UPS has notched up a number of important victories. In 2001, E.U. regulators fined Deutsche Post EUR24 million for granting parcels discounts on condition that customers sent most of their business via Deutsche Post. This action prevented private companies from competing fairly, the regulators ruled.

Then, last year, the E.U. forced Deutsche Post to pay back money to the German state that it used to fund its generous discounts - even while Deutsche Post ran a loss in its parcels business. With accumulated interest, Deutsche Post had to pay EUR906 million back to the state. Deutsche Post, however, is appealing Monti's decision at the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and at a court in Germany.

The latest tussle is different because it mostly focuses on Deutsche Post's basic letters business rather than the parcel division. Two years ago, disgruntled German consumers complained to Brussels about

Page 127 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
high stamp prices. Deutsche Post successfully rebutted the claims with a study by Arthur D. Little showing that Germany's stamps are priced at roughly the  European average.

UPS was never convinced about the Little study. It hired economists NERA, whose just-finished study accuses Deutsche Post of overcharging by as much as 40%, or EUR1 billion, a year. UPS says the study shows that stamp-buyers pay 8  euro cents more for a domestic stamp than they should.

Tuesday, E.U. officials said it was too early to say whether the new evidence on stamp prices would lead to fines for Deutsche Post. "We've just received the NERA study a few weeks ago," said E.U. spokeswoman Amelia Torres. "We're still examining it and don't have a view at the current stage."

Successful acquisition of Airborne would give Deutsche Post its first major foothold in the U.S. market, an important step in the German company's plans to build a global delivery giant that can rival UPS and FedEx Corp. (FDX) anywhere.

To block the move, the two U.S. carriers are trying to drag Airborne into a battle over Deutsche Post's ties to DHL Airways Inc., the Miami-based airline that flies DHL shipments inside the U.S.

UPS and Memphis-based FedEx claim DHL Airways is controlled by Deutsche Post, which generates about 90% of the airline's revenue through DHL International. Deutsche Post and DHL Airways deny the accusation, saying the two U.S. carriers just want to keep Deutsche Post from expanding on their home turf.
Competitors are pushing Monti to crackdown on Deutsche Post's revenue streams.

"The (E.U)  Commission needs to reopen the stamp prices case," says UPS vice president Anton van der Lande. "The data show Deutsche Post making a rate of return allowing it to cross-subsidize other commercial activities, including making acquisitions that have nothing to do with why the monopoly was granted in the first place."

Competing German mail groups are equally incensed. Deutsche Post is "able to finance acquisitions in part because they are making a 25% profit from stamp sales," says Ralf Wojtek of German Express Organization, BIEK.

Deutsche Post denies those charges. It lowered prices last year under pressure from Germany's own regulator, RegTP and chief executive Klaus Zumwinkel said prices will remain unchanged for the next three years.

There is "absolutely no space" for further cuts, says Deutsche Post spokesman Dirk Klasen. "It's not the case that we save up money from the monopoly business and then use it for acquisitions."

But competitors are adamant Brussels should take action. They point to last month's decision by E.U. officials to slap a EUR12.6 million on  Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) for squeezing competitors - even though the German regulatory authority had already reduced wholesale telephone access charges.

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)-  Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) will probably significantly hike fixed-line telephone fees in Germany this fall after the regulating authority granted it permission Wednesday, German news agency VWD reported.

The authority wants  Deutsche Telekom to raise prices up to 10% to meet its costs, although the decision hasn't yet been formalized, VWD said.

TD
The move is the regulator's solution to a  European Commission criticism that the company was charging rival telecom companies higher fees than it was charging its own end users, VWD said. The European Union's antitrust  commission had fined Deutsche Telekom EUR12.6 million in late May.

The German regulating agency's president, Matthias Kurth, said the company was charging its customers EUR1.41 per connection per month less than it should.

BONN, June 4 (Reuters) - Germany's telecoms regulator said on Wednesday it would allow Deutsche Telekom to raise prices for end consumers and hoped the move would settle an antitrust dispute with the EuropeanCommission.

At a briefing with journalists, RegTP President Matthias Kurth said  Europe's largest telecoms carrier would be allowed to hike prices to the end of next year by around 10 percent.

This could generate up to 600 million  euros ($702 million) in additional income by the end of 2004, he said, adding he hoped it would resolve an antitrust case launched by the  European Commission.

The European Commission last month  fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros for charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks.

It said wholesale fees set by the German regulator on May 1 were still too high and that the former monopoly must either reduce them immediately or hike prices for end consumers, which would help smaller rivals to compete.

Many of Deutsche Telekom's fees are fixed by the German telecoms regulator, including both the line rental it charges rivals and subscription rates for consumers.

SUMMARY

Legal and regulatory risks will be very low. The judiciary is fiercely independent and the legal system will remain highly transparent. Contracts will almost always be enforceable, provided they meet the requirements of the state in which they will apply and are not vaguely worded. Compliance with individual state legal and regulatory requirements can often be under- estimated by foreign investors. The risk of expropriation will be negligible, but restrictions on foreign investment in transport, telecommunications and certain defence-related sectors will continue. Investors will benefit from very high protection of property rights, including those pertaining to intellectual property. Price controls will continue on some regulated monopolies, such as power utilities, in an otherwise unfettered market.
ANALYSIS
* The regulatory framework becomes more onerous (High risk).

President George W Bush came to power with the express intent of paring down the federal government's role in the economy, planning to cut back regulation and intervention. However, the September 11th attacks and a spate of corporate scandals from Enron to WorldCom have prompted radical policy reversals. While the terrorist attacks triggered federal bailouts of the airlines and insurance industry, the
collapse of confidence in US corporate governance has generated a plethora of new regulations. Scandals on Wall Street, especially those involving corporate governance, accounting, and conflicts of interest within investment banks, have received special attention, and the mood in Washington against corporate malfeasance has hardened, culminating in the unexpectedly swift passage in July 2002 of the Corporate Responsibility Bill. The new law, among other things, sets up an independent oversight board for the auditing profession, stiffens penalties for corporate wrongdoers and requires more extensive financial disclosure by companies. A number of measures designed to strengthen the accountability of senior corporate officers have also been introduced by the Securities and Exchange  Commission. Chief executives and chief financial officers of US-based companies with revenue of more than US$1.2bn in
2001 must now swear under oath, and in writing, that the figures in their financial reports are correct, to the best of their knowledge. Foreign investors need to familiarise themselves with these new regulations and pay close attention to further changes to the regulatory environment.

* Barriers to foreign investors increase in strategic sectors (Low risk).

Although foreign investors will continue to enjoy unrestricted access to most of the US economy, the government could increase limitations on foreign investment in sectors deemed sensitive to national security. Restrictions on foreign ownership in transport, telecommunications and energy generation will be strictly enforced and may be tightened, while more business operations associated with defence-related work could be classified and put beyond the realm of foreign investment.
BACKGROUND Enforceability of Contracts
The US has a sophisticated legal system, but one in which contractual arrangements are almost always secure. Contracts must, however, be properly structured and meet the requirements of the state in which the contract will be enforced. The need to comply with individual state legal and regulatory requirements is often under-estimated by foreign firms establishing operations in the US.

Owing to the litigious nature of US society, and the ready availability of legal services, vaguely worded contracts will often be challenged by business partners, and can be invalidated by the courts. Once established, however, most courts--whether at the local, state or federal level--will reliably and
even-handedly enforce contracts.

The US legal system is highly transparent; new laws and legal standards are generally published quickly, whether by local, state or federal jurisdictions. The system is not, however, easily discernible; any contractual undertaking beyond the most basic requires the advice of an experienced attorney. Despite attempts by some business associations to simplify contractual arrangements, legal advice remains a necessity, especially when establishing operations in more than one state.

The US is a common law country. The legal system of every state is based on the common law, except Louisiana (which is based on the French civil code). Common law has no statutory basis; judges establish common law through written opinions that are binding on future decisions of lower courts in the same jurisdiction. Broad areas of the law, most notably relating to property, contracts and torts, are traditionally part of the common law. These areas of the law are mostly within the jurisdiction of the states, and thus state courts are the primary source of common law. The area of federal common law is primarily limited to federal issues that have not been addressed by a statute.

All courts follow a strict set of procedural requirements. In 1938, the Supreme Court promulgated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which are periodically updated and renewed by the US Judicial Conference. They are uniform in all federal jurisdictions, although each federal court may also adopt additional rules. Every state court has its own set of rules, which are typically not as detailed or strict as the federal rules. In courts of original jurisdiction, judges are usually provided with juries to decide all questions of fact. The right to a jury is generally guaranteed by the federal Constitution in federal cases, and state constitutions typically contain similar provisions which apply in state cases.

Every level of the federal courts has the power to interpret the federal Constitution and federal laws and regulations. The courts also exercise judicial review over federal statutes and agency actions, and determine the constitutionality of federal and state laws. To the extent any statute or agency action is found to be unconstitutional, it is invalid. Federal courts also interpret federal legislation and federal agency rules and decisions.
Independence of the Judiciary

Consistent with the structure of the US legal system, judges serve on local, state and federal benches. At all levels, but especially so at the state and federal levels, judges are widely viewed as independent and non- partisan. While they will, in extraordinary cases, come under pressure from governments or private individuals to rule in their favour, there have been relatively few cases of wide-ranging judicial misconduct.

Judicial independence in the federal legal system is rooted in five principles: the constitutional protections afforded judges; the independent administration of the judiciary by the judiciary; a well- established disciplinary system; the manner in which conflicts of interest are addressed; and the assurance that decisions will be implemented.

The US Constitution ensures that federal judges cannot be removed by the government, except in extraordinary cases of misconduct. In such an instance, the judge would be subject to impeachment and trial before, respectively, the US House of Representatives and the Senate. This impeachment power has, however, been used rarely, and then only to remove judges for various forms of personal misconduct. Judges essentially serve for life, and so are less likely to be influenced by transient political issues.

Page 133 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The independence of the judiciary is also protected by the rules under which judges operate. A high-level body, the Judicial Conference of the United States, sets rules of procedure for judges; in effect, the judiciary controls the environment in which judges operate, minimising the chance of political interference. These detailed rules also provide a framework within which judges must operate, limiting the opportunity for bias or prejudice in the administration of the law.

Judges are also restrained by a formal system of judicial discipline, which applies in cases where a judge is accused of misconduct--but where the offence does not rise to the level of an impeachable act. Chief judges are required to investigate complaints against a federal judge, which may lead to a reprimand, a freeze on the assignment of new cases or a request that the judge retire. Judges also face a legal requirement to disqualify themselves in cases where they may have a conflict of interest; they must also investigate whether family members have a financial interest in a case that comes before them.

Finally, the reliability of the legal system is underpinned by the efficacy of judicial decisions. Simply put, virtually all legal decisions are carried out, both because they are enforced by the authorities, but also because of the tradition of the rule of law in the US. In extraordinary cases where a state or local government is unwilling to honour a court's judgement--as happened in the 1950s and 1960s when some states refused to desegregate schools--federal marshals can be empowered by the courts to carry out their decisions.
Foreign Investment: Discriminatory Practices

As a matter of principle, the US does not engage in the nationalisation of industries. US courts have upheld the constitutionality of nationalisation or expropriation of property for public use (provided prompt, adequate and effective compensation is paid and subject to court review). It is highly unlikely that the federal government would exercise this authority over a property solely because it is foreign owned.

No general federal laws govern new investments or expansions by domestic or foreign firms. Foreign investors need not register with the federal government, though the Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States monitors acquisitions by non-US interests. Furthermore, like many countries, the US maintains restrictions on investment in specific sectors deemed sensitive to national security.
By federal law, the areas limited or closed to foreign investment include the following:

* Foreign ownership may not exceed 25% of domestic air-transport firms and coastal or freshwater shipping enterprises.

* Foreigners may purchase up to 49% of a US airline but may own only 25% of voting shares--though US and foreign airlines have sought to evade some of these restrictions by forming alliances. The Justice Department keeps a close eye on the airline industry for any non-competitive behaviour.

* Hydroelectric power companies require a licence from the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, which may issue such permits only to US citizens or domestic corporations. The issue of the degree of foreign ownership of a domestic corporation has never arisen in this area, and there are no specific regulations on this. A company that is the recipient of a voluntary transfer of such a licence must file with the commission for approval of that transfer (a process covered by the Code of Federal Regulations, 18
CFR Section 131.20).

* Foreign firms and individuals may be barred from obtaining operating licences to use certain nuclear materials.
* The Defence Department restricts work on classified US government contracts.

* Foreign firms may invest in communications industries (like telephone, telegraph, radio and television) but may not obtain a licence to broadcast or otherwise transmit. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and US communications laws bar any company that is more than 25% foreign owned from purchasing US telecommunications firms. The FCC may waive this restriction, however, as it deems necessary.

In late April 2001, despite heated opposition from several US lawmakers, the FCC unanimously approved Deutsche Telekom's US$26bn takeover of VoiceStream Wireless. The FCC approved the merger because it would serve the public interest by giving US consumers an additional option for wireless service. Opponents to the sale believed the company's backing by the German government would give it an unfair advantage over US competitors, but this did not prove to be the case in the two years following the sale.

Most states impose only minor restrictions. Federal laws or treaties sometimes pre-empt state legislation. Other state and local regulations affecting foreign investment generally pertain to ownership and use of land and natural resources, supervision of professions and matters related to intrastate commerce. In a few states, most notably Kansas, foreigners are still not permitted either by law or by administrative policy to establish deposit banks.

Thanks to the interstate bank branching law passed at the end of 1994, however, all states are open to foreign branches (as well as domestic branches) since June 1st 1997. All foreign banks need an operating licence from the state in which the US headquarters is located. Federal law generally prohibits foreign
bank branches from accepting the retail deposits of US residents. The Federal Reserve Bank serves as the federal regulator of all state-licensed foreign branch banks and agency banks.

The US banking system has been in the throes of fundamental change since the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall act--the Depression-era law separating commercial lending from securities underwriting and separating insurance companies and banking enterprises.

Some states, including North Carolina, North Dakota and Tennessee, ban insurance companies controlled by governments, foreign or US.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (within the Department of Commerce), foreign-owned assets in the US ended 2001 at US$943.2bn, compared with US$952.4bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US securities other than US Treasury securities were a record US$498.4bn in 2001, up from the previous record of US$485.6bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US shares were US$127.2bn in 2001, down from US$192.7bn in 2000. Net foreign purchases of US bonds were a record US$371.2bn in 2001, up from US$294.1bn in 2000.

Net foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States was US$157.9bn in 2001, down from US$287.7bn in 2000. The vast majority of FDI inflows, some US$143.5bn, originated in  Europe. The greatest inflow of FDI to the US during 2001 came from, in descending order, Germany, the UK, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
Unfair Competitive Practices

Local-content requirements per se do not exist. Numerous "Buy American" provisions, however, have been imposed at the federal, state and local government levels. For example, federal funding from the Federal Transit Administration requires that at least 50% of the final cost of components used in the construction of buses and underground rail systems be of US origin.

The US government generally regards the promotion of competition and economic efficiency as the central goal of its antitrust policy. Price controls are generally not a part of this equation, except for public utilities and a few other industries. As a result, the US market is well known for a highly competitive atmosphere in which the government is involved only as a regulator.

The Justice Department and 19 states won a lawsuit against Microsoft in early April 2000 when a US District Court judge ruled the company had repeatedly violated antitrust laws. Specifically, the court found that Microsoft's efforts to protect its Windows (operating system) monopoly against competitors exceeded bounds, as did its attempts to monopolise the market for browsers (software used to navigate the Internet) by linking Windows to its Internet Explorer software. An appeal against the ruling began in April 2001 before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The judges hearing the appeal decided not to uphold a lower court's order to break up the company.

The US Justice Department, in an effort to end the protracted litigation, decided to accept a settlement deal, which, many point out, was less stringent than previous court orders. Despite the Justice Department's agreement, there are nine states pursuing their own cases against Microsoft.
The key statutes governing US antitrust policy are the Sherman and Clayton acts and the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Both the Department of Justice and the
Department of Commerce have issued important guidelines on vertical and horizontal mergers and
pre-merger notification. These guidelines spell out how facts concerning imports and foreign capacity are
used in defining markets, calculating market share and weighing the likely competitive consequences of a
merger. New vertical- restraint guidelines have just been implemented.

Regulators are also homing in on antitrust issues raised by contracts between the makers of brand-name and generic drugs. The Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) announced plans in November 2000 to investigate generic- drug competition to study whether agreements between generic and brand- name drug makers have delayed access to generic products.

The FTC, which administers the fair-competition provisions of the applicable laws, uses both persuasion and litigation to enforce them. The FTC works closely with the Department of Justice to avoid duplicating enforcement activities. It follows similar policies in disclosing proposed consent decrees and allowing public comment for 60 days before taking a final vote on the settlement. The  commission is also active in challenging monopolistic practices stemming from restrictions on the use of patents and licensing.
However, Congress has prohibited the FTC from using authorised funds to petition for the cancellation of a registered trademark on the grounds that it has become a generic name.

The FTC's BusinessLine publications clarify otherwise ambiguous laws and rules. The full text of the guides on advertising, credit, labelling, money, online commerce and a series of "compliance guides" elucidating FTC rules is available on the FTC's website.

One antitrust exemption (granted by the Webb-Pomerene Act) allows groupings for the promotion of US exports in order to help US firms compete abroad against foreign companies or cartels. This was greatly broadened by the Export Trading Company (ETC) Act of 1982, which not only permits antitrust immunity for specific certified export activities but also allows bank holding companies to have equity participation in ETCs. Any such agreement must be carefully reviewed with the Department of Justice and the FTC. Applications under the ETC Act are reviewed by the Department of Commerce in conjunction with the Department of Justice. Applications by bank holding companies are reviewed exclusively by the Federal Reserve Board.

Besides clarifying the applicability of US antitrust law to international transactions, the ETC Act provides for a certification process for companies wishing to establish an ETC. With the concurrence of the Department of Justice, the Department of Commerce can issue an Export Trade Certificate of Review granting antitrust immunity to these companies if the following stipulations are met: there can be no substantial weakening of competition in the US, no unreasonable upward pressure on US prices, no unfair methods of competition and no US resale or consumption of exported goods. Private suits may not be brought for more than actual damages against ETCs thus certified.
Intellectual Property Rights
The US has a well-developed system of licensing that protects patents, trademarks and copyrights. Each
of these has its own set of rules and procedures. The Patent and Trademark Office (of the US Department
of Commerce) issues patents and trademark registrations. Copyrights may be filed with the Copyright
Office of the Library of Congress.

A US patent may be obtained by any person who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter or any new and useful improvements of these. US patent laws make no distinctions based on the inventor's citizenship. Patents are issued to individual inventors, who may assign or license their rights. It is legal and customary to require employees to assign their patent rights to their employers.

The basic law specifying the subject matter for which a patent might be obtained and the conditions for patentability took effect in 1953 (see Title 35 of the US Code). The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended US patent law to expand protection for owners of US process patents. Now, any person who, without authority, imports into the US or sells or uses in the US a product made outside the country but using a process patented in the US may be liable. Moreover, as a result of the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs), on January 1st 1996, US patent law was expanded to include the importation and offer for sale of patented products and processes as acts of infringement.

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted 184,051 patents in 2001, compared with 176,084 in 2000. According to IFI Claims, a North Carolina firm, the top ten recipients of private-sector utility patents were IBM (US, 3,453); NEC (Japan, 1,966); Canon (Japan, 1,877); Micron (US, 1,643); Samsung Electronics (South Korea, 1,451); Matsushita (Japan, 1,447); Sony (Japan, 1,392); Hitachi (Japan, 1,283); Mitsubishi (Japan, 1,210); and Fujitsu (Japan, 1,208). Increased staffing in the USPTO and greater efficiencies have cut the filing and approval time to an average of 23 months.

Bill 1948 passed in November 1999 requires that all patent applications filed in the US and in another foreign country be published 18 months after filing. The bill also states that published applications will constitute prior references that can be applied to deny a patent to another applicant, in effect treating them as prior inventions and not as mere prior publications.

A US trademark relates to any word, name, symbol or device that is used in the trade of goods or services to indicate the source or origin of the goods or services and to distinguish them from the goods or services of others. Trademarks may be obtained to prevent the use of confusingly similar marks by others, but they may not be used to keep others from manufacturing the item or offering the services concerned.

Page 136 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Trademark rights in the US are now acquired through common law "use requirements" and not, as in many countries, through first registration. US law does allow for the filing of an intent-to-use application, however, which provides a constructive first-use date based on the filing date. To receive the registration, use must be proved. So, a trademark's continued use is necessary for the protection to remain in effect. A US trademark right is acquired through adoption and by use of a mark on goods or in connection with services, or by filing an intent-to-use application that is supported by later use.

Customs Service regulations went into effect in March 1999 that include an amended "affiliate exception", intended to avoid consumer confusion. Under the rules, foreign goods that are different from US goods bearing a legal trademark are not detained if the merchandise bears a conspicuous label that should include the following words: "This product is not a product authorised by the United States trademark owner for importation and is physically and materially different from the authorised product." The new regulations also provide a standard to determine whether goods are "physically or materially different". Courts have historically been against the affiliate exception espoused by the Customs Service, and it remains to be seen if they will be more receptive to its new form.

In March 2001 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board's final rejections of three applications to register "phantom" marks, so-called because they include placeholders to denote multiple, unspecified elements. It is expected that the appeal court's ruling will bring consistency to the USPTO's approach to similar applications for phantom marks in future.

Under the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright protection in the US is automatically extended to "original works of authorship" at the time of their creation. This provides the owner with exclusive rights to reproduce and sell a work. Works that can be copyrighted include motion pictures, sound recordings and computer software.
Trade secrets are considered a form of property. Since enactment of the Economic Espionage Act of
1996, the US Department of Justice has been granted jurisdiction (previously left to the states) over the
protection of trade secrets. The Justice Department's newly organised section on computer crime and
intellectual property is the responsible agency. Under the general outline of the trade-secret doctrine, the
owner of a trade secret has the right to use it to his economic advantage. The law also protects the holder
of a trade secret against disclosure gained by some improper means, such as theft, wiretapping or even
aerial reconnaissance. Trade-secrets law does not offer protection, however, against discovery by fair and
honest means, such as independent invention, accidental disclosure or reverse engineering.

The holder of a US patent, trademark or copyright may sue the infringer through the US federal court system, though the process can be long and costly. The holder may also obtain an injunction and may sue for damages. If a foreign patent holder licenses his patent in the US, he may still be able to sue directly an infringer if the licence agreement allows.

Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, is an attractive alternative to federal patent litigation involving international trade, which typically lasts many years. Under this section, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates infringement claims.

As a result of changes stemming from the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for investigations based on complaints filed prior to January 1st 1995, the ITC must make its final determination not later than one year (18 months in more complicated cases) from the publication of notice about the start of an investigation in the Federal Register. For investigations based on complaints filed
after January 1st 1995, the ITC must conclude its investigation as quickly as possible and must, within 45 days of its start, establish a target date for issuing a final declaration.

The amended code also eliminates the need to prove "injury" to the domestic industry and provides for expedited consideration of requests for temporary relief (such as temporary exclusion orders and temporary cease- and-desist orders) if there is reason to believe a violation has occurred. In the event of a temporary exclusion order, entry may be only under bond. The result of a successful claim can be drastic: an infringing product is generally excluded from entry into the US market.

The Copyright Act does impose certain limits on holder rights. Limitations on the exclusive rights of copyright owners include the doctrine of "fair use" (Section 107), which permits the use of copyrighted information for news reporting, teaching, research and a few other pursuits, and the allowances for "compulsory licensing" (Section 115) when royalty payments are made. The basic law was most recently amended by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of October 1998, and the Fairness in Music Licensing Act, also of 1998. The Supreme Court upheld the first of these two laws against legal challenges in January 2003.

A federal appeals court in New York issued a ruling in November 2001 in a case that highlighted the issues at stake on intellectual property in the digital age (perhaps even more than the Napster case). This

Page 137 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
case concerned the right to publish information that discloses how to circumvent copy- protection devices in digital video discs (DVD). It was the first major challenge to a 1998 amendment to the federal copyright law, dubbed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), making it illegal for anyone to try to circumvent copy-protection programs.

The issue came to the fore when a Norwegian programmer wrote a program called DeCSS, which allows users to bypass copy protections on DVDs. The lawsuit came about when a computer magazine published the code. The result is a clash between the need for copyright against two core First Amendment
principles: the right of the magazine to publish the code (free speech) and the right of users to deploy the code in order to reclaim their ability to make fair use of copyrighted material. While the computer magazine lost in the New York case, other courts have subsequently ruled in favour of opponents of the DMCA.

The consequences of these cases are already becoming evident: researchers at Princeton University announced that they broke through the copy- protection technologies of a new online music format proposed by the industry. The university cannot publish their findings, however, without violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Despite efforts to prevent the researchers' findings from being made public,
many programs have begun to make use of the findings.

The Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 imposes criminal penalties for trafficking in goods or services bearing a counterfeit mark. The act authorises seizures, steep  fines and a possible prison term.

One important trend in this area is the development of closer links between intellectual property laws and trade policy. An amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 linked the benefits of the Generalised System of Preferences to protection of US intellectual property rights abroad. The 1984 Trade Act enabled the government to bring unfair-trade-practice cases against countries in which intellectual property protection is found to be lacking. The 1986 "Statement on the Protection of US Intellectual Property Rights Abroad" detailed problems in this area, including the absence or inadequacy of national laws and enforcement. It
also outlined a series of multilateral, bilateral and domestic initiatives in response. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 increased the government's leverage in using trade policy to compel foreign governments to increase their protection of US intellectual property rights.

Beginning January 1st 1996 certain creative works of non-US origin that had been in the public domain in the US had their copyright protection automatically restored. These included books, movies, sculptures, paintings, music, photographs, computer software and anything else that is eligible for US copyright protection. Congress changed US copyright law to this effect in late 1994 when it ratified the trade agreements that created the World Trade Organisation. The owner of a work that originated outside the US can now claim infringement of copyright in the US, but only after filing a notice of intent to enforce a restored copyright. This notice may be filed either with the Copyright Office or directly with the party using the work. The Copyright Office has additional information about works whose owners have filed such notices.
Price Controls

Price controls are rare in the United States, but they do exist for some regulated monopolies (like utilities and the postal service), and certain states and localities control residential rents. The most recent imposition of price restrictions was approved on May 2nd 2002, when the state legislature of Hawaii approved price caps on petrol prices, which have historically been higher than in any other US state.

The bill allows the state's Public Utilities  Commission to set a maximum price on petrol based on an average of prices in West Coast markets. Profit margins for dealers are to be capped at US$0.16 per gallon on regular unleaded petrol. The national average for regular unleaded petrol was US$1.40 per gallon in early May, but it ranged from US$1.60 to US$1.88 per gallon in Hawaii. Opponents contend the law is an attempt to appease consumers in an election year and will ultimately result in higher prices as supply decreases because of diminished competition.

The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission agreed to limited, temporary price constraints on wholesale electricity in California in 2001. After months of refusing the state's demands for price caps, the commission voted 2 to 1 to put a lid on California's wholesale electricity prices starting on May 1st 2001, but only when the state's supplies slip low enough to trigger an energy emergency. The caps remained in place until September 2002.

Opinion de l´Avocat Général: Introduction
1 K. B., travailleur féminin britannique, souhaite que son compagnon R., qui a subi une opération de conversion sexuelle le faisant passer du sexe féminin au sexe masculin, puisse, le moment venu, bénéficier de la pension de survie à laquelle il aurait droit en qualité de conjoint survivant. Or, la législation du Royaume-Uni empêche un transsexuel de se marier conformément à son nouveau sexe.

2 La demanderesse au principal s'estime victime d'une discrimination fondée sur le sexe en matière de rémunération. Une telle prétention pourrait trouver appui dans la directive 75/117/CEE (1), alors même que l'illégalité de traitement invoquée par la demanderesse ne découle pas directement de son identité sexuelle ni de celle de son compagnon, mais de la législation civile nationale qui règle la détermination du sexe
d'une personne: le Royaume-Uni n'autorise pas les rectifications d'état civil consécutives à une opération
de conversion sexuelle, lesquelles permettraient la conclusion d'un mariage, nécessairement hétérosexuel.
Il est constant que, en cette matière, la Communauté ne possède pas la moindre compétence; toutefois, si
l'on considère que la réglementation britannique enfreint un droit fondamental, cette circonstance ne peut
être ignorée.

3 La présente affaire revêt un intérêt d'ordre transitoire, puisqu'il est à prévoir que, au cours des prochains mois, le Royaume-Uni adopte des modifications législatives de nature à résoudre le problème de fond, à savoir l'incapacité des transsexuels à contracter mariage.
Les faits et la procédure nationale

Page 141 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
4 K. B., la demanderesse au principal, a travaillé pour le National Health Service (ci-après le «NHS»), organisme britannique chargé des services de santé publique, de 1976 à 1996. Au cours de ces vingt années, elle a cotisé au régime de pension du NHS et a acquis notamment le droit à une pension annuelle de 5 375,86 livres sterling.
Ledit régime prévoit l'octroi d'une pension de veuf en faveur du conjoint survivant d'un affilié. On entend par
«conjoint» uniquement une personne à laquelle l'affilié avait été uni par le mariage.

5 R., née de sexe féminin et inscrite comme telle à l'état civil, souffrait de dysphorie de genre. Après avoir subi une opération de conversion sexuelle, elle est devenue un homme, tant dans ses rapports avec K. B. que vis-à-vis de la société en général. Depuis de nombreuses années, R. et K. B. entretenaient une
relation affective et domestique. Si cela avait été possible, ils auraient contracté mariage, mais ont estimé à juste titre que la loi les en empêchait.

6 N'ayant pas le droit de se marier, R. ne peut prétendre à une pension de veuf en cas de décès de sa compagne.

7 Pour cette raison, K. B. a introduit un recours devant l'Employment Tribunal en faisant valoir que le refus du NHS d'octroyer à R., le cas échéant, une pension de veuf constituait une discrimination fondée sur le sexe, contraire aux dispositions de l'article 141 CE interprétées à la lumière de la jurisprudence de la Cour, et en particulier de son arrêt du 30 avril 1996, P./S. (2), ainsi qu'à la directive 75/117. Selon K. B., ces dispositions exigent que, dans un tel contexte, la notion de «veuf» soit interprétée de sorte à englober également le membre survivant d'un couple qui aurait acquis cette qualité si son appartenance sexuelle n'avait pas été le résultat d'une opération médicale de transformation.

8 Les défendeurs au principal, à savoir l'organisme gestionnaire du régime de pension du NHS (NHS Pensions Agency) et le ministre de la Santé (Secretary of State for Health), ont soutenu que la prétention de la demanderesse ne prenait pas en considération l'arrêt du 17 février 1998, Grant (3), selon lequel le compagnon homosexuel d'un employé ne pouvait bénéficier des avantages en matière de transport octroyés au compagnon hétérosexuel. Selon les défendeurs, cette prétention ignorait en outre que, bien
qu'elle ait affirmé, dans son arrêt P./S., précité, que le traitement défavorable d'un transsexuel en raison du sexe acquis à la suite d'une opération portait atteinte au principe d'égalité, la Cour n'a pas accordé à une telle personne l'ensemble des droits inhérents à son nouveau sexe.

9 L'Employment Tribunal et l'Employment Appeal Tribunal saisi en appel ont estimé fondés les arguments des défendeurs. L'affaire a alors été soumise à la Court of Appeal (England and Wales) (Civil Division), qui l'a renvoyée devant la Cour à titre préjudiciel.
La procédure devant la Cour
10 La demande de décision préjudicielle est parvenue au greffe de la Cour le 15 mars 2001.
11 À la suite des observations écrites présentées par K. B., le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni et la
Commission des Communautés européennes, une audience publique a été tenue le 23 avril 2002.

12 Le 11 juillet 2002, la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme a rendu son arrêt dans les affaires Goodwin c. Royaume-Uni et I. c. Royaume-Uni, dans lesquelles, contrairement à sa jurisprudence antérieure, elle a déclaré que l'impossibilité dans laquelle se trouvaient les transsexuels britanniques de contracter mariage conformément à leur nouveau sexe était contraire à la convention  européenne  de sauvegarde des droits de l'homme et des libertés fondamentales (ci-après la «convention». Compte tenu de cet élément, le greffe de la Cour a demandé au juge de renvoi si une décision préjudicielle était encore utile.

13 Par lettre du 4 octobre 2002, la Court of Appeal a informé la Cour que, conformément au droit national, elle se trouvait dans l'obligation de convoquer les parties avant de statuer sur l'utilité de poursuivre la procédure préjudicielle.

14 Le 5 mars 2003, la juridiction de renvoi a indiqué qu'elle estimait toujours nécessaire une réponse à la question posée, étant donné que l'arrêt Goodwin c. Royaume-Uni, précité, avait un objet différent de celui de la procédure au principal. Elle a ajouté que des modifications législatives ou jurisprudentielles imminentes étaient susceptibles de fournir une solution à l'affaire au principal sans que la Cour ait à se prononcer.
La législation nationale pertinente

15 La Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (loi de 1975 relative aux discriminations fondées sur le sexe) interdit à un employeur toute discrimination directe consistant à traiter les personnes d'un sexe de façon moins favorable que celle réservée au sexe opposé. Il interdit également les discriminations indirectes fondées

Page 142 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
sur le sexe, qu'il définit comme le fait d'appliquer des conditions ou des exigences identiques qui ont pour effet de désavantager de manière disproportionnée et injustifiée les personnes d'un sexe donné.

16 À la suite de l'arrêt P./S. (4), le Royaume-Uni a adopté les Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 (règlement de 1999 relatif aux discriminations en cas de conversion sexuelle). Ce règlement a réformé la Sex Discrimination Act 1975 afin d'inclure dans son champ d'application toute discrimination directe fondée sur la conversion sexuelle d'un travailleur à la suite d'une opération. Toutefois, la législation relative à l'égalité de traitement en matière de rémunération (Equal Pay Act 1970) et de pension (Pensions Act 1995) n'a pas été modifiée.

Ces nouvelles dispositions définissent la conversion sexuelle comme «une opération menée sous surveillance médicale, afin de convertir le sexe d'une personne en modifiant ses caractéristiques physiologiques et autres liées au sexe».

Selon l'exposé des motifs dudit règlement de 1999, «au Royaume-Uni, le transsexualisme concerne un nombre de personnes estimé à 5 000. Les traitements médicaux permettant aux transsexuels de modifier leur corps afin de l'accorder à leur identité sexuelle sont très efficaces. Dans le secteur médical, l'opération est appelée conversion sexuelle».

17 Le régime des pensions du NHS prévoit le versement d'une pension à la veuve ou au veuf de l'un de ses employés. La notion de veuve ou de veuf implique l'existence d'un conjoint survivant.

18 En droit anglais, le mariage est défini comme l'union volontaire d'un homme et d'une femme. À cet égard, et conformément à la jurisprudence élaborée par la High Court of Justice (England and Wales) en
1971 dans l'affaire Corbett (5), le sexe doit être déterminé à l'aide de critères chromosomiques, gonadiques et génitaux concordants, une intervention chirurgicale ne pouvant être prise en considération.
19 Par ailleurs, l'article 11, sous c), de la Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (loi de 1973 relative au mariage)
prévoit la nullité du lien matrimonial si les conjoints ne sont pas un homme et une femme.

20 Dans son arrêt du 10 avril 2003, Bellinger (6), la House of Lords a rejeté une demande visant à la reconnaissance de la validité d'un mariage conclu par un transsexuel conformément à son sexe acquis. La haute juridiction a estimé que le droit anglais ne conférait pas d'effets juridiques suffisants à la conversion sexuelle. Toutefois, elle a prononcé, à l'égard de l'article 11, sous c), de la Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, une «déclaration d'incompatibilité» avec la convention au sens de l'article 4, paragraphe 2, de la Human Rights Act 1998 (loi de 1998 incorporant la convention dans le droit interne). Cette déclaration vise à inciter le gouvernement à adopter d'urgence les mesures nécessaires pour faire cesser l'incompatibilité (7).
Le droit communautaire applicable

21 L'article 141 CE prévoit l'application du principe de l'égalité des rémunérations entre travailleurs masculins et travailleurs féminins pour un même travail ou un travail de même valeur (paragraphe 1). On entend par «rémunération» non seulement le salaire ou traitement ordinaire, mais également tous les autres avantages payés directement ou indirectement, en espèces ou en nature, par l'employeur au travailleur en raison de l'emploi de ce dernier (paragraphe 2).

22 L'article 1er, premier alinéa, de la directive 75/117 (8) dispose que le principe de l'égalité des rémunérations entre les travailleurs masculins et les travailleurs féminins implique, pour un même travail ou pour un travail auquel est attribuée une valeur égale, l'élimination, dans l'ensemble des éléments et conditions de rémunération, de toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe. Selon l'article 3 de cette même directive, les États membres sont tenus de supprimer les discriminations entre les hommes et les femmes qui découlent de dispositions législatives, réglementaires ou administratives et qui sont contraires au principe de l'égalité des rémunérations. En vertu de l'article 4, les États membres doivent prendre les mesures nécessaires pour que les dispositions contraires au principe de l'égalité des rémunérations qui figurent dans des conventions collectives, des barèmes ou accords de salaires ou des contrats individuels de travail soient nulles, puissent être déclarées nulles ou puissent être amendées.

23 Selon une jurisprudence constante de la Cour, la notion de rémunération, telle qu'elle est délimitée à l'article 141 CE, n'inclut pas les régimes ou prestations de sécurité sociale, notamment les pensions de retraite, directement réglés par la loi (9). En revanche, elle comprend les prestations octroyées au titre d'un régime conventionnel de pensions, qui est fonction, pour l'essentiel, de l'emploi qu'occupait l'intéressé, puisqu'elles se rattachent à la rémunération (10). Pour apprécier si une pension de retraite entre dans le champ d'application de l'article 141 CE, le critère déterminant est l'existence d'un lien entre la relation de travail et la prestation, sans que les éléments structurels du système remplissent un rôle décisif (11).
24 De même, la Cour a déclaré que la pension de survie prévue dans ces conditions relevait de l'article
141 CE. À cet égard, elle a précisé que cette interprétation n'était pas infirmée par la circonstance que la
pension de survie, par définition, n'est pas payée au travailleur, mais à son survivant, puisqu'une telle
Page 143 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
prestation est un avantage qui trouve son origine dans l'affiliation au régime du conjoint de celui-ci, de sorte que la pension est acquise à ce dernier dans le cadre du lien d'emploi entre l'employeur et ledit conjoint et lui est versée en raison de l'emploi de celui-ci (12). Le conjoint survivant peut invoquer l'article 141 CE afin de faire reconnaître à son profit le principe du droit au versement d'une pension de survie (13).
Le droit des transsexuels à contracter mariage

25 Est transsexuelle, dans la doctrine médico-légale, une personne qui, tout en présentant les caractéristiques génotypiques et phénotypiques d'un sexe, a le sentiment profond d'appartenir au sexe opposé, dont elle a adopté l'aspect extérieur et le comportement et au sein duquel elle désire être acceptée à tous égards et à tout prix. Le transsexualisme se définit ainsi comme un syndrome selon lequel le sexe anatomique (gonadal) ou biologique (chromosomique) d'un patient ne concorde pas avec son sexe psychologique (14).

Le désir inébranlable du transsexuel d'obtenir la reconnaissance, y compris juridique, de son appartenance au sexe opposé se manifeste chez lui par la volonté de se soumettre à un traitement hormonal afin de modifier ses caractéristiques sexuelles secondaires et à une intervention chirurgicale d'ablation et de reconstruction entraînant la transformation anatomique des organes génitaux. La structure chromosomique demeure intacte, de sorte que ce que l'on appelle le sexe biologique reste le même (15).

Le transsexualisme se distingue nettement des états liés à l'orientation sexuelle (hétérosexuel, homosexuel ou bisexuel), dans lesquels l'individu accepte sans ambiguïté son sexe, les problèmes se situant fondamentalement dans le domaine de l'expression de l'affectivité, ainsi que du travestisme, qui
caractérise les personnes recherchant une identité sexuelle satisfaisante en adoptant les tenues du sexe opposé.

26 Je voudrais préciser que, bien que, en principe, l'empêchement au mariage opposable aux transsexuels réside dans l'impossibilité de modifier leur état civil afin de refléter le changement de sexe, il n'en reste pas moins que, de cette façon, leur droit de contracter mariage se trouve limité, faute d'acceptation globale de ce lien entre personnes d'un même sexe biologique. Dès lors, et dans un souci de brièveté et de concision, j'analyserai la question sous le seul angle du droit des transsexuels à contracter mariage, sans m'arrêter aux obstacles techniques concrets dont il dépend.

27 L'aspiration des transsexuels à contracter mariage conformément à leur nouvelle identité sexuelle (16) se reflète sur le terrain juridique tant dans la législation et la pratique administrative des États membres que dans la jurisprudence, en particulier celle de la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme. Ces
éléments présentent un intérêt primordial pour l'analyse à laquelle la Cour doit se livrer, dans la mesure où l'on pourrait dégager un principe général de droit communautaire sous la forme d'une tradition constitutionnelle commune aux États de l'Union  européenne  ou d'une indication fournie par un instrument international concernant la protection des droits de l'homme ratifié par tous les États membres.

28 Une étude comparative de la situation juridique existante montre une acceptation globale du mariage des transsexuels conformément à leur nouveau sexe. Que ce soit au moyen d'une intervention expresse du législateur (Allemagne (17), Grèce (18), Italie (19), Pays-Bas (20), Suède (21)) ou à la suite d'une pratique administrative (Autriche (22), Danemark (23)), ou encore moyennant une interprétation
jurisprudentielle (Belgique (24), Espagne (25), Finlande (26), France (27), Luxembourg (28), Portugal (29)), les opérations de conversion sexuelle donnent lieu à des rectifications d'état civil qui ouvrent aux transsexuels la possibilité de contracter mariage.

Seuls les ordres juridiques irlandais et britannique semblent s'opposer à cette tendance générale, ce qui ne fait pas obstacle à la constatation d'une tradition juridique suffisamment uniforme, susceptible d'être la source d'un principe général de droit communautaire.
29 En tout état de cause, les indications fournies par la convention donnent lieu à moins d'incertitude.

30 L'article 8, paragraphe 1, de la convention dispose que «[t]oute personne a droit au respect de sa vie privée et familiale, de son domicile et de sa correspondance». Toute ingérence dans ce droit, pour être valable, doit être prévue par la loi, poursuivre un objectif légitime et être nécessaire dans une société démocratique (paragraphe 2).

Par ailleurs, l'article 12 de la convention énonce que, «[à] partir de l'âge nubile, l'homme et la femme ont le droit de se marier et de fonder une famille selon les lois nationales régissant l'exercice de ce droit».

31 Saisie de façon répétée par des transsexuels, notamment de nationalité britannique, qui invoquaient les articles 8 et 12 pour réclamer la reconnaissance de leur droit à contracter mariage conformément à leur sexe acquis, la Cour européenne  des droits de l'homme a répondu, dans son arrêt Rees c. Royaume-Uni du 17 octobre 1986 (30), qu'«il faut pour le moment laisser à l'État défendeur le soin de déterminer jusqu'à quel point il peut répondre aux autres exigences des transsexuels. [...] [l]a nécessité de mesures juridiques
Page 144 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
appropriées doit donner lieu à un examen constant eu égard, notamment, à l'évolution de la science et de la société» (31).

L'arrêt de la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme Cossey c. Royaume-Uni du 27 septembre 1990 (32), confirme l'importante marge d'appréciation que les juges de Strasbourg reconnaissent en la matière aux États, comme le fait également l'arrêt Sheffield et Horsham c. Royaume-Uni du 30 juillet 1998 (33). Dans cette dernière affaire, ladite Cour a rappelé que «le transsexualisme continue de soulever des questions complexes de nature scientifique, juridique, morale et sociale ne faisant pas l'objet d'une approche généralement suivie dans les États contractants» (34).

32 Telle était la situation lorsqu'a été engagée la procédure au principal, situation qui subsistait encore au moment où a été déférée à la Cour la présente question préjudicielle et qui est demeurée inchangée jusqu'après l'audience publique tenue le 23 avril 2002.

33 Le 11 juillet 2002, la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme, siégeant en une grande chambre, a prononcé l'arrêt Goodwin c. Royaume-Uni (35), qui opère un revirement jurisprudentiel radical.

34 À l'unanimité et en des termes particulièrement percutants, les juges de Strasbourg ont considéré, à l'issue d'une analyse de la jurisprudence antérieure et de l'évolution juridique et sociale, que «l'État défendeur ne peut plus invoquer sa marge d'appréciation en la matière, sauf pour ce qui est des moyens à mettre en oeuvre pour assurer la reconnaissance du droit protégé par la convention. Aucun facteur important d'intérêt public n'entrant en concurrence avec l'intérêt de la requérante en l'espèce à obtenir la reconnaissance juridique de sa conversion sexuelle, la Cour conclut que la notion de juste équilibre inhérent à la convention fait désormais résolument pencher la balance en faveur de la requérante. Dès
lors, il y a eu manquement au respect du droit de l'intéressée à sa vie privée, en violation de l'article 8 de la convention» (36).

35 Sur le terrain de l'article 12, la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme a jugé artificiel d'affirmer que les personnes ayant subi une opération de conversion sexuelle n'étaient pas privées du droit de se marier au motif que, conformément à la loi, il leur demeurait possible d'épouser une personne du sexe opposé à leur ancien sexe. Elle a constaté que la requérante, qui menait une vie de femme et entretenait une relation avec un homme, qu'elle souhaitait épouser, n'en avait pas la possibilité (37). Elle a ajouté que,
«[s]'il appartient à l'État contractant de déterminer, notamment, les conditions que doit remplir une personne transsexuelle qui revendique la reconnaissance juridique de sa nouvelle identité sexuelle pour établir que sa conversion sexuelle a bien été opérée et celles dans lesquelles un mariage antérieur cesse d'être valable, ou encore les formalités applicables à un futur mariage (par exemple, les informations à fournir aux futurs époux), la Cour ne voit aucune raison justifiant que les transsexuels soient privés en toute circonstance du droit de se marier» (38). La Cour a donc également conclu à l'unanimité qu'il y avait eu violation de l'article 12 de la convention.
La question préjudicielle déférée à la Cour

36 Par ordonnance du 14 décembre 2000, la Court of Appeal a demandé à la Cour de se prononcer sur la question de savoir «si le refus d'accorder une pension au partenaire transsexuel (une personne de sexe féminin à l'origine) d'une femme affiliée au National Health Service Pension Scheme, aux termes duquel les prestations pour personnes à charge ne pourraient bénéficier qu'à son veuf, constitue une discrimination fondée sur le sexe, prohibée par l'article 141 CE et la directive 75/117/CEE du Conseil, du
10 février 1975, concernant le rapprochement des législations des États membres relatives à l'application du principe de l'égalité des rémunérations entre les travailleurs masculins et les travailleurs féminins».
37 Ainsi qu'il ressort de cette ordonnance, la Court of Appeal nourrit les doutes suivants:

a) Les résultats auxquels aboutit la Cour dans ses arrêts P./S. et Grant, précités, sont clairs, mais tel n'est pas le cas du critère de distinction sur lequel ils se fondent. Si ce critère est que le refus d'accorder certains avantages à des partenaires homosexuels n'est pas discriminatoire tant qu'il est susceptible de toucher les hommes et les femmes de manière égale, la même solution vaut pour le refus d'accorder, comme dans la présente affaire, des prestations à des partenaires non mariés. Si, par contre, le critère est que le sexe, comme motif de discrimination, comprend l'identité sexuelle mais pas l'orientation sexuelle, alors le refus opposé dans la présente affaire est fondé directement sur le sexe et, par conséquent, discriminatoire.

b) À supposer que l'article 14, voire également l'article 8, de la convention  européenne  de sauvegarde des droits de l'homme et des libertés fondamentales aient été méconnus, la portée de cette violation sur l'interprétation de la notion de «veuf» est incertaine. Étant donné que la vie familiale suppose que les membres de la famille qui travaillent pourvoient aux besoins des personnes à charge qui leur survivraient
et que la vie privée implique qu'on évite de se mêler indûment des caractéristiques biologiques d'une personne, on pourrait soutenir que K. B., en raison du refus d'une pension à son partenaire transsexuel survivant, est injustifiablement privée du respect de ces deux droits ou qu'elle en jouit dans une mesure

Page 145 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
moindre. Si cet argument résiste à l'analyse, il pourrait y avoir lieu d'en tenir compte dans l'interprétation de l'article 141 CE et de la directive 75/117.

38 Pour la juridiction de renvoi, on ne saurait parler de discrimination indirecte, puisque rien ne permet de croire que les hommes et les femmes ayant une relation avec une personne transsexuelle sont affectés de manière inégale par la condition de mariage; par ailleurs, le fait de tirer argument de l'impact défavorable
de cette condition sur ces êtres humains reviendrait à les considérer comme un troisième sexe.
39 En revanche, selon la juridiction de renvoi, l'interprétation de l'article 2, paragraphe 1, de la directive
76/207, qui interdit «toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe, soit directement, soit indirectement par
référence, notamment, à l'état matrimonial ou familial», peut présenter des difficultés. Cette disposition
paraît limiter l'utilisation du critère de l'état matrimonial à l'appréciation d'une discrimination indirecte. Or, si
la condition de mariage est imposée aux hommes et aux femmes indistinctement, il est difficile d'imaginer
dans quelles circonstances elle pourrait avoir un quelconque effet défavorable pour l'un ou l'autre sexe. Il
se pose dès lors la question de savoir si cette directive considère, en définitive, la notion d'«état
matrimonial ou familial» comme équivalant à la notion de «sexe» dans le cadre de l'appréciation d'une
discrimination directe ou comme un critère intervenant dans l'appréciation d'une discrimination illégale
indirecte et impliquant l'examen, non pas d'une condition, qui serait étrangère à l'appartenance sexuelle,
mais bien de l'impact défavorable de cette condition.
Analyse de la question préjudicielle

40 Toutes les parties à la procédure qui se sont prononcées sur ce point sont d'accord sur le fait que la pension de veuf litigieuse constitue un élément de la rémunération aux fins de l'article 141 CE. Il n'y a aucune raison de s'écarter de cette constatation.

Il est de jurisprudence constante que les prestations octroyées au titre d'un régime de pension qui est fonction de l'emploi qu'occupait l'intéressé relèvent de la notion de rémunération (39). Cela vaut également pour les pensions de veuf qui présentent cette caractéristique (40).

Or, il ressort du dossier que la pension octroyée par le régime du NHS est calculée en fonction de la situation professionnelle de l'intéressée, en particulier de son salaire; il y a donc lieu de présumer qu'elle se rattache à sa rémunération.

41 Je suis également d'accord sur le fait que rien ne justifie d'apprécier de façon différente les discriminations consistant en une inégalité de traitement, interdites par la directive 76/207/CEE (41), et celles qui impliquent une inégalité de rémunération, auxquelles s'applique la directive 75/117. Cette interprétation uniforme est indiquée dans la mesure où, d'une part, l'article 141 CE n'établit pas de régimes de protection distincts et où, d'autre part, les deux directives présentent de grandes similitudes en ce qui concerne leur rédaction et les objectifs qu'elles poursuivent.

42 La demanderesse au principal et la juridiction de renvoi ne sont pas entièrement d'accord sur la définition de l'objet de la question préjudicielle.

43 Selon K. B., la présente affaire n'est pas liée au droit des transsexuels à contracter mariage, lequel ne relève pas de la compétence communautaire, ni à la discrimination dont sont victimes les couples de même sexe en raison de leur orientation sexuelle, puisqu'il s'agit dans la présente affaire à tous égards d'une relation entre un homme et une femme. Pour cette raison, la Cour devrait, de l'avis de la demanderesse au principal, appliquer la jurisprudence P./S., précitée, aux termes de laquelle le droit communautaire (42) «s'oppose au licenciement d'un transsexuel pour un motif lié à sa conversion sexuelle» (43); il suffirait donc de remplacer l'expression «licenciement d'un transsexuel» par les termes
«refus d'accorder une pension à un transsexuel».

Ainsi qu'elle l'a souligné à l'audience, la demanderesse au principal ne demande donc pas la reconnaissance du droit des transsexuels à contracter mariage, mais uniquement leur droit à voir traiter les personnes qui forment leur couple comme des conjoints aux fins de l'obtention de prestations financières.

44 La Court of Appeal s'interroge, dans son ordonnance, sur le critère qui caractérise les arrêts P./S. et Grant, précités, à savoir la question de l'application indistincte aux hommes et aux femmes et celle de l'inclusion de l'identité sexuelle et de l'exclusion de l'orientation sexuelle en tant qu'éléments constitutifs d'une discrimination inacceptable. Elle s'interroge également sur l'atteinte aux droits des transsexuels découlant des articles 18 et 14 de la convention qui pourrait résulter du refus d'une pension de survie. Enfin, elle nourrit des doutes sur le point de savoir si la notion d'«état matrimonial ou familial», visée à l'article 2, paragraphe 1, de la directive 76/207 doit être considérée comme équivalant à la notion de
«sexe» ou seulement comme une circonstance permettant d'identifier une discrimination illégale indirecte.

En outre, la Court of Appeal rejette toute appréciation relative à la discrimination indirecte, qui supposerait d'admettre la thèse erronée selon laquelle les transsexuels constituent un troisième sexe.
Page 146 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
45 Je souhaite simplement signaler que l'on peut à tout le moins déduire du raisonnement de la juridiction de renvoi qu'elle n'exclut pas que l'analyse correcte de la présente affaire puisse porter sur l'impossibilité pour les transsexuels de contracter mariage en tant que discrimination directe fondée sur le sexe.

46 En termes pratiques, et comme le formule la question préjudicielle, l'existence dans la présente affaire d'une discrimination contraire à l'article 141 CE et à la directive 75/117 dépend du point de savoir si la jurisprudence P./S., précitées peut être appliquée. Au-delà de cet aspect, il ne semble pas facile, comme l'affirme la demanderesse au principal, d'ignorer l'incidence sur la solution du litige du problème relatif aux conditions qu'impose le droit national pour contracter mariage et, concrètement, l'empêchement que suppose, à cette fin, l'impossibilité de rectifier l'inscription d'état civil correspondante à la suite d'une opération de conversion sexuelle.
47 Toutefois, je souhaiterais examiner, dans un premier temps, si l'on peut déduire de la jurisprudence de
la Cour que le refus d'accorder une pension de veuf à un transsexuel est contraire à l'article 141 CE. Je me
place ainsi dans le cadre fixé par la demanderesse au principal et accepté, pour l'essentiel, par la
juridiction de renvoi.
48 Dans l'affaire ayant donné lieu à l'arrêt P./S., précité, la Cour s'est penchée sur la question de savoir si
le licenciement d'un travailleur en raison du fait qu'il a subi une opération de conversion sexuelle constituait
une discrimination du type de celles interdites par la directive 76/207.

49 La Cour a rappelé que le principe de l'égalité de traitement impliquait l'absence de toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe et était ainsi l'expression du droit fondamental à l'égalité dont elle assurait le respect (44).

L'arrêt déduit de ce qui précède que le champ d'application de cette directive ne saurait être réduit aux seules discriminations découlant de l'appartenance à l'un ou l'autre sexe, mais qu'il englobe également celles qui trouvent leur origine dans la conversion sexuelle de l'intéressé. De telles discriminations sont fondées essentiellement, sinon exclusivement, sur le sexe de l'intéressé. En conséquence, lorsqu'une personne est licenciée au motif qu'elle a l'intention de subir ou qu'elle a subi une conversion sexuelle, elle fait l'objet d'un traitement défavorable par rapport aux personnes du sexe auquel elle était réputée appartenir avant cette opération; un tel traitement méconnaît le respect de la dignité et de la liberté auquel elle a droit et que la Cour doit protéger (45).

50 La thèse des représentants de K. B. se fonde sur l'affirmation selon laquelle le droit revendiqué par celle-ci pour son compagnon transsexuel découle de la simple substitution de l'expression «lorsqu'une personne est licenciée» par les termes «lorsqu'une personne se voit refuser le droit à une pension de veuf», puisque, dans l'un et l'autre cas, il s'agit de droits dont le bénéfice égal est garanti respectivement par les directives 76/207 et 75/117.

51 Je me rallie à cette thèse dans la mesure où, aux fins de l'appréciation par la Cour, il est totalement indifférent de savoir si l'inégalité dénoncée consiste en un licenciement ou en un refus de pension de veuf.

52 Cela dit, on peut à mon avis légitimement opposer à l'interprétation de la demanderesse au principal que le refus de la pension litigieuse n'est pas fondé sur la modification du sexe de la personne intéressée, mais sur son incapacité à remplir l'une des exigences requises par le droit national pour contracter valablement mariage avec la personne titulaire de la pension principale, à savoir la différence de sexe entre les futurs époux. Si l'on suit ce raisonnement, on peut considérer que le refus du mode de rémunération litigieux s'explique non pas par le changement de sexe, mais précisément par l'absence de changement de sexe, en droit, de la personne transsexuelle, ce qui empêche la célébration valable du mariage. Cette argumentation conduit inévitablement à s'interroger sur la conformité d'un pareil refus de reconnaître son plein effet à une opération de conversion sexuelle aux valeurs fondamentales de l'ordre juridique et, parallèlement, sur la compétence du juge communautaire pour se prononcer à ce sujet.

53 Avant de poursuivre dans cette voie, qui s'éloigne du cadre initial de la question préjudicielle, il convient de relater d'autres précédents afin de préciser le contenu de la jurisprudence de la Cour en la matière. Je me référerai tout d'abord à l'arrêt Grant, précité, et à celui du 31 mai 2001, D et Suède/Conseil (46).

54 Dans l'affaire Grant, précitée, l'employée d'une entreprise ferroviaire soutenait que, par l'octroi de réductions sur les prix de transport au travailleur et à son conjoint ou à la personne de sexe opposé avec laquelle il entretient une relation «significative» stable, et par le refus corrélatif de cet avantage aux couples se trouvant dans la même situation, mais dont les partenaires sont de même sexe, il était porté atteinte à l'interdiction de discrimination figurant à l'article 119 du traité (les articles 117 à 120 du traité CE ont été remplacés par les articles 136 CE à 143 CE).

La Cour n'a pas accueilli favorablement cette thèse et a, à cette fin, recouru à un schéma de raisonnement particulier. Elle a tout d'abord répondu à la question de savoir si une règle telle que celle en cause dans le litige au principal constituait une discrimination fondée directement sur le sexe du travailleur. Ensuite, elle
Page 147 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
s'est penchée sur la question de savoir si le droit communautaire exigeait que les relations stables entre deux personnes du même sexe soient assimilées par tout employeur aux relations entre personnes
mariées ou aux relations stables hors mariage de deux personnes de sexe opposé. Enfin, elle a examiné la question de savoir si une discrimination fondée sur l'orientation sexuelle constituait une discrimination fondée sur le sexe du travailleur (47).

Sur la première de ces questions, la Cour s'est bornée à constater que la règle s'appliquait de la même manière aux travailleurs de sexe féminin qu'à ceux de sexe masculin, de sorte qu'elle ne pouvait constituer une discrimination directement fondée sur le sexe (48).

Sur la deuxième question, après s'être livrée à une analyse de la situation juridique existant au niveau communautaire et à celui des États membres, ainsi que des principes dégagés par la jurisprudence relative à la convention, elle est parvenue à la conviction que, en l'état actuel du droit au sein de la Communauté, les relations stables entre deux personnes du même sexe n'étaient pas assimilées aux relations entre personnes mariées ou aux relations stables hors mariage entre personnes de sexe opposé. Par conséquent, un employeur n'est pas tenu par le droit communautaire d'assimiler la situation d'une
personne qui a une relation stable avec un partenaire de même sexe à celle d'une personne qui est mariée ou qui a une relation stable hors mariage avec un partenaire de sexe opposé (49). Cette approche peut s'avérer fort utile pour la solution de la question préjudicielle, ainsi que je l'expliquerai plus loin.

Enfin, en ce qui concerne la troisième question, la Cour a déclaré que la notion de discrimination fondée sur le sexe ne couvrait pas une discrimination fondée sur l'orientation sexuelle. Elle a estimé en outre que la jurisprudence P./S., précitée, était limitée à la conversion sexuelle d'un travailleur.

55 L'arrêt Grant, précité, est invoqué par le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni pour étayer son argumentation visant à nier l'existence, dans la présente affaire, d'une discrimination interdite. À cet effet, ce
gouvernement transpose le raisonnement en trois phases, décrit plus haut.
Selon lui, la première de ces propositions est entièrement applicable à la présente affaire: sont exclues de
la pension de veuf toutes les personnes non mariées, qu'elles soient de sexe masculin ou féminin; dès lors,
on ne saurait invoquer la discrimination directe fondée sur le sexe. À cet égard, peu importe que
l'empêchement réside dans le fait que l'autre membre du couple soit du même sexe, dans le fait qu'il soit
transsexuel ou dans toute autre circonstance.

La deuxième proposition viendrait également à l'appui de l'opinion du gouvernement du Royaume-Uni, puisqu'elle vise le fait que l'article 12 de la convention protège uniquement le mariage traditionnel entre deux personnes de sexe biologique opposé, ainsi qu'il ressort des arrêts Rees c. Royaume-Uni, et Cossey c. Royaume-Uni, précités (50). Ces arrêts refléteraient le contenu du droit  européen en la matière.

Selon le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni, la troisième partie du raisonnement de l'arrêt Grant, précité, n'est pas pertinente pour la présente affaire.

56 L'arrêt Grant, précité, n'est pas de nature à étayer la thèse de la demanderesse au principal, puisqu'il nie toute infraction au droit à l'égalité de traitement entre hommes et femmes. Toutefois, il n'est pas inutile de souligner que le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni semble considérer que la solution de la question
posée est inséparable d'une appréciation par la Cour de la légalité de l'impossibilité pour un transsexuel de contracter mariage conformément à son nouveau sexe.

Dès lors, le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni, tout en affirmant la compatibilité de la législation britannique avec les articles 8 et 14 de la convention, déclare que l'absence hypothétique de cette compatibilité ne pourrait avoir pour conséquence que la disposition litigieuse devienne contraire à l'article 141 CE.

Il renvoie aux points 45 à 47 de l'arrêt Grant, précité, dans lesquels la Cour déclare que, si le respect des droits fondamentaux qui font partie intégrante de ces principes généraux constitue une condition de la légalité des actes communautaires, ces droits ne peuvent en eux-mêmes avoir pour effet d'élargir le champ d'application des dispositions du traité au-delà des compétences de la Communauté. La portée de toute disposition de droit communautaire ne peut être déterminée qu'en tenant compte de son libellé et de son objectif, ainsi que de sa place dans le système du traité et du contexte juridique dans lequel cette
disposition s'insère.

57 Dans l'affaire D et Suède/Conseil, précitée, un fonctionnaire des Communautés  européennes, de nationalité suédoise, membre d'un couple de même sexe enregistré conformément au droit suédois, avait demandé le bénéfice de l'allocation de foyer, que les règles statutaires réservent aux personnes mariées. D soutenait que des termes comme «conjoint» ou «fonctionnaire marié» devaient être interprétés par référence au droit national, et non de façon autonome, et que, dès lors, le refus de l'allocation constituait une discrimination fondée sur le sexe.


Page 148 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
58 Statuant en matière de pourvoi, la Cour a considéré que le terme «mariage», selon la définition communément admise par les États membres, désignait une union entre deux personnes de sexe différent et que, s'il était également vrai que des États membres en nombre croissant ont mis en place, à côté du mariage, des régimes légaux accordant une reconnaissance juridique à diverses formes d'union entre des partenaires de même sexe ou de sexe différent et donnant à ces unions certains effets identiques ou comparables à ceux du mariage, tant entre les partenaires qu'à l'égard des tiers, ces régimes étaient, dans les États membres concernés, distincts du mariage proprement dit. Dès lors, le juge communautaire ne peut interpréter le statut des fonctionnaires des Communautés  européennes de sorte que soient assimilées au mariage des situations légales qui en sont distinctes (51).

En ce qui concerne la prétendue discrimination fondée sur le sexe, la Cour a signalé, en premier lieu, que celle-ci n'était pas constituée, dès lors que la circonstance que le demandeur soit un homme ou une femme était indifférente, et que, par ailleurs, il n'y avait pas non plus inégalité de traitement en raison de l'orientation sexuelle, puisque ce n'était pas non plus le sexe du partenaire qui constituait la condition d'octroi de l'allocation de foyer, mais la nature juridique des liens qui l'unissaient au fonctionnaire (52). Cette affirmation semble signifier que le juge communautaire n'est pas compétent pour apprécier la
compatibilité avec les droits fondamentaux des conditions pour contracter mariage exigées en droit interne. Toutefois, la Cour examine ensuite les conceptions prévalant dans l'ensemble de la Communauté, dont
elle déduit que les législations sont hétérogènes et que, d'une manière générale, elles n'assimilent pas le mariage et les autres formes d'union légale (53).

59 L'arrêt D et Suède/Conseil, précité, n'est pas non plus de nature à étayer la thèse de K. B. Comme dans l'affaire Grant, précitée, la Cour a estimé qu'il n'y avait pas eu de discrimination fondée sur le sexe.

60 D'un intérêt à mon avis plus marginal pour la présente affaire, on citera l'arrêt du 22 juin 2000, Eyüp (54), dans lequel la demanderesse au principal croit voir la reconnaissance, par le juge communautaire, de l'assimilation au mariage d'un lien stable entre personnes non mariées.

Dans cette affaire, il s'agissait de savoir si la compagne étrangère d'un travailleur turc établi légalement dans un État membre, vivant maritalement avec lui, devait être considérée comme un «membre de la famille» au sens de l'article 7, premier alinéa, de la décision n_ 1/80 du Conseil d'association, du 19 septembre 1980, relative au développement de l'association entre la Communauté économique européenne  et la Turquie. Les faits à l'origine de la question préjudicielle sont particuliers: en 1983, Mme Eyüp a contracté mariage avec un travailleur turc appartenant au marché régulier de l'emploi autrichien depuis 1975; ils ont divorcé en 1985, mais se sont remariés en 1993. Au cours de cet intervalle, les
ex-conjoints ont continué à vivre ensemble en Autriche et ont donné naissance à quatre de leurs sept enfants. Il s'agissait de déterminer si cette période devait être comptée aux fins du calcul des cinq années de résidence régulière auxquelles la décision n_ 1/80 subordonne la possibilité pour les membres de la famille d'un travailleur turc d'accéder au marché de l'emploi du pays d'accueil.

La Cour a pris en considération l'objectif de regroupement familial effectif sous-jacent à l'article 7, premier alinéa, de la décision n_ 1/80 et a déclaré que, «eu égard aux éléments factuels particuliers de l'affaire au principal et notamment au fait que la période de cohabitation hors mariage de M. et Mme Eyüp se situait entre leurs deux mariages», leur vie familiale commune n'avait pas été interrompue, de sorte que cette période devait être comprise en totalité aux fins du calcul de la durée de résidence régulière (55).

Il ressort très clairement des termes circonstanciés employés par la Cour que celle-ci n'a pas affirmé que, en droit communautaire, un lien stable entre deux personnes était assimilé au mariage. Il y a lieu d'ajouter, par ailleurs, que la décision n_ 1/80 se réfère, de façon générique, aux «membres de la famille» du travailleur turc, notion ayant des limites plus souples que celle de «veuf» ou «veuve» utilisée dans le régime de pension britannique.

Cependant, l'arrêt Eyüp, précité, est de nature à éclairer d'une certaine façon la présente question préjudicielle, quoique pour des raisons différentes de celles envisagées par la demanderesse au principal. Il convient de relever, d'une part, l'ouverture dont la Cour fait preuve pour interpréter des concepts du droit de la famille conformément à l'esprit et à la finalité de la norme qui y fait référence et, d'autre part, l'appréciation des particularités du cas d'espèce conduisant à adopter des solutions équitables (ex aequo et bono). Toutefois, ces éléments ne sont pas de nature à revêtir une importance décisive pour la réponse à fournir à la Court of Appeal.

61 Il ressort à mon avis de l'analyse jurisprudentielle qui précède qu'il est impossible de déduire de la directive 75/117 ou de l'article 141 CE que l'on doit octroyer au compagnon non marié d'un travailleur féminin un avantage, tel qu'une pension, réservé au conjoint survivant. L'état de transsexuel de cette personne n'est pas, en principe, déterminant, puisque la même solution s'imposerait à l'égard d'autres empêchements au mariage. Il en irait de même, naturellement, à l'égard de compagnons du même sexe, mais également à l'égard de personnes n'ayant pas atteint l'âge nubile, ou juridiquement incapables, ou déjà mariées ou encore liées au travailleur par des rapports de consanguinité. Dans aucun de ces cas, on

Page 149 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
ne saurait réclamer, le moment venu, une pension de veuf alors même que ces empêchements ne constituent nullement l'expression d'une inégalité de traitement fondée sur le sexe.

62 Cette même analyse conduit à s'interroger, comme je l'ai annoncé, sur l'élément central du litige concrètement en cause: l'impossibilité, pour les transsexuels britanniques, de contracter mariage avec des personnes du même sexe biologique, en dépit de la transformation physiologique apportée à leur anatomie. Les représentants de K. B. ont insisté sur le fait qu'ils ne demandaient pas à la Cour de reconnaître ce droit. Toutefois, outre que cette argumentation a pu obéir à une certaine stratégie
procédurale, compte tenu de la situation juridique existante au moment de l'introduction de la procédure au principal, la Cour dispose d'une marge d'appréciation suffisante pour choisir l'angle d'interprétation adéquat aux fins de fournir une réponse utile à la juridiction de renvoi.

63 La Cour dispose d'un autre moyen d'interprétation pour aborder le présent problème. On l'entrevoit dans certains des arguments présentés par les parties à la procédure.

On pourrait mettre en question le caractère raisonnable du choix de la relation matrimoniale comme élément de rattachement dont dépend l'octroi, le moment venu, d'une pension de veuf. Cet examen imposerait de s'interroger sur l'objectif poursuivi par une pension de cette nature et, parallèlement, de rechercher si un simple contrat formel est apte à représenter une communauté solidaire ou, tout au moins, si des relations d'une autre nature ne méritent pas une protection semblable. Apanage d'une société mature, ce type d'analyse, dans laquelle le fond l'emporte sur la forme, fait son chemin dans la pratique. Ainsi, d'une part, il est permis de mettre en cause la réalité du mariage dans le domaine, par exemple, du droit de l'immigration (56), tandis que, d'autre part, pour des raisons d'équité, on assimile au lien matrimonial des situations caractérisées par une véritable cohabitation, dépourvues de reconnaissance officielle (57).

J'ai la conviction que le droit doit suivre, dans son évolution, de tels cheminements, mais il est peut-être prématuré de les appliquer à la présente affaire, notamment eu égard à l'existence d'autres solutions moins audacieuses.

64 Une fois reformulée, la question posée porterait donc sur la compatibilité avec le droit communautaire d'une législation nationale qui, en n'admettant pas le mariage des transsexuels, leur refuse l'accès à une pension de veuf.

65 Afin que la prétention formulée puisse, quant au fond, être accueillie, une double condition doit être remplie, à savoir:
a) que la législation nationale soit contraire au droit communautaire;

b) que la Cour soit compétente pour statuer, c'est-à-dire que le litige relève de l'une des matières visées par le traité.

66 Or, il ne fait aucun doute que l'impossibilité pour les transsexuels britanniques de contracter mariage conformément à leur nouveau sexe physiologique est contraire à un principe général du droit communautaire.

Il est de jurisprudence constante et persistante de la Cour que, au regard des droits fondamentaux, le contenu des principes généraux du droit communautaire doit être dégagé des traditions constitutionnelles communes aux États membres (58), à la lumière des indications fournies par les instruments
internationaux concernant la protection des droits de l'homme ratifiés par les États membres (59). En outre, la convention revêt, à cet égard, une signification particulière (60).

67 De ce qui a été exposé aux points 28 et 29 ci-dessus, il ressort tout d'abord que le droit des transsexuels à contracter mariage avec des personnes du même sexe biologique fait partie des ordres juridiques de l'immense majorité des États membres. À ce jour, treize des quinze États de l'Union le reconnaissent, que ce soit au moyen d'une disposition législative expresse ou par le biais de pratiques administratives ou judiciaires. Cette circonstance doit permettre à elle seule de considérer que ce droit fait partie du patrimoine juridique commun, puisque faire dépendre la détermination des principes généraux d'une concordance parfaite dans l'ensemble des États membres priverait cette méthode d'investigation de toute utilité.

68 Ensuite, depuis les arrêts de la Cour  européenne  des droits de l'homme du 11 juillet 2002 (61), ce droit fait partie du contenu de l'article 12 de la convention. Les juges de Strasbourg ne reconnaissent à l'autorité publique une certaine marge d'appréciation qu'en ce qui concerne les conditions que doit remplir une conversion sexuelle pour être effective, les conséquences en découlant pour les mariages antérieurs et l'obligation d'informer l'autre futur époux de cette conversion (62).


Page 150 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
69 Par conséquent, les deux méthodes employées par votre Cour pour doter d'un contenu les principes généraux du droit communautaire aboutissent au même résultat: les transsexuels jouissent d'un droit fondamental à contracter mariage dans des conditions prenant en considération leur nouveau sexe.
70 Toutefois, cette constatation n'est pas suffisante. Comme l'indique le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni,
la simple incompatibilité d'une réglementation interne avec un droit fondamental reconnu au niveau du droit
communautaire ne saurait élargir le champ d'application de celui-ci au-delà des compétences conférées
par le traité.

71 Il est donc nécessaire de vérifier si cette incompatibilité affecte l'un des droits relevant des instruments de la Communauté, en l'occurrence l'interdiction de toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe en ce qui concerne la rémunération des travailleurs.

72 Il est manifeste et admis par tous que le droit de percevoir une pension de veuf, dans les circonstances de l'affaire au principal, est couvert par l'article 141 CE et par la directive 75/117, s'agissant d'une prestation liée à la rémunération (63).

73 De même, le fait qu'il faille qualifier de discrimination sexuelle l'inégalité de traitement dont font l'objet les transsexuels ne fait guère de doute. C'est ce qui ressort de l'arrêt P./S., selon lequel cette notion ne peut être réduite «aux seules discriminations découlant de l'appartenance à l'un ou l'autre sexe», mais englobe également celles «qui trouvent leur origine [...] dans la conversion sexuelle de l'intéressée [...] de telles discriminations sont fondées essentiellement, sinon exclusivement, sur le sexe de l'intéressé» (64).

Cette approche reflète en outre le fait que les problèmes relatifs à la transsexualité ne se confondent pas avec ceux propres à l'orientation sexuelle (65). Si la discrimination dont souffrent les transsexuels n'était pas considérée comme fondée sur le sexe, on aboutirait à la situation paradoxale selon laquelle cette catégorie de personnes particulièrement vulnérables serait privée d'une protection spécifique au niveau communautaire. Rappelons que ni l'article 13 CE ni l'article 21 de la charte des droits fondamentaux de l'Union européenne  ne contiennent de mention expresse visant les transsexuels (66).

74 L'originalité du problème que soulève la présente affaire, et qui la distingue de celle ayant fait l'objet de l'arrêt P./S., précité, est que la discrimination litigieuse n'affecte pas directement le bénéfice d'un droit protégé par le traité, mais l'une de ses conditions d'octroi. Il est constant que l'inégalité de traitement en question ne se rapporte pas à la reconnaissance d'une pension de veuf, mais seulement à une condition préalable indispensable: la capacité à contracter mariage.

75 Cette différence ne saurait, à elle seule, conduire à une solution différente de celle adoptée jusqu'à présent. La Cour doit veiller non seulement à ce que l'exercice des droits protégés par le traité soit exempt de toute discrimination prohibée, mais également à ce que ces droits ne soient pas subordonnés à des conditions contraires à l'ordre public  européen.

76 Il ne s'agit pas de construire un «droit matrimonial  européen», mais de garantir la pleine efficacité du principe de l'interdiction de toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe. Supposons une réglementation nationale hypothétique qui empêcherait les femmes d'accomplir un acte juridique déterminé ou d'obtenir une qualification dont dépendrait obligatoirement l'obtention d'une rémunération. Une telle limitation, sans préjudice d'une justification proportionnée fondée sur des critères objectifs, constituerait une discrimination directe contraire à l'article 141 CE.

Il en va de même dans la présente affaire: bien que l'inégalité de traitement opère de façon indirecte, la discrimination conserve son caractère direct. On ne peut parler de discrimination indirecte qu'en cas d'application de critères autres que celui du sexe; or, l'empêchement matrimonial en cause a pour origine et pour seule explication la conversion sexuelle de l'intéressé, c'est-à-dire un élément visé par l'article 141
CE selon l'interprétation susmentionnée de la Cour.

77 Mise à part l'égalité dans le domaine du travail, il s'agit - comme l'admet l'arrêt P./S., précité, - d'une question de respect de la dignité et de la liberté auquel les transsexuels ont droit. «La dignité humaine et le droit fondamental à l'épanouissement de la personnalité rendent indispensable l'adaptation du statut personnel de l'individu au sexe auquel il appartient conformément à sa constitution psychologique et physique [...]. Pour des raisons de sécurité juridique, le législateur devrait réglementer les questions relatives à l'état civil liées à une conversion sexuelle, ainsi que leurs effets. Toutefois, en attendant l'adoption d'une telle législation, il incombe aux tribunaux d'appliquer le principe de non-discrimination entre hommes et femmes jusqu'à l'entrée en vigueur d'une réglementation qui les traite sur un pied d'égalité» (67).

78 Je suis conscient du fait qu'une interprétation de ce type comporte certains problèmes techniques d'application. Jusqu'à ce que le Royaume-Uni adopte les dispositions nécessaires pour permettre le mariage de transsexuels, le juge national - qui est également juge communautaire - doit garantir, conformément au droit interne, que la discrimination qu'ils subissent n'ait pas de conséquences sur les
Page 151 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
droits découlant du traité. Les solutions concevables vont d'une interprétation des termes «homme» et
«femme» autorisant le mariage des transsexuels (68) à la création ponctuelle d'une fiction de mariage ou
bien à l'instauration d'un lien distinct, moins rigide, permettant aux transsexuels d'accéder à une pension
après la mort de la personne qui aurait été leur conjoint si une règle injuste ne l'avait pas interdit.

79 Les transsexuels subissent une souffrance obsessionnelle, car ils sont convaincus d'être victimes d'une erreur de la nature. Beaucoup d'entre eux choisissent le suicide. Au terme d'un processus long et douloureux, dans lequel les apports hormonaux suivent de délicates opérations chirurgicales, la médecine leur offre un soulagement partiel, en rapprochant dans la mesure du possible leurs caractéristiques physiques externes à celles du sexe qu'ils sentent être le leur (69). Il me semblerait aberrant que le droit puisse se retrancher derrière de simples considérations techniques pour empêcher qu'une assimilation si péniblement conquise produise son plein effet.

80 Je terminerai, comme l'a fait l'avocat général Tesauro dans ses conclusions relatives à l'affaire P./S., précitée, en reprenant les paroles prononcées par l'avocat général Trabucchi dans des conclusions remontant à près de 30 ans: «[s]i nous voulons que le droit communautaire ne soit pas seulement une réglementation mécanique de l'économie, mais constitue un ordre juridique à la mesure de la société qu'il doit régir, si nous voulons qu'il existe un droit conforme à l'idée de justice sociale et aux exigences de l'intégration  européenne  au niveau non seulement de l'économie mais aussi des peuples, nous ne pouvons pas décevoir [les espérances placées en nous]» (70).
Conclusion
81 Il convient dès lors de répondre à la question posée par la Court of Appeal (England and Wales) (Civil
Division) de la façon suivante:

«L'interdiction de toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe, consacrée par l'article 141 CE, s'oppose à une législation nationale qui, en refusant aux transsexuels le droit de contracter mariage conformément à leur sexe acquis, les empêche d'accéder à une pension de veuf.»

Avant les progrès de la médecine et de la chirurgie accomplis au cours de la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les femmes qui ressentaient la pulsion d'être des hommes devaient recourir à des stratagèmes compliqués et se lancer dans des aventures hasardeuses, qui les menaient généralement vers un destin tragique. En
1566, Henry Estienne relate un événement qui s'est déroulé à Fontaines, où une femme s'est déguisée et a travaillé comme garçon d'écurie; elle est parvenue à se marier avec une autre femme, avec laquelle elle vécut heureuse pendant deux ans avant que l'on ne découvrît l'instrument qui lui servait pour accomplir son devoir conjugal; elle fut arrêtée et brûlée vive.

Le XVIIe siècle a connu des femmes qui ont été pirates comme Anne Bonney et Mary Read, ou bien la Française Geneviève Premoy qui, se faisant passer pour le chevalier Balthazar, a été décorée de l'Ordre de Saint-Louis par Louis XIV. De nombreuses femmes sont parvenues à être soldats ou marins. Au cours des procès qui ont suivi, on sait que certaines ont déclaré que leur comportement était dicté par Dieu, que,
lorsqu'elles sont nées, leurs parents attendaient un garçon et que, alors même qu'elles avaient l'apparence de femmes, leur nature était en réalité masculine.
La crainte de voir leur supercherie découverte poussait ces femmes au suicide, comme ce fut le cas en
1765 de Catharine Rosenbrock qui, après avoir passé douze années à travailler comme marin et comme
soldat en Hollande, est retournée chez elle à Hambourg, où sa mère l'a accusée d'avoir renié son sexe
féminin; elle a été arrêtée pour mauvaises moeurs et a tenté de mettre fin à ses jours.

Mlle de Maupin était l'une des actrices les plus célèbres du théâtre français du XVIIe siècle. Elle a triomphé à l'Opéra de Paris en chantant des rôles masculins. Au cours d'une tournée, elle s'est échappée à
Marseille pour séduire une jeune fille de la ville mais, lorsqu'on a su qui elle était, elle fut emprisonnée et condamnée à mort. Sa popularité et la pression de l'opinion publique ont entraîné l'annulation du verdict. Depuis lors, bien qu'elle ait continué à s'habiller comme un homme, les autorités ont décidé d'ignorer ses caprices. C. Spencer, dans Histoire de l'homosexualité, éd. Le Pré aux Clercs, traduction de D. Sulmon, Paris, 1998, p. 232 et suiv., évoque certains de ces cas.

As part of its campaign to unbundle the &#8220;local loop&#8221; -- the final link between the national telecoms network and the customer's home or office -- the  Commission has slapped a fine of (Euro)12.6m on Germany's  Deutsche Telekom (DT) for abusing its dominant position through unfair pricing for access to its network.

Under an EU regulation, all incumbent fixed-line operators were supposed to unbundle their local loops from the start of 2001. Unbundling refers to the process by which the former monopolies that control the loop lease out to competitors the right to supply voice, data or image services directly to consumers. This should lead to cheaper and faster Internet access over local copper-wire networks.

TD
Two years after the regulation came into force, however, only 1m subscriber lines have been unbundled across Europe. Of this figure, 855,000 are in Germany, where unbundling was already mandated by national law in 1998; but even there, unbundled lines accounted for less than 5% of the total. And 95% of these are still  DT customers, with the remainder shared by a flock of small competitors.

The Commission's investigation, prompted by numerous complaints from new entrants, concluded that a prime reason for DT's continued hammerlock on the retail market was its pricing policy on the wholesale market for access to the local loop, where it also has a dominant position as the only operator with a nationwide network. From 1998 through 2001,  DT actually charged its would-be competitors more for unbundled access at wholesale level than it charged subscribers for retail access (based on a weighted basket of analogue, ISDN and ADSL connections). Since 2002 this is no longer the case, but even after the latest reduction of wholesale tariffs ordered by the German telecoms regulator, which took effect on May 1st, the margin squeeze still leaves new entrants unable to compete for retail subscribers.

Impatient with the slow progress of unbundling, the  Commission last year opened infringement proceedings against Germany and four other states (France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal) for failing to implement the regulation properly. Meanwhile, its competition directorate has been pursuing a sectoral inquiry on local loop unbundling.

In addition to  DT, two other operators have also been the target of specific antitrust proceedings: France Telecom has been accused of predatory pricing for fast Internet access, and Dutch operator KPN of billing rivals too much for terminating calls on its mobile phone network.

BRUSSELS June 11 (Reuters) - Electricity companies want to give fresh meaning to the words plug-and-play by sending high speed Internet to the wall sockets in your home.

The first world conference of electric companies, equipment makers and others gathered for a day this week in efforts to make the Internet even more ubiquitous by channelling it through power lines into homes.

TD
"Within minutes of opening the box, the customer can be on the Internet," Keith McLean, who heads the Internet project for Scottish and Southern Energy in Perth, Scotland, said late on Tuesday.

The modem plugs into the wall, then the computer. No extra software is needed. The three dozen players who attended the Power Line Communications meeting from  Europe, Japan and the United States hope for big growth, although obstacles remain.

So far, Scottish and Southern has run a pilot project of 200 people using the system. It is about to launch a new test system to serve 15,000 people in limited areas at 29.99 pounds ($50) a month.
At first blush, the advantages of the electric Internet system seem considerable.

For one thing, it neatly avoids the "last mile" problem which has stymied high speed Internet competition across  Europe.

Competitors have made little progress against established phone companies who they say make life tough by charging too much to use the copper telephone wires which go into homes.

The European Commission has joined the fray, going so far as to fineDeutsche Telekom, but it says the market is still largely closed.
Electricity companies have their own last mile of copper into every home, including parts of eastern
Europe where home phones are far from universal.

And the companies reach rural areas too expensive to be connected to high speed ADSL running on telephone lines and too remote for cable TV operators to reach. Power companies have monthly billing and are established.

"We can compete with ADSL," said Marcos Lopez Ruiz of Madrid, president of the Public Utilities Alliance. Ruiz says the companies can make money with one home in 10 or fewer subscribing, about the same as ADSL and better than cable.

And the speed is faster than most ADSL, with power company Internet sending the Web in and out of homes at one million bits per second or higher.
HURDLES REMAIN

But equipment is expensive and power companies never known for marketing prowess must compete against phone companies, Internet firms and cable companies.

Page 157 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The new systems face a bureaucratic tangle too. Power regulators, telephone regulators and radio regulators, who worry signals may leak, all want to be in a position to say "no".

As an internal working document of the  European Commission's communications directorate presented to the conference said: "Regulatory uncertainty remains".

The technology has been greeted with enthusiasm at the Commission, looking to promote competition in high-speed Internet as a key technology to make Europe more competitive. But it is unclear how fast the Commission can cut red tape.
Meanwhile, technological development and demonstration projects are moving apace.

Industrial experts say  Europe leads the new technology with tests at Endesa in Spain, Enel in Italy, EnBW in Germany and EDP in Portugal.

Basic equipment is made by Ascom of Switzerland and Main.Net of Israel. Signal is sent at 10 megabits per second across high, medium and low-voltage lines in a band from 1.6 to 30 MhZ.

HD           D.Telekom (DTEGn.DE) to hike access, cut call fees. WC          231 words

FRANKFURT, June 13 (Reuters) - German phone giant  Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) said on Friday it planned to raise access and installation fees while lowering call prices to fend off a probe into its pricing by the  European Commission.

A spokesman confirmed remarks by  Deutsche Telekom board member Josef Brauner made in an interview with a local news agency, saying it planned to raise the monthly fees for standard analogue lines by as much as 1.41  euros, or more than 12 percent, and to cut prices for local calls.

TD
The move comes a week after the German telecoms watchdog said it was ready to allow  Europe's largest telecoms operator price hikes in order to increase the spread between its end-customer prices and the fees it charges competitors.

The European Commission last month  fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros for charging start-up rivals too much for access to its local networks and demanded it should cut those prices, or raise end-customer fees.

Many of Deutsche Telekom's fees are fixed by the German telecoms regulator, including both the line rental it charges rivals and subscription rates for consumers.
The fee hike could generate up to 600 million  euros ($707 million) in additional income for  Deutsche
Telekom by the end of 2004, the telecoms regulator said last week.

HD       Deutsche Telekom to hike access, cut call fees. WC      223 words

German phone giant  Deutsche Telekom said on Friday it planned to raise access and installation fees while lowering call prices to fend off a probe into its pricing by the  European Commission. A spokesman confirmed remarks by Deutsche Telekom board member Josef Brauner made in an interview with a
local news agency, saying it planned to raise the monthly fees for standard analogue lines by as much as
1.41 euros, or more than 12 percent, and to cut prices for local calls. The move comes a week after the
German telecoms watchdog said it was ready to allow  Europe's largest telecoms operator price hikes in
order to increase the spread between its end-customer prices and the fees it charges competitors. The
European Commission last month  fined Deutsche Telekom 12.6 million euros for charging start-up
rivals too much for access to its local networks and demanded it should cut those prices, or raise
end-customer fees.

TD
Many of Deutsche Telekom's fees are fixed by the German telecoms regulator, including both the line rental it charges rivals and subscription rates for consumers. The fee hike could generate up to 600
million euros ($707 million) in additional income for  Deutsche Telekom by the end of 2004, the telecoms regulator said last week.

DT forced to raise end-user prices

German telecoms regulator RegTP has allowed dominant operator Deutsche Telekom to raise its prices for end users, in response to an anti-trust investigation by the European Commission.

TD
RegTP president Matthias Kurth, who sets many of  Deutsche Telekom's prices, said the indebted operator could raise its prices by 10 per cent by the end of next year. This could generate up to e600 million in extra revenue by the end of 2004.

The Commission last month  fined DT e12.6 million for charging its competitors too much to access the local loop, and said the company must either reduce its wholesale prices or raise its end-user prices.
Raising prices would enable small companies to compete more easily in the German market.

COUNTRY BRIEFING
FROM THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT

TD
As part of its campaign to unbundle the "local loop" -- the final link between the national telecoms network and the customer's home or office -- the  Commission has slapped a fine of Euro12.6m on Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DT) for abusing its dominant position through unfair pricing for access to its network.

Under an EU regulation, all incumbent fixed-line operators were supposed to unbundle their local loops from the start of 2001. Unbundling refers to the process by which the former monopolies that control the loop lease out to competitors the right to supply voice, data or image services directly to consumers. This should lead to cheaper and faster Internet access over local copper-wire networks.

Two years after the regulation came into force, however, only 1m subscriber lines have been unbundled across Europe. Of this figure, 855,000 are in Germany, where unbundling was already mandated by national law in 1998; but even there, unbundled lines accounted for less than 5% of the total. And 95% of these are still  DT customers, with the remainder shared by a flock of small competitors.

The Commission's investigation, prompted by numerous complaints from new entrants, concluded that a prime reason for DT's continued hammerlock on the retail market was its pricing policy on the wholesale market for access to the local loop, where it also has a dominant position as the only operator with a nationwide network. From 1998 through 2001,  DT actually charged its would-be competitors more for unbundled access at wholesale level than it charged subscribers for retail access (based on a weighted basket of analogue, ISDN and ADSL connections). Since 2002 this is no longer the case, but even after the latest reduction of wholesale tariffs ordered by the German telecoms regulator, which took effect on May 1st, the margin squeeze still leaves new entrants unable to compete for retail subscribers.

Impatient with the slow progress of unbundling, the  Commission last year opened infringement proceedings against Germany and four other states (France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal) for failing to implement the regulation properly. Meanwhile, its competition directorate has been pursuing a sectoral inquiry on local loop unbundling.

In addition to  DT, two other operators have also been the target of specific antitrust proceedings: France Telecom has been accused of predatory pricing for fast Internet access, and Dutch operator KPN of billing rivals too much for terminating calls on its mobile phone network.
