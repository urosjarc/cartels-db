Volvo, Scania May Need To Sell Dealer Networks  For EU OK

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Swedish commercial vehicles maker  Volvo AB (VOLVY) would ease competition concerns about its planned buy of Swedish rival  Scania AB (SCVA) if it "opened the dealer network to competitors," but this might not guarantee the competition all-clear, an  European Union Commission spokesman said Tuesday.

"If (the companies) are to open their dealer networks to competitors that would ease competition concerns, but I am not sure if that would be sufficient (to win antitrust approval)," said E.U. Competition spokesman Michael Tscherny.

Tscherny would not comment on what concessions, if any, have already been offered by the companies. Volvo has reportedly offered to sell its 36.8% stake in Scandinavian car retail chain Bilia.

One Brussels-based antitrust lawyer said the comment could be seen as a "strong hint" to the Swedish companies, coming one day before Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson meets with the European Union's Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and less than a week before the deadline for submitting concessions to win antitrust approval.

The spokesman has previously said that he expects the Volvo/Scania alliance to be discussed at Wednesday's meeting between Persson and Monti. He added that meetings between an E.U. member state leader and the Competition Commissioner are "unusual" during extended competition investigations involving companies from that country.

Observers say that the E.U. is likely to insist on significant concessions from the company after competition commissioner Mario Monti said last week that the Commission is examining this case on a national basis.

This is viewed as bad news for the companies because they have a dramatically larger market share in certain individual countries than on an E.U.-wide basis. For example, the two companies would have between 60% and
90% market share in the bus and truck sectors in Scandinavia.
The E.U. Commission has also said that it has concerns about the bus and coach markets in the U.K. and
Ireland.

The companies have until Feb. 21 to make any concessions to win antitrust approval. Under normal E.U. competition procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

The E.U. is due to give a final decision on the merger on Mar. 23, having extended the decision deadline to give the companies time to comply with a so-called information injunction, ordering the companies to provide specific information relating to the investigation.

Volvo, Scania May Need To Open Dealer Networks  For EU Approval

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- A  European Union spokesman Tuesday said Volvo AB could ease competition concerns about its planned $7.5 billion acquisition of rival Swedish truck maker Scania AB if it "opened the dealer network to competitors," but he was unsure if the move would be enough to win antitrust approval.

EU Competition spokesman Michael Tscherny wouldn't comment on what concessions, if any, already have been offered by the companies.  Volvo has reportedly offered to sell its 36.8% stake in Scandinavian car retail chain Bilia.

The EU opened an in-depth review of the acquisition in October based on initial investigations that found possible antitrust problems in the markets for heavy trucks and buses. The combined market shares of the two companies after their merger would be "extremely high" in the bus and truck department, the EU has said.
Volvo announced in August plans to acquire Scania, a deal that would join the world's No. 2 and No. 3
heavy-truck makers. The pact would create a leader of the heavy-truck pack in Europe and a stronger No. 2
world-wide after DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes.

One Brussels-based antitrust lawyer said the spokesman's comment could be seen as a "strong hint" to the Swedish companies, coming one day before Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson meets with the EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and less than a week before the deadline for submitting concessions to win antitrust approval.

Previously, the spokesman has said that he expects the Volvo/Scania alliance to be discussed at Wednesday's meeting between Persson and Monti. He added that meetings between an EU member state leader and the Competition Commissioner are "unusual" during extended competition probes involving companies from that country.

STOCKHOLM - AB  Volvo said yesterday its profits rose nearly fourfold last year on strong sales after it sold its car division to Ford Motor Co. and turned its focus to trucks and buses. It reported 1999 net profit of 32.2 billion kronor ($5.4-billion), compared with 8.6 billion kronor in 1998 on the back of strong sales and lower material costs. A  European Union ruling is expected by March 23 on  Volvo's proposed $6.1-billion (US) buyout of rival Scania AB. The acquisition of  Scania would yield short-term savings,  Volvo said.

FOCUS - EU wants Volvo/Scania concessions by Monday.
By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Tuesday that Swedish truck maker  Volvo
had until next Monday to submit concessions to win regulatory approval for its acquisition of rival  Scania.

Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to say whether an offer by  Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johannson to open the company's dealership network in the Nordic area to competitors would be enough to secure the green light.
"We are in discussions with them. I don't know whether it will be a sufficient remedy or not. They have until next
Monday to submit undertakings," Tscherny said.

But an antitrust lawyer familiar with the review doubted the offer would remove the Commission's concerns, noting that rival truck makers would have little guarantee their products would be given enough space in Volvo/Scania showrooms.

He stressed, however, that the reason why Volvo and Scania already dominate the Swedish and other Nordic markets may be because of special cabin insulation requirements in the region, which make the local market unattractive for DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes and other truck makers.

If this proved correct and if rivals had not opposed the merger too strongly, Volvo would have a chance of getting the EU nod, industry and legal sources said, noting companies that bought heavy trucks were sophisticated buyers with strong bargaining power.

If Volvo's 60 billion crowns ($6.91 billion) plus bid succeeds, it will be the world's second biggest bus and truck concern, behind DaimlerChrysler.

The Commission last year objected to the deal on the grounds it would create a monopoly in Sweden for heavy trucks as well as strong positions in other Nordic markets and a dominant share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.

The European Union's competition watchdog has until March 23 to decide whether to clear or block the acquisition. Under EU merger rules, companies must offer concessions at the latest one month before the deadline.
Tscherny said the Commission would probably rule on the case at its weekly meeting on March 14.

But before then it will consult a committee of national merger experts, which will meet on February 28-29 in Brussels on the Swedish truck and other mergers, he added, as is normal in the review of mergers that pose competition concerns.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson is due to meet Commission President Romano Prodi in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss Sweden's presidency of the bloc in the first half of 2001. He is also slated to meet Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. ($1=8.682 Swedish Crown).

Volvo, Scania remedies insufficient for merger approval: EU

(Copyright 2000)
BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (AFP) - Swedish automakers  Volvo and Scania have yet to offer sufficient remedies to obtain EU merger clearance despite a looming Monday deadline, EU competition spokesman Michael Tscherny said Wednesday.
Commitments made so far have "not yet dispelled our serious concerns," Tscherny told journalists after Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson met with  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The companies' remedies include offering to open up their after- sales services network in Sweden, Tscherny said. He declined to give information about the other commitments made.
Brussels is expected to make a final decision on the merger on March 14.

The European Commission announced its investigation into Volvo's multi-billion-dollar acquisition of rival Swedish truck-maker Scania on October 25, citing competition concerns.

If the merger wins Brussels' blessing, Volvo-Scania would be the world's second-largest manufacturer of heavy trucks of more than 16 tonnes, behind Germany's DaimlerChrysler.

In Europe, Volvo-Scania would be able to claim a market share in excess of 30 percent, compared with 20 percent for German-US giant DaimlerChrysler.
Monti quoted Persson as telling Monti in Brussels that the merger was of "vital interest" for his country. bur/rom/vs

Prime Minister Goeran Persson will meet EU Commissioner Mario Monti in Brussels Wednesday to discuss the merger plans between truck makers AB Volvo (S.VLV) and  Scania AB (SCVA), Dagens Industri reports. According to the paper, Persson is concerned that the position taken by Monti will in effect make it impossible for companies in small countries to obtain a leading global position.

Swedish investment company Industrivaerden proposes to raise its dividend to SEK6 for 1999, including a bonus of SEK1, and up from SEK4.5 in 1998, Swedish business press report. Last year Industrivaerden posted a pretax profit of SEK4.74 billion, up from SEK2.36 billion.

Swedish television channel TV4 Tuesday reported its strongest full year results ever, posting a 80% rise in 1999 pretax profit to SEK218 million, Dagens Industri reports.
Last year's rally in information technology stocks swelled the coffers of Swedish unions Metall and Sif, Svenska
Dagbladet reports. Together the two unions have SEK18 billion at their disposal, a SEK6 billion increase from
1998.

EU: Volvo, Scania Concessions So Far Still Inadequate

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Wednesday that Swedish commercial vehicles maker Volvo AB (VOLVY) and Swedish rival  Scania AB (SCVA) have offered concessions relating to their services networks in order to win antitrust clearance.

However, E.U. Commission spokesman for competition Michael Tscherny said the concessions offered so far by the Swedish companies aren't sufficient to win clearance.
The offer relates to services in Sweden and would allow vehicles from other manufacturers to be serviced by
Volvo and Scania's networks.
"Opening the services network" in the Swedish market is "amongst the commitments they have offered," said
Tscherny.

He declined to say whether both companies have offered to sell their services networks or to what part of the companies the remainder of the commitments relate.

Tscherny declined to say whether the companies have made any concessions relating to their dealer networks. However, he said the service network is "the major concession" they have offered. Previous reports have suggested that Volvo has offered to sell its dealer network to ease competition concerns.
The companies have until Feb. 21 to make any concessions to win antitrust approval.

Tscherny wouldn't comment on what the companies need to win antitrust approval. "It is up to the companies to come up with the solutions, and then we check by the market testing them (to see) whether they are actually good enough," he said.

Tscherny said the Swedish service network offer only concerns trucks. The Commission has previously said it is concerned about both trucks and buses in the Scandinavian, U.K. and Irish markets.

Tscherny was speaking after a meeting between Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and the E.U. Commission's top competition official, Mario Monti.

He said that Persson noted his concern that companies from smaller E.U. countries may be discriminated against when merging with other companies from their home countries because they often have larger market shares in their home region. Preventing them from merging could stop companies from smaller E.U. countries becoming global players, he said.

Tscherny said that Monti countered that home market control isn't a necessary precondition to compete on a global scale and that both Volvo and Scania are already global players.

Tscherny also said that the competition commissioner said the two companies' competition has contributed to their success and that dominance in their home markets would ultimately hurt consumers.

The Commission has said it is particularly concerned about the companies' dominance in the Swedish truck market, with market shares of over 90% if the two companies merged. The companies would also have over 50% of the Scandinavian truck market.

Under normal E.U. competition procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

European Commission Not Satisfied  With Concessions By Volvo, Scania

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Concessions offered so far by Swedish vehicle makers Volvo AB and  Scania AB aren't sufficient to win antitrust clearance for  Volvo's planned acquisition of its rival, a European Commission spokesman said.

Volvo (VOLVY) and  Scania (SCVA) have offered to allow other manufacturers' trucks to be serviced by their networks if they merge.
"Opening the services network" in the Swedish market is "amongst the commitments they have offered," said
Michael Tscherny, spokesman for the European Commission, the European Union's governing body.

Tscherny declined to say whether the companies have offered to sell their services networks or whether they have made any concessions relating to their dealer networks.

Tscherny said the offer to open the services network concerns only trucks in Sweden. The commission has said it is concerned about buses as well as trucks in the Scandinavian, United Kingdom and Irish markets.

Tscherny made the comments Wednesday after a meeting in Brussels between Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and Mario Monti, the commission's top competition official. He said Persson noted his concern that companies from smaller EU countries may be discriminated against when merging with other companies from their home countries because they often have larger market shares in their home region. Preventing them from merging could stop companies from smaller EU countries from becoming global players, he said.

Tscherny said Monti responded that home-market control isn't a necessary precondition to competing on a global scale and that both Volvo and Scania are already global players. Monti also pointed out that the two companies' competition has contributed to their success and that dominance in their home markets would ultimately hurt consumers, according to Tscherny.

The commission has said it is particularly concerned about the companies' dominance in the Swedish truck market, where they would have more than 90% market share if they merged. They would also have more than
50% of the Scandinavian truck market.

Other car and truck makers have publicly expressed interest in buying the Swedish truck makers. But Sweden is eager for Volvo and Scania truck manufacturing to remain in Swedish hands, especially since U.S. auto maker Ford Motor Co. (F) bought Volvo's automobile-making operations in January 1999, The Wall Street Journal reported this week.

Volvo and Scania have until Monday to submit their concessions to the European Union. The EU's advisory committee of national competition experts is scheduled to discuss this and other mergers the following week. The EU is due to give a final decision on the merger March 23.

Mercedes takeover trump card for Volvo's  Scania acquisition plans.

As Volvo and Scania wait to hear the  EU's verdict on their proposed merger, the Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson goes to Brussels today in an attempt to win acceptance for  Volvo's view of the deal. The  EU's competition authority has clashed with the two companies by declaring that it will assess the deal from a perspective of national markets instead of the  European and global outlook taken by  Volvo.

In his meeting with European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, Persson is expected to bring to his attention the deal involving Volvo's and Scania's competitior Mercedes, which was allowed to acquire the German bus company Kaessbohrer even though the deal resulted in Mercedes winning a German market share of just under 60%. In some German states, the market share amounted to between 80% and 96%.

Volvo and Scania dominate the Swedish market with a share of over 93% between them. In the Nordic countries as a whole, Volvo and Scania control betwen 60% and 70% of the market. Volvo wants the takeover to be seen in a European perspective as Sweden and the Nordic countries account for 2% and between 5% and 6% respectively of the entire European market.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti will no doubt listen politely to what Sweden's Prime Minister Goran Persson has to say about the proposed merger between truck companies  Volvo and Scania. However, he is more likely to act on the advice given by the  EU Commission's advisory body which assembles on February 28 and 29. The Commission has as yet never acted against recommendations given by the advisory body.
The EU commissioners will make their definitive decision about the  Volvo-Scania deal on 14 March. [Original article approx 200 words]

BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Wednesday he was confident Volvo would find a solution with the  European Commission to competition problems posed by its acquisition of Scania .

Persson, speaking after meeting  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, said regulatory approval of the acquisition was important for the Swedish economy.

He expressed fears that EU opposition to the deal would mean other companies in Sweden would be unable to merge with other Swedish companies in possible future deals.
Persson said it was important for Sweden and the Swedish economy for the merger to go through.

The EU's competition watchdog has until March 23 to decide whether to clear or block the acquisition. ((Brussels newsroom +322 287 6830, fax +322 230 5573 brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

FOCUS-Sweden's PM urges EU to bless Volvo/Scania.
By Amelia Torres
719 words
16 February 2000
19:43
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2000 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson intervened on Wednesday to urge the European Commission to clear the merger of Swedish truck makers  Volvo AB and  Scania AB, saying a ban would mean other equally big national players could be lost to Sweden.

Persson's dramatic comments and the reaction of  European competition chief Mario Monti showed for the first time that the deal could be in real danger.
Volvo's acquisition of Scania would see the emergence of a powerful world player second only to U.S.-German
DaimlerChrysler but would also create a near monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden.

Persson said other Swedish companies found themselves in the situation of being big in Sweden but in need of growth to become world players. If the Commission blocked the Volvo/Scania deal, other Swedish firms would need to search abroad for partners and could lose their identity.

"If ... total domestic dominance would be an argument against a merger then there would only be the possibility for Swedish companies to find partners abroad. And that might end up in companies leaving Sweden," Persson told reporters after meeting Monti.

The Commission, the EU's competition watchdog, has objected to the 60.7 billion Swedish crowns ($6.99 billion) acquisition because of the monopoly in Sweden, strong positions in other Nordic countries and a big market share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.
Volvo has until Monday to improve concessions made to the Commission and a final ruling must be reached by
March 23, following an in-depth four-month probe of the deal.
EU REBUFFS SWEDEN'S ARGUMENTS

Persson's arguments, which also focused on the importance of Volvo/Scania for jobs in Sweden - they employ directly 1.3 percent of the country's workforce - did not appear to impress Monti. Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny quoted Monti as saying all mergers had to be judged according to the dominance test; that Volvo and Scania were not minnows and that it was precisely competition between the two that had propelled them to the world stage.

"Why should it be in anybody's interest to eliminate that competition between the companies," Tscherny told reporters, noting that customers would suffer.

"Further, the argument that such merger must go ahead because it's necessary in order to create a big global player is not very convincing...they are already global players," he added.
Volvo declined to comment saying it did not intend to conduct the merger review through the media.

The Commission has blocked only 12 mergers since 1990, when it became the clearinghouse for corporate alliances in the 15-nation bloc. But it has imposed conditions, usually asset sell-offs, before approving many other mergers and acquisitions.
VOLVO HAS TO OFFER MORE, BUT WHAT?


Page 19 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Volvo and Scania have offered to open up their services networks to rivals' trucks, Tscherny said, in what he qualified as the "major concession" made so far. But this was not enough.
"At this stage the serious competition concerns that we have identified have not been dispelled," he said. Persson said he was confident the companies and the Commission would "do their best" to find a compromise. But antitrust lawyers failed to see what could be done to solve the monopoly concerns in Sweden, saying that
even a promise to open the dealership networks to rivals' trucks, not just to service them, would probably be
deemed insufficient.
"I've discussed this with industry people, they don't know what can be done," one said.
Volvo and Scania currently produce over 90 percent of the heavy trucks sold in Sweden, with the rest sold by
DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes.

The Commission's tough line does not appear to have been triggered by competitors' complaints as there do not appear to be any, according to industry and legal sources.
At the heart of the regulatory problem is the Commission's conviction that the market for trucks is national, not
European or worldwide, as Volvo would like it to believe.

"Markets in Europe are still national. This is for various reasons of which maybe the most important is that national prices still differ greatly," Tscherny said. ($1=8.679 Swedish Crown).

EU/COMPETITION - COMMISSION EXPECTED TO GIVE STANCE ON 14 MARCH ON VOLVO/SCANIA MERGER.
351 words

MEETING WITH SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER ON WEDNESDAY.

Brussels, 16/02/2000 (Agence Europe) - The spokesperson for the Competition Commissioner confirmed on Wednesday that the European Commission should give its opinion on 14 March on the merger between the Swedish groups Volvo and Scania. Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson met Competition Commissioner Mario Monti late Wednesday afternoon, after President Romano Prodi.
Volvo acquired, in August, a majority stake of the shares held by Investor in Scania and made a public bid closing
29 March. For an estimated cost of SEK 60 billion, the operation will allow the second largest lorry and bus maker
worldwide to be created, after DaimlerChrysler. The two entities should keep the names of their make, announced
Volvo, whose intention is to consolidate its European position to offset its weak position on the American market.

In October, the European Commission opened a detailed investigation on the effects of the merger on competition in the goods vehicle sector (see EUROPE of 27 October). It fears that the two manufacturers will have a cumulated market share that is too high in Scandinavia (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), and also on the specific market of buses in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Volvo Scania would hold 60% of the market in these regions and up to 90% in Sweden, it is said at the Commission. The Commission seems to place special emphasis on after sales services, which are "fundamental in the lorry and bus market". It seems to hope that the Swedish makers will guarantee access to their distribution network to their potential rivals. "It is not certain that commitments are enough", noted the Commission spokesperson however.

Volvo already presented commitments on 10 February and may still make more until Monday 21 February. Volvo CEO Leif Johansson told the press in Gothenburg that his group was ready to open its service centres in Scandinavia. The Swedish press also reports Volvo could be selling its shares in Bilia concessionaries.

Stockholm Asks EU Commission To Approve  Volvo-Scania Merger
By Brandon Mitchener

BRUSSELS -- The unprecedented intervention by Sweden's prime minister on behalf of AB  Volvo and Scania AB
failed to budge the  European Commission.
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson told European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in an unusual
half-hour meeting Wednesday that  Volvo's plan to buy Scania was of "vital importance" to the Swedish economy.

If the commission blocks the merger of the two Swedish truck makers, Volvo or Scania could be forced into a partnership with a foreign company with subsequent "damages to employment in Sweden," Mr. Persson said, according to a spokesman for the Swedish mission to the European Union.

Mr. Persson cited the commission's approval of a merger between two German bus companies as a possible precedent for approving the Volvo-Scania deal, according to Michael Tscherny, a spokesman for Mr. Monti.
But the commission stood by its position that the merger could hurt competition both in the Nordic countries and
in other national markets within the EU. The two Swedish companies have some of the most extensive European
distribution and service networks among truck and bus makers active in the EU.

"If the two merge, they end up with almost total dominance of the Swedish market for heavy trucks," said Mr. Tscherny. The commission is also worried about the companies' collective strength in EU markets for buses, he added.
Mr. Monti told Mr. Persson that he expected Volvo to make any new commitments to appease EU regulators by
Monday, one month before the commission's deadline to pass judgment on the deal.

The commitments the companies have made to date, which include giving competitors access to Volvo and Scania service networks in Sweden, "aren't sufficient" to secure regulatory approval for the deal, Mr. Tscherny said after the meeting.

It is unusual for EU heads of state and government to intervene publicly on behalf of companies that are considered "national champions." In the past, such interventions -- usually by telephone rather than in person -- have generally failed to sway the commission.

Mr. Monti has also made it clear in recent statements that he is opposed to efforts by some EU governments to encourage mergers of local companies in order to forestall cross-border acquisitions that could do more to further the consolidation of the EU's common market.

"We need to make sure national authorities don't improperly interfere with the merger process," he said recently. "It's our responsibility to intervene when mergers have a European relevance."

Some critics have said the Volvo-Scania merger would hurt the evolution of pan-European trucking and financial-service markets by effectively eliminating one of a handful of companies present throughout the EU.

Under the routine EU merger-review procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss the Volvo-Scania deal and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

Volvo/Scania Merger Seen Getting EU Clearance - Analysts
By Rod Stone and Rupini Bergstrom
668 words
17 February 2000

Dow Jones International News

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- With the stakes extremely high, AB  Volvo (VOLVY) should make enough concessions to win approval from the  European Union Commission for its planned takeover of  Scania AB (SCVA).

Analysts said  Volvo will be prepared to offload certain interests in Sweden, and Brussels may decide a stronger global truck maker is in the best interests of  European business. But if it fails, Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) and Fiat SpA's (FIA) Iveco truck unit in particular may seek alliances with the Swedish automotive groups.
After a meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson Wednesday, E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti said concessions offered so far by Volvo and Scania aren't enough to settle antitrust concerns. The E.U.
will give a final decision on the merger March 23.

Volvo and Scania's most substantial concession so far is to open up their service network in Sweden, where the two companies have over 90% of the truck market.

"It would surprise me if this deal is rejected at the end of the day," said Mats Liss, an automotive analyst with Swedbank Markets in Stockholm. "The stakes are very high for Volvo, so it will go the full distance to meet the Commission's demands."

Kenneth Toll, an analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm, said Volvo management can't afford to see the deal fail. "I believe Volvo is willing to make quite substantial concessions...Volvo management has invested so much in this that if this (merger) doesn't go through the management has to go," said Toll.

Liss said he thinks Volvo is willing to let other competitors into its dealership network but it's questionable whether this will convince Brussels. Toll said he thinks Volvo will end up having to sell its service and distribution networks in Sweden.

"I'm not overly concerned by the situation. Of course Volvo is offering as little as possible in every negotiating round," said Anders Trapp, an analyst with Enskilda Securities. "One part wants the maximum concessions while the other side wants the minimum concessions."

Volvo's share price shows investors aren't overly troubled by Wednesday's events. By 1147 GMT, Volvo shares were up SEK0.5 or 0.2% at SEK213.5.


New Alliances Seen Struck If Merger Rejected

Should the Commission reject the alliance, analysts said Volkswagen and Iveco may head the pack of companies wanting ties with Volvo or Scania. Volkswagen has long been linked to Volvo and is known to want build a presence in the heavy truck market.

Swedbank's Liss said a rejection of the Scania merger would hit confidence in Volvo but the market would then focus on new alliances.

"A rejection from the E.U. Commission wouldn't be too dramatic from an operational perspective for Volvo. But it would be seen as a failure and this could hurt the share price. Although soon afterwards, speculation would start mounting about other merger candidates," he said.
Scania shares though may fall up to 15%, added Liss.
Page 26 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Without the Scania link, a cash-rich Volvo would probably go on the acquisition trail for smaller truck makers, analysts said. Last year it sold its car unit to Ford Motor Co. (F) for SEK50 billion. And speculation that it is targeting U.S. truck maker Navistar as a merger or acquisition candidate will likely emerge, as it did following the sale of Volvo's car division.

Trapp of Enskilda Securities believes political factors may ultimately swing the Commission round. "Negotiations are by civil servants and bureaucrats. In the end it's going to be the politicians that decide. To them it's more important to have strong European companies," he said.


A Volvo spokesman said late Wednesday he still believes the Commission will approve the Scania merger but wouldn't comment further on what concessions may have to be made.

THE European Commission said this week that Swedish truck maker  Volvo had until Monday (21 February) to offer more concessions to gain regulatory approval for its planned acquisition of rival  Scania.

A Commission spokesman said the concessions made so far by  Volvo did not go far enough to allay the institution's concerns over the impact of the deal on competition.

THE European Court of Justice has ruled that Deutsche Post AG can require companies to pay extra for it to deliver letters re-mailed from abroad, but not the full domestic stamp price. The landmark ruling, in a case brought by Deutsche Post against a German subsidiary of US banking giant Citigroup, deals a blow to the increasing business practice of sending data electronically to a foreign country and having it re-mailed there to bypass expensive postal costs.
COMMISSION officials said t

his week that the institution would maintain jurisdiction over the merger of telecoms giants MCI WorldCom and Sprint Corp, even after Spring sells its stake in the Global One venture to France Telecom. The statement came a day after the Commission extended its deadline for ruling on the merger, saying it had received undertakings from the companies to address potential anti-trust concerns.
THE Commission revealed this week that it had been offered concessions to address potential competition conce rns raised by the plans of Telekom Austria AG and two investment funds to take joint control of music and book
retailer Libro AG. Competition officials have extended the deadline for ruling on the deal by two weeks to 28
February.

A JOINT venture between paper companies Neusiedler AG of Austria and American Israeli Paper Mills Ltd. has been approved by EU regulators. The venture, to be based in Israel, will produce and market fine and special papers, focusing heavily on Israel and the Middle East
.

GERMAN utility Viag AG said this week it expected to receive EU clearance for its planned 75-million euro merger with German rival Veba AG to form Europe's third-largest utility, even though the Commission had launched an in-depth probe.

A GROUP of 47 European multinational companies have called for radical reform of national pension systems in the EU member states, warning that failure to act would inevitably lead to economic hardship and could damage confidence in the euro. "If they

are not reformed soon, public pension systems in many EU member states pose a threat to the competitiveness of the European economy," said the European Round Table in a report.

EUROPEAN Central Bank board member Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa insisted last week that he saw no need to change the current banking supervisory arrangements covering the 11-country euro zone. "Although the system has its own peculiarities, it is designed in its institutional structure in a way which is completely workable," he
said in a speech at the National Bank of Belgium.

BRUSSELS - Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB  Volvo's bid for rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB is at risk of being thwarted by  EU competition rules, lawyers and analysts said yesterday.  Volvo will have a difficult time finding additional concessions that will meet  EU concerns, after its offer to open its services network to competitors was judged inadequate.

AB Volvo and Scania AB failed to sell  European competition authorities on their merger despite an unprecedented intervention by Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson. He told  European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti yesterday that  Volvo's plan to buy Scania was of "vital importance" to the Swedish economy. If the commission blocks the truck makers' merger, Volvo or Scania could be forced into a partnership with a foreign company with "damages to employment in Sweden," Mr. Persson said, according to a spokesman. The commission, however, stood by its position that the merger could hurt competition in the Nordic countries and in other EU national markets.

SWEDISH prime minister Goran Persson has urged the  European Commission to clear the GBP 7 billion merger of Swedish truck makers  Volvo and Scania.

Volvo's acquisition of  Scania would create a near monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and see the emergence of a powerful world player second only to US-German DaimlerChrysler in the overall truck market. Mr Persson, appealing against the commission's objection to the deal, said: "If total domestic dominance would be an argument against a merger then there would only be the possibility for Swedish companies to find partners abroad."

Companies: EU Commission Unmoved by Plea From Stockholm --- Volvo-Scania Deal Would Hurt
Competition, Officials Say

BRUSSELS -- The unprecedented intervention by Sweden's prime minister on behalf of AB  Volvo and Scania AB
failed to budge the  European Commission.
Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson told European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in an unusual
half-hour meeting Wednesday that  Volvo's plan to buy Scania was of "vital importance" to the Swedish economy.

If the commission blocks the merger of the two Swedish truck makers, Volvo or Scania could be forced into a partnership with a foreign company with subsequent "damages to employment in Sweden," Mr. Persson said, according to a spokesman for the Swedish mission to the European Union.

Mr. Persson cited the commission's approval of a merger between two German bus companies as a possible precedent for approving the Volvo-Scania deal, according to Michael Tscherny, a spokesman for Mr. Monti.
But the commission stood by its position that the merger could hurt competition both in the Nordic countries and
in other national markets within the EU. The two Swedish companies have some of the most extensive European
distribution and service networks among truck and bus makers active in the EU.

"If the two merge, they end up with almost total dominance of the Swedish market for heavy trucks," said Mr. Tscherny. The commission is also worried about the companies' collective strength in EU markets for buses, he added.
Mr. Monti told Mr. Persson that he expected Volvo to make any new commitments to appease EU regulators by
Monday, one month before the commission's deadline to pass judgment on the deal.

The commitments the companies have made to date, including to allow competitors access to Volvo and Scania service networks in Sweden, "aren't sufficient" to secure regulatory approval for the deal, Mr. Tscherny said after the meeting.

It is unusual for EU heads of state and government to intervene publicly on behalf of companies that are considered "national champions." In the past, such interventions -- usually by telephone rather than in person -- have generally failed to sway the commission.

Mr. Monti has also made it clear in recent statements that he is opposed to efforts by some EU governments to encourage mergers of local companies in order to forestall cross-border acquisitions that could do more to further the consolidation of the EU's common market.

ANALYSIS-Volvo/Scania review tests EU rules.

BRUSSELS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's scrutiny of  Volvo AB's attempt to buy fellow Swedish auto maker  Scania AB has brought charges that Brussels discriminates against big companies from small EU countries.

The Commission, the executive body of the 15-member  European Union, is seeking further concessions from the companies by next Monday failing which the deal could be blocked.

But Stockholm argues that Volvo needs the extra bulk to compete internationally and should not be penalised for being a big fish in a small domestic pond.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson put his case in Brussels on Wednesday but historically the chances of a politician swaying European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti are slim.

Persson said a successful company in Sweden is more likely to attain a dominant position in its home market than would be the case of a large German company such as DaimlerChrysler in its domestic market.

Germany has more companies competing for a share of a market of 82 million people than does a small country such as Sweden, with less than nine million people.

The Commission is threatening to block Volvo's 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($7.03 billion) acquisition of Scania saying it would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.
Volvo and Scania, which achieve more than 80 percent of their sales outside Nordic countries, say the
Commission should be looking at the European market as a whole, not the impact on individual countries.
BIG HERE, NOT THERE

Olof Allgarth, director of the Brussels office of the federation of Swedish industries, Industriforbundet, said Swedish paper companies among others could face the same problem if the Commission stuck to its narrow definition of the market.

"My view is that the Commission should have a broader economic approach and make sure that they don't discriminate against small nations," he told Reuters.
Jaime Folguera Crespo, a lawyer with Spanish firm Uria & Menendez, said this was a fair point.
"You have to retain a certain sense of proportionality. You cannot ban a deal because 10 percent of the
customers may be affected...this would mean the vast majority of the customers worldwide would not benefit from
the synergies that might arise from the merger," he said.

Folguera Crespo thought, however, that the Commission ought to ensure that the Swedish market was open to other manufacturers' trucks, for example, by forcing a relaxation in the companies' dealerships contracts.

His opinion was echoed by another lawyer with business clients in the Nordic countries who asked not to be named.



Page 35 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"I have a Danish client that I have to keep warning not to do this or that because it might have a dominant position and he gets angry, saying he can be eaten alive tomorrow by some company from across the German border. He says 'I don't have the size to survive, that's unfair.'"
"Big companies sitting in large countries are naturally winning," he added. WILL THE COMMISSION MOVE?
Competition Commissioner Monti appeared unimpressed by Persson's discrimination argument.

"There is no discrimination whatsover in the Commission's attitude...we treat identical cases in identical manner," Monti's spokesman quoted him as saying, noting that competition between Volvo and Scania, currently owned by Investor, partly explained their success abroad.

He said the Commission was waiting for the firms to improve concessions already made by Monday. The final deadline for a ruling is March 23.

The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to review big mergers and acquisitions - a prerogative given to it by EU governments in 1990 - and is usually keen not be seen as giving in to perceived political interference. ($1=8.636 Swedish Crown).

Volvo-Scania deal won't be monopoly-Sweden truckers.
By Mariam Isa

Reuters News
LBA
English

STOCKHOLM, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Foreign truckmakers could make inroads into the Swedish market if a merger between two dominant rivals,  Volvo and Scania, resulted in steep price rises, domestic haulage firms said on Thursday.

Concern by EU authorities that the proposed merger - which would give the new group more than 90 percent of the Swedish market - would prevent competition was overdone, spokesmen from several Swedish transport companies maintained.

"It is a tradition in Sweden to buy Volvo or Scania. But if you can buy a truck at a cheaper price there is no doubt you would switch to another brand," Per Isacsson, a consultant for state-owned transport company Svelast, told Reuters.

Fears that the European Commission may block the Swedish plan to create the world's second biggest bus and truckmaker began to surface after EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Wednesday that further concessions were needed.

"It's a touchier case now than it was a couple of weeks ago - I think there is a real chance they will say no to the deal," Swedbank auto analyst Matts Liss said.
SCANIA SHARE PRICE PRICES IN THREAT TO MERGER

Scania's share price has reacted to the concern, falling 12 crowns or nearly four percent since Monday. Volvo had offered to pay 315 crowns per share or six new Volvo shares for five Scania shares.

Volvo has until February 21 to come up with more ideas for its 60.7 billion crown acquisition of Scania. The two companies have offered to open up their service and dealership networks to rival trucks, which was seen as a major compromise.
But the EU Commission has so far spurned the offer.

It has cited as its key concerns the virtual monopoly by the two players in Sweden as well as strong positions in other Nordic countries and a dominant share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson stepped into the debate on Wednesday, saying it might force other Swedish companies to search abroad for partners. Between them, Volvo and Scania employ 1.3 percent of the Swedish workforce.

Several Swedish truckers said that as long as foreign truckmakers were able to provide the same type of service as the two domestic leaders, they would replace the preferred Swedish brand with other brands if its price was not competitive.

They also scoffed at the idea that special cabin insulation requirements for extreme cold in Nordic winters were an obstacle to competitors. Many Swedish truck haulage companies use a sprinkling of other brands, particularly Mercedes trucks from global leader DaimlerChrysler, in their fleet.
France's Renault, Fiat's Iveco, and Dutch DAF, owned by U.S. group Paccar, also have a presence.

"I think that if other truckmakers built up their own network of service stations we would consider buying other trucks," Leif Gustafsson, operations manager for haulage company Schenker BTL said.
His comments were echoed by heads of unions for truck haulage in Sweden's specialised timber market. "Other companies make other trucks for the cold. As long as you can get a good service network, you can buy
them," the manager of Trefrakt union told Reuters. Trefrakt is one of three union whose members provide heavy
truck haulage for Swedish forestry group Assidoman.

Volvo has until February 21 to make submissions over Scania

The European Commission has said that  Volvo, the Swedish truck manufacturer, has until 21 February to submit concessions that will enable it to go ahead with its proposed acquisition of the other Swedish truck maker,  Scania.

The submission of concessions by Volvo does not guarantee regulatory approval though, with a spokesperson for the Commission stating that the EC is in negotiations with the company.

Volvo has apparently already proposed to open the company`s dealership network in the Nordic region to competitors as one way of alleviating concerns about a potential monopoly being created by the merger.

However, it is not certain whether or not this will be sufficient and one antitrust lawyer has said that it probably won`t be because rival truck manufacturers, such as Mercedes, could not be guaranteed enough space for their products in Volvo/Scania showrooms.

It has also been said that if it could be proved that the two Swedish companies` current dominance in the Nordic region is due to their special cabin insulation and if rivals hadn`t objected so strongly, then the acquisition may receive approval according to Reuters.
The USD6.91bn bid would make Volvo/Scania the second largest bus and truck manufacturer behind
DaimlerChrysler.

Volvo To Expand Offer To Get EU OK For Scania Buy

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB  Volvo's (VOLVY) said Friday that it plans to expand its offer to the European Union Commission in an effort to obtain antitrust clearance for its bid for rival Swedish truck maker Scania AB (SCVA).

Asked whether  Volvo plans to submit additional concessions, Gothenburg-based  Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg said that it does. But Edenborg declined to comment on the substance of these concessions or the timing of their arrival at the commission.

Volvo's comment comes after the E.U. Commission said Tuesday that the truckmaker's offers to date to remove E.U. antitrust worries were insufficient to gain approval. Volvo's proposals included opening up its post-sales service network to competitors, but no further details were given on other proposals.

Volvo and Scania have until Monday to submit any further offers. The E.U. is due to give a final decision on the merger on March 23.

The Commission has said it is particularly concerned about the companies' dominance in the Swedish truck market, with market shares of over 90% if the two companies merged. The companies would also have over 50% of the Scandinavian truck market. Antitrust problems also exist in the bus and coach markets and in the U.K. and Ireland.

Under normal E.U. competition procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

Volvo To Offer More Concessions To Win Approval For Scania Acquisition
864 words
18 February 2000

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Sweden's  Volvo AB said it will improve its offer to the European Union Commission in order to get antitrust clearance for its $7.5 billion bid for rival Swedish truck maker Scania AB.

Mats Edenborg, spokesman for the maker of commercial vehicles, said  Volvo would make concessions, though he declined to be more specific. So far,  Volvo has offered, among other things, to open up its post-sales service network to competitors.

Volvo's (VOLVY) acquisition of Scania (SCVA, SCVB) would create a powerful player in the world bus-and-truck market, second only to German-American company DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). The EU's worry is that the combined company would have a virtual monopoly over sales of heavy trucks in Sweden

Concerns that the EU might block the deal grew Wednesday when Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said more concessions by Volvo are needed. The Commission has noted that the combined companies would enjoy a
90% share of the Swedish truck market and more than 50% of the larger Scandinavian truck market. Antitrust problems also exist in the bus and coach markets and in the Britain and Ireland.

Volvo and Scania have until Monday to submit any further offers. The EU is expected to give a final decision on the merger on March 23. A commission spokesman said EU regulators are still holding talks with Volvo and Scania about the proposed merger, the Reuters news service reported Friday.

Kenneth Toll, an analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm, said Volvo management can't afford to see the deal fail.

"I believe Volvo is willing to make quite substantial concessions... Volvo management has invested so much in this that if this (merger) doesn't go through the management has to go," he said, adding that he thinks Volvo will end up having to sell its service and distribution networks in Sweden.
Several antitrust lawyers have questioned what Volvo could offer to meet the commission's concerns. "I've discussed this with industry people, they don't know what can be done," one said.
At the heart of the regulatory problem is the Commission's conviction that the market for trucks is national, not
European or world-wide, as Volvo contends.

"Ninety per cent (of the Swedish truck market) is probably pushing their luck a little bit," said one London-based competition lawyer.

"It's hard to see what else they could do other than open up their distribution network," said Peter Willis, a London-based lawyer at Taylor Joynson Garrett who specializes in EU competition law. He noted that similar concessions on service and retail networks won EU approval for a takeover in the bus sector by Mercedes of its German rival Kassbohrer in 1995.

"If the commission isn't just bluffing and isn't going to accept opening up distribution networks, the only alternative is to think about divesting some of their products lines such as coaches or medium-sized trucks," said Willis. The problem is that Volvo and Scania hoped to gain an integrated business, so losing one of their brands or products isn't very attractive, one analyst commented.

Even a commitment to stop selling one brand of trucks in a certain market, say Sweden, might not meet EU concerns. "The commission is reluctant to accept behavioral undertakings because they are less easily monitored, said Willis. It usually wants to see something changed in the corporate structure.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson stepped into the debate Wednesday in a meeting with Monti. Persson argued that companies from smaller EU countries are more likely to have larger market shares in their domestic markets and shouldn't be discriminated against. Persson added that Swedish companies may be big in Sweden, but they need to grow to become world players. If the Commission blocks the Volvo-Scania deal, he claimed, other Swedish concerns will be forced to search abroad for partners and could lose their identity. Between them, Volvo and Scania employ 1.3% of the Swedish workforce.

Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny quoted Monti as saying all mergers must be judged according to the dominance test and that Volvo and Scania aren't minnows, Reuters said. He added that the need for Volvo and Scania to become world players is unconvincing because they already are global players.

Several Swedish truckers have argued that if foreign truck makers are able to provide the same type of service as the two domestic leaders, they would replace the preferred Swedish brand with other brands if Volvo/Scania's price weren't competitive.

Should the Commission reject the alliance, analysts said German auto maker Volkswagen AG and Italian truck maker Iveco SpA may lead the pack of companies wanting ties with Volvo or Scania. Volkswagen is known to want build a presence in the heavy-truck market.

Without the Scania link, a cash-rich Volvo would probably go on the acquisition trail for smaller truck makers, analysts said. Last year it sold its car unit to Ford Motor Co. (F) for about $5.78 billion.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Two Wrongs --- Volvo and Scania: perfect together?

In Stockholm, Goeren Persson is known by his nickname, "HSB," which is the Swedish acronym for "He Who Decides." In Brussels, where the Swedish Prime Minister came yesterday in part to plead the case for  Volvo's acquisition of truck giant  Scania, the moniker belongs to someone else:  European Union Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. But in the case over which they are met, it's an open question whether either man deserves his respective authority.

Let's take Mr. Persson first. The Volvo-Scania deal is largely his baby, the result of a Social-Democratic aversion to seeing national champion Scania gobbled up by any but another Swedish firm.  Volvo had already sold its trophy car division to U.S. auto maker Ford, at great cost to Mr. Persson's pride, if not Sweden's. And there were rumors afoot that  Scania was at risk of being acquired by Volkswagen and  Volvo by DaimlerChrysler. Something had to be done.

By all reports, arranging the marriage wasn't easy. Nor is it obvious that the two companies, whose products and expertise largely overlap (like Coke and Pepsi, say some), really belong together. Should the combination fail, then, the importuning Mr. Persson will bear a heavy burden of blame.

For now, however, the verdict on Volvo-Scania ought to belong to the markets -- and not Mr. Monte. The commissioner is concerned that the deal will create a virtual monopoly of truck and bus makers in Scandinavia and an "oligopolistic" situation in Europe at large. And on the first score, he's nearly right. A combined
Volvo-Scania would initially enjoy as much as 90% of market share in some Nordic countries, proof if ever it was needed that monopolies are the product of government intercession and protectionist economic policies -- and not, as leftists of Mr. Persson's ilk usually imagine, of unchecked free markets.

Of course, Volvo-Scania's dominance needn't last; Nordic buyers can always go south if the company fails to offer competitive prices for its vehicles. As it is, its prospective market share in the European Union as a whole would amount to no more than 31%, which hardly suggests a monopoly. And as for Mr. Monti's worries about oligopoly
-- well, what's the problem? The entire car industry, to take just one example, is dominated by just a handful of players, but neither competition nor consumers seem to suffer.

Conventional wisdom in Brussels these days seems to be that the advent of shareholder capitalism in Europe -- with all the M&A activity that goes along with it -- will require the competition commission to go into overdrive. But as we've noted before, one of the advantages of a large single market is that it actually makes antitrust regulation less necessary than ever before. If Mr. Monte would just see that, we'd be happy to vote him our HSB. Then again, he might be out of a job.

Goteborg; -- Sweden -- Net sales fell to $14.5 billion from $24.76 billion in 1998, just before the company sold its car division. Excluding car sales,  Volvo revenues showed a nine per cent increase from $13.3 billion.

Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, said the automaker was succeeding in its aim of focusing operations on vehicles for commercial use and was hoping for a European Union antitrust decision no later than March 23 on its acquisition of Swedish rival truck and bus maker Scania.

"The objective is to create a larger and stronger industrial base from which we will develop and broaden the line of products we are offering customers," Johansson said in a statement. "The acquisition of Scania will yield savings over the short term."
Volvo, which announced the $6.5-billion sale of its passenger car division to Ford in January 1999, has about
52,500 employees worldwide. Scania has 23,500. The merger with Scania, which would remain a separate
division and retain its trademarks and distribution operations, would create the world's second-largest truck and
bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.
For Volvo's largest business area, trucks, 1999 operating profit rose 28 per cent to $454.9 million.

While U.S. truck deliveries grew 17 per cent, the company had problems meeting the demand and its U.S. market share for heavy trucks declined to 10.7 per cent.

Johansson said the company expected the North American truck market to weaken this year, but that this would be offset by an anticipated increase in demand in Asia and South America.

Also Monday, Volvo's board said it would ask shareholders at an upcoming meeting for a mandate to buy back shares and for permission to use these as payment in possible future transactions.

BRUSSELS, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Friday it was still in talks with  Volvo and
Scania over the regulatory review of the Swedish truck merger, but declined to give any details.

"We're still discussing with  Volvo and Scania, that's all I can say," Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny told the Commission's daily news briefing.

The European Union's watchdog has given the companies until Monday to address its concerns about creation of a dominant position in the Nordic heavy truck market. ((Brussels newsroom +322 287 6830, fax +322 2305573 brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

MONTI DESPONDENT OVER VOLVO/SCANIA CASE, DESPITE HIGH-LEVEL VISIT.

Swedish heavy goods vehicle maker,  Volvo, has a long and uncertain road ahead of it with its campaign to seek EU approval for its expansion plans - particularly when those plans will lead to a virtual monopoly in its home market in the truck sector. The  European Commission warned on February 17 that Volvo would have to make further concessions to get the green light for the Euro 6.9 billion purchase of rival Scania. The Commission's concern centres on the merged company's dominance of specific national markets including Sweden, where it would control more than 90% in the lorry sector, and the United Kingdom, where it would have 70% of the bus chassis market.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told the Swedish Prime Minister, Goran Persson, that it was the competition between Volvo and Scania that had contributed to the two Swedish groups' world-wide success. Moreover, the Commission would not be swayed by the argument that the merger should be cleared because of the need to create a big global player: "It (Volvo) is already the second biggest truck producer", said a spokesman. Volvo has already said it is prepared to make concessions including an offer to allow competitors
access to its Nordic dealership and services network. The Commission said the commitments were "insufficient to dispel concerns". Mr Persson told the Commissioner that attaching conditions to the merger could prevent the company having the critical mass to become a world player. Volvo has until February 21 to offer further concessions and divestment.

FOCUS-EU awaits Volvo's  new concessions.
By Michael Mann

BRUSSELS, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said it expected Swedish truckmaker Volvo to make more commitments later on Monday to address competition concerns over its planned purchase of rival Scania from Investor.

"Volvo has not yet proposed any additional commitments," spokesman Michael Tscherny said. "We expect that they will propose something, but it will probably be late tonight."

The Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, is seeking more concessions from the companies to deal with competition problems, or Volvo's 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.99 billion) purchase of Scania could be blocked.

The Commission has blocked only 12 mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for corporate alliances in the 15-nation EU. But it has imposed conditions, usually asset sell-offs, before approving many other mergers and acquisitions.

Volvo and Scania have offered to open their services network to rivals' trucks, the Commission said last week, in what Tscherny said was the "major concession" so far. This has proved insufficient to satisfy the Commission.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson intervened last week to argue the deal should be given the green light to give Volvo the extra size it needs to compete internationally. Volvo CEO Leif Johansson met EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in Brussels on Monday morning to discuss the issue.

The Commission has argued the deal would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region, as well as a large market share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.
COMPANIES SAY MARKET IS EUROPEAN, NOT NATIONAL

Volvo and Scania, which achieve more than 80 percent of their sales outside the Nordic countries, say the Commission should be looking at the European market as a whole, not the impact of the merger on individual countries.
Antitrust lawyers said it was difficult to identify what the companies could possibly offer to satisfy the Commission. "They could divest parts factories; very nice, but how will it address the competition problems on the retail side?"
said one.

"They could open up their service network, but the Commission has rejected this as insufficient. And offering to sell other makes of truck alongside Volvo/Scania won't interest many people," he added.

However, several Swedish transport companies said last week they might be prepared to invest more heavily in foreign trucks if they could be guaranteed the same level of after-sales service they received from Volvo and Scania.
Many haulage companies use a sprinkling of other brands, particularly Mercedes trucks from global leader
Daimler-Chrysler.
Renault, Fiat's Iveco, and DAF, owned by U.S. group Paccar, also have a presence on the market.

Volvo has refused to comment on reports it has offered to sell its 36.8 percent stake in auto retailer Bilia to gain regulatory clearance.

Tscherny said no announcement would be made before Tuesday on whether the companies had made new commitments. The Commission has until March 23 to rule on the merger. ($1=8.685 Swedish Crown).

The Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, is seeking further concessions from the companies by today to address potential competition concerns or the deal could be blocked.

EU Commission Confirms Volvo Submitted Concessions

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission confirmed Tuesday that it has received new concessions from Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB  Volvo (VOLVY) in its attempt to win antitrust approval for its takeover of rival  Scania AB (SCVA).
"The companies submitted new commitments last night," said E.U. Commission competition spokesman Michael
Tscherny.

Volvo said Friday that it was planning to submit further concessions, after the Commission said Volvo's offers so far were insufficient to remove all antitrust concerns. Volvo's most substantial offer at that point was to open the companies' services networks in Sweden to competitors' vehicles.
Tscherny declined to elaborate on the new concessions. "We are looking at the commitments," he said. The Commission will likely issue a decision on the case on March 14, he said.
If the deal is blocked, either company can maintain a stake in the other, provided neither has a large enough stake to gain control, Tscherny said.

The Commission has said it's particularly concerned about the companies' dominance in the Swedish truck market, where their market share after a merger would be more than 90%. The companies would also have more than 50% of the Scandinavian truck market. Antitrust problems also exist in the bus and coach markets and in the U.K. and Ireland.

Under normal E.U. competition procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

EU Confirms Volvo Submitted New Concessions For Scania Acquisition

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission confirmed Tuesday that it has received new concessions from Sweden's Volvo AB in its attempt to win antitrust approval for its $7.5 billion acquisition of rival truck maker Scania AB.
"The companies submitted new commitments last night," said  EU Commission competition spokesman Michael
Tscherny.

Volvo, a commercial vehicles maker, announced Friday that it was planning to submit further concessions after the panel said its previous offers were insufficient to remove all antitrust concerns. Volvo's most substantial offer at that point was to open the companies' services networks in Sweden to competitors' vehicles.
Tscherny declined to elaborate on the new concessions. "We are looking at the commitments," he said. The commission will likely issue a decision on the case March 14, he said.
If the deal is blocked, either company can maintain a stake in the other, provided neither has a large enough stake to gain control, Tscherny said.

Volvo's (VOLVY) acquisition of Scania (SCVA, SCVB) would create a powerful player in the world bus-and-truck market, second only to German-American company DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). The EU is worried that the combined company would have a virtual monopoly over sales of heavy trucks in Sweden.
The commission has said the combined companies market share after the proposed merger would be more than
90%. The companies also would have more than 50% of the Scandinavian truck market. Antitrust problems also
exist in the bus and coach markets and in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Under normal EU competition procedure, the so-called advisory committee of national competition experts will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on Feb. 28 and 29.

STOCKHOLM, Feb 22 (Reuters) -  Volvo has submitted its "final document" in negotiations with the  European Commission over the intended purchase of rival Swedish truckmaker  Scania which the EU says contains new commitments over competition issues.

Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson spoke on Monday to  EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who is seeking further concessions from the companies in order to address competition concerns.

"We have delivered our final document to the Commission. I cannot reveal the contents today as of course we are still negotiating with the Commission," Volvo spokesman Stefan Lorentzon told Reuters.

He was speaking before a Commission spokesman on Tuesday said: "We can confirm that Volvo made new undertakings late last night."

Asked about the timetable for a decision, Lorentzon said. "You will have to ask the Commission that. As far as we know their final decision will be by March 23."

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson weighed into the debate last week when he met Monti in Brussels and argued that the all-Swedish merger was essential if Volvo was to compete at the international level.

Volvo and Scania have already offered to throw open their service network to other truckmakers, but insist that the Commission should be looking at the European market as a whole rather than the Nordic region.

More than 80 percent of the combined sales of Volvo and Scania are outside the Nordic countries. ((Tony Austin, Stockholm newsroom, +46-8-700 1003, fax +46-8-211601, stockholm.newsroom@reuters.com)).

The European Commission (EC) has confirmed that the Swedish truck manufacturer Volvo has submitted a new proposal containing the concessions it would make if the  EC approved its acquisition of Scania, a smaller truck manufacturer.
Details of the undertakings have not been released and a spokesperson for the  EC would only say that 'the
Commission will probably take a decision by 14 March.'
Volvo has also been unwilling to unveil its concessions.

The planned USD7.06bn merger is under examination by the EC due to concerns that the deal will create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden as well as allowing the merged company to maintain a dominant position in the Nordic region.

Volvo's most substantial originally was to open the companies' services networks in Sweden to competitors' vehicles. A Commission official declined to reveal the new concessions. "We are looking at the commitments", he simply said.The Commission is expected to adopt a Decision on the case on March 14, he added. If the deal is blocked, either company can maintain a stake in the other, provided neither has a large enough stake to gain control.

The Commission has said it is particularly concerned about the companies' dominance in the Swedish heavy goods vehicle market, where their market share after a merger would be more than 90%. The companies would also have more than 50% of the Scandinavian truck market. Furthermore, competition problems also exist in the bus and coach markets and in the UK and Ireland. Under normal EU merger control procedure, the Advisory Committee on Mergers and Acquisitions, made up of national competition experts, will discuss Volvo/Scania and other mergers on February 28 and 29.

European Commission expected to block Volvo-Scania merger

BRUSSELS, March 1 (AFP) - The European Commission is poised to block the proposed merger of Swedish motor manufacturers  Volvo and Scania, EU sources said Wednesday.

According to the sources, the firms have failed to offer sufficient guarantees to respond to the commission's competition concerns.

As the process currently stands, the commission would refuse to grant clearance for the merger in mid-March, they said.
A final decision on the merger was expected on March 14.

The European Commission announced its investigation into Volvo's multi-billion-dollar acquisition of rival Swedish truck-maker Scania on October 25, citing competition concerns.

The inquiry found that the merger would risk creating or reinforcing a dominant position in the heavy trucks and bus markets.

In Europe, Volvo-Scania would be able to claim a market share in excess of 30 percent, compared with 20 percent for German-US giant DaimlerChrysler.

BRUSSELS, March 1 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Wednesday it was "still talking" to Swedish truckmaker Volvo about its planned purchase of rival  Scania from Investor .
"We're still talking to the companies in that case," Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny told Reuters.

The Commission said earlier this week it expected to take its decision on the merger at its meeting on March 14. It is studying new concessions made by the companies to address competition concerns.

The EU's antitrust watchdog must decide whether to clear the deal subject to conditions or block it. Since it became the clearing house for mergers and acquisitions in the 15-nation EU in 1990, the Commission has blocked just 11 mergers.

Tscherny's comments came in response to reports the deal could be blocked because the companies had made insufficient concessions to deal with fears of reduced competition.

The Commission has argued the 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.96 billion) merger as it stands would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region, and give the new group a powerful market share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union is due to issue its final decision on Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB  Volvo's (VOLVY) bid for rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB (SCVA) on March 14, an E.U. Commission spokesman said Thursday.

The spokesman said the deadline for the companies to submit offers to ease antitrust concerns has passed, and the Commission is now considering the companies' offers.
"The deadline for engagements has passed. The Commission is discussing the case," the spokesman said. Volvo has said it made additional submissions to avoid an E.U. veto after its offer to open its services network to
competitors was judged inadequate to meet antitrust concerns.

One key problem is that the two companies would have over 90% of the Swedish truck market. The Commission has also said it is concerned about truck and bus markets throughout Scandinavia, and bus and coach markets in the U.K. and Ireland. The Commission has said it is examining market shares on a national, rather than EU-wide, basis in this case.

STOCKHOLM, March 2 (Reuters) - Swedish vehicle maker AB  Volvo said on Thursday it was still holding talks with the  European Commission about its planned acquisition of rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB .
"The status is that no decision has yet been made and negotiations are continuing,"  Volvo spokesman Mats

EU talks to Volvo as clouds  gather over Scania buy.

BRUSSELS, March 2 (Reuters) - The  European Commission and Volvo said on Thursday they were still discussing the Swedish truckmaker's planned purchase of  Scania from Investor, but some antitrust experts predicted the deal would be blocked.

European Union officials and analysts said the fact that talks were continuing at such a late stage in the merger review suggested that concessions offered by the companies were insufficient to address antitrust concerns. But they said it showed both sides were trying to find a compromise.

"That is certainly a good indication there are problems, otherwise there's no sense in continuing to negotiate," said an EU official.

Some experts drew parallels between the Volvo case and the Commission's September decision to block British tour operator Airtours' takeover of rival First Choice.

"I think the deal is dead," said one London-based analyst. "It's like Airtours. I think they made their mind up a long time ago to block the deal. But in this case, they have a good reason to do so."

Earlier on Thursday, the Swedish media reported that the Commission planned to block the deal, although some lawyers took a more cautious line.
"The case is still open. The fact that they're still talking shows there's something to talk about," said one
Brussels-based competition lawyer.

The Commission said earlier this week it expected to make its decision whether to clear or outlaw the merger at its meeting on March 14. The deadline for it to rule is March 23.

It has argued that the 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.98 billion) merger as it stands would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region, and give the new group a powerful market share for buses and coaches in Britain and Ireland.

The Commission has only blocked 11 mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for mergers and acquisitions in the 15-nation EU.

Volvo and Scania, which achieve more than 80 percent of their sales outside the Nordic countries, argue the Commission should look at the truck business as an international market rather than simply looking at the effects of the link-up on individual national markets.

They have already offered to open their services network to rivals' trucks, and it has been reported they were prepared to divest parts factories and their 36.8 percent stake in auto retailer Bilia.

Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson intervened earlier this month, coming to Brussels to tell EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti the deal should be cleared to give Volvo the extra size it needs to compete internationally.
"Persson's intervention didn't help," said a source close to the negotiations.

EU Commission Set To Block  Volvo-Scania Merger - FT

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- E.U. competition authorities are expected to stop the SEK60 billion merger between
Swedish truckmakers AB  Volvo (VOLVY) and  Scania AB (SCVA) on the grounds that the merged company
would be too powerful in the Nordic market, the Financial Times reported Friday.

Volvo told the paper Thursday that it was still talking to the E.U. Commission's merger task force to offer further concessions to win approval. But it's too late, as undertakings have to be submitted to Brussels by the end of the third month in a four-month investigation, said the paper.

Volvo has indicated that it has drafted contingency plans in the event its bid for Scania is blocked. The firm is understood to be in talks with other manufactures, but has refused to name them.
The Financial Times speculated that Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) may renew its interest in Scania, and said Italy's
Fiat SpA (FIA) - which approached Volvo with a takeover bid in 1998 - was "monitoring the situation carefully."


Mario Monti, the E.U.'s competition commissioner, won't formally present the ruling until March 14, but his officials are understood to have drafted a plan to veto the deal, the Financial Times reported.

Volvo Investors Seen Winners, Whatever Brussels Decides
By Rod Stone and Rupini Bergstrom

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Merger speculation is likely to drive the share price of AB  Volvo (VOLVY) higher if the European Union Commission blocks its proposed takeover of  Scania AB (SCVA).

Analysts said that if the deal fails neither of the Swedish automotive groups is likely to remain independent for too long, given industry consolidation.

They said Volvo is the more desirable target, meaning its shareholders would face little, if any, downside if the deal is blocked. But shares of Scania are likely to be hit in the event of E.U. rejection.

Scania shares tumbled 7% Thursday on media reports that the Commission is preparing to block Volvo's takeover. Volvo shareholders have held on, clinging to hopes that a suitor could emerge.

At 1410 GMT Friday, Scania shares were up SEK3.5, or 1.3%, at SEK278 while Volvo B shares were up SEK6.0, or 2.9%, at SEK213.

Kenneth Toll, an analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm, said Volvo shareholders won't lose if the Scania takeover fails.
"It's not negative for the shares as it (Volvo) will be looked on as a takeover target," he said.

In a research note, Warburg Dillon Read said Volvo shareholders are in a "win-win" situation whatever Brussels decides, but still believes the deal will succeed.

"Regardless of the outcome, the stock is in our view cheap," Warburg Dillon Read said. It also noted that the combined (Volvo-Scania) group would benefit from massive synergies. Volvo on its own may attract bids over SEK300 a share, it said.

Analysts said that with Scania regarded as less appealing than Volvo, its share price would be hit if the deal fails. Its stock could tumble to around SEK240 if Brussels blocks the merger, market participants said.


Volkswagen, Fiat, GM Seen Possible Volvo Suitors

Volkswagen AG (G.VOW), General Motors Corp. (GM) and Fiat SpA (FIA), with its Iveco truck unit, are viewed by industry watchers as the most likely candidates to consider a Volvo buy.

Volkswagen and Fiat have long been linked to Volvo but GM's name has recently started to circulate, according to one stockbroker in Stockholm.

"With Percy Barnevik on the board of General Motors, the idea of a merger with Volvo or Scania isn't totally inconceivable," the stockbroker said.

Barnevik is Chairman of Investor AB (S.INV), the investment company which has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Scania to Volvo.

Swedbank Markets automotive analyst Mats Liss said GM would probably prefer Volvo, but might consider either maker. "Yes, Scania is interesting, but Volvo even more so because it already has a strong presence in the North American truck market," he said.


Page 69 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A cash-rich Volvo could also choose to hit the acquisition trail for smaller truck makers, analysts said. U.S. player
Navistar International Corp. (NAV) is a key candidate, they suggested.

Scania remains a major player on the global stage, but European suitors are less likely to swoop in for it than Volvo. "The only European player Scania could merge with is Volkswagen, which isn't in a hurry to get its hands on it," said the Stockholm-based broker.

"Also, VW can't pay as much for Scania as Volvo is willing to, mainly because a merger between VW and Scania would not yield nearly as great synergies," he added.

Analysts said the Commission may end up backing the deal in the 11th hour in order to preserve European business interests.

"It has become less obvious that the merger will be approved," said Liss. "But at the same time, there are a lot of prestige issues involved. If the Commission doesn't okay the deal, it will paralyze the whole process of consolidation of the heavy vehicle market, and thus open the European market to the U.S.," he said.
Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg declined to comment on the company's options if the merger fails.

"For now we're concentrating on the E.U. process and won't discuss it further until that process has been finalized," he said.
Mario Monti, the E.U.'s Competition Commissioner, won't formally present the ruling until March 14.

EU Commission Reportedly Prepared To Scuttle  Volvo-Scania Merger

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)-  European Union competition authorities are reportedly prepared to block  Volvo AB's planned $7.5 billion acquisition of rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB because the merged company would wield too much power in the Nordic market.

Mario Monti, the  EU's competition commissioner, won't formally present the ruling until March 14, but his aides are understood to have drafted a plan to veto the deal, London's Financial Times reported.

Volvo's (VOLVY) acquisition of Scania (SCVA,SCVB) would create a powerful player in the global bus-and-truck market, second only to German-American auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX).

The EU is worried that the deal - which faces antitrust problems in the United Kingdom and Ireland - would create a company with a virtual monopoly over sales of heavy trucks in Sweden.
The combined company would have a market share of more than 90% in Sweden and 50% in Scandinavia. Still, others suggested the commission may end up backing the deal in the 11th hour in order to preserve
European business interests.

"It has become less obvious that the merger will be approved," said Swedbank Markets automotive analyst Mats Liss. "But at the same time, there are a lot of prestige issues involved. If the Commission doesn't okay the deal, it will paralyze the whole process of consolidation of the heavy vehicle market, and thus open the European market to the U.S.," he said.

According to the Financial Times, Volvo is willing to offer further concessions to win approval for the Scania deal, but has missed the deadline for making such offers. Concessions have to be submitted to EU authorities by the end of the third month of a four-month investigation.

Volvo, which already owns 20% of Scania, had already offered to open up its post-sales service network to competitors, leaving market watchers wondering how far the company could bend to meet EU concerns before the deal would break.

"It's hard to see what else they could do other than open up their distribution network," Peter Willis, a London-based lawyer at Taylor Joynson Garrett who specializes in EU competition law, told Dow Jones Newswires last month. He noted that similar concessions on service and retail networks won EU approval for a takeover in the bus sector by Mercedes of its German rival Kassbohrer in 1995.

"If the commission isn't just bluffing and isn't going to accept opening up distribution networks, the only alternative is to think about divesting some of their products lines such as coaches or medium-sized trucks," Willis said.

Volvo and Scania hoped to gain an integrated business, so losing one of their brands or products isn't very attractive, one analyst commented.

Market watchers also note that Volvo's top management has made a significant investment in securing Scania and may be forced out if the deal collapses.

The bus-and-truck market is a small but significant piece of the world-wide vehicle market and the possible failure of the Volvo-Scania deal raises new scenarios.

Volvo has indicated that it has drafted contingency plans in the event its bid for Scania is blocked. The company is understood to be in talks with other manufacturers, but has refused to name them.

In a research note, Warburg Dillon Read said Volvo shareholders are in a "win-win" situation whatever Brussels decides, but still believes the deal will succeed.

"Regardless of the outcome, the stock is in our view cheap," Warburg Dillon Read said. It also noted that the combined Volvo-Scania group would benefit from massive synergies. Volvo on its own may attract bids over 300
Swedish kronor ($34.10) a share, it said.

Scania is generally seen as less appealing than Volvo and its share price to take a beating if the deal fails, analysts said.

Market speculation has linked Volvo with both Volkswagen and Fiat, but General Motor's (GM) name has recently begun to circulate, according to one stockbroker in Stockholm.

"With Percy Barnevik on the board of General Motors, the idea of a merger with Volvo or Scania isn't totally inconceivable," the stockbroker said. Barnevik is Chairman of Investor AB, the investment company which has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Scania to Volvo.

Volvo might also seek to acquire smaller truck makers, such as U.S.-based Navistar International Corp. (NAV), they suggested.

Brussels, 02/03/2000 (Agence  Europe) - According to  European sources the European Commission could oppose, on the 14 March, the merger of the Swedish truck manufacturers Volvo and Scania. The new undertakings presented a week ago by the manufacturers would not be enough to remove the fears on the compatibility of the operation with  European competition regulations. The  European services also fear that the two manufacturers may dominate the truck and bus market in Scandinavia, where the new group represents more than 60% of the market. The undertaking to open the dealership networks to competitors was not enough to convince the Commission. The deadline to put forward new undertakings has passed but the discussions
continue between the  European institution, the Swedish authorities and the two manufacturers.

THE European Commission is expected to block  Volvo's GBP 4.3 billion merger with fellow Scandinavian truck maker Scania.

Such a move could leave both companies liable to takeover from foreign predators, with Volkswagen and Fiat talked-about favourites.

Volvo, which last year sold its car division to Ford to concentrate on commercial vehicles, is still hopeful of seeing the deal sanctioned. A decision is due on March 14.

The Commission has blocked only 11 deals since its inception but Mario Monti, the EC's competition commissioner, is considering blocking the Volvo/Scania merger as he believes Volvo has not offered enough concessions to avoid a monopoly situation in Scandinavia.

FOCUS-EU set to block Volvo buy of Scania.

BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is set to block the proposed acquisition by Swedish truck maker Volvo AB of rival  Scania AB from Investor AB on March 14, a  European Union source said on Friday.
"On the basis of the submissions they have made so far approval is very unlikely," the source said, describing as
"good reports" media suggestions the deal would be prohibited.
The Commission and Volvo said on Thursday they were still discussing how best to address concerns that the
60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.93 billion) deal would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a
dominant position in the Nordic region.
Under the EU's merger rules, it is in theory too late for the company to offer any new concessions to gain the
Commission's blessing, although deadlines have proved flexible in the past.

The Commission has only blocked 11 mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for corporate alliances in the 15-nation EU.

But in Vovo's case, the EU's executive has concluded that the remedies suggested by Volvo to meet competition concerns are not sufficient. On Tuesday, the Commission asked a committee of merger experts from the 15 EU states to back its proposal to stop the merger, sources said.

The companies had offered to open their services network to rivals' trucks, and it has been reported they were prepared to sell parts factories and their 36.8 percent stake in auto retailer Bilia AB.
The decision to block the merger will be highly politically sensitive in Sweden.

Prime Minister Goran Persson intervened personally earlier this month, meeting EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to persuade him to look at truck manufacturing as an international market rather than merely at the effect of the merger on narrow national markets.
Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny confirmed that the Commission's formal ruling would be made on
March 14.

If the Commission does stop the deal in its present form, the companies would still be able to come back at a later stage with a new merger plan, on condition they were willing to offer more far-reaching concessions to deal with antitrust concerns.

But Swedish newspapers reported on Friday that both Volvo and Scania could be up for grabs by other predators if the deal is shot down. ($1=8.759 Swedish Crown).

Scania merger veto would rock Volvo strategy.

LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - A Brussels veto of Swedish truck maker  Volvo AB's takeover of  Scania would be a blow to Volvo's long term strategy and set off a scramble among other potential  Scania suitors, analysts said on Friday.

News that the European Commission and Volvo were still discussing the 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.98 billion) merger with Scania on Thursday led some to believe it was in jepoardy.

A European union source on Friday said the Commission is set to block the deal on the basis of current submissions. But an industry analyst at a major investment bank in London said it was premature to say that the deal was doomed.

Analysts believe that objections to the deal from the Competition Commission, centring on the dominant market share the two would have in the Nordic region, could be overcome.

The Nordic region accounts for only about four percent of the west European heavy truck market, and Volvo would be keen to make sure its global strategy was not derailed by problems in a relatively unimportant part of its empire, they said.

The Commission said earlier this week that the merger would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region, as well as a big share of the bus bus and coach market in Britain and Ireland.
The Commission is expected to make a decision on March 14. The deadline for it to rule is March 23. VETO WOULD DERAIL VOLVO STRATEGY
Richard Walles, chief truck analyst at Standard and Poors DRI, said Volvo would be determined to save the deal which was crucial to its future.

"It would be a tragic blow to Volvo's ambitions of being the second biggest (truck) player in the world. This deal was designed to make it a key global player," Walles said.

"Volvo could allow competitors access to its Nordic dealer and services network, or take the drastic step of offering to limit their share in the Nordic region to an acceptable level," Walles said.

Peter Schmidt of Automotive Industry Data agreed that the Sdeal was crucial for Volvo, but that if it was killed there would be no shortage of suitors for Scania.
"If it didn't happen this would leave Volvo in a very difficult position because it has sold its car involvement to Ford
() with the clear intention of investing that money to boost its truck business," Schmidt said.
"Volvo can't turn the clock back and it would have to buy an alternative; (Fiat's) Iveco or MAN or last but not least
(Renault's) RVI; VW's interest in Scania is on the record," Schmidt said.
Schmidt lauded a Volvo/Scania combination which would be a thorn in the side to market leader DaimlerChrysler. ABSOLUTE PERFECT SENSE

"This merger is one of the few in the automotive market that makes absolute perfect sense," Schmidt said.
He said Volvo and Scania, separately, had forced DaimlerChrysler to slash prices on its Actros heavy truck range. DRI's Walles expected a veto to start a scramble for Scania.
"Iveco was in fact speaking to Scania when Volvo made the hostile bid in January 1999. Also VW was very keen and they are determined to enter the heavy truck market and will do so one way or another. Also there's the possibility of other smaller players like MAN and RVI looking to take advantage of the situation and seeking some sort of alliance," Walles said.
Volvo shares were trading 11.5 crowns higher at 218.5 in late afternoon trading. Scania was down 1.0 at 275.0. (C) Reuters Limited 2000.

FOCUS-Swedes boil over talk of EU blocking Volvo.
By Tony Austin

STOCKHOLM, March 3 (Reuters) - Swedish trade unions protested on Friday at what they feared would be the
European Commission's rejection of a planned truck merger between  Volvo and Scania.

A European Union source said on Friday: "On the basis of the submissions they have made so far approval is very unlikely," describing as "good reports" media suggestions the deal would be prohibited.
Swedish metalworkers, worried about their jobs, complained in an open letter to Brussels about the way the
Commission was handling its probe into competition aspects of the move.
The civil engineers' association said a veto would be a slap in the face for Sweden and would harden anti-EU
sentiment there.

"As warm friends of the EU we would have pause for thought. It can't help the EU cause if little countries on the fringe have to stand back before the bigger countries' interests," the association's chief executive Joran Tjernell said in a statement.
The Commission and Volvo said on Thursday they were still discussing how best to address concerns that the
60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.93 billion) deal would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a
dominant position in the Nordic region.
The Commission is expected to announce its verdict on March 14, and must make a ruling by March 23. SWEDEN SAYS LOOK AT EU MARKET, NOT JUST NORDIC
Sweden, led by Prime Minister Goran Persson, asserts that the merger would not give Volvo a monopoly in the
EU, and it is prepared to make concessions in the Nordic countries where it dominates the truck market.

Metalworkers' chairmen at Volvo and Skania, who sit on their companies' boards, said they thought Volvo management had already gone too far to meet EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's demand for concessions.

The two Swedish firms have offered to open their services network to competitors' trucks, and some reports have said they are prepared to divest parts factories and Volvo's 36.8 percent stake in auto retailer Bilia.

"With dismay, we now see that the competition authorities are not satisfied with concessions to date, but want to go even further," the union officials added.

The unions said DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes had been allowed to buy bus competitor Kassboehrer, giving it more than 70 percent of the German market for city buses, and the possible loss of 3,000 jobs had been a factor in EU approval.

"We fear that significantly more than this number will lose their jobs in Sweden if this acquisition cannot be implemented under reasonable terms," they said.

Volvo may turn out to have made a terrible miscalculation if the bid is blocked and both Swedish firms could be up for grabs, according to Swedish analysts.

"I think it is remarkable that they have stumbled upon formal obstacles in such an important deal," car industry analyst Matts Carlsson of Chalmers told TT news agency.
"One cannot draw any conclusion except that they have made a serious error of judgment," he added. Scania first, but also Volvo, might fall prey to predators.
Volkswagen, which wants to enter the truck market, Mercedes, and even competitors Fiat's Iveco and U.S. company Paccar Inc were mentioned by analysts as possible buyers.

Scania's share was trading 3.5 crowns lower at 272.5 while Volvo's was 11 higher at 218 in a positive market. ($1=8.772 Swedish Crown).

Volvo and Scania soon in play again? - Sweden press.

STOCKHOLM, March 3 (Reuters) - Any decision by the  European Commission to block the merger between Volvo and Scania would put both companies up for grabs by other predators, Swedish newspapers reported on Friday.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is minded to block the fusion on antitrust grounds, press reported, quoting unnamed sources in Brussels.

The Commission has said negotiations are still going on and it expects to decide on March 14 whether to let the merger through. The deadline for a ruling is March 23.


Stockholm daily Svenska Dagbladet said Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes could be interested in picking up the pieces if the Commission indeed stopped the deal.

"Volkswagen has shown interest in Scania before and wants to enter the heavy truck sector," the paper quoted
Swedbank analyst Mats Liss as saying.

Mercedes could be another bidder for Scania, which is considered the crown jewel of the sector, the paper said, adding that Fiat's Iveco and U.S. company Paccar Inc might also enter the fray.

Business daily FinansTidningen said that antitrust experts from EU governments, an advisory committee which met the Commission on Tuesday, had also recommended blocking the deal.

Volvo chief executive Lennart Johansson was in Brussels on Thursday and told the paper: "We are absolutely focused on conducting the negotiations in a good way. We would not negotiate if we did not think they would succeed."

The country's top-selling business daily Dagens Industri said Percy Barnevik, chairman of Investor AB which is the main owner of Scania, also met Monti in Brussels on Thursday.
Papers speculated about the possible reaction of Investor AB, controlling 27.8 percent of Scania's capital and
49.3 pct of the votes.
Scania wants to divest its core holdings in companies like Scania in favour of growth stocks.
Dagens Nyheter, which said only a miracle could now rescue the merger, noted that Volvo had already bought
Scania shares for 27.5 billion crowns, while Investor had in turn purchased Volvo stock for five billion.
Investor still owns Scania shares which Volvo has pledged to buy for 17 billion crowns.

Uncertainty as to the outcome of the merger focused on the future of Investor's remaining shareholding in Scania on Thursday, and the share fell 19 crowns to 276.

BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission is likely to block the proposed acquisition by Swedish truck maker  Volvo AB of rival Scania AB as the deal currently stands, a  European Union source said on Friday.
"On the basis of the submissions they have made so far approval is very unlikely," the source said.

The Commission and Volvo said on Thursday they were still discussing how best to address concerns that the deal would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.
Under the EU's merger rules, it is now too late for the company to offer any new concessions to gain the
Commission's blessing, but deadlines have proved flexible in the past.

The Commission has only blocked 11 mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for corporate alliances in the 15-nation EU.
Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny confirmed that the Commission's formal ruling would be made on
March 14. ((Brussels newsroom, +322 287 6830, fax +322 230 573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

Volvo Hopes Concessions Will 'Please' EU Commission

GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP)--Volvo (VOLVY) said Saturday it has offered to reduce its market share in the Nordic area in a last-minute effort to gain European Commission approval for its merger with rival Swedish
bus-and-truckmaker Scania (SCVA).
The Goteborg-based company promised to reduce its share of the heavy truck market in Sweden and Norway by
15% each and in Finland by 10%, spokesman Mats Edenborg said.

Volvo has already promised to open to competition the extensive retail and service network for the truck divisions maintained by both companies.

"We feel that these concessions should be strong enough to please the commission," Edenborg said. "They will achieve what the commission wanted to do - to decrease our market share."

He declined to comment on plans for the bus division or whether any concessions were made regarding the company's strong market share in Britain and Ireland, about which the commission also has expressed concern.

The European Commission launched a full antitrust prove into the planned takeover in October after it expressed concerns that the 60.7 billion kronor merger would strengthen the company's already dominant position in the truck and bus market.

The proposed merger, announced in August, would create the world's second-largest truck- and bus-maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.

The company, which sold its passenger car division to U.S.-based Ford Motor Co. last year, has a market share of about 90% in Sweden, 70% in Norway and 65% in Finland, Edenborg said.
"We'll completely stop the construction and sale of trucks when we reach the promised limits," Edenborg said. The commission, which can veto or demand alterations to mergers it judges to violate competition rules, was
expected to announce its ruling later this month.

Edenborg said the concessions had been offered to the EU commission on Friday and they had received no response as of Saturday.
Volvo, which had a net income last year of 32.2 billion kronor has about 52,500 employees worldwide and Scania
23,500.

Volvo Trucks cannot amend Scania takeover proposal: EC

BRUSSELS, March 4 (AFP) - Swedish truck manfacturer  Volvo will need to offer  EU competition officials an entirely new proposal if it wants to change the terms of its planned buy-out of local rival  Scania, a European Commission spokesman said Saturday.

The Commission said it would not accept last minute alterations to  Volvo's proposal after the Financial Times reported the firm was ready to offer new concessions.
"Volvo can no longer come with substantial new elements," to influence the Commission, the spokesman told
AFP.

According to the Financial Times, Volvo told the Commission Friday that it was prepared to ship fewer trucks to dealers in order to cut its share of the Scandinavian market.

A merged Volvo-Scania would dominate the truck and coach market in Scandinavia. The Commission is understood to be prepared to block the takeover in the interests of preserving competition.

In the last month of its inquiry the Commission can accept no changes to a project under examination, the spokesman explained. A decision on Volvo's bid is expected on March 23.

"In such a situation, firms can always withdraw their proposal and come back with another one which takes account of our concerns, which happens a lot, rather than risk being turned down," the spokesman said.
If the merger goes ahead the new firm would become the world's second largest truck manufacturer after
Germany's DaimlerChrysler and the biggest supplier in Europe where it would hold 30 per cent of the market.

GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) - Volvo said Saturday that it has offered to reduce its market share in the Nordic area in a last-minute effort to gain European Commission approval for its merger with rival Swedish
bus-and-truckmaker Scania.
The Goteborg-based company promised to reduce its share of the heavy truck market in Sweden and Norway by
15 percent each and in Finland by 10 percent, according to the Swedish news agency TT.

Volvo has already promised to open the extensive retail and service network for the truck divisions maintained by both companies to competition, TT reported.

"This solution in combination with the earlier promised concessions should be attractive for the EU commission," Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg told the news agency. He declined to comment on plans for the bus division.

The European Commission launched a full antitrust prove into the planned takeover in October after it expressed concerns that the 60.7 billion kronor (dlrs 6.9 billion) merger would strengthen the company's already dominant position in the truck and bus market.

The proposed merger, announced in August, would create the world's second-largest truck- and bus-maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.

However, with the combined companies reported to have shares of between 60 to 90 percent of Nordic bus and truck markets, the deal immediately raised competition concerns.

The company, which sold its passenger car division to Ford last year, has promised to limit its market share to 75 percent in Sweden and still lower in Norway and Finland.

"We'll conclude entirely the construction and sale of trucks when we reach the promised boundaries," Edenborg said.

The commission, which can veto or demand alterations to mergers it judges to violate competition rules, was expected to announce its ruling later this month.

Edenborg said the concessions had been offered to the EU commission on Friday and they had received no response as of Saturday.

Volvo offers more concessions in Scania bid.

ABSTRACT By Jonathan Lynn
STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Reuters) - Swedish truckmaker AB  Volvo has offered to cut sales in Scandinavia in a
last-minute effort to win  EU approval for its agreed takeover of Swedish rival  Scania AB,  Volvo said on Saturday.

Volvo's head of information Mats Edenborg told Reuters Volvo had offered to cut its market share in heavy trucks in Sweden and Norway by 15 percent and by 10 percent in Finland to persuade EU competition commissioner Mario Monti to approve the deal.

Volvo had also offered other concessions, which he declined to specify. Under EU merger rules the deadline for concessions has already passed, but Volvo believes it is not too late.

The Commission is expected to announce its verdict on the 60.7 billion crown ($6.93 billion) merger, which would create the world's second biggest truck maker, on March 14 and it must make a decision by March 23.

"The negotiations are going on," Edenborg said. "There will be people in contact with the Commission, representatives from Volvo's executive committee."
An EU source said on Friday, before the latest concessions were offered, that approval was very unlikely. News of the possible veto has caused outrage in Sweden where the deal, backed by Prime Minister Goran
Persson, is seen as essential for the future of manufacturing in Sweden.

The ruling Social Democratic Party holds an extraordinary congress next week to decide whether to back Swedish entry into the single European currency, and a surge in anti-EU sentiment in euro-sceptical Sweden is the last thing Persson wants.
NORDIC MARKET OR SINGLE MARKET

The commission's objections centre on the fact that the merger would give the combined group a virtual monopoly of truck sales in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region. Last year the two had a combined market share of 93 percent in Sweden, 71 percent in Norway and 67 percent in Finland.

Volvo argues that the commission should be looking at the entire EU single market, not just the Nordic countries, which accounts for only about four percent of the west European heavy truck market and less than 20 percent of Volvo-Scania sales.

Swedes point out that the commission is putting pressure on Sweden to drop its restrictions on alcohol and tobacco imports in the name of the single market, but has so far declined to view Volvo's and Scania's truck sales on a market-wide basis.

Swedish unions - fearing that the price of EU approval will be the loss of jobs in Sweden - have written to the commission complaining at the way the deal was being handled and arguing that Volvo had already made too many concessions.

The two companies have already offered to open their service networks to competitors, and some reports say they are prepared to divest parts factories and Volvo's 36.8 percent stake in auto retailer Bilia AB.

If the deal collapses both Volvo, which sold its car business to Ford last year to focus on trucks, and Scania could become takeover targets. The prospect helped boost Volvo's share price on Friday.
Possible predators include Germany's Volkswagen, U.S.-German group Daimler-Chrysler and Italy's Fiat. Analysts have speculated that in order to pre-empt moves from any of these, Volvo might seek to consummate a
new marriage with Renault's RVI or U.S. group Paccar Inc. ($1=8.759 Swedish Crown).

EU Commission Is Set To Block the Merger Of Volvo and Scania

BRUSSELS -- After months of investigation and high-profile lobbying, the  European Commission appears ready to block a merger between AB Volvo and Scania AB because the two Swedish truck makers would have too large a share of some European national markets for heavy trucks and buses.

"On the basis of the submissions they made, the commission is unlikely to approve it," said a commission official familiar with the situation. About two weeks ago, Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson pleaded for the deal's approval.

Volvo agreed in August to acquire Scania for nearly seven billion euros ($6.76 billion) in a cash and stock deal that would unite the world's No. 2 and No. 3 makers of heavy trucks.

Theoretically, the companies could withdraw their merger notification before the official commission decision is made this month, and start the process all over again with a new merger proposal.

However, in this case, it appears unlikely that Volvo and Scania could come up with divestments that would satisfy the commission. The companies already have offered to allow competitors access to their service networks in Sweden, but European Union antitrust regulators deemed that concession insufficient.

The deadline for the company to submit remedies to the commission's concerns expired on Feb. 22, one month before the final March 23 deadline.

Volvo and Scania said they are still conducting last-minute negotiations with the commission and that it is premature to speculate on the outcome.

Volvo Offers To Cut Market Share To Get Scania Buy Approved

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Sweden's AB Volvo (VOLVY) has offered to cut its market share in the Nordic truck market in order to get approval from the European Union Commission for its bid for  Scania AB (SCVA).

Under this latest concession,  Volvo and Scania would take measures to cut their combined share of the truck market in Sweden and Norway by 15%, Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg said Monday. The market share in Finland would be cut by 10%.

E.U. competition authorities are worried that the merger would create a dominant player in the Nordic region. The combined group would have around a 90% share of the Swedish truck market.

Edenborg said this new concession combined with a previous offer to open its Nordic truck dealer networks to competitors may be enough to placate Brussels. "There should be a goods chance to come to an agreement with this proposal," he told Dow Jones Newswires.

Truck deliveries to suppliers would be cut to reduce Volvo and Scania's share of the Nordic market. Edenborg wouldn't comment on whether the companies would reduce their share of the Nordic bus markets as well.


The Commission is expected to give a ruling on the merger on March 14 but the final deadline is March 23.

Volvo's  New Offer Seen Unlikely  To Sway Brussels
By Rod Stone

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- AB Volvo's (VOLVY) eleventh hour offer to limit truck sales in the Nordic region is unlikely to persuade the European Union Commission to approve its proposed takeover of  Scania AB (SCVA).

Observers said Volvo and Scania's proposal to cut market share in the Nordic region may not placate the Commission as these types of undertakings can prove difficult to monitor and enforce.  Volvo might withdraw its current merger application and refile a new one, they added.

Under an offer submitted Friday, Volvo and Scania would impose truck sales quotas in order to cut market share in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The combined group would have a market share of around 90% in Sweden,
70% in Norway and 65% in Finland.

This market penetration has troubled E.U. competition authorities and Volvo and Scania have already offered to open-up their dealer networks to competitors.

Volvo and Scania would seek to cut their combined market share by 15 percentage points in Sweden and Norway and by 10 percentage points in Finland, according to Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg Monday.
Peter Willis, a lawyer specializing in E.U. competition law for Taylor Joynson Garrett in London, said the
Commission doesn't like accepting promises from companies about what they will or won't do in the future.

"The Commission is reluctant to accept behavioral undertakings, it usually wants to see something changed in the corporate structure," he said. Behavioral promises require continuous enforcement and monitoring whereas structural changes such as selling of a unit are much simpler to verify, he explained.

Willis said Volvo's offer is a rare step in these cases. "It's a very odd thing to do and (may suggest) desperation," he said.

Anders Trapp, an automotive analyst for Enskilda Securities in Stockholm, said Brussels will probably still block the merger and believes Volvo may have to submit a new merger proposal. "I don't think it's enough," he said.
Trapp also questions the legality of refusing to deliver products to distributors in Sweden.

Commission officials said Monday the latest offer may be too late as the deadline for Volvo to submit remedies to its concerns expired Feb. 22. Volvo's Edenborg though said the offer has been registered as a modification to existing proposals and concessions.

Volvo share closed down 2.5%, or SEK5.5, at SEK212 while Scania shares closed up SEK3, or 1.1%, at SEK275 in Stockholm.


Even With Offer, Mkt Shr Still A Worry

Volvo and Scania would still be above the E.U. antitrust alert threshold of around 40% in the Nordic region even with this new offer, legal sources added.
Trapp said Volvo is basing its case on the E.U.'s 1995 approval of Mercedes takeover in the bus sector of
German rival Kassbohrer. The merger created a company with a market share of around 75% in Germany.



Page 95 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Trapp said Brussels is unlikely to want to use this deal as a precedent as the bus group's market share remains extremely high in Germany.

Nevertheless, Volvo's Edenborg said the new concession combined with the previous offer to open up dealer networks may be enough. "There should be a good chance to come to an agreement with this proposal," he said.

While they enjoy near monopoly status, the Nordic markets are reasonably small for the two Swedish truck makers. Out of Volvo's global truck deliveries last year of around 85,000, Sweden accounted for 2,370, Norway
1,100 and Finland 1,000.
As for Scania, 2,337 of its trucks were registered in Sweden during 1999.


Theoretically, Volvo and Scania could withdraw the merger notification before the Commission decision is taken later in March and restart the process with a new merger proposal. The Commission is expected to give a ruling on March 14 but the final deadline is March 23.

Volvo, Scania Offer To Cut Market Share To Win Merger Approval From EU

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)-  Volvo AB, seeking to overcome regulators' resistance to its proposed acquisition of Scania AB, has offered to cut the combined company's Scandinavian market share to ease  European Commission concerns that the two Swedish truck makers would have a disproportionately large share of some European markets for heavy trucks and buses.

The latest proposal calls for  Volvo (VOLVY) and  Scania (SCVA, SCVB) to reduce their combined share of the truck market in Sweden and Norway by 15%, and the market share in Finland by 10%, said  Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg.

Volvo agreed to acquire Scania in August for about seven billion euros ($6.76 billion) in a cash-and-stock deal that would unite the world's No. 2 and No. 3 heavy truck makers. As it stands now, the combined company would have market share of more than 90% in Sweden and 50% in Scandinavia.
The combination would create a powerful player in the global bus-and-truck market, second only to
German-American auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). In addition to the European Union's concerns, the deal
faces antitrust problems in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Edenborg said the latest proposed concession - along with a previous offer to open the combined company's Nordic truck dealer networks to competitors - may be enough to placate the European Commission, the EU's executive branch. "There should be a goods chance to come to an agreement with this proposal," he told Dow Jones Newswires.

Truck deliveries to suppliers would be cut to reduce Volvo and Scania's share of the Nordic market. Edenborg wouldn't comment on whether the companies would reduce their share of the Nordic bus markets as well.
The Commission is expected to give a ruling on the merger on March 14 but the final deadline is March 23. Some market watchers have suggested the commission will end up supporting the deal at the last minute to
preserve European business interests.

"It has become less obvious that the merger will be approved," Swedbank Markets automotive analyst Mats Liss said last week. "There are a lot of prestige issues involved. If the Commission doesn't okay the deal, it will paralyze the whole process of consolidation of the heavy vehicle market, and thus open the European market to the U.S."

BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Monday it had not received any new commitments from Swedish truckmaker Volvo to address potential competition problems relating to its planned acquisition of rival truckmaker  Scania from Investor .

"There have been discussions but no new formal commitments have been filed to us," said Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull. "We can't be faced with last-minute changes but if proposals are made, we wouldn't refuse to discuss them."

Volvo told Reuters on Saturday that it had offered to cut sales in Scandinavia to try to win the Commission's approval for the planned 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.92 billion) merger.

An EU source said on Friday the Commission, the EU's anti-trust watchdog, was set to block the deal because of concerns that the new company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.

Under the EU's four-month extended investigations into complex mergers, companies have until a month before the deadline to make undertakings to address anti-trust concerns. The deadline for a decision on Volvo's purchase of Scania is set for March 23 and Faull said it was formally too late for new commitments.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is expected to announce his decision on March 14. ((Brussels newsroom, +322 287 6830, fax +322 230 573, brussels.newsroom@reuters.com)).

STOCKHOLM, March 6 (Reuters) - Swedish truckmaker  Volvo said on Monday that it had changed the terms of its planned acquisition of rival group  Scania in an effort to address the concerns of the  European Union's Commission.

AB Volvo was commenting on a statement from the  EU's competition watchdog on Monday which said it had not received any new commitments from  Volvo to address potential competition problems relating to the merger.

Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg told Reuters that the modifications it had proposed were not new but rather changes to the current application which the Commission is analysing.

"The modifications about market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland which we presented on Friday are within the framework of the old application," Edenborg said. "Our modifications have been the basis of discussion
today."

On Friday Volvo offered to reduce its market shares for heavy trucks in the Nordic region to win EU approval of the 60.7 billion Swedish crowns ($6.93 billion) merger which would create the world's second biggest truckmaker.

Earlier Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull said no new formal commitments had been filed to them, adding that it could not be presented with last-minute changes but that if proposals were made they would not refuse to discuss them.

Under EU merger rules it is already too late for Volvo to file new conditions to its takeover bid, so the success of Volvo's latest effort to save the deal depends on whether the commission regards its offer as a modification of the existing terms.
The commission is expected to announced its verdict on March 14 and must make a decision by March 23. Volvo shares were six crowns lower at 211.5 crowns while Scania shares were up two crowns at 274. ((Olof

FOCUS-EU says has nothing new from Volvo on Scania.
By Michael Mann

English
(c) 2000 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, March 6 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Monday it was too late for Swedish truckmaker Volvo to make new offers to address competition problems over its planned acquisition of rival Scania, suggesting it still planned to block the merger next week.

Volvo said on Saturday it had offered new commitments including plans to cut its market share in heavy trucks in Sweden and Norway by 15 percent and by 10 percent in Finland to persuade the Commission to approve the planned 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.92 billion) acquisition from Investor.

"The deadline for new commitments expired a very long time ago. We are not anticipating major developments," said Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull.

"It's conceivable they could refine further what they've already offered, although it's not necessarily the case that this would be acceptable to us," he said, adding that the Commission had received nothing new from Volvo.

An EU source said on Friday the Commission, the EU's anti-trust watchdog, was set to block the deal because of concerns that the new company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.

Under the EU's four-month extended investigations into complex mergers, companies formally have until a month before the deadline to make undertakings, although deadlines have proved flexible in the past.
RULING APPROACHES

The final date for a decision on Volvo's purchase of Scania is March 23 and Faull said it was theoretically too late for new commitments.EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is due to announce his ruling on March 14.

"We assume if commitments are on offer, they would have been made a long time ago. There are very real legal obstacles to our reconsidering at this stage."

Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg told Reuters that the modifications it had proposed were not new but rather changes to the current application which the Commission is analysing.

"The modifications about market shares in Sweden, Norway and Finland which we presented on Friday are within the framework of the old application," Edenborg said.

The success of Volvo's latest effort to save the deal depends on whether the Commission regards its offer as a modification of the existing terms or new concessions.

Faull said that even if the Commission did block the merger, that would not prevent the companies from redrafting the terms of their link-up and renotifying a similar deal at a later stage with different commitments for the Commission to consider.

The Commission's current concerns centre on the fact that last year Volvo and Scania had a combined market share of 93 percent in Sweden, 71 percent in Norway and 67 percent in Finland.

Volvo says the Commission should be looking at the entire EU market, not just the Nordic market, which accounts for only about four percent of the west European heavy truck market and less than 20 percent of Volvo-Scania sales.

There has been speculation that, if the deal collapses, both Volvo, which last year sold its car business to Ford, and Scania could become takeover targets. ($1=8.771 Swedish Crown).

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- AB  Volvo (VOLVY) will hold a news conference Wednesday at which Chief Executive Leif Johansson will outline the company's view of the  European Union Commission's investigation of its planned acquisition of  Scania AB (SCVA).
The press conference will start at 1100 GMT in Stockholm.

Brussels is concerned that combining the two groups would be anti-competitive for the Nordic truck market in particular. On Friday, Volvo said they would impose sales quotas in Sweden, Norway and Finland to reduce their market shares but this offer isn't expected to win over E.U. competition officials.

The final deadline for the Commission to rule on the proposed merger is March 23. Volvo officials weren't immediately available to comment further on the news conference.

European Commission will reject the deal at its regularly scheduled meeting tomorrow.

Volvo late last week offered to cap its market share in the Nordic countries to 75%, but the EC considers that offer too little, too late. The combined company would still inhibit competition in Sweden, Norway and Finland, the people said. "They didn't make serious undertakings," said one person. "Last-minute changes don't correct this fundamental mistake."

A last-minute withdrawal is also possible in the case of Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s planned purchase of French rival Pechiney SA, which the EC also intends to reject, the people said. Alcan, Pechiney and Switzerland's Algroup, which Alcan also wants to buy, were still discussing their options with lawyers and the EC late yesterday.

The EC has been saying for weeks that the Volvo-Scania deal was problematic. Volvo agreed to acquire Scania in August for about seven billion euros ($6.76 billion) in cash and stock.

The personal intervention of Sweden's Prime Minister, Goeran Persson, who was caught off guard by Ford Motor Co.'s purchase of Volvo's automobile division last year, failed to convince the EC's fiercely independent merger task force that the deal could be good for Europe, as well as good for Sweden's two firms.

As a relatively new member of the EU -- it joined the union in 1995 -- Sweden hasn't faced EU approval of many mergers involving two large Swedish companies. Several countries have run afoul of the EC shortly after joining it. "Someone always has to bang their head against the wall first, and for Sweden it looks like it will be Volvo," said one Brussels-based antitrust lawyer who feels Mr. Persson's intervention hurt Volvo.

"They relied too much on political pressure," agreed another person familiar with the EC's thinking. "They thought this would count. It doesn't."

Volvo said the changes it proposed to the EC on Friday were not entirely new, but merely stronger versions of proposed changes offered earlier. Volvo and Scania offered to cut their combined market share by 15 percentage points in Sweden and Norway, and by 10 percentage points in Finland, Volvo said yesterday.

Under EU rules, companies have until one month before the final deadline for the EC to reach a verdict on their merger -- in the Volvo-Scania case until Feb. 22 -- to make significant modifications to terms of a deal. That margin allows regulators to seek comments on the proposed changes -- usually divestitures -- with any parties likely to be affected by the merger.

But in both the Volvo-Scania and AlcanPechiney cases, the companies' concessions came too late and didn't appease regulators who worry that the mergers would create players so dominant in their markets that effective competition would be eliminated or strongly reduced.
"They haven't taken the commission seriously," said one person familiar with the EC's views.

Volvo future on hold as EU faults Scania merger by Christopher Boian

STOCKHOLM, March 7 (AFP) - The future of giant Swedish truckmaker  Volvo was up in the air Tuesday as the firm sought alternatives to a merger with rival  Scania after failing to overcome  EU objections to the plan.

Volvo was expected to withdraw its current merger proposal and submit a new version within the coming days, but experts cautioned the company had little room for maneuver if the deal were to remain attractive to  Volvo shareholders.
"Yes, they will submit a new plan," said Mats Liss, automotive industry analyst with the Swedish commercial bank
Foereningsparbanken.

"But it's going to be difficult for them to go too far since they have a responsibility to their current shareholders," he said.
"If they make large alterations, or radical changes, the deal will look even less attractive for Volvo."
Under the current plan, Volvo would pay 315 Swedish kronor (about 37 euros) per share of Scania, or a total of
63 billion kronor (seven billion euros). The merged entity would dominate the truck and bus market in
Scandinavia.

The European Commission in Brussels has made clear it will reject the plan on grounds it undermines European Union (EU) competition rules, rejecting last-minute concessions from Volvo that sought to diminish those concerns.
A decision was expected to be announced March 14.

Volvo officials at the company's headquarters in the southwest Swedish city of Goeteborg declined to return phone calls as speculation mounted over how Volvo would react to the signals from Brussels.

Analysts said both Volvo and Scania were financially healthy and could continue to operate independently in the short term, but warned both would be more vulnerable to foreign takeover in the likely event their merger failed.
"It would probably be easier to make an acquisition of either of them if they don't merge," Liss said.

Of Europe's top five truckmakers only one or two -- Fiat of Italy and Renault of France -- were likely to be able to meet EU competition criteria for a merger with Volvo or Scania, he said.
Volvo, which sold its car division to US automaker Ford last year, has been courted in the past by Fiat.

Liss said German carmaker Volkswagen could also entry the fray, having the cash and the desire to enter the truck market with such an acquisition.

"You can find companies with market coverage that would complement each other rather than two companies that are strong in the same markets," Liss said.

The deadline for modifying the current merger scheme has passed, but EU officials have said they would welcome a new proposal from Volvo.
Industry analysts however voiced doubt that Volvo would be able to make enough concessions to please
Brussels while managing to keep the deal sweet for stockholders at the same time.
"There's a lot of speculation at the moment" on what Volvo might do, Liss said.
Page 108 of 131 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He and other industry analysts also raised the possibility that Volvo could drop the Scania merger altogether and look farther afield for an acquisition elsewhere in Europe.

But Volvo has shown no sign yet of doing this and "it doesn't seem that Brussels is too happy about mergers at all these days anyway," Liss added.

EU/COMPETITION - SCANIA/VOLVO PUT FORWARD NEW CONCESSIONS TO GAIN COMMISSION APPROVAL.

(c) 2000 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 06/03/2000 (Agence  Europe) - The Swedish heavy goods vehicle manufacturers  Volvo and Scania have proposed to cede 15% of their market share in Sweden and Norway, and 10% in Finland, to answer the European Commission's fears over the effects of the merger on the Scandinavian markets of utility vehicles. This is what a spokesperson for  Volvo and Scania indicated this weekend. The deadline to present new undertakings has passed and the Commission must make a decision next 14 march, increased the pressure by insinuating that it could oppose the proposed merger. However the negotiations continue between the manufacturers and the European competition services. Legally the notification of the project may still be withdrawn and a new merger proposal can be presented.

Representatives from Volvo continue to show optimism, while believing that the Commission should take into account the European market as a whole in which Volvo and Scania hold only 20% and not just the Scandinavian market that the two manufacturers dominate with a 60% share.

Companies: EU Believed Ready to Reject Volvo-Scania, Alcan-Pechiney Deals --- Last-Minute Concessions by Car Maker Considered Too Little, Too Late --- Commission, Unimpressed by Promises, Believes Both Deals Would Stifle Competition

BRUSSELS -- European Union antitrust regulators intend to reject AB  Volvo's planned acquisition of rival Swedish truck maker Scania AB despite last-minute concessions aimed at clinching approval, according to people familiar with the situation.
Unless Volvo withdraws its notification of the deal -- allowed under  EU laws up to the moment of decision -- the
European Commission will reject the deal at its meeting Wednesday.

Volvo late last week offered to cap its market share in the Nordic countries at 75%, but the commission considers that offer as too little, too late. The combined company would still inhibit competition in Sweden, Norway and Finland, according to people familiar with the situation. "They didn't make serious undertakings," said one of these people. "Last-minute changes don't correct this fundamental mistake."

A last-minute withdrawal is also possible in the case of Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s planned purchase of French rival Pechiney SA, which the commission also intends to reject, according to people familiar with the situation. Officials of Alcan, Pechiney and Algroup of Switzerland, which Alcan also wants to acquire, were still discussing their options with lawyers and the commission late Monday.

The commission has been saying for weeks that the Volvo-Scania deal was problematic. The personal intervention of Sweden's prime minister, Goeran Persson, who was caught off-guard by Ford Motor Co.'s purchase of Volvo's automobile division last year, failed to convince the commission's fiercely independent merger task force the deal could be good for Europe as well as good for Sweden's two truck makers.

Sweden, a relatively new member of the EU -- it joined in 1995 -- hasn't faced EU approval of many mergers involving two large Swedish companies. Several countries have run afoul of the commission shortly after joining it. "Someone always has to bang their head against the wall first, and for Sweden it looks like it will be Volvo," said one Brussels-based antitrust lawyer who feels Mr. Persson's intervention hurt Volvo's case.

"They relied too much on political pressure," agreed another person familiar with the commission's thinking. "They thought this would count. It doesn't."

Volvo says the changes it proposed to the commission weren't entirely new, but merely stronger versions of proposed changes offered earlier. Volvo and Scania offered to cut their combined market share by 15 percentage points in Sweden and Norway and by 10 percentage points in Finland, Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg said.

Under EU rules, companies have until one month before the final deadline for the commission to reach a verdict on their merger -- in the Volvo-Scania case, the deadline was Feb. 22 -- to make significant modifications to the terms of their deal. That margin allows regulators to seek comments on the proposed changes -- usually divestitures -- with any parties likely to be affected by the merger.

But in both the Volvo-Scania and Alcan-Pechiney cases, the companies' concessions failed to appease regulators who worry that the mergers would create players so dominant in their markets that effective competition would be eliminated or strongly reduced.
"They haven't taken the commission seriously," says one person familiar with the regulator's views.

Peter Willis, a lawyer specializing in EU competition law for Taylor Joynson Garrett in London, said the commission doesn't like accepting promises from companies about what they will or won't do in the future.

The commission "usually wants to see something changed in the corporate structure" rather than promises of behavioral change, he said. Volvo's offer "is a very odd thing to do and (may suggest) desperation," he said.

Volvo shares closed at at 212 kronor (25.05 euros), down 5.50 kronor, or 2.5%, in Stockholm, while Scania shares closed at 275 kronor, up three kronor, or 1.1%.

STOCKHOLM, March 7 (Reuters) -  Volvo AB said it will hold a news conference in Stockholm on Wednesday at which chief executive Leif Johansson will report on  Volvo's view of the  EU's scrutiny of its proposed merger with Scania .

The European Commission said on Monday it was too late for the Swedish truckmaker to make new offers to address competition problems over its planned acquisition of  Scania.
An EU source said on Friday that the Commission was set to block the deal on antitrust grounds.
Volvo said on Saturday it had offered new commitments including plans to cut its market share in heavy trucks in
Sweden and Norway by 15 percent and by 10 percent in Finland.

The Swedish company, backed by the Swedish government, argues that its near monopoly in Sweden and dominant position in Nordic countries should be seen in a wider European context, in which it has minority market shares.

Volvo said on Tuesday "At the press conference chief executive Leif Johansson will put Volvo's view of the ongoing EU scrutiny of Volvo's acquisition of Scania." ((Tony Austin, Stockholm newsroom, +46-8-700 1003, fax

EU says Volvo free to have another go at Scania buy.

BRUSSELS, March 7 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Tuesday held out an olive branch to Swedish truckmaker Volvo, saying it could have another go at buying  Scania even if the Commission as expected blocks the deal.

"If the deal is prohibited, the companies would have to terminate the (merger) agreement," Commission spokesman Jonathan Faull said.

"But if the same parties came back and proposed the same overall package and offered different commitments, that would amount to restructuring the deal, which in effect is a different deal," he added when asked if the deal would be killed off once and for all if the Commission ruled against it.

Volvo said on Saturday it had offered new commitments to persuade the Commission, the EU's antitrust watchdog, to clear its 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.90 billion) acquisition of Scania from Investor.

But the Commission said on Monday it was too late for Volvo to make new offers to address competition problems, suggesting it would block the deal next Tuesday.

Volvo has called a press conference for 1100 GMT on Wednesday with chief executive Leif Johansson to give its view of the Commission's scrutiny of the case.

The Commission is concerned that the new company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region. Volvo and the Swedish government argue the Commission should look at the truck market in a wider European context.

Brussels-based competition lawyers said they doubted the companies would try again if the Commission as expected said the concessions offered were not enough to meet competition concerns.

There has been speculation that, if the deal collapses, both Volvo, which last year sold its car business to Ford, and Scania could become takeover targets.
"I have the impression that it's over," said a partner at a U.S. law firm in Brussels.

"I can't imagine they'll renotify. If they had any magic solutions, I'm sure they would have put them on the table long since."
Faull said Volvo's latest offer to cut its market share in heavy trucks in Sweden and Norway by 15 percent and by
10 percent in Finland was not the sort of solution to competition problems the Commission usually favoured.

"We always prefer structural solutions to structural problems. Non-structural problems are viewed with considerable reservations because they are not guaranteed to solve the problem. We don't want to have to monitor behavioural undertakings," Faull said. ($1=8.792 Swedish Crown).

Volvo "even ready to shelve Scania name" - paper.

STOCKHOLM, March 7 (Reuters) -  Volvo AB has offered to drop the  Scania brand name for two years on new trucks in Nordic countries in an effort to win  EU approval of its proposed merger, the Gothenburg Post reported on Tuesday.

The paper, which often has an inside track on  Volvo as the auto group is headquartered in Gothenburg, published what it said was a 16-page list of concessions made by  Volvo to the EC Commission.

The concessions, most of which had already been published, were contained in a confidential document signed by Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson on February 21. The document said: * Volvo pledges to lobby the Swedish government for the abolition of impact tests on lorry cabs. Because these tests are more rigorous than in the rest of the EU, foreign manufacturers have to reinforce their cabs. * Volvo pledges to let competitors use its after-sales and service network in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland. The same applies to Scania, with exception of Ireland.

Volvo will not discriminate against any garage that repairs rival trucks and will allow competitors' sales staff to operate from the same offices. * Volvo pledges within half a year to sell by public auction its 37 percent stake in vehicle distributor Bilia . If a competitor buys the stake, Bilia will lose its profitable sales of Volvo buses and trucks. * Volvo pledges to sell Scania's bus plants at Katrineholm in Sweden and at Silkeborg in Denmark and its
own factory at Abenra in Denmark. These factories build bus bodies. * Competitors will be allowed to use Volvo's Carrus bus body plant in Finland for the Finnish market. * Volvo pledges not to use the Scania brand name for two years on new heavy trucks in Sweden, Norway and Finland. * An offer to manage the sale of factories and shares in cooperation with the EC, at Volvo's cost.

Since the February 21 concessions, Volvo has said it offered new commitments including plans to cut its market share in heavy trucks in Sweden and Norway by 15 percent and by 10 percent in Finland.

To late for new Volvo offers claims European Commission

Copyright 2000 M2 Communications, Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
The European Commission has stated that it is too late for Volvo, the Swedish truck manufacturer, to make any new offers regarding its proposed USD6.92bn acquisition of Scania, another Swedish truck maker.

The statement, made on 6 March, has sparked speculation that the  EC may refuse to allow the merger to proceed. A spokesperson for the  EC said that though it wasn't 'anticipating major developments' it was
'conceivable that (Volvo) could refine further what they've already offered, although it's not necessarily the case that this would be acceptable to us.'

Volvo apparently advised on 4 March that it had made an offer of new commitments to alleviate concerns that the merger would create a monopoly in the Nordic region, including plans to reduce its market share in heavy trucks
in Sweden and Norway by 15% and in Finland by 10% according to Reuters. A spokesperson for Volvo said these commitments were not new proposals but alterations to the old application.
The EC is scheduled to rule on the issue by 23 March 2000.

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Swedish commercial vehicle maker AB  Volvo (VOLVY) will let the  European Union Commission block its planned merger with  Scania AB (SCVA), Swedish business daily Dagens Industri reported Wednesday, citing sources close to the matter.

The newspaper said  Volvo considers that it has made as large concessions as are possible from a business perspective.  Volvo is very unlikely to withdraw its application at the last minute in order to submit a modified application later, the paper said. The E.U. is due to make its decision March 14, following an indepth antitrust investigation.

The quoted sources claimed that the deal had been actively opposed by Volvo rivals Fiat SpA (FIA) of Italy, Germany's Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) and Paccar Inc. (PCAR) of the U.S.
Volvo has a called a news conference at 1100 GMT Wednesday and is expected to outline what concessions the
Commission has demanded and what concessions Volvo has agreed to.

The newspaper said the news conference will be Volvo's last lobbying attempt before the Commission makes its decision.
A Volvo spokeswoman said any comments regarding the investigation will be made at the news conference. At 0927 GMT, Volvo shares were down SEK0.50 to SEK210.50, while Scania was off SEK16 to SEK261. Document dji0000020010805dw38018fk

Volvo: No More Concessions On Scania Bid; Await EU Rule

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Swedish automotive group AB  Volvo (VOLVY) said Wednesday that, based on current conditions, it is unlikely that the company will reach an agreement with the  European Union's competition authorities on its planned bid for  Scania AB (SCVA).

In a statement,  Volvo's Chief Executive Leif Johansson said the company isn't planning to submit a new merger application and will await Brussels' verdict on the current merger filing.

"The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another," Jonansson said.

"If the conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application, with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months."

Volvo said is has provided strong reasons as to why the market for heavy trucks and buses should be viewed on a pan-European basis. It said the E.U. Commission contends that each country in the European Union should be viewed as a separate market.

In order to address the combined group's massive market share in the Nordic region, E.U. competition authorities raised a number of proposals for debate that weren't acceptable, Volvo said.

The suggestions included the divestment of Scania's bus operations and the sale of dealerships owned by Volvo and Scania in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland. The Commission also proposed to bar Volvo from using the Scania truck brand name in the Nordic countries and Ireland.

The Commission also suggested that the distribution of all Scania's products in the Nordic region and Ireland be transferred to competitors for seven years

"These are measures that do not stand in any reasonable proportion to the scope of the problem," Johansson said.

"There is a risk that these measures would also destroy Volvo's and Scania's operations outside the countries concerned and, naturally, it is totally out of the question that we would be involved in such actions."


"As a matter of fact, it appears that currently there are no concessions in any respect that could satisfy the demand of the authorities," he continued.
- - 08/03/00 11-37G

On Feb. 21, Volvo had made concessions designed to address the Commission's fears that the merger would create too dominant a player in the Nordic region.

Volvo's proposed concessions included a promise that it and Scania would open its dealer networks to competitors and that the Scania brand name for heavy trucks and buses wouldn't be used for two years in Sweden, Finland and Norway.

Last Friday, Volvo sweetened the pot by offering to impose truck sales quotas in the Nordic region to reduce market share. Combined, Volvo and Scania would have a 90% share of the Swedish heavy truck market.

With no agreement with the E.U. on the horizon, Volvo will now await the Commission's final ruling on the merger, which is to be issued by March 23.

Volvo CEO: If EU Blocks  Scania Bid, All Options  Open

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- AB Volvo (VOLVY) Chief Executive Leif Johansson said Wednesday that all options will be considered if the European Union Commission blocks its proposed takeover of  Scania AB (SCVA).
"In that case all options must be tried," declared Johansson, when asked what strategy  Volvo might take if the
Scania bid fails.

He said both Volvo and Scania can survive as independent players short-term but will need to expand in the longer term. Johansson didn't comment on potential partners.

Johansson said that despite the apparent failure of negotiations with E.U. competition authorities, he still hopes the full Commission will approve the Scania buy.
Johansson was speaking at a news conference in Stockholm.

In the event of a bid for Volvo from a rival group, Volvo's board will review such a bid and weigh it against other options available at the time.

"There are really no bids that the board can view as hostile," said Johansson. "The board will look both what is best for the shareholders and what is industrially sound."
Johansson wouldn't venture into what possible partners there are if the bid for Scania is blocked.

Navistar International Corp. (NAV) and MAN AG (G.MAN) of Germany have been highlighted as possible and suitable takeover targets for Volvo.

Volvo is currently sitting on a large pile of cash after it sold its car division to Ford Motor Corp. (F) in January last year for around SEK50 billion.

EU:Volvo's New Offers Likely Too Late For Consideration

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Wednesday that Swedish truck maker AB Volvo's (VOLVY) latest antitrust concessions are probably too late to be considered, making it increasingly unlikely that  Volvo will win a last minute reprieve in its attempt to buy  Scania AG (SCVA).
"The general rule is that we can't have substantial new undertakings after the deadline (for concessions)," said
Michael Tscherny, E.U. Commission competition spokesman.

Volvo's latest concessions were submitted Tuesday, the spokesman said. The commission is examining the latest offer, but has no time to "market test" the offers with competitors, he said. The official deadline for concessions was two weeks ago.

"At this stage less than one week before the commission's decision it is virtually impossible to change (a decision)," Tscherny said. A final decision on the merger is expected Tuesday.

It also seems very unlikely that E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's fellow commissioners will overrule his expected recommendation that the merger be blocked. Monti only needs a simple majority of the 20 commissioners to support his recommendation. No competition commissioner has ever been overruled by his fellow commissioners in the requisite vote before a merger veto, Tscherny said.

Volvo has offered to open its dealer networks to competitors and not to use the Scania brand name for heavy trucks and buses for two years in Sweden, Finland and Norway.

In addition, Volvo says its latest offer to the E.U. Commission was to impose truck sales quotas in the Nordic region to reduce market share. Combined, Volvo and Scania would have a 90% share of the Swedish heavy truck market.

If the merger is blocked by the commission, Volvo can challenge the decision at the European Court of Justice. However, this procedure can take between three and five years, so isn't very attractive to companies.

Alternatively, Volvo is still able to withdraw its merger notification and resubmit an altered plan. However, it would also have to reverse any changes in the companies which have already been implemented in order to prevent an E.U. Commission ruling on Tuesday, Tscherny said. Further, any new plan would have to be substantially different than the existing one, Tscherny said.

Volvo Vows No More Scania Concessions Ahead Of EU Ruling

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Fed up over an impasse with the  European Union's competition unit, AB Volvo (VOLVY) Chief Executive Leif Johansson said Wednesday that concessions demanded for its takeover of Scania AB (SVCA) are unreasonable.

Volvo said Wednesday it will make no further concessions and instead take its case directly to the Commission, which it hopes will give the issue a "broader and more multi-dimensional" view.

The E.U.'s competition unit is expected to recommend against the merger, but the Commission itself could vote contrary to the recommendation - an outcome Volvo is hoping for but has happened very rarely in the past. And if the merger is blocked, both Volvo and Scania are likely to become takeover targets themselves in the rapidly consolidating global automotive business, analysts said.

Proposals made by the competition authority that were unacceptable for Volvo included the sale of Scania's entire bus operations, and a ban on using the Scania brand name in the Nordic region and Ireland.

The core issue has been the combined truck market shares for Volvo and Scania in the Nordic region, which ranges from 65% in Finland to as high as 90% in Sweden. The Nordic region, however, only constitutes around
6% of the European truck market.
"These measures don't stand in any reasonable proportion to the scope of the problem," Johansson said.

In Volvo's view, it hasn't received any clear indication from the competition unit on the measures needed to approve the deal.

"And it seems like they don't really know that themselves," Johansson stressed, adding that the reason Volvo sees little point in withdrawing the current merger proposal and submitting a modified one later.
"The only way to buy Scania seems to be to sell Scania," he said.


Blocked Deal Makes Volvo Attractive Takeover Target
A negative ruling by the Commission would heighen speculation about future restructuring deals in the industry. Both Fiat SpA (FIA) of Italy and Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) have both expressed an interest in Volvo and, to a
lesser extent, Scania. General Motors Corp. (GM) of the U.S. is also frequently mentioned a possible suitor.
Analysts are convinced that a bid from any of the two for Volvo is quite likely in the case of a "no" from the
Commission.

In the event of a bid for Volvo from a rival, Volvo's board will review such a bid and weigh it against other options available at the time.

"There are really no bids that the board can view as hostile," said Johansson. "The board will look at both what is best for the shareholders and what is industrially sound."
Alternatively, Volvo could target Navistar International Inc. (NAV) of the U.S., MAN AG (G.MAN) of Germany, or
Renault's truck division, RVI/Iveco, for takeover, according to analysts.

In Stockholm Wednesday, Scania's shares were hit by increased speculation that the Commission will turn down the merger. Scania closed at SEK250, down SEK27 or 9.8%. Investors generally feel that no other bidder would be willing to pay as much as Volvo for Scania.
Volvo, on the other hand, saw a more limited loss of SEK2 to SEK209.

According to Kenneth Toll, sector analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm, any bid for Volvo would probably be at SEK280 a share or more.

Volvo currently holds around 45% of Scania. While the E.U. hasn't indicated whether Volvo would need to sell that stake if a full merger is blocked, Volvo's Johansson made it clear that it would probably be divested.


If the merger is blocked by the Commission, Volvo has the option of appealing through the European Court of Justice, a process that could take three to five years. Despite such an unappealing length of time, Johansson indicated that Volvo would consider and appeal.

Wheels May Be Coming Off Volvo Deal To Buy Fellow Truck Maker Scania

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Sweden's AB  Volvo said it and European Union regulators remain far apart regarding the planned purchase of rival truck maker  Scania AB and it doesn't expect to make more concessions to win approval.

Volvo indicated it would take its case directly to  European Commission members, and also hinted that it will sell its stake in  Scania if regulators scuttle the $6.7 billion deal.

It seems unlikely that fellow members will overrule EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's expected recommendation that the merger be blocked. Monti only needs a simple majority of the 20 commissioners to support him. No competition commissioner has ever been overruled by fellow commissioners in the requisite vote before a merger veto, said Michael Tscherny, European Union competition spokesman

Tscherny said Volvo's latest concession offer probably came too late to be considered, making a last-minute reprieve increasingly unlikely.

Volvo promised that it and Scania would open its dealer networks to competitors and that it wouldn't use the Scania brand name for heavy trucks and buses for two years in Sweden, Finland and Norway. The company also offered to cap its market share in the Nordic countries to 75%.

"The general rule is that we can't have substantial new undertakings after the deadline (for concessions)," said Tscherny. The commission is examining the latest concession offer, submitted Tuesday, but has no time to "market test" the offers with competitors, he said. The official deadline for concessions was two weeks ago.

"At this stage less than one week before the commission's decision it is virtually impossible to change (a decision)," Tscherny said. A final decision on the merger is expected March 14.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said his company doesn't plan to submit a new merger application if the current one fails. The vehicle maker also said it would consider bids for Volvo if the EU rejects the merger.

"The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another," said Johansson. "If the conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application, with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months."

Volvo (VOLVY) already owns 20% of Scania (SCVA, SCVB). The EU argues that the two Swedish truck makers combined would have a disproportionately large share of some European markets for heavy trucks and buses. Volvo-Scania would be a powerful player in the world bus-and-truck market, second only to German-American company DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX).
The EU says Volvo and Scania combined would enjoy a 90% share of the Swedish truck market and more than
50% of the larger Scandinavian truck market. Antitrust problems also exist in Britain and Ireland.

EU competition officials made several proposals that weren't acceptable, Volvo said, including divesting Scania's bus operations and selling Volvo and Scania dealerships in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

The commission also proposed blocking Volvo from using the Scania truck brand name in the Nordic countries and Ireland and suggested that distribution of all Scania's products in the Nordic region and Ireland be transferred to competitors for seven years

"There is a risk that these measures would ... destroy Volvo's and Scania's operations outside the countries concerned and, naturally, it is totally out of the question that we would be involved in such actions," said

Johansson said both Volvo and Scania can survive as independent players in the short term but will need to expand over the longer term.
Volvo's board would review any acquisition offers and weigh them against other options available at the time, the
Volvo chief added.

Johansson wouldn't name possible partners for Volvo if the EU blocks its bid for Scania. The Financial Times has speculated that Volkswagen AG may renew its interest in Scania, and noted that Italy's Fiat SpA (FIA) - which approached Volvo with a takeover bid in 1998 - is another possibility. General Motors Corp. (GM) also has been mentioned as a possible suitor.

Volvo is sitting on a large pile of cash after it sold its car division to Ford Motor Corp. (F) last year for around 50 billion kronor ($5.7 billion). Analysts have said Volvo might seek to acquire smaller truck makers, such as
U.S.-based Navistar International Corp. (NAV) or MAN AG of Germany.
