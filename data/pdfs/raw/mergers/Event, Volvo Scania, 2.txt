STOCKHOLM, March 8 (AFP) - Swedish truckmaker  Volvo said on Wednesday that it would not make further concessions over a planned merger with rival  Scania to head off an anticipated veto from the  European Commission.

"In Volvo's opinion, the conditions do not exist for Volvo to reach an agreement with the  EU competition authority regarding approval of the proposed acquisition of Scania," Volvo said in a statement.
"Accordingly, Volvo will await decision by the EU Commission".

The Commission has indicated it will reject Volvo's current proposal for acquiring Scania on the grounds that the new company would dominate Nordic truck and bus markets in violation of EU competition rules.
A formal decision from the Commission was due next Tuesday.
Volvo's announcement that it would offer no more concessions to make the deal more palatable to the
Commission was irrelevant, as the Commission had said March 4 that the deadline for concessions on the current
proposal had expired.

In its statement, Volvo accused Brussels of applying double standards for small and large countries in Europe regarding mergers and acquisitions but left the door open for the Commission to change its course.

"The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another," Volvo chief executive officer Leif Johansson said in the statement.

"If the conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months," he said.

The Commission said on March 4 that, while it would entertain no further concessions from Volvo on the current proposal, it would be open to Volvo withdrawing its plan and submitting a new proposal for acquiring Scania.

Analysts said that failure of the Volvo-Scania merger could leave both companies more vulnerable to foreign takeover.
The Financial Times reported however that Volvo, flush with cash after selling its car division to US automaker
Ford last year, could look farther afield for an acquisition.
The paper said investment bankers believed Volvo could approach US truckmaker Navistar or Germany's MAN
with a purchase offer.

FOCUS - Volvo says no more concessions on Scania.

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - Swedish vehicle maker AB Volvo said on Wednesday it would make no further concessions in an effort to win  European Commission (EC) approval for its merger with  Scania.

"In Volvo's opinion, the conditions do not exist for  Volvo to reach an agreement with the  EU competition authority,"  Volvo said. "Accordingly,  Volvo will await a decision by the  EU Commission," it added in a statement.

By refusing to back down further, Volvo is putting the onus on Brussels to turn down the merger and at the same time raising the political stakes, analysts said.

Hans Westberg, analyst at den Danske Bank, said: "The play here is pressure on the Commission, they want to send a message to the politicians.
"Volvo is saying that if the EC blocks this deal it is probably going to block other truck deals, and that will allow the
North Americans into the market with their strong currency," Westberg said.

An EU source in Brussels has said that the planned takeover in its present form is likely to be stopped on antitrust grounds.

The European Commission will meet on March 14 and is expected to rule on Volvo-Scania. It must pronounce on the deal by March 23.
VOLVO URGES "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL VIEW"

Volvo's statement coincided with a news conference in Stockholm by chief executive Leif Johansson about his dealings with EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti over the planned $6.92 billion fusion.

Noting that the merger had so far been handled by the EC's competition authority, Volvo said: "We welcome that the issue is lifted to Commission level, where the combined expertise of the commissioners can give the issue a broader and more multi-dimensional view."

Volvo has said that its near monopoly in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic countries should be seen in the context of the wider European market, in which it is a minority player.
Its shares were unchanged at 212 crowns in a negative market on Wednesday while Scania shares were down
18 crowns at 259.

Volvo may be able to make capital out of outrage in Sweden if the EC rejects Volvo-Scania. The ruling Social Democratic Party holds a special congress starting Friday to decide on membership of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

"I think the Swedish government and Prime Minister Goran Persson are going to continue lobbying in favour of this deal," Swedbank equities analyst Mats Liss told Reuters.

Johansson's refusal to give away anything more effectively slams the door on the chance of returning with an amended merger plan at a later date and means that, assuming the EC blocks the deal, Volvo may be forced to come up with an alternative strategy.

Germany's Volkswagen, Italy's Fiat and American Paccar-Daf were among those which opposed the deal, according to daily Dagens Industri. These firms have also been mentioned by analysts as possible buyers of Scania and Volvo.
The Financial Times said on Wednesday investment bankers believed Volvo was considering an approach to
U.S. truckmaker Navistar or German company MAN if the Scania deal failed.

Volvo would also emphasise its Asian expansion plans through a tie-up with Mitsubishi Motors truck and bus arm, the FT said.

Volvo says EU plans to veto Scania merger.
By Paul de Bendern

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited
STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - Truck and bus maker Volvo said on Wednesday the  European Commission had indicated that it planned to block its merger with Scania - but Brussels had not said what was required to receive approval.

"It seems the  EU anti-trust authorities will say 'no' (to the merger),"  Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference, adding that Commission officials had indicated this.
"So the only chance we've got is to appeal straight to the Commission members."

The EU's anti-trust watchdog is set to block the deal because of concerns that the new company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region. But Volvo said it planned to make no further concessions in its negotiations with the Commission.

AB Volvo criticised the Commission's handling of the merger saying it had initially been given to believe that it would be a straightforward matter not requiring a full and lengthy investigation by the Commission.

"We got the impression at the start that this would not be a problem and that there would be no in-depth investigation," Volvo communications director Per Lojdqvist told Reuters.

Johansson said that the Commission had not applied the same criteria in reviewing this merger as it had done in previous cases, such as German carmaker DaimlerChrysler's purchase of bus maker Kaessbohrer.

"Since the autumn the European Commission's policies have changed dramatically and this has been done without political decisions," Johansson said.

He said the Commission was looking mainly at the market shares Volvo would have in individual markets, whereas in the past it had judged mergers according to market shares on a pan-European level.

"Even if we come from a small country we see it as obvious that if companies do deals like this it's done on the same condition as rivals like in Germany and we have a problem that this could have changed over the last five months," Johansson said.

He also criticised the antitrust authority for listing recommended measures but failing to indicate what Volvo would need to do for the merger to be approved.

"As we see it the Commission has not given suggestions as to what will be enough to get the deal approved," Johansson said. "If we had been given indications of this then we would obviously have looked into that."

At 1427 GMT Volvo shares were 1.5 crowns higher at 212.5 while Scania was down 21.5 crowns at 255.5 crowns. The broader market was 2.22 percent down.

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - Swedish truck and bus maker
AB Volvo said on Wednesday it rejected  European Commission demands for further concessions in its proposed merger with rival Scania .
Below are Volvo concessions to the merger and proposals the European Commission would like to discuss, according to Volvo. With the aim of reaching an agreement based on the
competition authority's view of national markets, Volvo handed in the following proposed concessions on March 3, an updated version of a February 21 recommendation:
* Volvo opens its service dealer network for competition in
Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.
* Volvo opens its dealer network for competiton in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland and, as a result, provides expanded business opportunities.
* Scania does the same on those markets, except Ireland.
* Scania's bus and coachwork operations in Silkesborg, Denmark and Katrineholm, Sweden be divested.
* Volvo's coachwork operations for buses in Aabenraa, Denmark, be divested.
* Volvo continues to allow competitors access to the coachwork operations in Carrus Oy, Finland.
* Volvo exerts influence on the Swedish government to abolish crash tests for truck cabs.
* Volvo reduces its and Scania's total market shares in Sweden and Norway by 15 percentage points and in Finland by 10

percentage points.
* Volvo reduces its and Scania's total market shares in trucks
and buses in Sweden and Norway by 15 percentage points and in
Finland by 10 percentage points.
* As an alternative to offer of guaranteed level of market
shares, Volvo invited competitors to take over a large number of dealers in Sweden, Norway and Finland, corresponding to a portion of Volvo's and Scania's sales of a maximum of 35 percent of Sweden and 25 percent each in Norway and Finland.
In negotiations with Volvo, the EU's competition authorities presented the following points for discussion:
* Volvo is forced to divest Scania's bus operations.
* Volvo is banned from using the Scania brand for trucks in
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.
* Distribution of all Scania's products in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland to be transferred to competitors for seven years.
* Sale of dealerships owned by Volvo and Scania in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

EU sticks  to its guns over Volvo's  Scania buy.

BRUSSELS, March 8 (Reuters) - The  European Commission repeated on Wednesday it was too late for Swedish truckmaker Volvo to persuade antitrust regulators to clear its proposed purchase of  Scania from Investor .

The Commission is set to block the deal next Tuesday, after finding concessions made by the companies were insufficient to address concerns the merger would give them a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.

Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny said Volvo had submitted new concessions on Tuesday. Although the EU's antitrust watchdog was looking at the offer, it had come two weeks too late under EU rules to be considered, he said.

"There is a deadline for the submission of substantive undertakings and that expired on February 21," Tscherny told reporters.

He was responding to Volvo's announcement earlier on Wednesday that it would make no further concessions to try to win EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's blessing for its 60.7 billion Swedish crown ($6.89 billion) Scania buy.

Apparently hoping Monti would be overruled by his colleagues, Volvo said it hoped that next Tuesday's meeting of the 20-member Commission would "give the issue a broader and more multi-dimensional view".
But Tscherny rejected the idea of the entire Commission overturning Monti's proposals.

"The Commission will look at the draft decision which Mr Monti will table. We apply one set of rules to all cases in a non-discriminatory fashion."

Volvo and the Swedish government argue the company's dominance in the Nordic region should be seen in the context of the wider European market, where it is a minority player.

On Tuesday, the Commission suggested the companies could have another go at merging their activities if they came back with a similar merger agreement but offered different concessions.

But news of Monti's opposition to the deal has led to speculation that Volvo will be forced to come up with an alternative strategy to gain the critical mass needed to compete in the global truck and bus market.

Volvo and Scania have been mentioned as possible takeover targets for several rivals and there has been speculation Volvo might look to other possible partners.
Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said on Wednesday the board would consider any bid it received. Brussels-based competition lawyers have said they doubt Volvo and Scania will try to refile their merger.

LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - HSBC Securities said on Wednesday it upgraded truck and bus maker Volvo to "add" from "reduce," with a price target of 235 crowns, after the company said its planned merger with Scania may be blocked by the  European Commission.

In a note, analysts at the investment bank said the mews was viewed as a positive since it would eliminate the reason for a downgrade last August.
"As a stand alone company, Volvo looks cheap...and is particularly attractive to a bidder, possibly Fiat , MAN or
VW ," the note said.

FOCUS-Volvo,EC on truck collision course.

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - AB  Volvo accused the European Commission on Wednesday of moving the goalposts on mergers and vowed to give no more away in its planned fusion with Swedish truckmaker  Scania AB.

Instead it indicated it was banking on the  European Commission itself rescuing the $6.92 billion deal, which would create the world's second biggest truckmaker.

In Brussels, the EC repeated it was too late for Volvo to persuade antitrust regulators to clear the proposed purchase of Scania from Investor.

"Since the autumn the European Commission's policies have changed dramatically and this has been done without political decisions," Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said.

"It seems the EU anti-trust authorities will say 'no' (to the merger)," Johansson told a news conference, adding that Commission officials had indicated this.
"So the only chance we've got is to appeal straight to the Commission members."

Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny said Volvo had submitted new concessions on Tuesday. Although the EU's antitrust watchdog was looking at the offer, it had come two weeks too late under EU rules to be considered, he said.

The Commission is set to block the deal next Tuesday, after finding concessions made already were insufficient to address concerns the merger would give them a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.
Volvo, backed by Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, claims the Commission should be looking at the whole
EU market, not the small regional Nordic one.
"THEY WANT US TO SELL SCANIA TO BUY IT"

At a news conference in Stockholm Johansson listed all the divestments and market limitations which Volvo had offered, and joked: "The EC wants us to sell off Scania in order to buy it."

Volvo's defiant stance rules out the chance of coming back later with an amended offer for Scania, and could toss both Volvo and Scania into the ring for other predators.

Apparently hoping Competition Commissioner Mario Monti would be overruled by his colleagues, Volvo said it hoped that next Tuesday's meeting of the 20-member Commission would "give the issue a broader and more multi-dimensional view".
But Tscherny rejected the idea of the entire Commission overturning Monti's proposals.

"The Commission will look at the draft decision which Mr Monti will table. We apply one set of rules to all cases in a non-discriminatory fashion," he said.

Johansson said that the Commission had not applied the same perspective in its decisions in the review of this merger as it had done in previous cases like Germany's DaimlerChrysler's purchase of German bus maker Kaessbohrer.
He also complained that the Commission had not made clear what Volvo had to do to win approval.

Volvo shares closed two Swedish crowns lower at 209 while Scania shares were down 27 crowns at 250 in a negative market.
EUROPE A SENSITIVE ISSUE IN SWEDEN
Analysts noted the issue was particularly sensitive ahead of a vote this weekend by Persson's ruling Social
Democrats on whether Sweden should join the single European currency.

Den Danske Bank analyst Hans Westberg said Volvo was putting pressure on the Commission and sending a message to politicians.
"Volvo is saying that if the EU blocks this deal it is probably going to block other truck deals, and that will allow the
North Americans into the market," Westberg said.

Monti's opposition to the deal has led to speculation Volvo will have to come up with an alternative strategy to gain the critical mass to compete on the global truck and bus market, or both Volvo and Scania could become takeover targets.

Germany's Volkswagen, Italy's Fiat and American Paccar-Daf have all been mentioned by analysts as possible buyers of Scania and Volvo.

The Financial Times said earlier investment bankers believed Volvo was considering an approach to U.S. truckmaker Navistar or Germany's MAN if the Scania deal failed.

Volvo would also emphasise its Asian expansion plans through a tie-up with Mitsubishi Motors truck and bus arm, the FT said.
Johansson said on Wednesday the board would consider any bid it received. ($1=8.852 Swedish Crown). (C) Reuters Limited 2000.

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - Swedish truck and busmaker AB Volvo said on Wednesday it rejected demands for any further concessions in its proposed merger with Scania .
"Accordingly,  Volvo will await a decision by the  EU Commission,"  Volvo said in a statement.

Volvo's statement, which coincided with a news conference in Stockholm by chief executive Leif Johansson, made clear that Volvo would not withdraw its Scania takeover bid.

An EU source in Brussels has said that the planned takeover in its present form is likely to be blocked on antitrust grounds.

"In Volvo's opinion, the conditions do not exist for Volvo to reach an agreement with the EU competition authority," Volvo said.

Noting that the merger had so far been handled by the EC's competition authority, Volvo said: "We welcome that the issue is lifted to Commission level, where the combined expertise of the commissioners can give the issue a broader and more multidimensional view."
The European Commission will meet on March 14 and is expected to rule on the Volvo-Scania deal. ((Tony

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Reuters) - Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said on Wednesday that Volvo had alternatives in mind if the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with rival truckmaker Scania .

"If the  European Commission says 'no' which we would do everything to prevent, we would get into a situation where all alternatives would be tried but I cannot go into which ones now," Johansson told a news conference.
"Other deals exist and those can become alternatives," he added.

Johansson was speaking after he announced that Volvo would make no further concessions in its negotiations with the EC over the Scania deal, and would await the outcome of the full Commission's deliberations.

Johansson, asked why Volvo had adopted this approach when the full Commission invariably followed the recommendations of its competition authority, said. "It's a bit like our last chance."

He said there were precedents for the Commission to take into account the competition situation in the EU as a whole rather than in one particular region - Volvo's own point of view. ((Tony Austin, Stockholm newsroom,

Volvo rejects further  demands from EU competition authority
507 words

NORDIC BUSINESS REPORT
NORD

The Swedish truck maker  Volvo has rejected the  EU competition authority's demands for further concessions in exchange for approval of the proposed acquisition of  Scania.

In a recent statement  Volvo said that it had provided strong reasons to the  EU's competition authority to view the market for heavy trucks and buses as pan-European, but that the competition authority in  Volvo's case contended that each  EU country should be seen as a separate market.

Referring to the competition authority's previous decisions to allow the merger of the bus operations of the French maker RVI and Italy's Iveco and the acquisition of the German bus maker Kassboher by Daimler, Volvo said that the competition authority had applied a different perspective than in the case of Volvo's acquisition of Scania.

"Volvo considers that prior decisions by the EU Commission must be prejudicial, particularly since the development in recent years has been toward further liberalisation and internationalisation. In Volvo's opinion, it is unacceptable that certain manufacturers from large countries are covered by one interpretation of the EU competition rules, while certain manufacturers in small countries are covered by another," Volvo said in its statement.

Volvo has already agreed to open its dealer and service networks for competition in the Nordic area and in Ireland and to open Scania's networks in the Nordic area. It has also agreed to divest several coachwork operations in Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Volvo has also undertaken to reduce the market shares of Volvo and Scania in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

In addition to these measures the EU competition authority has also suggested that Volvo should divest the bus operations of Scania, sell dealerships owned by Volvo and Scania in the Nordic area and in Ireland, to transfer all Nordic and Irish distribution of Scania products to competitors for a period of seven years and to cease using the Scania brand for trucks in the Nordic area and Ireland.

According to Volvo CEO Leif Johansson, the additional measures suggested by the EU competition authority are unreasonable.

"There is a risk that these measures would also destroy Volvo's and Scania's operations outside the countries concerned and, naturally, it is totally out of the question that we would be involved in such actions. As a matter of fact, it appears that currently there are no concessions in any respect that could satisfy the demands of the authorities," Johansson said.

"The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another. If the conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application, with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months," Johansson said.

Volvo's proposed acquisition of Scania is now to be handled by the EU Commission. The decision to lift the issue to Commission level has been welcomed by Volvo.

STOCKHOLM - The future of giant Swedish truckmaker  Volvo was up in the air yesterday as the firm sought alternatives to a merger with rival  Scania after failing to overcome  EU objections to the plan.  Volvo was expected to withdraw its current merger proposal and submit a new version within the coming days, but experts cautioned the company had little room for manoeuvre if the deal were to remain attractive to  Volvo shareholders. Volvo said its chief executive, Leif Johansson, would hold a news conference today. Under the current plan, Volvo would
pay 315 Swedish kronor ($52.25) per share of  Scania, or a total of 63 billion kronor. The merged entity would dominate the truck and bus market in Scandinavia.

EU Toughens  Its Antitrust Stance On Deals in Bid to Protect Markets

BRUSSELS -- As  Europe's merger wave rolls on,  European Union antitrust regulators are looking more like a breakwater for some deals.

Last September, they blocked the creation of what they called a potentially dangerous oligopoly in the British leisure travel market. Next week, they look prepared to veto or substantially scale back deals involving aluminum giants Alcan Aluminium Ltd. and Pechiney SA and truck makers AB  Volvo and Scania AB.

Three vetoes in seven months would be quite a streak for the European Commission, which has only blocked a dozen mergers or acquisitions outright since its current merger regulations took effect in 1990. But they represent just the beginning of a more aggressive stance by regulators to protect competitive markets.

Largely unnoticed by industry, a series of recent developments, including the growing size of some deals and a key decision by the European Court of Justice, have emboldened the commission to widen its definition of problem deals. In the past, its vetoes generally involved companies in a monopoly or duopoly situation. But the travel, aluminum and truck deals each involve sectors or regions where a further concentration could create a situation of "collective dominance" by a handful of players -- an oligopoly.

At the same time, a new regime at the commission's powerful antitrust department, led by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, has led to an increasing reliance on economic evaluation of mergers as opposed to an evaluation on strictly legal grounds.

"It's obvious that the new commission is running competition law much differently than it did before," said Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson after conceding an apparent defeat in his attempt to persuade the commission to approve Volvo's purchase of rival Scania.

Alcan and Pechiney were also scrambling to salvage their deal, which was intended to be part of a larger, three-way merger involving Algroup of Switzerland. The commission will render an official verdict on the aluminum and truck deals at its meeting next Tuesday.

The case that turned the tide was the commission's 1996 decision to prohibit a merger between Gencor Ltd. of South Africa and Lonrho PLC of the United Kingdom, two companies in the closely contested platinum business. The two companies already had close links, but the merger would have given Gencor even greater influence over Lonrho and had an immediate, substantial and foreseeable effect in the EU market for platinum, the commission argued.

The companies contested the commission's judgment, but the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice handed the commission a clear victory.

According to the commission's working definition, collective or oligopolistic dominance arises in markets where competition is muted to such an extent that the market outcome could be the same as if there was a single dominant firm. The biggest danger in such cases is always outright collusion between companies. But one person familiar with the commission's thinking says a certain amount of coordination is implicit in any market with only a handful of major players -- "there is always a certain reduction in competition," he says.



Page 23 of 133 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Around half of all cases that the commission subjects to an in-depth, five-month investigation now involve questions of collective dominance. The Gencor-Lonrho decision will strengthen this trend, commission officials and private lawyers say.

That could spell trouble for companies in sectors where substantial consolidation has already taken place. "If companies can't join forces to confront the forces of globalization, this could be a problem for the competitiveness of European industry," warned Marc Greven, director of regulatory affairs for ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Volvo wasn't the first company to misread the trend. Airtours PLC is currently challenging the commission's decision to block its hostile bid for rival First Choice Holidays PLC. That case was the first in which the commission examined the potential creation of an oligopoly of three companies rather than just two.

In the case of Volvo and Scania, the commission says the merged companies could dominate the market for heavy trucks in the Nordic countries and create a virtual duopoly with DaimlerChrysler AG in several other markets.

EU/COMPETITION.

WHILE REVIEW OF THE  VOLVO/SCANIA MERGER HAS ALMOST BECOME AN AFFAIR OF STATE IN SWEDEN,  VOLVO ACCUSES THE COMMISSION OF PARTIALITY.

Brussels / Stockholm, 08/03/2000 (Agence Europe) - The Swedish truck manufacturer  Volvo is accusing the European Commission of applying European competition rules in a discriminatory way. In a lengthy statement published on Wednesday,  Volvo observes that the Commission will have used a double standard if it bans next Wednesday the merger between the Swedish manufacturers  Volvo and Scania, as it has threatened to do. At a time when Sweden is debating joining the euro area, the case has practically become an affair of state in Sweden and contacts between the Commission and Swedish authorities are continuing. The Commission has announced
a decision for 14 March but in fact it has until 23 March to do so.

In its statement, Volvo points out that with prior decisions the European Executive authorised the merger between Renault Vehicules Industriels and Italy's Iveco for the construction of buses, as well as the acquisition of Kaessboher by Daimler in Germany. For the Swedish firm, "it is unacceptable that certain manufacturers from large countries are covered by one interpretation of EU competition rules, while certain manufacturers in small countries are covered by another". Volvo notes in particular that the Commission cannot examine the effects of
the merger on the Scandinavian market alone (rather than taking account of the European market as a whole) when the industrial vehicle industry is "highly internationalised and competitive with professional customers who operate transnationally".

The Swedish manufacturer recalls the undertakings it has made to the Commission, including: opening of its dealer service network to competition in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland; pull-out from factories in Sweden and Denmark; and non-use of the Scania brand for two years in Norway, Finland and Denmark.
For its part, the Commission is alleged to have asked the group to:

i) divest itself of Scania's bus activities, ii) no longer use the Scania brand on the truck markets in Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland, iii) transfer to competitors for 7 years the Scania product distribution activities in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland, iv) sell the Volvo and Scania dealerships in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

According to Volvo, these conditions are commercially unacceptable and endanger the purpose of the operation. "If conditions for approval are not considerably improved, there is no reason to submit a new notification, with the risk of an uncertain outcome after another five months", declared Volvo Chairman Leif Johansson. Volvo is therefore hinting that it could drop plans for the takeover of Scania and turn to the American Navistar or the German Man, reports the Financial Times.

SWEDISH car group  Volvo has accused European Union competition authorities of moving the goalposts on mergers.
And it vowed to give no more away in its planned link-up with rival Swedish truckmaker  Scania. Instead, it said it was banking on the European Commission to rescue the GBP 4.3 billion deal.
Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson said: "Since the autumn the EC's policies have changed dramatically and this has been done without political decisions.

"It seems the EU anti-trust authorities will say 'no' to the merger so the only chance we've got is to appeal straight to the Commission members."
Volvo's defiant stance has raised the political stakes in its stand-off with EC Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti.

It courts the real possibility of a veto from the Commission next Tuesday, which could toss both Volvo and its takeover target Scania into the ring for other predators.
By refusing to withdraw from the merger in its present form, Volvo is appealing over Monti's head to the full
Commission which is expected to rule on March 14.

Truck and bus-maker Volvo will make no further concessions in its application for  EU approval of its merger with
Scania.

Volvo said yesterday that it will await the decision of the  EU Competition Commission later this month.
The company said that it no longer believes the conditions exist for it to reach a negotiated agreement with the
EU competition authority.

The company said that it has provided the EU with strong reasons why the European heavy truck and bus market should be viewed as one.
In previous decisions, including the merger of France's RVI and Italy's Iveco, as well as the acquisition by
Germany's Daimler of Kassboher, the commission had taken that view.

Volvo said: 'But the competition authority has not applied the same perspective in the review of Volvo's acquisition of Scania.
'Volvo's understanding of Europe as a single market has not been accepted by the EU's competition authority. In
Volvo's case, the authority contends that each country in the EU should be viewed as a separate market.'

Volvo says, if the EU's conditions for approval of the merger are not improved significantly, it will not consider making a fresh application.

Leif Johansson, chief executive officer of Volvo, said: 'If conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application, with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months.'
Mr Johansson said that the company would instead look forward to the matter being taken out of the EU
competition authorities hands, and put before the EU Commission.

In Brussels, a spokesman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said Mr Monti was ready to submit a decision on the merger to the other 19 commissioners when they hold their weekly meeting next Tuesday.

European Antitrust Watchdogs Bark -- and Bite More Deals --- Regulators Are Unleashing Stricter
Standards

BRUSSELS -- As the Continent's merger wave rolls on, the  European Union antitrust regulator is looking increasingly like a breakwater for some deals.

Last September it blocked the creation of what it called a potentially dangerous oligopoly in the U.K. leisure-travel market. Next week it looks prepared to veto or substantially scale back deals involving aluminum giants Alcan Aluminium Ltd. and Pechiney SA and truck makers AB  Volvo and Scania AB.
The European Commission has blocked only a dozen mergers or acquisitions outright since the current
incarnation of its Merger Regulation came into force in 1990. But next week's possible vetoes shouldn't come as a
surprise -- and probably won't be the last.

Largely unnoticed by industry, a series of recent developments -- including the growing size of some deals and a precedent-setting decision by the Court of Justice -- have emboldened the commission to expand its definition of deals that deserve to be blocked. Most blocked mergers thus far have involved companies in a monopolistic or duopolistic situation. But the U.K. tour operator, aluminum and truck deals each involve sectors or regions where a further concentration could create an oligopoly -- a situation of collective dominance by a handful of players. Such a concentration of power raises the danger that companies will collude to raise prices and restrict competition.

At the same time, a new regime at the commission's powerful antitrust department -- led by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, the first professional economist to hold the job -- has resulted in mergers increasingly being evaluated on economic grounds, rather than strictly legal ones.

The change has come as a shock to some companies. "It's obvious that the new commission is running competition law much differently than it did before," Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson told analysts in a telephone conference call on Tuesday after conceding an initial defeat in his attempt to convince the commission to approve Volvo's purchase of rival Scania. Volvo is still trying to persuade the commission to change its opinion.

Alcan and Pechiney were also scrambling to salvage their deal, which was intended to be part of a larger, three-way merger involving Algroup of Switzerland. The commission will render an official verdict on the aluminum and truck deals at its meeting next Tuesday.

Some observers say the commission has been signaling a lane change for years, with Volvo & Co. asleep at the wheel in oncoming traffic.

"There has been a trend over the last three to five years to move away from a formalistic analysis and examine what's really meant by restriction of competition," says Alec Burnside, an EU antitrust lawyer with Linklaters & Alliance in Brussels. "It's economics against law. It's form against substance."

The case that turned the tide was the commission's 1996 decision to prohibit a merger between Gencor Ltd. of South Africa and Lonrho PLC of the U.K., two companies in the closely contested platinum business. The two companies already had close links, but the merger would have had an immediate, substantial and foreseeable effect in the EU market for platinum, the commission argued. The Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice agreed with the commission that the merger would create a platinum giant with the ability to effectively dictate prices to customers.

Page 28 of 133 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The companies contested the commission's judgement, but the court last year handed the commission a clear victory.

In another decision, the court had told the commission that it was not limited to prohibiting deals involving clear "structural" links between companies, but could also act when it had reason to believe a deal would create "collective dominance" of a market by a handful of players.

Around half of all cases that the commission subjects to an in-depth, five-month investigation now involve questions of collective dominance. The Gencor-Lonrho decision will strengthen this trend, commission officials and private lawyers say.

"Legal uncertainty (during the Court's handling of the Gencor-Lonrho case) put a certain constraint on us," said one person familiar with current thinking in the commission's merger task force. "We may be more courageous in the future."

That could spell trouble for companies in sectors where substantial consolidation has already taken place. "If companies can't join forces to confront the forces of globalization, this could be a problem for the competitiveness of European industry," warned Marc Greven, director of regulatory affairs for ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Volvo wasn't the first company to misread the change in roadsigns. Airtours PLC is currently challenging the commission's decision to block its hostile acquisition of rival U.K. leisure-tour operator First Choice Holidays PLC.

The U.K. tour operator case was the first in which the commission examined the potential creation of an oligopoly of three companies. Previous cases had involved two companies.

The decision came on Mr. Monti's first day on the job as competition commissioner. At the time, he said it was "not unlikely that we face more and more" cases of "collective dominance," as opposed to individual monopolies or cartels.

According to the commission's working definition, collective or oligopolistic dominance arises in markets where competition is muted to such an extent that the market outcome could be the same as if you had a single dominant firm.

The biggest danger in cases of oligopoly is always outright collusion between companies. But one person familiar with the commission's current thinking says a certain amount of coordination is implicit in any market with only a handful of major players. "There is always a certain reduction in competition," he says.
In the case of Volvo and Scania, the commission says the merged companies could dominate the market for
heavy trucks in the Nordic countries -- Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway -- and create a virtual duopoly with
DaimlerChrysler AG in many others.

In both the cases before the commission next week -- trucks and aluminum -- antitrust regulators parsed companies' activities into a series of sectoral and regional markets, not one, all-encompassing market. Using those narrower definitions, the deals pose problems that the companies concerned have refused to address, it says.

Companies: Volvo-Scania Deal Appears Doomed --- Latest Concession May Be Too Late to Placate
European Commission --- Johansson Mulls Other Options  Including Appeal

Sweden's AB  Volvo, hoping to create  Europe's largest truck maker through a takeover of  Scania AB, has acknowleded the deal now appears doomed by regulatory concerns and is debating its next move, possibly an appeal or another merger.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said the company couldn't make any further concessions that would ease the European Commission's worries about the new company's dominant role in Scandinavia, and he accused competition authorities of changing the rules under which the  European takeover game is played in midstream.

"Its almost insolvable," Mr. Johansson said of the impasse with the regulatory authorities. "We don't know of any remedy we could put in that would make this acceptable to the commission." He was speaking on a telephone conference call with industry analysts and journalists.

Failure of the deal throws the European truck market wide open. Although regulatory worries may give other truck makers reason for pause, companies such as Volkswagen AG and MAN AG may now be interested in joining forces with Scania. And DaimlerChrysler AG may no longer face a threat to its position as the dominant player in the European commercial-vehicle market.
Volvo announced last August its intention to take over Scania, a union of the world's No. 2 and No. 3 truck
makers to create the largest in Europe. Mr. Johansson said he was originally confident of winning approval for the
deal, but the new commission that took office in September held a different view of competition law, looking at the
possible impact of mergers on national markets rather than Europe as a whole. Volvo and Scania together would
dominate the Scandinavian truck market.

Offers to remedy such concerns, including opening up the distribution network to other truck makers and offers to cap the Nordic market share of the combined entity, however, failed to impress the commission.

The European Commission will meet on Tuesday and is expected to rule on the proposed merger. It must pronounce on the deal by March 23 at the latest.

Michael Tscherny, the commission's competition spokesman added to the gloom, saying that Volvo's latest concession, submitted Tuesday, had come too late. "At this stage less than one week before the commission's decision, it is virtually impossible to change" a decision, he said.

Assuming the merger is blocked, Volvo now faces several questions: does it appeal, does it look for another company to take over, or does it consider a sellout?

The Volvo chief said he was reluctant to drag merger proceedings out any further because the uncertainty was hurting employee moral. But he left open the possibility that a "no" ruling would be appealed. "We would weigh an appeal to the European Court of Justice," Mr. Johansson said. But such a process could take years.

A merger with another truck maker, maybe one based in the U.S., would be another option. "We would take any serious proposal and look at it in the best interest of our shareholders," Mr. Johansson said. He declined to comment on potential partners.

The same goes for a possible Volvo takeover of another company. Mr. Johansson said that, given the right circumstances, the company would pursue another truck maker, but he stressed he wasn't under any time pressure and that Volvo already had a good range of products in the North American market.

He left open the possibility that Volvo would retain its stake in Scania. "We wouldn't exclude holding on to the Scania shares, but we would have to have some other logic other than just holding on to them," Mr. Johansson said. He also said Volvo hadn't provided Scania with any strategically important information that could be used against it if the pair part company.

The prospect of a regulatory rejection of a Volvo-Scania deal would be an ironic twist to what had been tortured talks between the two companies last summer. Months of negotiations were punctuated by bickering and
name-calling that sent shock waves through the normally placid Swedish business community. It also comes as a blow to the Swedish government, which had sought a "Swedish solution" for the two companies and wanted to avoid having both fall into foreign hands.

0920 GMT - Swedish shares bounce back early on Thursday on tech gains after Wednesday's dramatic four percent drop on investor sell-off in telecoms and technology. * All-share general index    up 1.64 percent at 6,664.51, OMX 30-share index   gaining 1.53 percent to 1,503.50, in strong turnover of 3.34 billion crowns. * Market heavyweight Ericsson , which fell around five percent on
Wednesday, was up eight crowns at 878. Finnish rival Nokia , which also suffered on
Wednesday, rose 10 crowns to 1,875 crowns. * Drugs groups again in favour after a long period of sharp falls as investors switch portfolios. AstraZeneca up 10.5 crowns at 324 and Pharmacia & Upjohn gaining eight crowns to 454. * Truck stocks in
focus after
Volvo dramatic decision on Wednesday not to give further concessions to the
European Commission to win approval of merger with rival Scania .


This is most likely to mean Volvo won't be able to merge with Scania, opening up the field again for mergers and hostile takeovers in the sector again.

Volvo up seven crowns at 216 while Scania - after several days of falls - gains two crowns to 252 crowns. * Financial services and insurance group Skandia - expanding fast in the lucrative U.S. funds market - jumps 17 crowns to 455. * Internet consultancy Framfab gains 23.5 crowns to 286.5 and Icon Medialab rising 11 crowns to
251 as the sector is expectd to see further consolidation.

Volvo rejects demands for more extensive  concessions, will await decision by the EU Commission
1,174 words
9 March 2000

In Volvo's opinion, the conditions do not exist for Volvo to reach an agreement with the  EU competition authority regarding approval of the proposed acquisition of Scania. Accordingly,  Volvo will await decision by the  EU Commission.

Volvo has provided strong reasons to the EU's competition authority regarding why the market for heavy trucks and buses should be viewed as pan-European. The industry is highly internationalized and competitive, with professional customers who operate transnationally. National laws have been successively harmonized and national restrictions for road transports have been eliminated.

This transformation of the conditions for commercial transports has occurred in a short time and was accelerated through by the formation of the EU's common market.

In prior decisions related to the industry, the EU Commission has taken this development into account. Among other decisions, the merger of French RVI and Italian Iveco's bus operations and German Daimler's acquisition of the German bus manufacturer Kssboher were approved by the Commission a few years ago.
However, the competition authority has not applied the same perspective in the review of Volvo's acquisition of
Scania.

Accordingly, Volvo's understanding of Europe as a single market has not been accepted by the EU's competition authority. In Volvo's case, the authority contends that each country in the EU should be viewed as a separate market.
Volvo considers that prior decisions by the EU Commission must be prejudicial, particularly since the
development in recent years has been toward further liberalization and internationalization. In Volvo's opinion, it is
unacceptable that certain manufacturers from large countries are covered by one interpretation of the EU
competition rules, while certain manufacturers in small countries are covered by another.

During the ongoing review, both Volvo and the EU's competition authority have carried out surveys of the customers' views on the proposed acquisition. A majority of customers favor Volvo's acquisition of Scania. The customers consider that the competition situation in Europe does not mean that Volvo can utilize its position on individual markets to affect prices and instead see advantages in the form of better products at lower prices.

With the aim of reaching an agreement based on the competition authority's view of national markets, Volvo agreed on February 21 to extensive concessions that would contribute to further stimulating competition in the Nordic markets. These concessions are:
* that Volvo opens its service dealer network for competition in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Ireland.

* that Volvo opens its dealer network for competitors in Sweden, Finland, Norway Denmark and Ireland and, as a result, provide dealers expanded business opportunities.
* that Scania does the same on those markets, except Ireland.
* that Volvo divests its 37% holding in Bilia AB.
* that Scania's bus and coachwork operations in Silkesborg, Denmark and Katrineholm, Sweden be divested.
* that Volvo's coachwork operations for buses in Aabenraa, Denmark be divested.

Page 33 of 133 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
* that Volvo continues to allow competitors access to the coachwork operations in Carrus Oy, Finland.
* that Volvo exerts influence on the Swedish government to abolish crash tests for truck cabs.

* that the Scania brand for heavy trucks and buses not be used for two years in Sweden, Finland and Norway, and that Scania's products are sold under another brand name on those markets.

Volvo has been a strong opponent of the concession regarding banning the use of the Scania brand in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

Fundamentally, Volvo's view is that this measure is industrially and commercially destructive. However, for the purpose of facilitating an agreement with the competition authority, Volvo decided, with great hesitation, to accept this concession.

After discussions with the competition authority, Volvo supplemented the above measures on March 3 with a formal guarantee of reduced market shares in the Nordic region. Volvo undertook to reduce Volvo's and Scania's total market shares in Sweden and Norway by 15 percentage points and in Finland by 10 percentage points. The corresponding guarantee was also provided for the bus operations.

At the same time, Volvo withdrew its earlier concession of not being able to use the Scania brand in Sweden, Norway and Finland and the concession regarding sale of Volvo's holding in Bilia.

As an alternative to the offer of guaranteed level of market shares, Volvo offered competitors to take over a large number of dealers in Sweden, Norway and Finland, corresponding to a portion of Volvo's and Scania's sales of a maximum of 35% in Sweden and 25% each in Norway and Finland.

"The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another. If the conditions for an approval are not improved significantly, it is meaningless to submit a new application, with the risk of awaiting a highly uncertain outcome for another five months," says Volvo's CEO Leif Johansson.
In negotiations with Volvo, the EU's competition authorities presented the following points for discussion:
* Volvo is forced to divest Scania's bus operations
* Volvo is banned from distributing Scania products in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

* Distribution of all Scania's products in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland to be transferred to competitors for seven years.
* Sale of dealerships owned by Volvo and Scania in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Ireland.

"These are measures that do not stand in any reasonable proportion to the scope of the problem. There is a risk that this measures would also destroy Volvo's and Scania's operations outside the countries concerned and, naturally, it is totally out of the question that we would be involved in such actions. As a matter of fact, it appears that currently there are no concessions in any respect that could satisfy the demands of the authorities," says Leif Johansson.

"Our aim has been to create a globally competitive company, with the possibility to strengthen Volvo's and Scania's positions on the world's largest markets in order to face competition from the strongest players in North America and Japan. The competition authority has perceived our combined market shares in the Nordic region as a complication from a competitive viewpoint, and we have demonstrated our goodwill through accepting extensive concessions.
However, to date we have gained very little understanding for our arguments, which we feel is regrettable," says
Leif Johansson.

"To date, Volvo's acquisition of Scania has been handled by the EU's competition authority. We welcome that the issue is lifted to Commission level, where the combined expertise of the commissioners can give the issue a broader and more multidimensional view. It is our hope that the Commission arrives at a decision that complies with the intentions of the deregulated common market," concludes Leif Johansson.

Volvo has further criticized the European Commission for failing to indicate what actions  Volvo needs to take for its proposed merger with Scania to be approved.

Volvo, the Swedish truck and bus manufacturer, indicated yesterday (8 March) that it expected the  EC to block the merger for anti-trust reasons and has complained about the way the  EC has handled the proposal.  Volvo claims that the company had initially been led to believe that the investigation into the merger would be straightforward and would not be a lengthy process.

Volvo said yesterday that it would not be offering any further concessions to obtain approval for the merger and indicated that it would appeal 'straight to the Commission members' if approval was rejected according to Reuters.

The world's second-largest maker of heavy trucks,Volvo A.B., may scrap its $6 billion bid for a Swedish rival, Scania A.B., after failing to agree with the European Commission on terms for the takeover. ''The negotiations between Volvo and the competition authorities show that we stand far from one another,'' Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, said. The company said it planned no further concessions before the European Union's
executive agency made a decision on the merger next Tuesday.  European regulators have been reviewing the purchase since October.

STOCKHOLM -  Volvo AB yesterday launched an unprecedented public attack on the  European Union's competition authority over its plans to block the $6.8-billion (US) merger with  Scania AB, its Swedish heavy truck rival.
It said its only hope now lay with the 20 individual commissioners who are due to decide on Tuesday.

The competition authority is planning to veto the deal, largely because of Volvo's dominant position in the Nordic truck market.

Volvo said the commission is wrong to consider national markets as the relevant yardstick, when the truck industry is so global. It argues competition commissioner Mario Monti's predecessor took the pan-European market into account, allowing deals where there were high market shares in individual markets and regions.

Volvo hardens its stance on bid for rival Scania.

Truck maker at impasse with  EU competition body
Mark Milner Deputy Financial Editor
Volvo raised the stakes in its battle with the European commission over its bid for fellow Swedish truck maker
Scania yesterday when it ruled out making further concessions to have the deal approved.

Chief executive Leif Johansson also warned that his board would look at any bids made for the bus and truck maker if the Scania deal were blocked.
`The conditions do not exist for Volvo to reach agreement with the EU competition authority,' he said.
`If a bid is proposed [subsequently] the board will look at it and consider what is best for shareholders.'

Although the decision to rule out further concessions is academic in the short run because the deadline for modify ing the merger terms has already passed, Volvo's move will increase the political pressure on both competition commissioner Mario Monti and the Swedish government.

This weekend prime minister Goran Persson's social democratic party meets to discuss the timing of Sweden's accession into the single currency. But campaigning on the issue will be hindered if, as looks increasingly likely, the EC blocks the merger of the two Swedish truck makers, particularly if one or even both is then taken over by a foreign automotive maker.

`It is bound to have an impact if the Swedish public sees what it does not consider a fair deal. Euroscepticism has always been quite high and [a decision to block the bid] would definitely make that a little bit worse,' according to Gustav Wessberg, deputy director general of the confederation of Swedish industry.
`The play here is pressure on the commission; they want to send a message to the politicians,' said Hans
Westberg, an analyst at den Danske Bank.

The EC is concerned that the merger would give the Volvo-Scania combination 90% of the Swedish truck market and around two-thirds of the markets in the Nordic area.

But the Swedish truck makers argue that the commission should look across the whole single market, rather than looking at one region in isolation. Volvo-Scania's share of the western European market would be around 30%.

`We are not doing this [merger] to strengthen our position in the Nordic countries - this is a global issue,' a spokesman said.

DEFIANT VOLVO PUTS FOOT DOWN IN MERGER ROW.

(c) 2000
SWEDISH car group  Volvo has accused European Union competition authorities of moving the goalposts on mergers.
And it vowed to give no more away in its planned link-up with rival Swedish truckmaker  Scania. Instead, it said it was banking on the European Commission to rescue the #4.3 billion deal.
Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson said: "Since the autumn the EC's policies have changed dramatically and this has been done without political decisions.

"It seems the EU anti-trust authorities will say 'no' to the merger so the only chance we've got is to appeal straight to the Commission members."
Volvo's defiant stance has raised the political stakes in its stand-off with EC Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti.

It courts the real possibility of a veto from the Commission next Tuesday, which could toss both Volvo and its takeover target Scania into the ring for other predators.
By refusing to withdraw from the merger in its present form, Volvo is appealing over Monti's head to the full
Commission which is expected to rule on March 14.
An industry analyst said Volvo's stance looked desperate. Document sc00000020010816dw390124u

VOLVO could soon find itself a takeover target after its failure to agree terms with the European Commission over its proposed $6.9 billion ( #4.4 billion) takeover of  Scania, the rival Swedish truck maker. Volvo yesterday accused the EU's competition authority of changing the rules. The Swedish company has been unable to concede enough ground to satisfy the Commission, which is demanding that  Volvo sell Scania's bus operation.

EU stand puts Volvo, Scania deal in doubt.
By Tony Austin.

STOCKHOLM: Swedish vehicle maker AB  Volvo will report on Wednesday on its stand-off with Brussels over its proposed merger with rival  Scania, and analysts were uncertain whether or not it would pull out.

An EU source has said the European Commission is set to reject the plan in its current form on antitrust grounds, but analysts said on Wednesday that Swedish politicians would continue to lobby in favour of the all-Swedish
deal.

The financial daily Dagens Industri said Volvo felt it had made all commercially sensible concessions and would now put the onus on the European Commission to veto the deal.
If that happened, Volvo could switch to a different strategy of deeper cooperation with other manufacturers, daily
Svenska Dagbladet added.

Volvo will hold a news conference at 1100 GMT in Stockholm at which Chief Executive Leif Johansson will report on Volvo's negotiations with EC Competition Commissioner Mario Monti about the planned $6.92 billion fusion.
Swedish analysts and commentators were divided over what Johansson was likely to say.

"My own feeling is that Volvo is still optimistic, and they may withdraw the present proposal and come back with an amended one later," Mats Liss, equities analyst at bank Swedbank, told Reuters.

Volvo shares were 0.5 crowns lower at 210.5, while Scania shares were down 15 crowns at 262 in a negative early market.

He and another analyst, who asked not to be named, said Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson was likely to lobby until the last minute in favour of the merger.

"It could go either way," said the second analyst. "If the EC stops the deal, Volvo will be badly hurt and could be vulnerable to takeover."

According to financial daily Dagens Industri's unquoted sources, Volvo believes it has already given all reasonable concessions and anything more would not be commercially viable.

One of the reported concessions, to drop the Scania brand name on new truck sales in Nordic countries for two years, could even rebound against Volvo, the Gothenburg Post said, quoting a distributor as saying he would sue Volvo if that happened.

Volvo says its near monopoly in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic countries should be seen in a wider European context, in which it has minority market shares.

A Dagens Industri source said Germany's Volkswagen, Italy's Fiat and American Paccar-Daf were among those which opposed the deal. These firms have also been mentioned by analysts as possible buyers of Scania and Volvo.
The Commission is expected to announce its verdict after a meeting on March 14, and must make a ruling by
March 23.

If Volvo sticks to its guns and the EC blocks the deal, it cannot reapply to Brussels with a new Scania merger proposal. The only chance Volvo has of merging with Scania is to withdraw the proposal and come back with an amended one later.
The Financial Times said investment bankers believed Volvo was considering an approach to US truckmaker
Navistar or German company MAN if the Scania deal failed.

Volvo would also emphasise its Asian expansion plans through a tie-up with Mitsubishi Motors truck and bus arm, the FT said. (Reuters).

Swedish Social Democratic  European parliamentarians tried to make the  Volvo/Scania merger a political issue rather than a competition problem. The move may have damaged  Volvo's (VOLVY) chances for a green light from the commission even more, reports Dagens Nyheter.

Over 50,000 employees in Ericsson now have convertible stock worth more than SEK23 billion to share between them, reports Dagens Industri.

The JC fashion retailer will list on the Stockholm Exchange in April and also issue new share for SEK280 million, reports Dagens Industri.

All curves point upwards. Growth is high as well as order intake. Confidence in the Swedish economy is booming and the yield gap to Germany fast melting, writes Finanstidningen.

Volvo and Scania retailers say that thousands of jobs would be lost in Scania retailers if the merger was approved by the EU commission. They also strongly criticizes the concessions agreed by Volvo in an attempt to win
approval for the bid, reports Svenska Dagbladet.

EU Committee  OKs Monti Position On Pechiney, Volvo-Source

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- A  European Union Commission committee voted in favor of a recommendation by E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to veto both Pechiney SA's (PY) planned merger with Alcan Aluminium Ltd. (AL), and AB  Volvo's (VOLVY) purchase of  Scania AB (SCVA), a person familiar with the issue said Friday.

The source also said the officials from each of the 20 E.U. commissioners' offices voted at their meeting late Thursday to support the recommended approval "with substantial concessions" of Alcan's merger with Switzerland's Alusuisse Lonza Holding AG (Z.AGP).

The decisions now pass to the 20 commissioners for a final official vote Tuesday, which is normal procedure for indepth, extended E.U. Commission merger investigations.

The officials assessed on a technical level papers from Monti which had set out the antitrust unit's decisions, the source said.
The officials unanimously approved all three merger decisions, he said.

Nevertheless, a last-minute reprieve is still possible for Canada's Alcan and France's Pechiney, but is virtually ruled out for Swedish commercial vehicles maker Volvo and Scania, people close to the issue said.

"If the Commission knows what it wants and (Alcan and Pechiney agreed to this), there is no need for market testing so it can be done in the very last days," said a Brussels-based lawyer who declined to be named.

Objections to Alcan and Pechiney's link-up are understood to relate to Alcan's 50% stake in the Norf plant in Germany. Holding on to Europe's biggest flat-rolled aluminium facility would put the companies in too powerful a position, people close to the issue say.
Alusuisse's concessions are believed to relate to alumina trihydrate and flat-rolled aluminium products, which the
Commission has previously said were problematic.

Companies also have the option of withdrawing their application for merger clearance before the final decision is given.

Highlights of Friday's  Commission briefing.

BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the  European Commission on Friday:
Spokesman Jonathan Faull said there would be a briefing at 1400/1300 GMT on Commission President Romano
Prodi's meeting with a number of Minister Presidents of the German regions, the Laender. Around 1230/1130
GMT on Tuesday there would be a technical briefing on the implementation of the broad economic guidelines for
1999. Also on Tuesday, Commissioner Mario Monti would hold a press conference on the two merger decisions
on the agenda of the Commission's meeting: on  Volvo's takeover of  Scania and the three-way merger between
Alcan, Alusuisse and Pechiney. No time has been set yet

Spokesman Gerassimos Thomas briefed on Monday's meetings of the Euro 11 and of the Ecofin Council. Spokesman Jonathan Todd said Commissioner Frits Bolkestein would present to the Ecofin Council a Commission communication on the taxation of aviation fuel.

The communication was based on a study which "confirms that current levels of taxation on commercial aviation do not reflect the damage done by commercial aviation". It urges member states to adopt a 1997 proposal which would allow them to impose excise duties on kerosene used for commercial aviation, he continued.

Answering questions, Todd said the proposed directive would apply only to flights between member states, and that it would "not necessarily put budget airlines out of business".

In answer to another question, Todd said Sweden was likely to bring up under 'other matters' in the Ecofin Council the issue of extending its exemption from EU trade rules on alcohol. Todd repeated the Commission's position that it "sees no reason to prolong this derogation after June 30".

Spokesman Andrew Fielding said an Employment and Social Affairs Council to be held on March 13 would discuss, at the Commission's request, a proposed package of anti-discrimination measures.

In reply to a question about developments in the EU-U.S. dispute over hormone-treated beef, spokesman Gregor Kreuzhuber said Commissioner Fischler had discussed this with U.S. Secretary of State for Agriculture, William Daley. "Under certain conditions the EU could envisage bigger imports (of U.S. hormone-free beef)", he said, adding that, regarding the use of sanctions, "the U.S. might have changed its mind".

Asked about the amount of money to be allocated to the stability pact for the Balkans, spokeswoman Dominique Discors said budgetary negotiations were ongoing and that a decision would be taken by May 10, when the Commission would adopt its official budget proposal.

Answering a question, spokesman Eric Mamer said the Commissison was still waiting for some former Commissioners to submit details of their earnings to see whether some of them needed to reimburse money received since leaving their posts.
Mamer added that a decision had been taken in three of the cases, but could not divulge any names.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Monti's  Monopoly Mirage --- He should  try buying  vodka in Stockholm
507 words
10 March 2000
The Wall Street Journal Europe
WSJE

When does 31% market-share make a monopoly? When Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is counting, that's when. Earlier this week,  Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said he learned from the EU antitrust authorities that they would block the merger between Swedish truck makers  Volvo and Scania because of their dominance of the Scandinavian truck market. Say what?

Although the combined Volvo-Scania would initially possess market share in parts of Scandinavia of over 90%, their share of the overall European truck market would be a mere 31%. Not exactly Gargantua.

The European Commission is supposed to oversee anticompetitive practices in the single European market, and it is about time that it started viewing that market as a whole. A unified market need not be a uniform one.
Volvo-Scania's dominance in Scandinavia is likely to last only as long as they continue to sell quality products at competitive prices. If they don't, customers will go elsewhere.
No doubt the Commission is concerned in part because of the alleged collusion of auto makers to prevent
cross-border selling of autos and maintain price-differentials. But as we've discussed in this space before, such
collusion is neither as easy nor as effective as the Commission seems to fear.

Furthermore, trucks, like cars, are readily transportable, coming as they do already well-equipped to be moved from place to place. To find out how willing Swedes are to cross borders for a better deal, Mr. Monti need look no further than the recent blow-up over Sweden's oppressive alcohol-importation restrictions.

Sweden's restrictive alcohol regime has run afoul of Commissioner Fritz Bolkestein's Internal Market Directorate, which this week ordered Sweden to phase out its severe restrictions on the importation of alcohol products from other EU countries. This is bad news for Systembolaget, which holds the government monopoly on the sale of alcohol within Sweden. The ability to buy cheaper goods in Denmark, for example, and bring them back to Sweden, will make it extremely difficult for Systembolaget to maintain its extortionist pricing, which will in turn cut into the revenue Systembolaget generates for the Swedish government.

The government's opposition to the elimination of the import restrictions is a clear acknowledgement that Systembolaget's monopoly (and the pricing power that goes with it) can be maintained only by severely restricting importation of alcohol and tobacco. If Systembolaget's reign of terror over alcohol is so precarious, what does Mr. Monti have to fear from a combined Volvo-Scania?

It has been offered recently that the antitrust watchdogs are concerned about a truck oligopoly in Europe as much as about monopoly itself. This smacks of regulatory creep. It is not for Mr. Monti to decide how many companies make a market. Auto-industry consolidation is being driven precisely by the fierce competition and low margins that prevail in this industry, all of which is good, not bad, for consumers.

FOCUS - EU to block Volvo/Scania deal - EU source.
By Michael Mann
647 words
10 March 2000
16:50
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2000 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set on Tuesday to back plans from its antitrust chief to block Swedish truckmaker Volvo's buy of rival  Scania on competition concerns, an  EU source said on Friday.
"The basic proposal will be confirmed," the source told Reuters, referring to a proposal from  EU Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti. "All there might be is some minor drafting changes to the text."

The source was speaking one day after senior advisers to the 20 Commissioners met to prepare next week's meeting of the EU executive.

The source said the Commission would back Monti's conclusion that the concessions offered by the companies to address competition concerns were insufficient. Monti needs the support of at least half the members of the EU executive for his proposal to be adopted.
Despite the signals from Brussels, Volvo spokesman Mats Edenborg reiterated the company's hope that
Tuesday's meeting of the full Commission would overrule Monti.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson admitted on Wednesday that Monti had recommended blocking the deal on the grounds that the merged company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position on the Nordic market.

Monti's spokesman Michael Tscherny told reporters the Commission would nonetheless discuss the ruling after requests from "a couple of Commissioners who have reservations".
Uncontroversial merger decisions are normally nodded through without debate.
"There are Commissioners who want to discuss the Volvo case," Tscherny said. "But it's on the agenda and I
don't anticipate any problems."
He said Monti would give a press conference once the decision was taken to explain his reasoning.
Edenborg repeated comments by Johansson that if the Commission rejected Volvo's 60.7 billion Swedish crown
($6.94 billion) bid to buy Scania from Investor, Volvo had other alternatives in mind.
NATIONAL DOMINANCE

The Commission argues that the merged company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region.

Volvo and the Swedish government say the company's dominance in the Nordic region should be seen in the context of the wider European market, where it is a minority player.

Johansson said on Wednesday the Commission had changed its policy on mergers like Volvo/Scania, adding it had cleared DaimlerChrysler's 1995 purchase of German busmaker Kaessbohrer without raising similar concerns.
But Brussels-based antitrust lawyers rejected this argument.

"It's simply not true that the Commission has defined the market as Europe-wide in these sort of cases before," said one lawyer who asked not to be named. "There is absolutely no precedent for what Volvo is looking for."
Volvo shares were up 0.5 Swedish crowns at 218 crowns at 1515 GMT on Friday. ($1=8.748 Swedish Crown). Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson admitted on Wednesday that Monti had recommended blocking the deal on
the grounds that the merged company would have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant
position on the Nordic market.

But he held out the hope that Tuesday's meeting of the full Commission would "give the issue a broader and more multi-dimensional view" and overrule Monti.

However, the EU source said the Commission would back Monti's conclusion that the concessions offered by the companies to address competition concerns were insufficient. Monti needs the support of at least half the members of the EU executive for his proposal to be adopted.
Monti's opposition to the deal has led to speculation that Volvo will come up with an alternative strategy to gain
the critical mass to compete on the global truck and bus markets. ((Michael Mann, Brussels newsroom, +322 287

VOLVO/SCANIA CONCESSIONS UNLIKELY TO SATISFY COMMISSION TEAM.
256 words
11 March 2000
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2000 European Report.
According to sources close to the deal, the eleventh-hour concessions offered by Swedish truck makers  Volvo
and Scania, aimed at satisfying the  EU's merger control authorities, will be rejected.  Volvo agreed to acquire rival
automotive group Scania last August for about Euro 7 billion. Presently,  EU competition officials have indicated
that they intend to reject Volvo's planned purchase of rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB, unless  Volvo
withdraws its notification of the deal or the twenty  EU Commissioners decide to be persuaded by the companies'
arguments at their next weekly meeting on March 14. Despite further concessions offered by  Volvo to restrict its
market share to 75% in the Nordic countries, the combined company would still continue to have a strong hold on
the markets in Sweden, Norway and Finland. But the deal has been plagued for weeks, with many off-the-record
comments by EU officials clearly scorning the high market share the new merged group would have.

Even a recent visit by Sweden's Prime Minister, Goeran Persson, to the EU Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, failed to impress the EU's Merger Task Force that the deal could be good for Europe; analysts and competition lawyers following the negotiations have even gone as far as saying that the virtually unprecedented move backfired. Volvo and Scania offered to cut their combined market share by 15% in Sweden and Norway,
and by 10% in Finland, Volvo said on March 7.

Sweden Ruling Party Congress  Makes Volvo/Scania Statement

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Sweden's ruling Social Democratic party's extra congress on Sunday made a special statement on  European Union competition policy practice.
The expected blocking Tuesday of the planned merger between Swedish vehicle makers  Volvo AB (VOLVY) and
Scania AB (SCVA) has brought the competition policy onto the agenda, it said.

"European competition policies must be fair. For the sake of employment and growth, it must be possible to create large and competitive industrial groups also in small countries," the statement said.

The EU Commission is expected to block the merger on grounds that the combined group would have a market share of around 90% in Sweden and over 50% in other Nordic markets.
Volvo argues that the E.U. should be viewed as one common market in which Volvo would have less than 30%
and still be behind German-U.S market leader DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX)

Cos Cower As EU Veto On Volvo, Pechiney Seen Tue

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Six months into his term as competition commissioner, Mario Monti is expected to give Europe's consolidating companies pause for thought Tuesday by vetoing AB  Volvo's (VOLVY) purchase of Scania AB (SCVA) and Pechiney SA's (PY) planned merger with AlcanAluminium Ltd (AL).

But companies shouldn't panic, lawyers and analysts said. Monti's economic training may be ensuring he's just as tough as his predecessor, Karel Van Miert, but most sectors are still fragmented enough to see considerable consolidation without testing antitrust limits, they point out. The Volvo decision will certainly encourage the trend for geographically-complementary crossborder European and transatlantic mergers, rather than between national champions, they said. And with the European Commission clearly committed to scrutinizing competition effects at a Local level, companies would be well-advised to do their homework very carefully in preparing merger plans, lawyers warn.

The merger blocks look virtually certain, after Monti's proposed vetoes were upheld by Commission officials at a meeting Thursday. Alcan's acquisition of Alusuisse AG (Z.ALU) - one part of what those companies and Pechiney hope will be a three way merger- is expected to be approved at the same meeting Tuesday, but with substantial concessions. A Pechiney spokeswoman said "We are pursuing talks with the Commission and will do so until the last minute to reach an agreement for the three-way merger."

Two of the 20-members of the Commission have requested a discussion about the Volvo case at Tuesday's meeting, but observers say Monti should easily gain the simple majority needed to officially endorse his veto. An E.U. spokesman declined to comment on which commissioners wished to discuss the decision. Swedish Commissioner Margot Wallstrom is known to have come under pressure to oppose the veto. The merger is viewed by many Swedes as protecting the two vehicle makers from being swallowed by foreign rivals, and thus safeguarding jobs in Sweden. A veto could aid the "no" camp in the debate on Sweden's entry to the euro, they warn.

Merger vetos or approvals with concessions are relatively rare, but are likely to increase alongside the number of planned mergers in the next 12 to 18 months, antitrusts experts say. According to E.U. figures, there were 19
in-depth extended merger probes in 1999, up from 12 in 1998 and only two in 1997.

"In a number of markets there is now an irreducible minimum of competing companies," said Martin Baker, partner and head of the U.K. competition group at London-based law firm Taylor Joynson Garrett. However, it's usually still possible for merging companies to divest parts of their business to remove antitrust worries, he said.
For example, even in the heavily concentrated oil market, French major Totalfina was able to agree to admittedly
"extremely extensive divestments" to win the competition all-clear for its purchase of Elf in February, Baker noted.

"Classical" companies are more likely to test antitrust limits first as they try to build market share in their core competencies, which new technology companies "keep their fingers in as many pies as possible," said an E.U. Commission antitrust specialist who declined to be named.

For example, any further concentration of the paper and packaging industry, which has seen a series of mergers in the past 12 months , will be closely checked, said Baker. Industrial gases is another business where consolidation has left a limited number of competitors. French industrial gases company Air Liquide SA's (F.AIR) had to agree to very substantial concessions in January to be able to buy parts of BOC Air Group PLC (BXC).

Nevertheless, "there is still a long way to go from here" before most industries exhaust their competition-friendly concentration possibilities, Daniel Dickinson at Merrill Lynch in London said.

Dickinson cited retailing, consumer goods, food and banking as reasonably fragmented sectors which can expect to see national as well as cross-border mergers. Utilities, telecoms, chemicals and pharmaceuticals are in the
next stage of consolidation, with considerable pan-European and transatlantic deals in the cards, he said.

Fiat, GM Holding  Talks On Alliance; Fiat May Bid For Volvo Afterwards

MILAN -(Dow Jones)- Fiat SpA is in talks with General Motors Corp. about an alliance in which GM would take a
20% stake in the Italian group's car unit as part of an industrial partnership, Monday's Wall Street Journal
reported.

Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) is looking to break up those discussions and lure Fiat (FIA) away from its American rival with an offer of its own, those familiar with the matter told the Journal. At the same time, Fiat is considering making a bid for Swedish truck maker  Volvo AB (VOLVY), if the  European Commission blocks the latter's plans to buy rival  Scania AB (SCVA), those familiar with the matter told the Journal.
In December 1998, Fiat unsuccessfully attempted to acquire Volvo, which decided to sell only its car division to
Ford Motor Co. (F).

Thw Journal reported that GM (GM) is proposing an alliance that would allow Fiat to retain considerable control over car unit Fiat Auto, while DaimlerChrysler is offering to buy 100% of the division. However, Fiat's talks with GM are at an advanced stage and appear to have more support than the DaimlerChrysler option. GM and Fiat are discussing a deal in which the two would set up a series of joint ventures aimed at slashing production costs, while leaving each group to continue to manage the assembly, marketing and sales of the cars independently. The collaboration would make both groups more competitive in selling their cars, which would retain their own brands and identities.

To seal the industrial partnership, GM is considering buying a 20% stake in Fiat Auto, which represents about half of Fiat's consolidated sales, with that slice being valued at $2.4 billion. In turn, Fiat would take a 5% slice of GM, putting the Italian group among GM's largest shareholders. One person says Fiat's board could meet as soon as today to approve the deal, if both sides manage to hammer out the final details.

The Italian car maker -- the world's seventh-largest in terms of sales -- is widely regarded as too small to go up against rivals that are growing larger through mergers and acquisitions. Fiat also suffers from its dependence on the small car segment, which has become extremely competitive in recent years. As a result, Fiat has been courted by nearly all of the world's leading car makers during the past couple of years, with DaimlerChrysler among the most insistent suitors in recent months.

If concluded, the joint venture would cover Europe and South America, where both companies are already present, while the U.S. market wouldn't be included because Fiat has almost no presence.

Fiat and GM Are Holding  Talks About Alliance

MILAN -- Fiat SpA is in talks with General Motors Corp. about an alliance in which the U.S. auto maker would take a 20% stake in the Italian group's car unit as part of an industrial partnership, people familiar with the situation said.

Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler AG is looking to break up those discussions and lure Fiat away from its American rival with an offer of its own, these people said. At the same time, Fiat is considering making a bid for Swedish truck maker Volvo AB, if the  European Commission blocks the latter's plans to buy rival  Scania AB, those familiar with the matter said.

GM is proposing an alliance that would allow Fiat to retain considerable control over car unit Fiat Auto, while DaimlerChrysler is offering to buy 100% of the division.

One person says Fiat's board could meet as soon as today to approve the deal, if both sides manage to hammer out the final details.
Both Fiat and GM declined to comment.

The Italian car maker -- the world's seventh-largest in terms of sales -- is widely regarded as too small to go up against rivals that are growing larger through mergers and acquisitions. Fiat also suffers from its dependence on the small car segment, which has become extremely competitive in recent years. As a result, Fiat has been courted by nearly all of the world's leading car makers during the past couple of years, with DaimlerChrysler among the most insistent suitors in recent months.

If concluded, the joint venture would cover Europe and South America, where both companies are already present, while the U.S. market wouldn't be included because Fiat has almost no presence.

There are plenty of potentially sticky questions for GM and Fiat executives. How would GM and Fiat mesh their operations and product strategies in markets where they currently compete, such as Eastern and Western Europe and Latin America? Would GM and Fiat cooperate to cut excess capacity -- cutting jobs and closing plants -- in those markets, where profits are either razor-thin or nonexistent?

According to those familiar with the matter, the situation remains quite fluid, while a major sticking point still to be resolved regards the the role of the Agnelli family, the owners of Fiat. The Agnellis are deeply attached to Fiat, which was founded by the grandfather of Honorary Chairman Gianni Agnelli, while family control has in the past been an obstacle to an alliance with a foreign car maker. GM and Fiat are haggling over an option that could involve the acquisition of further stakes in Fiat Auto, which isn't publicly traded.

Fiat's role in Italy -- where it represents about 4% of national output -- renders control of the car division a particularly delicate one. While the Italian government has been anxious to see Fiat resolve its troubles, it has been wary of a deal with a foreign colossal. Fiat's size relative to GM -- the Italian group's market capitalization is

a quarter that of GM -- could raise concerns that a deal with the U.S. giant is the first step to the end of Italian ownership of the Turin-based group.

Trading in Fiat's stock has been heavily conditioned in recent weeks by the speculation of an imminent deal, with ordinary shares up about 15% since the start of the year. The preferred shares are up 45% on speculation that the stock could be converted to ordinary shares to smooth the way for a deal. Classic GM Strategy For its part, using a minority stake as the basis for a broad product and strategic partnership is a hallmark of GM's global
strategy under Chairman John F. Smith Jr. and incoming Chief Executive G. Richard Wagoner Jr. The No. 1 auto maker increasingly has turned to partnerships with other auto makers to enter new markets and develop vehicles more rapidly than it could on its own.
The outlines of the deal under discussion with Fiat are similar to arrangements GM is using to expand its
presence in Asia. GM has long held minority stakes in Japanese auto makers Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Suzuki Motor
Co., and last year acquired a minority interest in Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., builder of Subaru brand vehicles.

While the Japanese companies are nominally independent, GM is working to integrate them closely into its broader strategy for gaining ground in Asia.

In Europe, GM acquired a 50% stake in Sweden's Saab Automobiles in 1990 from Investor AB, and managed the company for a decade before agreeing to acquire the rest of it earlier this year.

Meanwhile, people close to the situation say Fiat is considering making a bid for truck maker Volvo, given expectations that the EC will block Volvo's plans to merge with Scania. Little more than a year ago, Fiat lost out to Ford in a bid to buy all of Volvo, which then included the Swedish group's car unit.

It is thought that the  EU Commission, which is due to meet tomorrow in Strasbourg, will rule out the planned three-way aluminium sector merger of Pechiney, Alcan and Algroup (APA), as well as the merger of  Volvo and Scania. In the case of APA, the team of Competition Commissioner Mario Monti was prepared to approve a merger of Alcan and Algroup, but not of Alcan and Pechiney.

EU is poised to block aluminium, truck mega-mergers  by Stephane Barbier

13 March 2000

English
(Copyright 2000)
BRUSSELS, March 13 (AFP) - The  European Commission, flexing its regulatory muscles as never before in the arena of corporate competition, is poised to block two mega-mergers on Tuesday,  EU sources say.

One involves aluminium producers Pechiney in France, Alcan in Canada and Swiss Algroup. The other would put together Swedish heavy- duty truckmakers  Volvo and Scania.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is set to rule that each of the mergers would createa big new company capable of abusing dominant positions in the marketplace, sources said.
Monti was also expected to inform his fellow commissioners, meeting in Strasbourg, France, that neither
Pechiney-Alcan-Algroup nor Volvo-Scania had put forward ideas good enough to overcome these concerns.

Out of the hundreds of merger applications that the European Union's executive branch has processed over the years, only a few have been formally blocked.

On the other hand, faced with scrutiny from Brussels, many companies have preferred to give up their merger plans rather than risk a red light.
For nine years, the European Commission has vetoed mergers 11 times.

The biggest case was in 1991 when it blocked French Aerospatiale and Italian Alenia from acquiring the Canadian aircraft manufacturer De Havilland from Boeing. De Havilland was later snapped up by Canada's Bombardier group.

Barring any last-minute surprises, Tuesday's red lights from Monti in Strasbourg will match the De Havilland decision in magnitude, despite months of intensive lobbying behind the scenes.
The aluminium merger has been the subject of two separate negotiations in Brussels -- one involving Alcan and
Pechiney, the other Alcan and Algroup, with the ultimate goal being a three-way tie- up worth 21 billion dollars.
Putting together Alcan, Pechiney and Algroup was supposed to counter a planned merger by US rivals Alcoa and
Reynolds, which is itself the subject of a full EU investigation. Results are due in May.

Having carried out a preliminary investigration, followed by an in- depth probe that opened in November, Monti's experts have concluded that Alcan-Pechniney-Algroup would create or strengthen control over certain markets such as that for aluminium used to make materials fireproof.

They also suspect a danger exists in the market for sheet alumimum used for construction, automotive industries and canning, and for alumimum used for packaging, such as aluminium foil.

In the case of Volvo-Scania, the commission had demanded, in return for its approval, that Volve discard Scania's bus unit and surrender the use of the Scania brand on heavy trucks sold in the Nordic countries and Ireland.
Volvo judged both demands unacceptable.

"In Volvo's opinion, the conditions do not exist for Volvo to reach an agreement with the EU competition authority regarding approval of the proposed acquisition of Scania," Volvo said in a statement last Wednesday.

Volvo has been ready to pay 315 Swedish kronor (about 37 euros, dollars) per share of Scania, or a total of 63 billion kronor. The merged entity would dominate the truck and bus market in Scandinavia.

In blocking both mergers, the commission risks being accused of favortism, at a time when corporate marriages are becoming more common in Europe in light of the growing global economy.

Volvo has already barked at the commission for approving the merger of France's Renault Industrial Vehicles and Italy's Iveco, alleging that manufacturers in bigger EU states are getting a more partial interpretation of the rules than those in smaller countries.

Fiat Is in Advanced  Talks For Partnership With GM --- Italian Icon May Sell U.S. Giant 20% Stake in Auto Unit --- Agnelli-Controlled Group, Pursued by Daimler-Chrysler, Also Considers a Bid for Volvo Trucks By Deborah Ball

MILAN -- Fiat SpA is in advanced talks with General Motors Corp. about an industrial alliance in which the U.S. auto maker would take a 20% stake in the Italian group's car unit, people familiar with the matter said.

Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler AG is looking to break up those talks and lure Fiat away from its American rival with an offer of its own, people familiar with the matter say. At the same time, Fiat is considering making a bid for Swedish truck maker AB  Volvo, if the  European Commission blocks the latter's plans to buy rival  Scania AB, say people familiar with the situation.

GM is proposing an alliance that would allow Fiat to retain considerable control over car unit Fiat Auto, while DaimlerChrysler is offering to buy 100% of the division. However, Fiat's talks with GM are at an advanced stage and appear to have more support from the Italians than the DaimlerChrysler proposal.

Even some members of the Italian government, which is leery of giving up one of the nation's industrial jewels, acknowledged that Fiat can't remain independent forever. "Fiat needs an international alliance that allows it to broaden its market," said Italian Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino over the weekend. "Such a step is unavoidable. (Otherwise) Fiat risks being gradually marginalized."

GM and Fiat are discussing a deal in which the two would set up a series of joint ventures in Europe and South America aimed at slashing production costs in those markets, while leaving each group to continue to manage the assembly, marketing and sales of the cars independently. The collaboration upstream would make both groups more competitive in selling their cars, which would retain their own brands and identities.

In order to seal the industrial partnership, GM is considering buying a 20% stake -- valued at about $2.4 billion (2.49 billion euros) -- in Fiat Auto, which accounts for about half of Fiat's consolidated sales. In turn, Fiat would take a 5% interest in GM, becoming one of GM's largest shareholders. A person familiar with the situation said Fiat's board could be called as early as today to approve the deal if both sides manage to hammer out the final details. Both Fiat and GM declined to comment.

If there is an agreement, it could resolve Fiat's longstanding difficulties in a sector that is increasingly dominated by giants. The Italian car maker -- the world's seventh largest by sales -- is widely regarded as too small to compete effectively against rivals that are growing larger through mergers and acquisitions. Fiat also suffers from its dependence on the small-car segment, which has become extremely competitive in recent years. As a result, Fiat has been courted by virtually all of the world's leading car makers over the past couple of years, with DaimlerChrysler among the most persistent suitors in recent months.

As part of the deal, Fiat may also join the Internet-based automotive-parts exchange that GM, Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler plan to set up, although any eventual agreement could come only with approval of Ford and DaimlerChrysler, people familiar with the matter said.

The situation remains fluid as a major sticking point still to be resolved is the future control of Fiat Auto and the role of the Agnelli family, the owners of Fiat. The Agnellis are deeply attached to Fiat, which was founded by the grandfather of Honorary Chairman Gianni Angelli, and in the past, their position has been an obstacle to an alliance with a foreign car maker. GM and Fiat are haggling over an option that could involve the acquisition of further stakes in Fiat Auto, whose shares aren't publicly traded.

Fiat's pre-eminent role in Italy -- its operations account for about 4% of gross national product -- makes the entry
of a foreign investor into its car division a particularly delicate one. While the Italian government has been anxious
to see Fiat resolve its troubles, it has been wary of a deal with a foreign colossus. Given that the Italian group's
market capitalization is a quarter that of GM, there could be concerns that a deal with the U.S. auto maker may be
the first step toward the end of Italian ownership of the Turin-based company.

"We trust that the group's leaders will take the best decision, with the knowledge that what is at stake is more than the future of just any private group, but that of an important piece of the country," said Italian Industry Minister Enrico Letta over the weekend.

Volvo, Scania Back In Play As EU Blocks  Merger Plans
By Jan Lindroth

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)-  Volvo AB (VOLVY) will look at other targets and may be a target itself following the
European Union's block Tuesday of its planned merger with rival truck maker  Scania AB (SCVA).

The group said it will evaluate possible partners in  Europe, North America and Asia. Its healthy cash pile, of SEK31 billion at the end of last year, and relatively cheap share price may also make it attractive to others. Such hopes drove its share nearly 7% higher on the Stockholm bourse.

In a telephone conference call following the E.U. ruling, Chief Executive Leif Johansson said: "I expect that we will now enter a phase when many different alternatives will be tried and our intention is to continue to be active."

It was likely the group would receive proposals and suggestions from other industry players, "and those will also be evaluated," he said.
He declined to specify targets or potential suitors.

The E.U. Commission Tuesday rejected AB Volvo's bid to join forces with Scania. It said the combined company would have a truck market share of between 65% and 90% in the Nordic region.

Fiat SpA (FIA) and Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) have both expressed an interest in Volvo and, to a lesser extent, Scania. General Motors Corp. (GM), which Monday sealed an accord with Fiat, is also frequently mentioned as a possible suitor.
Alternatively, Volvo could target Navistar International Inc. (NAV) of the U.S., MAN AG (G.MAN) of Germany, or
Renault's truck division, RVI/Iveco, for takeover, according to analysts.
"Navistar would make a handsome combination with Volvo, but so would Paccar-Daf or RVI," said Anders
Bruzelius, sector analyst with Nordic investment bank Carnegie. "The question is if they are for sale."
In Asia, Volvo has a cooperation agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (J.MOT) of Japan. Volvo has 5% in
Mitsubishi, which it's to swap for around 20% in the trucks and buses division.
Johansson said the cooperation with Mitsubishi is working very well and that he expects to extend and deepen it. Volvo Shares Higher With More Upside Seen; Scania Down
Volvo's shareholding in Scania, 45.5% of the capital worth around SEK24 billion, will not be immediately affected by the E.U. ruling. Volvo intends to hang onto to the stake for now.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," said Johansson.

Scania's other major shareholder, Investor AB with 26% of the shares and 45% of the voting rights, said in a brief statement that it now "take the time needed to carefully seek every conceivable alternative for the future."
Johansson said the E.U. decision seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

The decision blocks the companies' integration, but they will evaluate other forms of cooperation. This could involve some joint purchasing and research and development, Johansson said.
Volvo shares shot up SEK15.50 to close at SEK236.00, while Scania slipped SEK8, or 3.1%, to SEK250.
Page 69 of 133 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Traders said Volvo shares have the potential to climb to between SEK250 and SEK260, as speculation mounts that a rival automotive group will make a bid.

Scania, on the other hand, could slip another SEK10-SEK20 from present levels, although long-term prospects for its share price are strong.

"Scania will eventually become a merger target for Volkswagen and a further drop in share price is going to make levels very attractive," one Stockholm-based trader said.

Volvo Says EU Blocks  Scania Merger

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission on Tuesday rejected AB  Volvo's planned merger with rival truck maker Scania AB (SCVA), Volvo said.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said he regretted the decision, which he said seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo's current shareholding in Scania is 45.5% of the capital and will not be immediately affected by the ruling. Volvo intends to hang onto to the stake for now.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," said Leif Johansson.


The EU decision means the integration of the two companies will not be carried out, but they will now evaluate other forms of future cooperation, Volvo said.
- - 14/03/00 15-56G

"It is natural that many questions arise as a result of the EU Commission's decision," Johansson said. "Today we do not have definitive answers to all questions. We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives".

The EU ruling means that the shares from shareholders that accepted Volvo's bid for Scania will be transferred back to them around March 20.

Scania said in a separate statement that the uncertainty during the past year has been a burden on Scania and its sales organization but that no damage should have been caused to the company in the short term as a result.

Swedish Minister of Industry Bjoern Rosengren said in a written comment that he felt the Commission had put to much emphasis on single national markets in this case but that he hoped that the decision doesn't mean that small countries like Sweden won't have problems in the future "to achieve national solutions to restructuring problems in sectors where the competition is global".

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union Commission Tuesday confirmed that it blocked Swedish commercial vehicles maker AB Volvo's (VOLVY) bid for rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB (SCVA).

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the decision was unanimous and followed findings that the originally notified acquisition would lead to high market shares of between 50% and 90% in the heavy truck, city and intercity buses and touring coaches markets in a number of E.U. countries.
The Commission said that offers made by Volvo to solve competition concerns were insufficient.

The Commission said it didn't consider there were exceptional circumstances that would allow it to consider a second complex package of undertakings submitted on March 7, after the deadline of Feb. 21.

The Commission also said it didn't have enough time to evaluate and consult on the new proposal before the legal deadline for a decision, which couldn't be extended.

"Given the gravity of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger...and the fact that Volvo was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger," it said.

Monti dismissed arguments that the merger should be considered on a pan-European rather than a national market basis.
"We aren't allowed to discriminate against consumers simply because they live in a relatively small country." Nothing is stopping the companies notifying an amended merger proposal.
Volvo can keep its stake in Scania so long as it doesn't have control of the company, Monti said.

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Swedish shares ended up slightly Tuesday, but the focus was on  Volvo and Scania after European Union competition authorities decided not to approve the proposed merger between the two truckmakers.

The Stockholm General Index, or SXG, rose just 2.28 points, or 0.03%, to 6519.84 while the narrower OMX index was up 0.29 points, or 0.02%, at 1466.87.
Volvo shot up SEK15.50, or 7.0%, to SEK236.00 on the E.U. decision, while Scania slipped SEK8, or 3.1%, to
SEK250.

Upside potential on Volvo shares is seen up to SEK250-260, as speculation will mount that Italy's Fiat is likely to make a bid for the company, traders said.

Scania, on the other hand, could slip another SEK10-20 from present levels, although long-term prospects for its share price are strong, said traders.

"Scania will eventually become a merger target for Volkswagen and a further drop in share price is going to eventually make levels very attractive," one Stockholm-based trader said.

Meanwhile, Finnish telecommunciations giant Nokia surged SEK47, or 2.6%, to SEK1,877 in Stockholm, and finished up EUR7.25, or 3.3%, at EUR224 in Helsinki.

Traders chalked up the gains to bargain-hunting, saying several successive weeks of profit-taking on the stock had sent the share to cheap levels.
Market bellwether Ericsson finished up SEK2, or 0.2%, at SEK850.

Among Tuesday's losers, financial stocks fell in tandem with the bond market, with insurance firm Skandia the hardest hit. Skandia fell SEK6, or 1.3%, to SEK439.

Anglo/Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca closed down SEK10, or 2.8%, at SEK342.50. The firm gained approval of its Nexium drug in Sweden on Monday, but subsequent media reports have said the drug doesn't have the capacity to replace Losec as AZN's mainstay product.

EU, As Expected, Puts Stop To Volvo's  Purchase Of Rival Truck Maker Scania

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)-  European Union competition authorities, showing they intend to maintain a tough line against attempts by big corporations to get even bigger, have vetoed  Volvo AB's planned $7.5 billion acquisition
of rival Swedish truck maker  Scania AB.

The decision, which had been expected after published reports last week said Mario Monti, the  EU's competition commissioner, opposed the deal, was greeted with disppointment by  Volvo and the Swedish government. However, it could open the door to possible interest in  Volvo. Before the decision was announced, sources told The Wall Street Journal that Fiat SpA was considering making a bid for Volvo if the EU blocked the Scania (SCVA, SCVB) deal. Those reports may have helped fuel a rise in Volvo shares (VOLVY) after the EU decision was announced.

In its decision, the European Commission, the EU's executive body, said offers made by Volvo to solve competition concerns were insufficient.

"Given the gravity of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger ... and the fact that Volvo was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger," it said.

Last week, London's Financial Times reported that EU officials had drafted a plan to veto the deal, which would have created a powerful player in the global bus-and-truck market, second only to German-American auto maker DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX).

The EU was concerned the deal would create a company with a virtual monopoly over sales of heavy trucks in Sweden. The combined company would have a market share of more than 90% in Sweden and 50% in Scandinavia.

The Financial Times said Volvo had been willing to offer further concessions to win approval for the Scania deal, but missed the deadline for making such offers. Concessions have to be submitted to EU authorities by the end of the third month of a four-month investigation.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said Tuesday he regretted the EU's decision, which he said seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Despite the decision, Volvo said it plans to hold onto its stake in Scania and the two companies will look at ways to cooperate on future developments. Volvo's current holding in Scania amounts to nearly 31% of the voting shares and nearly 46% of the capital.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," said Johansson.

"It is natural that many questions arise as a result of the EU Commission's decision. Today we do not have definitive answers to all questions. We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives".

The EU ruling means that the shares from shareholders that accepted Volvo's bid for Scania will be transferred back to them around March 20.

Scania said in a separate statement that the uncertainty during the past year has been a burden on the company and its sales organization but that the EU decision wasn't expected to damage Scania in the short term.

Swedish Minister of Industry Bjoern Rosengren said he felt the Commission had put to much emphasis on single national markets in this case. He hoped the decision wouldn't affect future attempts by small countries like Sweden "to achieve national solutions to restructuring problems in sectors where the competition is global".

BRUSSELS, March 14 (AFP) - The European Commission has blocked Tuesday a proposed merger of the
Swedish auto groups  Volvo and Scania, EU sources said.

Volvo had made an offer to buy  Scania's trucks business for 315 Swedish kronor per  Scania share, or a total of
63 billion kronor (seven billion euros, 6.72 billion dollars).
The merged entity would dominate the truck and bus market in Scandinavia.

But the European Commission had made clear it would veto the plan on grounds it undermines European Union competition rules, rejecting last-minute concessions from Volvo that sought to diminish those concerns.

BRUSSELS, March 14 (AFP) - The  European Commission blocked Tuesday a proposed merger of Swedish motor groups Volvo and Scania, saying it would have created competition problems on  European heavy truck markets, EU sources said.

A veto effectively would sound the death knell to a plan that was to have created the world's second-largest builder of trucks over 16 tonnes, after Daimler-Chrysler, and the largest in  Europe, with 30.8 percent of the market.
EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti was due to announce officially the decision later Tuesday.
Volvo had made an offer to buy Scania's trucks business for 315 Swedish kronor per Scania share, or a total of
63 billion kronor (seven billion euros, 6.72 billion dollars).
The merged entity would dominate the truck and bus market in Scandinavia.

The commission said a series of committments made by Volvo and Scania to realize the merger were insufficient to avoid dominant positions on the European market.

The commission said, in fact, that the proposed merger would have resulted in dominant market positions for heavy trucks in the Scandinavian countries, and for municipal bus tourism car construction in Ireland, Britain and Scandinavia.

EU sources said the latest proposals made by Volvo on March 7 had not met legal deadlines and were not examined in detail, but nonetheless would not have rectified the competition problems.

Volvo, anticipating the commission's decision, had called it "unacceptable," noting the commission had given the green light to other similar mergers, including that of Renault Industrial Vehicles and Iveco, and
Daimler-Kaessbohrer in the same sector.

Sweden attacks EU decision to block Volvo/Scania merger ATTENTION - RECASTS, UPDATES with government, Scania reactions ///

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (AFP) - Sweden attacked a decision Tuesday by the  European Commission to block the planned merger between truckmakers  Volvo and Scania, calling the move "deeply regrettable" and contradictory to  EU rules.
"From the Swedish point of view, the decision of the  EU Commission is deeply regrettable," Industry Minister
Bjorn Rosengren said in a statement.

He criticized European Union (EU) competition authorities for placing "too much weight" on the national aspect of the deal instead of viewing it within the context of a single European market.

"I presume this decision does not mean that small countries like Sweden find it hard in the future to devise solutions at the national level in sectors where the competition is global," Rosengren said.

The European Commission in Brussels blocked the decision because it would have created competition problems on European heavy truck markets, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
The proposed Volvo-Scania merger would have created the world's second-largest manufacturer of trucks over
16 tonnes and the new entity would have dominated the Scandanavian market, unfairly in Brussels' view.
Rosengren took issue with that view though, saying "the future of the truck market is not here in Sweden." Volvo separately expressed regret at the Commission's move, arguing it flouted basic commercial principles of
the European Union.

"I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market," Leif Johansson, Volvo chief executive, said in a statement.
He said the Commission's decision raised a number of questions, to which he did not have all the answers. "We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," Johansson said.
Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of the capital in Scania and Johansson said Volvo planned to retain that holding for the time being.

Industry analysts have suggested that rejection of the Volvo- Scania merger could leave both companies more vulnerable to foreign takeover.
Italian auto giant Fiat was among the companies known to have been courting Volvo. Fiat chief executive Paolo
Fresco said in an Italian newspaper interview published Tuesday that his company was still interested.
Recent media reports however have also noted that Volvo, flush with cash after selling its car division to US
automaker Ford Motor Company last year, could look farther afield for an acquisition.
Those reports have named US truckmaker Navistar and Germany's MAN as possible Volvo acquisition targets. The reaction to the EU move from Scania was more sanguine.
"I believe that in the short term this rejection will not cause any serious injury to the company," Scania's chief executive, Leif Oestling, said in a statement.

EU upsets Volvo-Scania merger by Robert MacPherson  ATTENTION - INCORPORATES EU-auto-Sweden, EU-France-aluminium series ///
655 words
14 March 2000
Agence France-Presse
AFPR

(Copyright 2000)
STRASBOURG, March 14 (AFP) - Volvo's quest to become the world's number-two big-truck maker was hurled off the road Tuesday by the European Commission.
Flexing its regulatory muscle, the  EU's executive branch said  Volvo's merger with rival Swedish truckmaker
Scania would have left the new company with an unacceptable dominant position in the Scandinavian market.
The veto upset Volvo's plan to become the world's second-largest builder of trucks over 16 tonnes, after
Daimler-Chrysler, and the largest in Europe, with 30.8 percent of the market.
"From the Swedish point of view, the decision of the EU commission is deeply regrettable," Swedish Industry
Minister Bjorn Rosengren said in a swift condemnation of the decision.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti also intended to block a tie-up between Canadian and French aluminium producers Alcan and Pechiney, while approving a related merger between Alcan and Switzerland's Alusuisse group.
Had the three-way merger gone through, the result would have been the biggest aluminium company after
Alcoa-Reynolds of the United States -- a merger that is itself pending EU approval due in May.

But just a few hours before Monti's announcement in Strasbourg, where the European parliament was meeting, Pechiney declared that its fusion with Alcan was being put on hold, pending new proposals to be put to Brussels.

"The objective of the three groups is to ensure the necessary time to review the details of the commission's requirements for approval, to examine solutions that satisfy all the parties and allow the presentation of a new notification," it said.

Monti's verdicts, unanimously approved by his fellow EU commissioners, were seen by industry analysts as a clear sign from Brussels that it will not routinely rubber-stamp a growing wave of big-scale corporate mergers in Europe.

In the past decade, the commission has only blocked 11 merger applications, although many companies have also abandoned merger plans to avoid embarrassing outcomes.

But Monti argued Tuesday he was not adopting a deliberate hard line against multi-billion-euro, transborder corporate marriages -- seen by many European captains of industry as essential for battling US rivals in the global economy.

"I believe that mergers are generally pro-competitive," he told reporters. "They have the potential to bring substantial efficiencies to our economies."

Volvo had offered to buy Scania's truck business for 63 billion kronor (seven billion euros, 6.72 billion dollars), using cash it reaped when it spun off its car division to Ford Motor Company of the United States.

But Monti argued that Volvo and Scania had failed to come up with realistic proposals to avoid dominant market positions -- particularly in an industry that caters to independent truckers and bus operators.

Volvo-Scania would have controlled 90 percent of the Swedish heavy truck market, and 50 percent of Britain's long-distance bus market, Monti said, citing but two examples.

In a statement, Volvo chief executive Leif Johansson said: "I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the (pan-European) common market."
"We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," Johansson said.

In the case of Alcan-Pechiney-Alusuisse, Monti's office said in a statement that the Alcan-Pechiney side of the deal would have "created dominant positions in a number of markets."

Those markets included aluminium used for drinks and food cans, and packaging products such as aerosol cans and foil wrapping, it said. The merged company would also have shared a rolling mill in Germany with rival VAW, a unit of the German group Viag.

"In the course of the procedure, Alcan proposed undertakings which the commission did not consider sufficient to remove the competition problems," the statement said.

EU Panel Rejects Volvo-Scania Deal

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - The  European Commission on Tuesday rejected  Volvo's planned $6.9 billion merger with rival Swedish truck and bus maker  Scania as anticompetitive.

The commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-member  European Union, said the merger "would have caused serious competition concerns by creating dominant positions" in several sectors, including the heavy truck and bus markets in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

The commission ruled that a combined market share, which it estimated would range from 50 percent to 90 percent, would raise barriers to entry or expansion in those markets.

"The merger would therefore significantly change the market structure to the detriment of the customers," the commission's decision said.

The proposed merger, announced in August, would have created the world's second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.

Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, had lobbied hard for approval, offering to open its extensive truck retail and service network to competition and to reduce its market share. But the commission rejected the concessions.

Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, expressed regret over the decision, saying it seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of Scania and will retain its stake for now, according to a statement issued before the commission made its decision public.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," Johansson said.
The two companies will pursue other forms of cooperation, Volvo said.

Scania's managing director, Leif Oestling, said he was not happy it took the commission so long to reach a decision.
The uncertainty, he said, "influenced Scania and our sales organization negatively." But he added that there was
"no serious damage."
Volvo, which had a net income last year of $3.74 billion, has about 52,500 employees worldwide and Scania
23,500.

EU Commission Stops Volvo's  Acquisition of Scania

STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 14, 2000--The EU Commission today rejected  Volvo's application for competition approval of  Volvo's proposed acquisition of Scania.

This means that Volvo does not have the possibility to complete the acquisition of Investor's  Scania shares and the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

"Together with Scania, we had the ambition to build an EU-based company with the best conceivable prospects to compete globally with the large players in the industry. I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market," says Volvo's CEO Leif Johansson.

"Within Volvo, we must look ahead and move onward with the work to strengthen our global competitiveness, which includes continued investment and further development of our other business areas," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's current holding in Scania, which amounts to 30.6% of the votes and 45.5% of the capital, is not affected directly by the EU Commission's decision. The shares were acquired at an average price of SEK 266 per share, or a total of slightly more than SEK 24 billion. Volvo intends to retain this holding at this time. However, Volvo does not intend to request a position on Scania's Board of Directors.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania," says Leif Johansson.

The EU Commission's decision means that the intended integration of Volvo and Scania will not be carried out. The companies will now evaluate whether other forms of future cooperation are possible.

"It is natural that many questions arise as a result of the EU Commission's decision. However, I hope that there is understanding for the fact that today we do not have definitive answers to all questions. We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's offer to shareholders in Scania was conditional upon receipt of the necessary approval from the authorities for the acquisition of shares in Scania on terms acceptable to Volvo. As a result of the EU Commission's decision not to approve Volvo's acquisition of Scania, Volvo cannot complete the agreement to acquire Investor's holding in Scania nor the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

The shares tendered in the offer will be transferred back to the affected shareholders' VP-accounts as soon as possible, which is expected to occur on March 20, 2000. Additional information will be sent directly to the affected shareholders.

Scania's Comment in View of the Decision  by The EU Commission

STOCKHOLM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 14, 2000--Against the background of the decision by the  EU Commission not to approve the proposed acquisition of  Scania by Volvo, Scania's President and CEO Leif Ostling makes the following comments:

"Regrettably, the handling of this issue has taken a long time. The uncertain situation during more than one year has naturally put strain on the company and its sales organisation. Despite this uncertainty, I conclude that in the short perspective  Scania has not sustained serious damage.

"Scania's owner structure is obviously an issue for our shareholders. But at the same time I must declare that the present uncertainty is not good for Scania. Long-term ownership stability is a necessity for Scania's continued development as a publicly listed company.

"Demand for heavy commercial vehicles, particularly in western Europe, developed strongly, as evidenced by our very good financial performance in 1999. During the first months of this year, demand and capacity utilisation remain good.

"Extensive product renewal over the past few years in combination with strong market growth has made Scania a very healthy company. We now concentrate on producing good results this year.

"Industrially, Scania now continues to develop its business as an independent actor, irrespective of the current ownership structure. This means for example that the joint preparatory planning between Volvo and Scania, which was initiated by the integration committee in August 1999, is now discontinued. Long-term, this does not preclude future co-operation regarding some non-strategic areas.

"My role as President and CEO of the company during the period since the offer was launched has primarily been to prioritise operations and ensure that Scania during this period has acted appropriately towards all parties involved. The Board and Group Management of Scania now focus on the future, with special attention to what is best for the company and for our customers in the long run."
For the time being, Scania has no further comments to the current situation.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 14, 2000--"We have stood behind the  Volvo Scania deal since we believe in the advantages to be gained from an eventual merger.

European Commission rejects Volvo's  planned merger with Scania

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - The  European Commission on Tuesday rejected  Volvo's planned $6.9 billion merger with rival Swedish truck and bus maker  Scania as anticompetitive.

The commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-member  European Union, said the merger "would have caused serious competition concerns by creating dominant positions" in several sectors, including the heavy truck and bus markets in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

The commission ruled that a combined market share, which it estimated would range from 50 percent to 90 percent, would raise barriers to entry or expansion in those markets.

"The merger would therefore significantly change the market structure to the detriment of the customers," the commission's decision said.

The proposed merger, announced in August, would have created the world's second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.

Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, had lobbied hard for approval, offering to open its extensive truck retail and service network to competition and to reduce its market share. But the commission rejected the concessions.

Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, expressed regret over the decision, saying it seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of Scania and will retain its stake for now, according to a statement issued before the commission made its decision public.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in

The Goteborg-based automaker had lobbied hard for approval, offering to open its extensive truck retail and service network to competition and to reduce its market share, but the commission rejected the concessions.

"Given the gravity of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger ... and the fact that Volvo was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger."

Volvo's chief executive Leif Johansson said he regretted the decision, which he said seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market."

Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of Scania and will hold onto its stake for now, according to a statement that was issued before the commission made its long-expected decision public.

FOCUS - EU rejects Volvo's  merger with Scania.

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission blocked Swedish truck and busmaker AB Volvo's 60.7 billion crown ($6.95 billion) merger with rival  Scania on Tuesday on competition grounds, the  EC and Volvo said.

Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson attacked a ruling - correctly anticipated in the market - which he said seemed to go "against the basic concept of the common market".

Volvo shares rose 15.5 crowns to 236, while shares in Scania fell eight crowns to 250 when the market closed flat.

Auto industry analysts said the move put both companies into play in a rapid consolidation of the global vehicle industry, and Johansson agreed in a teleconference there could be bids.

"We certainly feel that we have the opportunity as a company to be in the driving seat to make acquisitions but we have also said that if good proposals come from outside, whatever the structure, we will look at them," he said.

In a separate statement, Scania Chief Executive Leif Ostling said that work begun on integrating the two companies was now discontinued, but this did not rule out long-term cooperation in non-strategic areas.

The Commission said in Strasbourg it had concluded that concessions proposed by Volvo were not enough to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the merger.
The proposed merger would have made Volvo-Scania Europe's biggest heavy truckmaker.

The Commission said the proposed merger could have created dominant positions in the markets for heavy trucks and city buses in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Ireland, touring coaches in Finland and Britain and intercity buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.
VOLVO, SCANIA MAY COOPERATE

Volvo and the Swedish government argued the company's dominance in the Nordic region should be seen in the context of the wider European market, where it would only be a minority player.
Although the full 20-member Commission discussed the issue, Volvo's hopes that EU Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti would be overruled by his colleagues were disappointed.
Volvo said it and Scania would now study whether other forms of cooperation were possible, and in the short term
Volvo said it saw no need to divest its 45.5 percent Scania stake.
Volvo, which sold its car division to Ford last year, already cooperates with Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC).

Volvo plans to eventually take a 19.9 percent of a new Mitsubishi subdisidary including all the Japanese group's truck and bus operations and has already purchased a five percent stake of MMC.

GM's alliance with Fiat announced on Monday came as a timely reminder that size is key in consolidation of the worldwide vehicle industry.

"If Fiat develops into a holding company, it's possible that Iveco might acquire Volvo, or maybe the other way round," auto industry analyst Anders Bruzelius of brokerage Carnegie said.
"We would still like Volvo," Fiat Chairman Paolo Fresco told reporters in Turin on Monday, adding that the GM
deal would not affect Fiat truck division Iveco's interest in Volvo if the Scania link failed.

Hakan Persson, analyst at Aragon Securities, said people might now expect Volkswagen AG to renew its interest in Scania, but he thought this was not likely at present because of VW's low stock price.
The latest consolidation could involve German truck manufacturer MAN Nutsfahrzeuge AG, U.S. truck firm
Paccar Inc, Navistar International Corp, and Renault's RVI trucks, analysts said. ($1=8.729 Swedish Crown).

EU set to take tough line on Volvo, APA mergers.
401 words
14 March 2000

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited
STRASBOURG, France, March 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set on Tuesday to take a tough line on two major corporate alliances, blocking truckmaker Volvo's planned takeover of  Scania and giving only partial approval to an aluminium industry mega-merger,  EU sources said.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti believes the  Volvo/Scania tie-up would create a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and would dominate the Nordic market.

He has rejected calls from Volvo and the Swedish government to look at the market in a wider European context, where Volvo/Scania would only be a minority player.

Meanwhile, Monti is also expected to recommend that Canada's Alcan be allowed to link up with Switzerland's Alusuisse in return for concessions, but that the further merger with France's Pechiney be blocked on competition grounds.
Volvo has been lobbying hard on the Scania deal over recent weeks, hoping that Tuesday's meeting of the full
20-member European Commission would overrule Monti's Merger Task Force.
But EU officials confirmed on Friday that the majority of the EU executive would back Monti, although a couple of
Commissioners have asked him to explain his decision.

The aluminium firms have continued talking to the Commission right up to the eleventh hour, although sources said on Friday that despite their efforts, the Commission would only clear Alcan's purchase of Alusuisse.

The companies would then have to decide whether to come back later with a new plan to merge with Pechiney, including new concessions to deal with competition problems.

The proposed three-way merger, to form a group provisionally called APA, was filed for the Commission's review as two separate but simultaneous notifications, outlining plans for Alcan first to buy Alusuisse and then Pechiney.

Analysts believe the biggest problem facing the plan is the combined group's potential market share for sheet metal used to make beverage cans. APA would have around 45 percent of the European market for rolled aluminium products.

Two blockages on the same day would be a highly unusual development. The Commission has rejected just 11 mergers since 1990, when it became the one-stop clearing house for corporate alliances in the EU.

FOCUS-EU's Monti shows his mettle on mergers.

STRASBOURG, France, March 14 (Reuters) - The  European Union's antitrust chief on Tuesday showed the world he means business, taking the unprecedented step of blocking two high-profile mergers on the same day.

The European Commission backed EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's proposals to stop Swedish truckmaker Volvo buying its rival Scania, and blocked half of a proposed three-way merger in the aluminium industry.
While Monti gave the go-ahead to Canadian firm Alcan's buy of Switzerland's Alusuisse, he prevented France's
Pechiney from joining the deal, fearing the merged company would dominate certain markets.

Likewise, Monti judged that Volvo and Scania would together have a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region if they were allowed to get together.
His tough line raised eyebrows because it was the third merger Monti has blocked since taking the job in
September last year.

Before that, the Commission had blocked just 10 mergers since 1990, and had dealt with just 11 cases where companies had chosen to withdraw their merger notifications before the Commission had completed its investigations.

It is more usual for the Commission to set conditions, such as asset sales, before clearing problematic corporate alliances.
MONTI PLAYS IT DOWN
But Monti played down the significance of the events.

"We're simply showing a determined willingness to do our job. We have to judge whether or not a merger creates a dominant position on a particular market," he told reporters.

"We are convinced that competition policy has to be conducted in a very rigorous manner. We must take these decisions for the benefit of consumers but without making life too hard for our companies."
Monti admitted, however, that he was looking to "apply a more economic approach" to the vetting of mergers. The number of mergers notified to the Commission for its appraisal has spiralled in recent months.
Monti said his officials were working on two separate papers he hoped would give companies more guidance when considering what undertakings they should make to gain the Commission's green light for a merger.

He wants to set out more clearly how to define which markets to examine in considering the impact of a merger, and to give companies guidance on how and when to offer concessions to address competition concerns.

"This won't mean a blueprint, but at least they'll get to know in advance what the general view is on potential remedies," Monti said.

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Reuters) - Swedish truck and busmaker AB  Volvo said on Tuesday the  European
Union (EU) has rejected its 60.7 billion crown ($6.95 billion) planned acquisition of rival  Scania.

"I regret that the  EU Commission through today's decision is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market," Chief Executive Leif Johansson said in a statement.

"We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," said Johansson, who last week told a news conference that Volvo would consider any bid on the group.

Auto industry analysts have said Volvo could either take over another truck manufacturer or itself become a target if the Scania deal fell through.

Volvo's original offer to Scania shareholders was conditional on EU approval. As a result, "Volvo cannot complete the agreement to acquire Investor's holding in Scania nor the public offer to Scania shareholders," Johansson said.
Volvo said it and Scania would now study whether other forms of cooperation were possible, and in the short term
Volvo said it saw no need to divest its Scania stake. ($1=8.729 Swedish Crown).

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Reuters) -  Scania Chief Executive Leif Ostling said on Tuesday that work begun on integrating it and  Volvo was now discontinued, but this did not rule out long-term cooperation in non-strategic areas.

"Industrially,  Scania now continues to develop its business as an independent actor, irrrespective of the current ownership structure," Ostling said in a statement after the  European Union blocked a planned Volvo-Scania merger.

"Scania's owner structure is obviously an issue for our shareholders. But at the same time I must declare that the present uncertainty is not good for Scania. Long-term ownership stability is a necessity for Scania's continued development as a publicly-listed company," Ostling said.
The proposed merger would have made Volvo-Scania Europe's biggest heavy truckmaker.

The European Commission confirmed in Strasbourg on Tuesday that it had blocked the deal on competition grounds.

EU sources had said that Competition Commissioner Mario Monti considered that the Swedish tie-up would have created a monopoly in Sweden and a dominant position in the Nordic region. ((Tony Austin, Stockholm newsroom, +46-8-700 1003, fax +46-8-211601, stockholm.newsroom@reuters.com)).

STRASBOURG, France, March 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission said on Tuesday it had blocked plans by Swedish truckmaker  Volvo to buy rival Scania from Investor on competition grounds.

"The Commission concluded that the remedies proposed by  Volvo are insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of  Scania," the Commisisn said in a statement.

It voiced concerns the proposed merger could have created dominant positions in the markets for heavy trucks and city buses in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Ireland, touring coaches in Finland and Britain and intercity buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.

Volvo and the Swedish government argued the company's dominance in the Nordic region should be seen in the context of the wider European market, where it would only be a minority player.
Although the full 20-member Commission discussed the issue, Volvo's hoped EU Competition Commissioner
Mario Monti would be overruled by his colleagues were disappointed. ((Brussels newsroom, +322 287 6830, fax

He did not say at which level of shareholding  Volvo would have control, but  EU regulatory reviews of mergers in the past have shown this could be as low as 25 percent.

"On the present shareholding of Scania, Volvo can of course hold it (stake) as long as it does not give it control of Scania, otherwise that would be a consumation of the merger," Monti told a news conference in Strasbourg, France, also broadcast in Brussels.

STOCKHOLM, March 14 (Reuters) - Swedish shares ended mostly little changed on Tuesday, but truckmaker Volvo jumped seven percent after the  EU Commission's rejection of its bid for  Scania fuelled speculation it could be a takeover target.

The all-share General index ended 0.03 percent higher at 6,519.84 and the 30-share OMX index ended 0.02 percent up at 1,466.87 on below average turnover of 11.91 billion crowns.
Volvo, the second most traded share, ended 15.5 crowns higher at 236 after the expected announcement by the
EU rejecting its bid to create the world's second biggest truckmaker with Scania.

"I think Volvo will remain up here after today's rise," said one trader. "There is some scope for a rise as a possible bid could mean a good premium."
Scania shed eight crowns to 250.

Swedish shares failed to follow earlier positive signs on Wall Street, as investors doubted that the U.S. gains would hold. After the Stockholm close the Dow Jones industrial turned into negative territory.
Ericsson, as usual the most traded share, firmed two crowns to 850.

Among small cap Internet stocks, Framfab fell another 26 crowns to 238 while web casino operator Boss Media fell 34 crowns to 451 after a sell recommendation in daily Finanstidningen.
But another IT consultant Sigma rose 27 crowns to 267 after news it had become a priority supplier to Ericsson. AstraZeneca fell 10 crowns to 342.50 after Sweden's Medical Product Agency said its new drug Nexium was not
an improvement on its best-seller Losec. On Monday the agency gave the drug European approval.

The congress of the ruling Social Democratic party in Sweden made a statement regarding  European Union (EU)
competition policy practice on 12 March.

The congress issued the statement in relation to the proposal by  Volvo to buy Scania, which is expected to be rejected by the  EU competition watchdog today (14 March).

The statement issued by the congress said 'European competition policies must be fair. For the sake of employment and growth, it must be possible to create large and competitive industrial groups also in small countries.'

Volvo's acquisition of Scania is expected to give the combined group a market share of about 90% in Sweden and over 50% in other Nordic markets, but Volvo is arguing that the EU should be viewed as one common market in which Volvo would have less than 30% and still be behind DaimlerChrysler in the truck manufacturing market.

Germany's  Volkswagen to try again for Scania.

After the expected  EU veto of AB  Volvo's bid for  Scania AB, Germany's Volkswagen has another chance to achieve its long-term aim of gaining a presence in the medium-weight and heavy truck market. Since Volkswagen's chairman Ferdinand Piech decided that Volkswagen should be a full-line provider,  Scania has been first choice. Its first attempt to acquire  Scania in 1997 failed because the then major shareholder Investor AB demanded too high a price.  Scania would have cost over DM 10bn. Since then  Scania has not become cheaper. Based on its current share price it has a market value of some DM 12bn. The cost will be a large hurdle for Volkswagen.

Although Volkswagen has said nothing officially there is plenty of evidence that it is preparing to make a takeover bid for Scania. Sweden's second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer has always generated profits.

EU COMMISSION STOPS  VOLVO'S ACQUISITION OF  SCANIA

The EU Commission today rejected Volvo's application for competition approval of Volvo's proposed acquisition of Scania. This means that Volvo does not have the possibility to complete the acquisition of Investor's Scania shares and the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

"Together with Scania, we had the ambition to build an EU-based company with the best conceivable prospects to compete globally with the large players in the industry. I regret that the EU Commission, through today's decision, is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market", says Volvo's CEO Leif Johansson.

"Within Volvo, we must look ahead and move onward with the work to strengthen our global competitiveness, which includes continued investment and further development of our other business areas," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's current holding in Scania, which amounts to 30.6% of the votes and 45.5% of the capital, is not affected directly by the EU Commission's decision. The shares were acquired at an average price of SEK 266 per share, or a total of slightly more than SEK 24 billion. Volvo intends to retain this holding at this time. However, Volvo does not intend to request a position on Scania's Board of Directors.
"We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in
Scania", says Leif Johansson.

The EU Commission's decision means that the intended integration of Volvo and Scania will not be carried out. The companies will now evaluate whether other forms of future cooperation are possible.

"It is natural that many questions arise as a result of the EU Commission's decision. However, I hope that there is understanding for the fact that today we do not have definitive answers to all questions. We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives," continued Leif Johansson.

Volvo's offer to shareholders in Scania was conditional upon receipt of the necessary approval from the authorities for the acquisition of shares in Scania on terms acceptable to Volvo. As a result of the EU Commission's decision not to approve Volvo's acquisition of Scania, Volvo cannot complete the agreement to acquire Investor's holding in Scania nor the public offer to Scania's shareholders.

The shares tendered in the offer will be transferred back to the affected shareholders' VP-accounts as soon as possible, which is expected to occur on March 20, 2000. Additional information will be sent directly to the
affected shareholders.

"The Commission concluded that the remedies proposed by Volvo are insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of  Scania," the EC said in a communique.

The commission was concerned that the deal would give the merged company a dominant position in the heavy-trucks market in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

The resulting company would also have a dominant position in the sedan market in Finland and Britain, and in the intercity-bus market in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland, as well as the urban-bus market in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.

Analysts Upgrade Volvo,Scania On Bid Hopes >VOLVY SCVA

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Analysts are upgrading shares of AB Volvo (VOLVY) and  Scania AB (SCVA) on hopes that takeover bids for the two truckmakers may emerge after the European Union Commission blocked their proposed merger.

The shares will be helped by any signs that larger players will launch bids for the groups, analysts said Wednesday. The most likely suitors include Volkswagen AG (G.VOW) and Fiat SpA (FIA), while  Volvo itself may consider smaller takeovers.
"It's more a play on consolidation and not a play on industry fundamentals," said Kenneth Toll of Handelsbanken. Erik Kaellgren, an analyst at MeritaNordbanken in Stockholm, said he's upgrading Scania to a buy from neutral,
and keeping Volvo at a strong buy.
He said signs the two Swedish players will participate in industry consolidation should support share prices. Toll said merger hopes will prompt many of his fellow analysts to upgrade the Swedish pair and review their
valuations. He declined to comment directly on his rating plans for the two.

London-based JP Morgan analyst Ed Venables said: "We're in the process of looking at the numbers now." He didn't elaborate.

Some analysts changed their recommendations ahead of the Commission's official but anticipated rejection Tuesday of the merger. Nordic investment bank Carnegie raised Volvo to a buy from neutral late last week, according to market sources.

Scania shares fell 3.1% Tuesday but by 1338 GMT Wednesday were up SEK3.5, or 1.4%, at SEK253.5. After jumping 7% Tuesday on merger speculation, Volvo shares were down SEK3, or 1.3%, at SEK233.

Toll of Handelsbanken forecasts good upside potential for Scania shares longer term. Most analysts see solid support at around SEK245 shorter term. Volvo shares have the potential to reach SEK260 as speculation mounts, but any bid is expected to be at least SEK280 a share, analysts said.


Fiat, Volkswagen Seen Most Likely Suitors

Fiat, through its Iveco truck unit, and Volkswagen are considered the most likely suitors, and have expressed interest previously.

Anders Trapp, an automotive analyst with Enskilda Securities in Stockholm, said Volkswagen would probably favor a bid for Scania while Fiat focuses on Volvo. This is based on previous comments from both companies, he said.

A Fiat spokesman reiterated Tuesday that Fiat would be interested in Volvo's truck operations. "We've said before that we're interested, and nothing's changed," he said.

Scania and key shareholder Investor AB (S.INV) are unlikely to consider acquisitions, but Volvo is expected to target smaller players in the truck or construction equipment sectors, analysts said.

Volvo could eye Navistar International Inc. (NAV) of the U.S. or MAN AG (G.MAN) of Germany, for takeover, according to analysts. Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson will probably strive for a friendly merger after the Scania debacle, observers said.

In a telephone conference call following the E.U. ruling Tuesday, Johansson said: "I expect that we will now enter a phase when many different alternatives will be tried and our intention is to continue to be active."


It was likely the group would receive proposals and suggestions from other industry players, "and those will also be evaluated," he said.

Volvo said the European Commission blocked its $6-billion purchase of rival  Scania on concerns the combined company would have a dominant position in the Swedish and British markets for trucks. The ruling puts both truck makers back on the market where competitors are eyeing the Swedish name brands, though  Volvo said it doesn't plan to sell its 45.5%  Scania stake now. The commission opposed the purchase because the combined company would have 93% of the Swedish truck market, 50% of the Danish market and 40% of the British market.  Volvo asked to be judged on a  Europe-wide basis, where it would have 30% of the market for heavy trucks. It bid for Scania to expand its global truck market share after selling its car unit to Ford Motor Co.  Volvo's ADRs rose
$1.38 to close at $27.25 on Nasdaq.

Sea change forecast  in truck market after EU blocks  Volvo deal by Christopher Boian

English
(Copyright 2000)
STOCKHOLM, March 15 (AFP) -  EU rejection of a marriage between rival Swedish truckmakers  Volvo and Scania leaves both firms again playing the field in a sector set for ambitious consolidation, industry analysts said Wednesday.

The EU move, announced Tuesday, "signals the start of a free-for- all in the heavy truck industry" likely to end in foreign ownership of both companies, the independent daily Dagens Nyheter commented.

Both companies however remain competetive independently and are certain be high-stakes components -- either as predators or prey -- in a wave of mergers and acquisitions anticipated soon in the truck market, the analysts said.

"They are both strong, you can't get them at a bargain," said Mats Liss, automotive industry analyst with commercial bank Foereningsparbanken.

A potential buyer of either Volvo or Scania "will need to pay, and it's going to be a big pricetag" despite a recent slump in Volvo share values.

Analysts uniformly agree that accelerated mergers and acquisitions are on the agenda for the global truck industry, but views are mixed on whether companies like Volvo will be the hunters or the hunted in the process.

Among the companies known to be interested in full or partial acquisition of Volvo is Fiat of Italy, and Liss said a merger of Fiat's truckmaking subsidiary Iveco and Volvo would be accepted by the European Union.

"Iveco and Volvo would complement each other very well as Iveco is strong in some parts of Europe and Volvo in others," Liss said.

The EU Commission rejected the Volvo-Scania merger on the grounds the new entity would have an unfair lock on the Scandanavian truck and bus market.

But analysts noted Volvo had the means and the will to acquire all or key portions of firms such as US truck manufacturer Navistar and MAN of Germany.

"The stock market prefers mergers where you can see earnings synergies, complementary mergers," Liss explained, suggesting Volvo shareholders would welcome a carefully-calibrated acquisition in North America or Asia.

Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief executive, said Tuesday his company and its shareholders were open to financially interesting deals with anyone in any region.

"We can feel that we are in the driving seat when it comes to acquisitions," Johansson said in a telephone conference with reporters Tuesday.
"However, if we receive a good offer we will seriously take a look at them." cb/ss

Brussels, 14/03/2000 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission has banned the merger between the Swedish heavy goods vehicle makers Volvo and Scania.

Volvo A2 Rtg Affirmed On EC Block Of Scania Buy: S&P

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Standard & Poor's said Wednesday it affirmed its A2 short-term ratings on  Volvo AB (VOLVY) and guaranteed related entities.
This follows the  European Commission's rejection of the proposed deal between the Swedish truck-maker and
Scania AB, the ratings agency said in a press release.

"The group now faces much uncertainty regarding the future of its stake in Scania and of its external growth strategy," S&P said.

The rating on Volvo is supported by strong profitability, reflecting the geographically diversified market positions of its heavy truck and construction equipment businesses, it said.

"These businesses benefit from substantial penetration in major markets, up-to-date product lines, and - in the case of trucks - an above-industry-average degree of component commonality," S&P said.
The rating is constrained by the current degree of uncertainty with respect to Volvo's future strategic decisions;
the high capital intensity and volatile sales of Volvo's heavy truck and construction equipment businesses; and the
smaller size of its construction equipment operations compared with those of the two global market leaders, S&P
said.

Volvo intends to keep its stake in Scania despite the fact that the  EU commission would not approve a merger between the two companies. Volvo said it would evaluate other forms of co-operation with  Scania, as well as assessing other strategic alliances.

However, Volvo shares rose by SKr 15.50 to SKr 239 on the  EU commission's decision. The stock market regards Volvo as a likely candidate for a takeover and expects bids to amount to between SKr 340 and SKr 350 per share. The price of  Scania shares, on the other hand, fell SKr 8 to SKr 250.

EC has no truck with Volvo merger

VOLVO'S planned merger with rival Swedish truck and bus maker  Scania has been rejected by the  European
Commission.

Volvo's chief executive Leif Johansson said he regretted the decision, which he said seemed "to go against the basic concept of the common market".
Volvo currently holds 45.5 per cent of Scania and will hold on to its stake.

The EC launched a review of the planned takeover in October after it expressed concerns that the GBP 4.3 billion merger would strengthen the company's already dominant position in the truck and bus market.

The EC voiced concerns that the proposed merger could have created dominant positions in a number of markets: these included heavy trucks and city buses in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Ireland; touring coaches in Finland and the UK; and intercity buses in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland.

Volvo fails in #4.6bn bid for Scania.

Swedish truck and busmaker  Volvo failed yesterday in its #4.6 billion atte mpt to take over rival  Scania.

Volvo could not get the acquisition through the  EU and the company now finds itself in a position where it could be a victim of a takeover.
Although the full 20-member Commission discussed the issue, Volvo hoped EU Competition Commissioner Mario
Monti would be overruled by his colleagues ... but were disappointed.

Chief executive of Volvo, Leif Johansson, said: 'I regret the EU Commission is stopping these plans for reasons that seem to go against the basic concept of the common market.
'We must now evaluate the other possible alternatives.'
Last week Mr Johansson said Volvo would consider any bid for the group.

Automotive industry analysts have said Volvo could either take over another truck manufacturer like MAN or itself become a target if the Scania deal fell through.
Volvo's original offer to Scania shareholders - the company is majority owned by Swedish investment group
Investor - was conditional on EU approval.

'Volvo cannot complete the agreement to acquire Investor's holding in Scania nor the public offer to Scania shareholders,' said Mr Johansson.

Volvo said it and Scania would now study whether other forms of co-operation were possible, and in the short term Volvo said it saw no need to divest its minority Scania stake.

The Commission said it had concluded the remedies proposed by Volvo were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Scania.

European regulators block deals involving Volvo, aluminum companies

PARIS -  European antitrust regulators took some of their most strenuous action against big corporate mergers on Tuesday, blocking a planned $7 billion purchase by  Volvo of the rival Swedish truck maker  Scania and forcing three large aluminum companies to withdraw their proposed $17 billion combination.

The moves by the  European Union's competition commission are not expected to slow the pace of global consolidation in the automotive and aluminum industries. However, they reflected the rigorous standards set by Mario Monti, the chief  European antitrust regulator, who in his six months on the job has taken a far more aggressive position than his predecessors in examining the impact of mergers on competition.

In rejecting a combination of Volvo and Scania, announced last year, Monti said, such a merger would dominate the Scandinavian market and hold a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden. Leif Johansson, Volvo's chief executive, said the decision appeared to "go against the basic concept of the common market."

Fears about opposition from Monti also led the aluminum companies Alcan Aluminium of Canada and Pechiney of France to withdraw a proposal for a three-way merger with Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland. The regulators said that they would accept a combination of just Alcan and Alusuisse, but that a three-way deal including Pechiney would have to be modified.

STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Reuters) - Scaniamade clear on Wednesday that its cooperation with arch-rival  Volvo towards a merger of the two Swedish truckmakers ended when the  European Commission vetoed the project on Tuesday.

"The integration committee's preparatory work on various projects is discontinued immediately,"  Scania said in a statement. "Scania is now formally requesting the return of all material and information in  Volvo's possession."
Magnus Hahn, Scania's acting director of information, took exception to comments a Volvo executive made to
Reuters earlier on Wednesday.

Jonas Wintzell, vice president of Volvo's Investor Relations, had said: "Volvo is having a look at Scania and seeing what areas we could cooperate on and what savings that could bring."
But Hahn said this did not accord with the new situation.

"After the preparatory work has stopped, I do not rule out that a discussion about cooperation in certain non-strategic areas may be taken up. But that's something for the future," he said in a statement.
Scania's chief executive, Leif Ostling, had opposed the Volvo takeover for business reasons.

Volvo holds 30.6 percent of the votes and 45.5 percent of the share capital in Scania. "In the short term we see no need to divest our shares in Scania," chief executive Leif Johansson said on Tuesday after the European Union rejected the merger.

Volvo bought its Scania shares at an average of 266 crowns per share. At present the B-stock is trading 3.0 crowns higher on the day at 253 crowns and the A-shares up seven at 251.

ANALYSIS-"Good for Volvo...and  Sweden"  era ends.

STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Reuters) -  EU rejection of  Volvo's plan to take over rival truckmaker  Scania may signal the end of an era when "what is good for  Volvo is good for Sweden".

Swedish politicians condemned Tuesday's veto by the  European Union's Commission, saying the ruling made it impossible for firms like  Volvo in small countries to become big players on the  European stage.

Others said it marked the end of a time when the interests of Volvo and other big companies were synonymous with Sweden's.

"It looks as if the political view of backing big companies in Sweden is at present still predominant," Nils Wahl, a lecturer in European law at Stockholm University, told Reuters.

"But if you represent the interests of Volvo as those of Sweden you sublimate the consumer's need for price competition. That is an outdated concept," he added.

Mats Hallgren, a columnist with the daily Svenska Dagbladet, added that the EU decision "may have drawn the line under an epoch in Swedish postwar economic history.

"Up till now there has been an unwritten contract between big companies and the government whereby they could dominate the home market and use it as a springboard for overseas expansion," Hallgren wrote.
"But EU membership has introduced new competition rules."

The Commission stopped the merger saying it could have created dominant positions for Volvo-Scania heavy trucks and buses in the Nordic countries, and in some other markets.
"We must consider how these competition rules hit countries like Sweden and the Netherlands," Prime Minister
Goran Persson said, adding that the Swedish market for trucks was only 3,500 vehicles per year.

Industry Minister Bjorn Rosengren added: "I think in this case far too much attention was paid to companies' national market shares, considering that it's not here in Sweden where the battle for truck market share will be fought."

EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom, from Sweden, did not oppose the Commission's decision in Strasbourg but said later: "I regret the deal did not go through, even if I do not question the legal justification of the veto."

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti denied that small countries would always lose out in competition questions.

"There is the example of Holland where some companies have become big in Europe without dominating their home market," Monti said in an interview with Swedish Radio on Wednesday.
TOO MANY COOKS?
Under the leadership of Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo became Sweden's number one blue-chip company.



Page 131 of 133 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Its estate cars were a reassuring symbol of safety in European and North American cities, and the core company made brief forays into the food, pharmaceuticals and even oil sectors.
The tide began to turn against Volvo in 1993 when Gyllenhammar's boldest ambition - a merger with France's
Renault-collapsed amid acrimony, and Gyllenhammar left.

Current chief executive Leif Johansson sold Volvo's car division to Ford in 1999 and, as well as concentrating on trucks through the Scania move, has started building up a strategic stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors.

Johansson's own position may be in jeopardy if he does not come up with a viable Plan B for Volvo, some analysts said.
"There's a lot of cooks who have spoiled this broth," Swedish MEP Inger Schorling said.

"Volvo behaved arrogantly. How could it promise to change Swedish laws on truck cabin safety, for example," she said, referring to one of the many concessions which Volvo made in an attempt to win EU approval.
Christer Karlsson, professor of industrial production at the Stockholm School of Economics, recalled that when
Volvo sold its cars to Ford, a separate company was set up to protect the Volvo brand name.

This could be relevant in view of the latest consolidation in the global vehicle industry, a cross-shareholding between GM and Fiat.

"The brand company is led by Johansson and Ford chief executive Jacques Nasser. We could imagine Ford bidding for the rest of Volvo if it wanted to protect it against GM and Fiat," Karlsson said.

STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Reuters) -  Volvo said on Wednesday it would keep its large minority stake in  Scania
for both financial and strategic reasons.

"Obviously the shareholding in  Scania is strategically important when you look at what may happen in the various groupings in Europe over the next few years," Jonas Wintzell, vice-president of  Volvo's Investor Relations, told Reuters.

Volvo holds 30.6 percent of the votes and 45.5 percent of the share capital in Scania. "In the short term we see no need to divest our shares in Scania," Chief Executive Leif Johansson said on Tuesday after the European Union rejected Volvo's proposed merger with Scania.

Volvo bought its Scania shares at an average of 266 crowns per share. At present the B-stock is trading 3.5 crowns higher on the day at 253.5 crowns and the A-shares up eight at 252.

"The Scania stake is of strategic importance for the remoulding of the truck industry. That does not mean it's a long-term stake," Wintzell said. ((Barbara Taltavull, Reuters Ekonominytt, 08-7001019, fax 08-211601, barbara.taltavull@reuters.com)).
