GE says new Honeywell  offer makes "no sense" for shareholders
178 words
29 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, June 29 (AFP) - General Electric  chairman Jack Welch said Friday that an offer by  Honeywell  to reduce its acquisition price in an effort to win EU approval  for the merger makes "no sense" for shareholders of both companies.

Honeywell  chairman Michael Bonsignore earlier in the day offered to cut the acquisition price as part of a package to make additional divestitures to satisfy concerns of the  European Commission, which is balking at the merger.

But Welch said such a move would make no sense in strategic terms, because it would require the merged company to give up too many assets.

In an open letter to Bonsignore, Welch said the new Honeywell proposal would present the same problems as the proposals by the European Commission.
"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," Welch said.

"The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Honeywell  offers to drop GE deal bid price in exchange for concessions
403 words
29 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, June 29 (AFP) - Honeywell  said Friday it offered to reduce its acquisition price if  General Electric
made concessions to win EU approval  for the merger of the two industrial conglomerates.

Honeywell  said it offered to drop its bid price in the deal to 1.01  Honeywell  shares for each GE Honeywell
share, down from a prior ratio of 1.055  Honeywell  shares.
The offer would reduce the acquisition price by about 1.5 billion dollars, making the deal worth some 40 billion. The company said the reduction in the shares ratio will require the approval of Honeywell shareholders.
There was no immediate comment from GE.

Honeywell said the concessions it asked GE to make included the divestiture sought by the EU of 2.2 billion dollars in GE holdings, as well as the sale of a 19.9 percent stake in GE's aviation capital services unit.
The offer came from Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore in a letter to GE chief executive
Jack Welch.

Honeywell said that Bonsignore's letter read: "In light of our mutual desire to have the merger accounted for as pooling of interests and the pending termination of pooling under applicable accounting standards, we must move quickly.
"Indeed, we must amend the merger agreement and announce any change in the exchange ratio no later than
Saturday."

Bonsignore said Honeywell's new bid price ratio offer as well as its demand that GE make concessions followed discussions with EU Commissioner Mario Monti.
Bonsignore's letter said that both Honeywell and GE had hoped that the EU would accept fewer divestitures if GE
offered to divest a minority holding in its aviation capital services unit.

He also said the two companies recently offered to make divestitures equally for 1.1 billion dollars in revenues along with an aviation capital services unit.
But he said these concession offers were not made in a timely manner.

"The commissioner told us yesterday, however, that the limited time available to him was not sufficient to consider adequately the new divestiture package.

"Unfortunately, the delay in offering the aviation capital services unit solution until June 28 has limited the commission's ability to undertake its necessary review and therefore a more complete alternative is the only possible effective solution that will satisfy the commission," Bonsignore wrote.

28/06/2001 (Agence Europe) - According to sources close to the issue, GE has reportedly proposed a last minute compromise to the European Commission in the hope of seeing its merger with Honeywell  accepted, a  merger that the  European Executive is preparing to block. The concessions would focus on the Gecas subsidiary, the stumbling block that had hampered discussions. The spokesperson for  Commissioner Monti confirmed that new discussions were under way between the  Commission and the parties, but left little hope that the decision would be deferred until after 12 July (which would have given the Americans more time to adjust their new proposals), stressing that the timetable for review of the mergers was "binding". "The decision is awaited for next week ...",
she replied to questions.

Companies: GE and Honeywell  Seek EU Approval Through  Stake Sale --- Proposal  Attempts to Reduce
Divestitures of Avionics Units
By staff reporters Matt Murray, Philip Shishkin And Laurie P. Cohen

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc., in an 11th-hour effort to dissuade European regulators from rejecting their proposed $42 billion (48.81 billion euros) merger, offered to sell a minority stake in GE's aviation-financing unit in exchange for fewer divestitures of Honeywell's  avionics businesses, according to people familiar with the situation.
However, GE's negotiators were still uncertain Thursday night whether the new proposal -- in which GE would sell
19.9% of Capital Aviation Services to noncompetitors -- would satisfy the  European Commission's merger task
force.

On its surface, the proposal was crafted to appease some of the commission's concerns regarding the deal, particularly about GE Capital Aviation Services. The commission has argued that the aircraft-finance unit, a large purchaser of airplanes, unfairly pressures manufacturers to buy GE products. In earlier negotiations, the commission had urged a structural change to the unit, such as selling a 20% stake to the public, or even selling a stake to competitors, ideas at which GE balked.

The question is whether the latest offer is a satisfying enough change for the commission's regulators. The new proposal, which was presented during meetings between GE and Honeywell lawyers and staffers of the commission's merger task force, would fall short of a public sale of a stake in the unit.

GE concessions may save deal - General Electric  - Takeover - Honeywell  Internati  onal.

THE European Commission is under mounting pressure to delay its decision to block  General Electric's  $41 billion ( #29 billion) takeover of  Honeywell  International after the American conglomerate offered new concessions in an eleventh-hour attempt to save the deal from collapse.

Brussels's top civil servants will decide today whether to press ahead with a decision to include the  merger on the agenda for a regular gathering of the 20  European commissioners next Tuesday, as currently scheduled.

Today's meeting of the Commission's chefs de cabinet, normally a formal occasion, has been given political significance after GE offered to meet Europe's concerns by selling part of its aircraft leasing arm.
Jack Welch, GE's chairman and chief executive, is understood to have spoken directly to Mario Monti, the
European Competition Commissioner, over the past two days.

GE Says Offer Doesn't Make Sense

BY ALAN CLENDENNING AP Business Writer

Copyright 2001 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
NEW YORK (AP) - General Electric  Co. said last minute concessions proposed by Honeywell  International to save their multibillion dollar merger would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by Europeanregulators.

Honeywell  offered Friday to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy antitrust concerns by the European Commission that threatened to derail the deal.
But GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said the offer falls short of what regulators want.

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he responded in a letter to Honeywell's CEO. "The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."
Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said spokesman
Tom Crane.

An earlier proposal criticized by EU regulators is expected to be considered by the Commission next week, but analysts predicted it would be turned down.

"We thought it was dead. It still looks dead," said Kent Newcomb, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission.
"We're not optimistic of approval," Binns said.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore, said in a letter to Welch outlining the offer. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."
EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to comment on the letter.
Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti late Thursday turned down
GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, sources close
to the deal said Friday.



Page 10 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS fell short because it didn't change the structure of its control of
GECAS' purchasing policy, said an EU commission source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Monti's office fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, leading eventually to higher prices.

Monti has said the Commission would likely vote on the deal at a meeting Tuesday, although his spokeswoman, Amelia Torres, said Friday that the final agenda had not yet been adopted. The commission must act before July
12 or the deal is automatically approved.

The deal won conditional antitrust clearance in Washington in May, but its tortured path in Europe has raised concern among Bush administration officials. Some in Congress have even accused the EU of protectionism and threatened retaliation.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, Torres said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The closest the EU ever came to blocking a U.S. deal that had been approved in Washington was in 1997 under Monti's predecessor, Karel van Miert, who risked a trade war with the United States by holding up Boeing's $15 billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas.

While President Bill Clinton and top aides worked the phones, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution declaring that EU disapproval would be unwarranted interference in an American business transaction.

The day before the Commission met to vote, Boeing made a new offer that included an agreement to loosen its exclusive contracts to sell planes to three major U.S. airlines - enough to secure tentative EU approval at the meeting. The full Commission approved it the following week.
GE share rose 13 cents Friday to close at $49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Honeywell shares dropped
$3.30, or 8.6 percent, to $34.90, also on the NYSE.

GE, Honeywell  Make New Offer to EU --- Companies  Propose to Sell up to 20% of a Unit to Save Merger ---
Commission Is Unlikely  to Make Its Final Decision  on Tuesday

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc., in an 11th-hour effort to dissuade European regulators
from rejecting their proposed $42 billion  merger, offered to sell a minority stake of up to 20% of GE's
aviation-financing unit to noncompetitors in exchange for fewer divestitures of  Honeywell's  avionics businesses,
according to people familiar with the situation.

On its surface, the proposal was crafted to appease some of the European Commission's expressed concerns regarding the deal, particularly about  GE Capital Aviation Services. The commission has argued that the
aircraft-finance unit, a large purchaser of airplanes, unfairly pressures manufacturers to buy  GE products. In earlier negotiations, the  commission had urged a structural change to the unit, such as selling a 20% stake to the public, or even selling a stake to competitors, ideas at which  GE balked.

The question is whether the latest offer is a satisfying enough change for the European Union competition officials. The new proposal, which was presented during meetings between GE and Honeywell lawyers and staffers of the commission's Merger Task Force in Brussels, would fall short of a public sale of a stake in the unit.

It also wouldn't involve GE competitors as stakeholders, people familiar with the proposal said. Likely holders of the stake GE proposed selling might include financial institutions, as an example, these people said. In addition, the board of the unit would add outside directors proportionate to the stake, they said.

The revised GE offer, the fruit of several days of discussions between the companies, also would be contingent on fewer divestitures of Honeywell avionics businesses than the ones GE previously had proposed selling off, which had combined annual sales of about $2.2 billion, these people said. Honeywell's total annual sales are around $25 billion, with its aerospace units accounting for about 40% of that.

People close to the commission said the body is unlikely to make its final decision on Tuesday, as it needs more time to evaluate the legal details of the new proposal. The commission's deadline to decide on the case is July
12, but EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti recently said that Tuesday is the likely date for reaching a decision. A commission spokeswoman also reiterated Thursday that Tuesday is the expected date for a decision.

But people close to the commission said it will have to delay the decision to allow sufficient time for a proper review of GE's proposal. "The deal has to go through inter-service consultations and then to the EU member state advisory committee," these people said. "They are rapidly running out of time to do that."

They said that if Mr. Monti decides that GE's proposal came too late, it would be an easy way of blocking the deal, but he would have to face the political consequences. "If he says no and pushes it through (Tuesday) you can say goodbye to U.S.-EU merger review convergence," the people said.
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday, Honeywell shares were up 80 cents at
$37, while GE shares were down 53 cents at $48.26. Both movements suggested that the market sees better
prospects for the deal to be completed. Midday Thursday, Honeywell had gained 5.3%, or $1.95, to $38.95, while
GE was up 13 cents at $48.39.

Analysis: GE-Honeywell  merger may fall through
1,062 words
29 June 2001

RON INSANA, co-anchor: While the drama of technology vs. technology was playing itself out on the Nasdaq market, one of the most ambitious and dramatic blue-chip mergers ever was falling apart.  GE Chairman Jack Welch sent a message to his Honeywell  counterpart, saying Honeywell's  last-minute concessions were not enough to save the merger from rejection by European regulators. After tracking close to each other for
months, the prices of GE and Honeywell  shares suddenly veered apart, today taking widely different courses.  GE
finished up a modest amount on the day, while  Honeywell  plunged.
Our David Faber has covered this  merger from its original proposal--even before--through its problems in  Europe
and up to its apparent fate today. He joins us now with the latest details.
Anything new late this evening, David? DAVID FABER reporting:
You know, we haven't really heard or I haven't heard, at last, from a lot of my sources close to Honeywell at this point, Ron, so not too much in terms of a new update, except Honeywell's earlier statement that it was disappointed with GE's response. Honeywell's last-ditch attempt, of course, to get GE to make the EU happy was met with a stern rebuke by GE, despite the promise of a $1.6 billion cut in the price that GE would have to pay for Honeywell.

So, for now, the two parties continue to have a merger agreement, and they do continue to wait the July 3rd meeting of the EU, in which it will vote on GE's first set of concessions to the EU. Now those concessions made on June 14th were the divestiture of businesses with $2.2 billion in revenues and GE's promise to get up GE Capital Aviation Services as a separate ringed-fence entity, although GE would continue to own 100 percent of it. The EU, though, expected to reject those concessions and that would represent the final end for the hopes for
this acquisition of Honeywell by GE.

A Honeywell spokesman has said, only, as I said, it's disappointed with GE's decision of today. Now it's unclear whether Honeywell will send GE one last plea, perhaps, in the form of a letter in which it might ask it to reconsider and employ its continued best efforts to get this deal done. Might have thought that letter would have already
been sent today. And it has not yet been, at least as far as I've been able to determine. If that plea does come, though, it would probably fall on deaf ears. GE has made clear it will not accept a remedy that calls for the previous divestitures and the sale of 19.9 percent of GE Capital Aviation Services to a party of Mario Monti's choosing. Now Monti, of course, the EU Competition Committee chairman. GE is adamant in its position that he wants that stake in GECAS sold to a competitor such as Rolls-Royce or Pratt & Whitney. And GE is simply unwilling to do that.

(Unintelligible) stations of late have led to questions about whether it really wanted to do the deal or, at least, while it may have wanted to, certainly got cold feet in recent days. Honeywell's own--own advisers, although they might have reason to do so, have told me they're not that sure what GE's been thinking. GE is the parent of this network and it has made efforts this week to get the EU to agree to a new set of concessions, but, Ron, there, as well, the EU said, `We don't think that would be quite enough.'

INSANA: So, David, what's the timetable here? Is it July 3rd, where the EU will come out and say something officially, or is it July 12th?
FABER: It is July 3rd, as of now. INSANA: Yeah.
FABER: It could become July 12th. That is the final, last day that the EU has to approve any deal, but it is scheduled to meet, the Competition Committee, on July 3rd, Ron, and it could be there that they formally reject

the--the pro--the--the prophec--the--what they have put forward. Excuse me. It's been a long day--what they have put forward. And that would be e--the official end of the deal.

International Shares: EU Set To Veto GE Merger

Jack Welch should have known it. If  General Electric's  $44bn (GBP31bn) merger with Honeywell  was a big enough deal to postpone his retirement, it was certainly big enough to worry the European Commission. After weeks of deliberating, the  EU is about to veto the merger on anti-competitive grounds. The stumbling block is GE's aircraft leasing unit, GECAS. European regulators fear that GE, which makes over half the world's aircraft engines, will use GECAS to extend its domination to avionics, where Honeywell  is strong. GE offered to sell businesses worth $2.2bn and separate the accounts of its plane leasing unit from the parent, GE Capital, but refused further concessions. That wasn't enough for Mario  Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner.

Some say the EU is a brave anti-trust warrior. The less charitable accuse it of acting in the interests of GE's competitors. Listening to US politicians and analysts, you would think it was the latter. "This is typical protectionist Europe. It's all about saving European companies that wouldn't survive on their own," insists Tom Burnett, at
New-York based Merger Insight. "GE was willing to divest assets 10 times more than what the US Justice
Department demanded."

Not quite, say industry insiders. According to one analyst, players on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the GE/Honeywell combination - but not because of worries about the market share in engines and avionics. The concern is that in bundling products with financing, competition may be stifled.

The EU clearly doesn't want to spoil relations with Washington over the issue. The members have already asked Mr Monti to keep negotiating right up to the 12 July decision day. But unless GE relents the merger looks doomed. That would force Honeywell to go it alone - or look elsewhere. United Technologies, parent of Pratt & Whitney, may just be the right place.

Brussels Supports Commissioner's Stand Against  Proposed  GE-HoneywellMerger

Brussels announced yesterday that it backed Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's stand against the proposed merger of American giants GE and Honeywell,  and in doing so raised the spectre of a full-scale trade row between America and the European Union.

Americans cannot understand how a  European body can block what they see as a domestic combination of two US businesses. They are largely unaware that there is a precedent for such action -- the US authorities blocked a proposed merger between two Swedish pharmaceutical companies not long ago.

They wonder whether Monti is simply a loose cannon or whether there is some darker political agenda. The answer is a bit of both. Monti is probably the most able of the current crop of commissioners but his academic background can make him a purist -- prone to too much rigorous logic and not enough pragmatism. But that makes it very unlikely that he would make a decision like this on political lines. However, many in Europe feel strongly that the Continent needs to bolster its defences against American business and cultural imperialism and they welcome Monti's stand.

Some political and business leaders are quietly enjoying the derailment of the American boom. It vindicates to some extent the slower, more restrained approach to growth of the euro-zone and has brought at least temporary respite from Americans telling them to liberalise their markets and get more like the US. And there is little inclination to help President Bush following his rejection of the Kyoto protocol on global warming.

But the real reason this deal has run into trouble is that US and European competition policies have a different focus. The Americans judged the merger on the effect it would have on the consumer while Monti considered the effect on competing businesses. The deal could be damaging to businesses like Rolls-Royce, which competes with GE in aero engines.

The danger is that reasonable objections will lead to unreasonable actions. The Europeans look unlikely to back down and so does GE's Jack Welch. The deal could well fail, with a consequent souring of trade relations between the two blocs. That is bad news at any time but doubly so in times of economic slowdown. This far away merger of which we know little could yet have a bad effect on us all.

EU Spurns GE's Plan to Save Honeywell  Bid

BRUSSELS --  General Electric  Co.'s last-minute proposal to Europeanregulators to win approval  of the company's $46-billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. was rejected, sources familiar with the situation said Thursday.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti is poised to scuttle the transaction when the commission meets next week, a move that would mark the first time the  European Union has acted alone to kill a merger. A rejection would be a blow to  General Electric  Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch, who delayed retirement to oversee the company's largest-ever acquisition.

Welch, who balked two weeks ago at making more concessions, had proposed selling a stake of about 20% in GE's plane-leasing unit to a financial services firm, sources familiar with the offer had said. An earlier offer to divest aerospace businesses with $2.2 billion in sales was scaled back as part of the latest proposal, the sources had said.

"Sounds like it's over," said Tim Ghriskey, a money manager at Dreyfus Corp., which holds shares in both companies.

The EU has said it plans to block the purchase because of concern General Electric would dominate the market for jet engines and airplane electronics. Although the modified offer addressed some of the EU's concerns, including how plane-leasing unit GE Capital Aviation Services is managed, antitrust experts and analysts said the offer by the largest company by market value didn't go far enough.
The purchase has received tentative approval from U.S. and Canadian regulators. Document latm000020010712dx6t011c6

AVIONICS - COMMISSION DEFENDS STANCE ON GE-HONEYWELL CASE.
877 words
30 June 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
A robust defence of the  European Commission's stance on the  General Electric-Honeywell (GE) merger deal was made in a letter to Senator John Rockefeller, Chairman of the US Senate Aviation Subcommittee, on June
26. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti and Vice-President of the European Commission Loyola de Palacio were replying to a letter of June 19 from the Senator who suggested that the Commission's investigation into the  merger was "driven principally by a desire to protect  European aerospace companies from strengthened but legitimate US  competition."

While noting that his letter echoed political concerns of some in the US the Commissioners replied that "We would like to reassure you that the concerns to which you refer about the operation of the European Union's merger control rules are wholly unfounded. Our  competition policy, whether in relation to mergers or anti-trust matters more generally, is firmly based on the fundamental principle of non-discrimination."

The Commissioner's letter stated that the EU's Competition officers applied the same test of market dominance to all of the investigations that they had carried out for over 10 years (see separate article in Section V on Transatlantic competition co-operation). "The nationalities of the companies and political considerations have played and will play no role in the examination of this proposed transaction. Recent attempts to politicise the Commission's review process are consequently entirely misplaced."

Mr Monti and Mrs de Palacio then said that the Commission's track record "speaks for itself". and refer to an annexe of decisions taken (see table below). "We think that these figures clearly demonstrate that the number of US companies that may have had to either withdraw/abort their transactions, or to submit undertakings as a result of competition concerns raised by the Commission has authorised the acquisition by US firms of a number of leading European companies." The Commissioners pointed out that the Commission had recently in the
aerospace sector cleared the recent deals between Boeing and Hughes and Raytheon and Thales "without imposing conditions". Whereas the Commission demanded restructuring of the mergers that led to the correction of EADS and Astrium.Of the GE-Honeywell deal Mr Monti and Mrs de Palacio said, "Let us underline that this proposed merger has raised strong concerns among suppliers and customers ie airlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Several US firms have complained and have taken an active role at a hearing organised by the Commission at the end of May. By contrast, and contrary to what has been said, large aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have not been particularly active in the proceedings."

In answer to the accusation by Senator Rockefeller that the Commission is using "legal theories that have little basis in practice" it replied that it is not applying novel, outdated or fancy theories to the investigation. "Contrary to what has been misleading reported, bundling is not the central issue in the Commission's analysis of this merger. Bundling is only one of the competitive concerns that the Commission has identified on some of the relevant aerospace markets. Indeed, the various concerns identified by the Commission mainly stem from horizontal overlaps on some markets and the foreclosure effect that is likely to result from the combination of GE's already dominant position on engines for large commercial aircraft, financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft financing, purchasing and leasing with Honeywell's leading position in avionics and non-avionics.In response to Senator Rockefeller's claim that is demanding draconian remedies the Commission claims that "it was willing to settle the case with a remedy proposal that would have limited the divestiture of Honeywell aerospace products to below what GE has actually fromally proposed. The only condition would have to combine these limited
aerospace divestitures with the implementation of a structural undertaking on Gecas (General Electric Capital Aviation Services), without putting in question the control by GE".The two Commissioners end the letter by saying that in general the Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission work well together and "convergence (on competition policy) remains a welcome development.

Latest developments.Despite an offer, on June 28, by GE to sell a 19.9% stake in its subsidiary Gecas it looks likely that the offer is a case of too little too late and that the Commission is still expected to block the deal at its
Page 18 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
meeting of July 3. It is understood the Commission believes that the offer made by GE on June 14 did not come near what it thought was necessary. The subsequent bid by GE to change the Commission's mind still apparently falls short and there is unlikely to be a coming together of parties. According to media reports Mr Monti had wanted GE to sell part of Gecas to rivals Rolls-Royce plc or Pratt & Whitney, both airplane engine manufacturers. With time running out it has been revealed that the current rounds of negotiations in Brussels are being led by GE's legal representatives and not company staff. Although there still is possibly time for a deal to be done it is looking more and more likely that the Commission will halt the merger.

EU/US - MONTI URGES RESTRAINT AFTERMATH OF GE-HONEYWELL DECISION.
470 words
30 June 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
The strain on the relationship between the  competition authorities in the European Union and United States by the General Electric-Honeywell merger was a theme touched on by Competition Commissioner Mario Monti in a speech on June 26. Speaking to an audience at the  EU Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce's annual conference on  competition issues, he stressed the need for co-operation between the  Commission and the Department of Justice and Federal Trade  Commission (FTC). He also said it was important not to allow technical points of the proposed  merger to become charged by politics in the US in particular (see previous
edition of  European Report).

"Co-operation between the US and the European Union works well in merger cases. Commission staff are in daily contact with Department of Justice and the FTC," said Mr Monti. "We are proud of this achievement and we have seen the co-operation between the competition authorities greatly increase in the past two years."Mr Monti admitted that there were differences on either side of the Atlantic on how authorities deal with merger cases, but this was due to differences in history and legal precedent. "Europe was a student of US antitrust law until 40
years ago and the creation of the Treaty of Rome," he said. "There has been a convergence in how the authorities deal with merger cases and this process is to be encouraged. Only a year ago the two US agencies and the EU set up a working group and this largely reports on remedies to issues on either side of the Atlantic. It is planned that the working group will shift its attention to dealing with oligopolies soon."Mr Monti also pointed out
how the relationship between the US and the EU was the bedrock for discussion at the World Trade Organisation on the creation of a Global Competition Forum. "The Global Competition Forum will allow competition authorities from around the world to have a systematic and intensive dialogue, which will bring about a convergence in approach without the Herculean effort required for harmonisation," Mr Monti said. "By encouraging a competition culture around the world we can help give more confidence to new national competition authorities."Despite the possible fallout over the Commission's decision on the GE-Honeywell case in Washington Mr Monti plans to continue building bridges with his US counterparts. "There is a desire to maintain the close contacts with the US's antitrust decision-makers. I intend to continue the dialogue I have had over the past two years," he said. "It seems that US-EU competition authorities relationship is like a fairly strong marriage in which important and difficult issues can be raised without both parties heading towards the divorce courts."

BRUSSELS, June 30 (Reuters) - General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc were on Saturday
'actively considering' abandoning their proposed merger and withdrawing their application for  approval  of the
merger from the European Commission, a source close to the situation said.
The 20-member Commission has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether the  merger meets the restrictions of
EU rules.
All sides expect the Commission not to approve the transaction.

On Friday GE Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch rejected a last-minute suggestion by his counterpart at Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, to slash $1.7 billion from GE's price tag to compensate GE for extra divestitures in order to win approval from the EC for the merger.

Based on GE's closing share price on Friday, the value of deal - including Honeywell's last ditch offer - would have been $39.9 billion.

The 20-member Commission has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether the  merger meets the restrictions of

All sides expect the Commission not to approve the transaction but should the companies withdraw their proposal no vote will take place.

On Friday final glimmers of hope that the deal would go through faded as GE Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch rejected a last-minute suggestion by his counterpart at Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, to slash $1.7 billion from GE's price tag to compensate GE for extra divestitures in order to win approval from the EC for the merger.
A source close to the situation said then that GE had no plans to negotiate further with European regulators. Louise Binns, a spokeswoman for GE, declined comment.
Shares of financially troubled Honeywell sank on the news of the exchange between Welch and Bonsignore, dropping $3.21, or 8.4 percent, to close at $34.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, their lowest close since October 18, five days before the deal with GE was announced. GE shares fell 12 cents to $48.75.

Based on GE's closing share price on Friday, the value of deal - including Honeywell's last ditch offer - would have been $39.9 billion.

GE rejects Honeywell  price cut

NEW YORK - General Electric  Co. said last-minute concessions proposed by Honeywell  International to save their multibillion-dollar merger would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by Europeanregulators.

Honeywell  offered Friday to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy antitrust concerns by the European Commission that threatened to derail the deal.
But GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said the offer falls short of what regulators want.

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he responded in a letter to Honeywell's CEO. "The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."
Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said spokesman
Tom Crane.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission.
"We're not optimistic of approval," Binns said.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay, decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.
The new Honeywell proposal would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff. Document saen000020010713dx6u00j3u

GE rejects Honeywell's attempt to save merger --- Concessions not enough to satisfy  antitrust concerns

General Electric  Co. said last-minute concessions proposed by Honeywell  International to save their multi-billion-dollar  merger would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by European regulators.

Honeywell  offered yesterday to reduce  GE's takeover price by $1 billion (U.S.) to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy  antitrust concerns by the European Commission that threatened to derail the deal.

"What the commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch responded in a letter to Honeywell's CEO.

"The new deal you propose, in response to the commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said spokesperson Tom Crane.

An earlier proposal criticized by EU regulators is expected to be considered by the commission next week, but analysts predicted it would be turned down.

"We thought it was dead. It still looks dead," said Kent Newcomb, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, Mo.
GE spokesperson Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, decreasing the value of the deal to $39.5 billion.

GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti late Thursday turned down GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, sources close to the deal said yesterday.
GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS fell short because it didn't change the structure of its control of
GECAS' purchasing policy, said an EU commission source who asked not to be named.

Monti's office fears GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, leading eventually to higher prices.

General Electric  Co. said last-minute concessions proposed by Honeywell  International to save their multibillion- dollar merger would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by European regulators.

Honeywell  offered yesterday to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy  antitrust concerns by the European Commission that threatened to derail the deal.
But GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said the offer falls short of what regulators want.

"What the commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he said in a letter to Honeywell's CEO. "The new deal you propose, in response to the commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."
Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," spokesman Tom
Crane said.

An earlier proposal criticized by EU regulators is expected to be considered by the commission next week, but analysts predicted it would be turned down.
"We thought it was dead. It still looks dead," Kent Newcomb of A.G. Edwards & Sons said.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said the company has no plans to make any further proposals to the European
Commission. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's powerful aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore wrote in a letter to Welch outlining the offer. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."
EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to comment on the letter.
Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti late Thursday turned down
GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, sources close
to the deal said yesterday.
GE shares rose 13 cents Friday to close at $49. Honeywell, which is based in Morris Township, dropped $3.30, or
8.6 percent, to $34.90.

GE, Honeywell  hopes fading

Another last-ditch effort to salvage their multibillion-dollar  merger apparently failed Friday when  General Electric Co. said concessions proposed by Honeywell  International Inc. would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by European regulators.

Honeywell  offered Friday to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion to offset the sale of operations it said would satisfy antitrust concerns by the European Commission. But  GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch said the offer falls short of what regulators want.

"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he responded in a letter to Honeywell's CEO. "The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Honeywell officials were "clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said spokesman Tom Crane. Honeywell's stock dropped $3.30, or 8.6 percent, to $34.90 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, its lowest closing price since last October, just days before GE struck a deal to acquire the Morris Township, N.J.- based company.

An earlier proposal criticized by EU regulators is expected to be considered by the Commission next week, but analysts predicted it would be rejected.

"We thought it was dead. It still looks dead," said Kent Newcomb, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.

GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said the company was still committed to the merger but has no plans to make any further proposals to the European Commission. She said the company was not optimistic the deal would be approved.

Honeywell's new offer reduced the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion. GE would then make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy regulators, an amount it had reduced to $1.1 billion after developing a plan to spin off part of GE's
aircraft-financing and leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services.

To some, Honeywell's action smacks of desperation. "They seem to abhor the idea of having to go out into the cruel world," said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research Inc.

Other analysts said GE's response to Honeywell's proposals signals a growing animosity between the two. This could have significant implications for GE, which needs to show it's doing all it can under the merger agreement to close the deal. Honeywell has been pushing hard, saying it expects GE to do all it can to get approval.

In its letter making the offer to GE, Honeywell hinted at some displeasure with the regulatory process. "Unfortunately, the delay in offering the GECAS solution until June 28th has limited the Commission's ability to undertake its necessary review."
On Thursday, GE and Honeywell made a last-ditch effort to save the deal, with GE offering to sell 19.9 percent of
GECAS in a private placement. The EU wants a public float of the stake.

The U.S. Army has grounded nearly three-fourths of its Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters to inspect for safety flaws in their tail rotors, an Army spokeswoman said.
Army inspection teams equipped with specialized X-ray machines are inspecti ng the tail rotor blades on 500 of
742 helicopters, focusing on blades that have more than 1,000 flying hours, said the spokeswoman, Capt. Amy
Hannah. The Army did not issue a formal order grounding the entire fleet.

None of the 500 helicopters can fly until each of the four blades in its tail assembly is inspected and replaced if necessary, Hannah said. The tail rotor controls horizontal movement.
The inspections are precautionary and were triggered by a June 11 incident, in which an Apache flown by the
Israeli army made an emergency landing after its tail rotor assembly came apart.

GE and Honeywell  Squabble Over Merger Problems

FAIRFIELD, Conn., June 29 --  General Electric  Co. all but called off a $46 billion acquisition of  Honeywell International Inc. today as friction between the companies degenerated into a public spat between their chief executives.

Honeywell's  Michael Bonsignore accused GE's Jack Welch in a letter of waiting too long to make new proposals to overcome the EuropeanCommission's antitrust concerns. Bonsignore offered to take about $2 billion less than had been agreed upon and suggested additional concessions to save the transaction.
Welch responded with his own letter, saying the Honeywell proposal "makes no sense for our share owners." GE would have to concede more to European regulators to win approval than a cut in Honeywell's sale price
could make up, analysts said. European Commissioner Mario Monti plans to reject the purchase, GE's
largest-ever acquisition, at a meeting Tuesday. Monti said the remedies aren't enough and are too late.
"Sounds like it's dead to me," said Brian James, an analyst with Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston, which owns GE
stock. "Jack Welch is throwing shovels of dirt on top of the casket."

Welch, who built GE into the biggest company by market value during a 20-year reign as chief executive, delayed his retirement to oversee the Honeywell purchase.

Bonsignore was hoping the lower price would persuade Welch to return to the $2.2 billion in divestitures offered on June 14, along with the revised offer to sell a 19.9 percent stake sale in GE Capital Aviation Services, the company's aircraft-leasing unit. The revised offer submitted earlier this week cut the amount of divestitures by $1 billion.
"We are clearly disappointed in GE's decision to reject our proposed solution," said Honeywell spokesman
Thomas Crane. He declined to comment further.

The aircraft-leasing unit has been at the center of the European Union's objections to the purchase. Regulators have cited the possible leverage the unit could exert if the company gained Honeywell's avionics business.

European Commission regulators have pointed to the overwhelming use of jet engines made by GE on planes financed by the company's aircraft-leasing unit. GE, which said it doesn't require customers to buy products from the company's other divisions, isn't willing to make bigger concessions.
"What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," Welch said in the letter. The commission, the 15-nation European Union's executive agency, has argued that the combined company
would dominate the market for jet engines and airplane electronics, leading to higher prices. GE is the biggest
maker of jet engines.

The EU can block or impose constraints on mergers between companies with combined global sales of 5 billion euros ($4.2 billion), even if they are not based in Europe. General Electric had sales of $130 billion last year, while Honeywell's sales were $25 billion.

U.S. politicians from President Bush down have spoken on GE's behalf. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on
Wednesday was the latest to express frustration with the EU, calling its opposition to the takeover "off the wall."

Hopes for GE merger fade.

HOPES that  General Electric  could salvage its $42 billion ( #30 billion) purchase of  Honeywell  International faded yesterday amid continued opposition from Brussels.

Any chance of the world's largest industrial  merger being resurrected seemed to disappear when Jack Welch, chairman and chief executive of  GE, turned down the offer of a $1.8 billion discount on the acquisition from Honeywell's  board.  Honeywell  wrote to GE proposing that the company lower its takeover offer to $40.3 billion as compensation for asset sales needed to secure  regulatory approval  from the European Commission.

The reduced price could have allowed GE to make the asset sales needed for EU clearance. But in a letter to Michael Bonsignore, chairman and chief executive of Honeywell, Mr Welch said: "What the Commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal. The new deal you propose, in response to the Commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Mario Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner, has been criticised by US officials for rejecting the deal. He said it would give the merged company too much market power. Signor Monti's final decision is expected on Tuesday, but can be put back until July 12.

The biggest hurdle was GE's continued ownership of GE Capital Aviation Services, its aircraft-leasing business. The EU argued that Gecas, which bulk-buys aircraft, could put unfair pressure on aircraft manufacturers to buy GE products in return for purchase orders. The other issue on the negotiating table was GE's proposal to sell Honeywell's avionics businesses with annual sales of about $2.2 billion. The EU said this was too little.

UTC to revive Honeywell  bid as GE retreats - United Technologies - Merger.
By David Parsley.

THE hardline attitude of Mario  Monti, the EU competition commissioner, may open the door for United
Technologies (UTC) to launch a dramatic bid for Honeywell,  the avionics group.

General Electric  (GE), America's mightiest industrial company, has seen its $45billion bid for  Honeywell  falter because of Monti's objections to allegedly anti-competitive aspects of the  merger.
Jack Welch, GE's chairman, this weekend appeared to walk away because of Monti.

UTC is GE's largest rival and its executives were locked in meetings this weekend preparing to resume what they started last autumn. At that time they had made an agreed $40billion offer for Honeywell, only for Welch to trump them with his $45billion bid.

But while George David, UTC's chairman, was hoping for the chance to return to the negotiating table with Honeywell as early as this week, some UTC directors were still worrying about Welch's position. Although Welch all but wrote off the deal late last week they fear he is playing possum.

One UTC insider said: "We know Jack too well. Why has he still got an army of lawyers in Brussels if he wants to ditch the deal? We have made no secret of our fondness for a deal with Honeywell. But Jack is full of surprises and we don't rule out one last trick up his sleeve."

UTC may remain cautious, but most observers have written off the GE-Honeywell deal and expect UTC to return to the table within days.

Welch was this weekend considering invoking a secret clause in the deal that will allow him to make a graceful exit from negotiations. The clause says that either side is permitted to bring an end to the merger talks if either American or European regulators demand a sale of assets worth more than $2billion.
Last week hopes of a deal faded as GE changed its offer to Mario Monti, the European competition
commissioner. Welch told Monti he would be prepared to sell 20% of Gecas, the aircraft-leasing business, as part
of the deal. The stake is valued at close to $2billion. But, at the same time, he cut back on how much he was
prepared to sacrifice of Honeywell's avionics business from $2.2billion to $1.1billion. Monti then made it clear that
Welch would have to increase the amount of Honeywell sales to see the deal through.

In what appeared a desperate attempt to secure his merger, Michael Bonsignore, chairman of Honeywell, began what observers were calling an exchange of "love letters" on Friday afternoon. But Welch turned down his offer of a $1.8billion discount on the deal. Honeywell wrote to GE proposing that the company lower its takeover offer to
$40.3billion as compensation for asset sales needed to secure Monti's approval.
Welch told Bonsignore that his board's proposal made "no sense". The full Monti, page 13

EU prohibits GE-Honeywell  merger

The European Commission decided to prohibit  General Electric's  proposed $45 billion purchase of Honeywell International, a deal that would have been the world's largest industrial merger. On July 3, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti issued a statement saying, "The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines." The Commission's twenty members unanimously supported
the decision to stop the  merger.

The Commission's decision comes after the US Justice Department had already approved  the deal with minor changes. In recent months, the two companies had attempted to amend the deal to gain EU approval.  The EU's decision marks the first time its  competition authorities have squelched a  merger that had been approved  by its US counterparts.

"The European Commission and the US Department of Justice have worked in close cooperation during this investigation," said Monti. "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways."

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer issued a statement saying, "We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services. The facts just don't support these assertions. We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices."

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The  European Union's 20-member executive  commission plans to vote Tuesday on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.

GE-Honeywell  has not withdrawn EU notification: EU

BRUSSELS, July 2 (AFP) - General Electric  and Honeywell  International have not formally withdrawn the  EU notification of their planned blockbuster merger, European Commission competition spokeswoman Amelia Torres said Monday.

"If it remains on the table, the  commission will have to take a decision," she said, adding that the  merger is "on the agenda" of its weekly meeting Tuesday in Strasbourg, where the  European Parliament convenes.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who is widely expected to reject the GE-Honeywell merger, is scheduled to hold a press conference in the French city at 3:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) Tuesday.

Though a notification of a merger can be withdrawn at any time, Torres said the underlying merger agreement between the parties needs to be cancelled and the commission then formally notified of the withdrawal.
On Friday Honeywell made an unusual appeal to GE to make additional concessions to the European
Commission, even offering to cut the acquisition price. But GE quickly rejected the proposal.

The strong market position of GECAS, GE's aircraft leasing unit, has been Brussels' main concern. Critics of the merger say it could force buyers of aircraft to equip them with GE engines and Honeywell electronics.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before
Tuesday. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said Friday.
Binns refused to comment late Sunday on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application. (cb-dj-pa)

For Honeywell,  GE Merger Fiasco Extends Bad Streak --- Company Was Exuding  Confidence 19 Months
Ago --- Earnings  Woes and Clashing  Cultures

Honeywell  International Inc. made a last-ditch attempt Friday to convince  General Electric  Co. that the two could still win favor from  European regulatory officials who oppose their $42.2 billion (49.68 billion  euros) merger.
Like so much else at the company in the last two years, the effort fell flat.
In a public letter, Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael R. Bonsignore told GE boss John F. Welch
Jr. he would cut the price GE would pay for Honeywell by roughly $1.8 billion if GE made a few more concessions
to the European Commission. Hours earlier, after regulators had given a thumbs-down to the companies'
11th-hour try at salvaging the deal, Mr. Bonsignore had suggested the same thing in private, but Mr. Welch
balked, according to people familiar with the situation.

Mr. Bonsignore also delivered a not-so-veiled hint that if GE said no, Honeywell could sue it for failing to fulfill its contractual obligation to expend "reasonable best efforts" to win approval.

But Mr. Welch didn't bite. After conferring with his own attorneys and GE directors, he shot back a terse, thanks-but-no-thanks response.

Honeywell's board plans to meet Tuesday to discuss its options. Some directors are increasingly critical of Mr. Bonsignore, according to people familiar with the situation. With a possible lawsuit in mind, Honeywell has consulted law firm Kirkland & Ellis and attorney David Boies, known for leading the U.S. prosecution of Microsoft Corp. and working on former Vice President Al Gore's legal team during the Florida recount.

Officially, GE said it still stood behind the merger. But its executives continued to blame the commission for making what GE sees as unreasonable demands that have put the deal at death's door. GE, which has been pushing Honeywell to withdraw from the merger application, hasn't talked to the commission since Thursday, when European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told Messrs. Welch and Bonsignore their latest proposal fell short. That body is poised to give an official and final rejection as soon as tomorrow at a meeting in Strasbourg, France.

Honeywell's proposed solution "makes no sense for our share owners," Mr. Welch wrote Mr. Bonsignore. "What the commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," he added.

With that, Mr. Welch may well have cut the hearts out of many at Honeywell as well. The collapse of its merger with GE would be the latest and perhaps worst blow for a $25 billion industrial company that exuded confidence just 19 months ago, after it merged with AlliedSignal Corp. Almost ever since, Honeywell has grappled with
deep-rooted earnings woes, clashing cultures and an uncertain strategic future.

Since last September, Honeywell has laid off about 10% of the 125,000 employees it then had. Since GE's transition team moved after making the deal last October, other employees, especially the 500 headquarters staff workers at Honeywell's Morris Township, New Jersey, base, which GE planned to close, have been bracing for the ax to fall. Some of those have already left, along with a handful of top managers, many of whose jobs remain unfilled.

While GE executives have been swarming the company preparing for the merger and calling many of the shots, stressed senior managers from Honeywell have been trying to balance their daily tasks with the huge challenge of satisfying GE's demands for data and plotting their post-merger futures. Most were counting on a huge pay-out upon the deal's closing to make up for it all.

As for Mr. Bonsignore, GE's methodical merger team has treated him like the lame duck he seemed to be, according to people familiar with the situation. During the last few months, an increasingly frustrated Mr. Bonsignore kept coming to work and talking to customers, but often was kept out of the GE loop, whose team was led by Vice Chairman Dennis D. Dammerman, according to these people. During the weeks of intense negotiations between the companies and antitrust enforces in Brussels this spring, Mr. Bonsignore appeared just once, for a half-day visit, according to negotiators there.

Now the 60-year-old Mr. Bonsignore, who already was under heavy fire when GE stepped in, must regain the confidence of his troops, a daunting task given the angst in the ranks. With the economic downturn deepening, meanwhile, Honeywell faces the prospect of more sluggish earnings. Among the businesses dragging the company down are consumer automotive products and friction materials, which Honeywell had planned to sell last fall before GE took them off the block.

What's more, Honeywell gave GE extraordinary access to its books and financial and operational details in recent months, including competitive information GE never could have gotten otherwise. The two companies signed a confidentiality agreement, but GE's newfound insight could possibly come back to haunt Honeywell.

Though Mr. Bonsignore, who declined to be interviewed for this story, recently insisted his company had contingency plans for any outcome, many investors argue he has little choice but to accept another offer,
probably for a lot less money. Moody's Investor's Service already has warned Honeywell its debt ratings would be reviewed for a possible downgrade if it ended up an orphan.

No one will walk away from this debacle untarnished. The European Commission finds itself under assault from a growing number of critics, especially top U.S. officials and businessmen, who describe it as a narrow, obtuse and politically unaccountable body whose methods verge on extortion. Mighty GE, which considers itself a smart acquirer and skilled negotiator, was outflanked by smaller rivals who found a sympathetic ear in Brussels, then utterly befuddled in its drive to close its biggest deal ever. The celebrated Mr. Welch, who foresaw a
career-capping triumph when he delayed retirement to see the deal through, instead will leave on a sour note.

Still, the fallout is likely to be roughest for Honeywell and its constituents. Bruised shareholders took another whack Friday as Honeywell's stock dropped 8.4% to close at $34.99, off $3.21, in 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange. As if to rub it in, GE shares fell just 12 cents to $48.75.

Even inside Honeywell's ranks, some saw Mr. Bonsignore's open letter to Mr. Welch as a desperate move reflecting a tacit fear of Honeywell's prospects without GE.

"It bespeaks anxiety," says Charles Nathan, a veteran New York takeover lawyer at law firm Latham & Watkins. "The fact that this was done publicly suggests that it couldn't have been resolved privately. It is designed to create public opinion and investor opinion against GE," he adds.

According to several people close to the situation, Mr. Monti even told Honeywell in mid-June that the deal stood little chance and suggested the company consider walking away to avoid an unfavorable ruling. But its management and board have been pushing GE hard to keep fighting ever since it submitted a "final offer" of concessions on June 14 that didn't satisfy antitrust investigators. Where Mr. Welch and his team hear Mr. Monti's sometimes elliptical pronouncements as death sentences, Mr. Bonsignore and his staff seem to interpret them as hopeful signs of resurrection. A spokeswoman for Mr. Monti declined to comment.

If the deal dies tomorrow, Honeywell might well end up back in the arms of United Technologies Corp., the parent of aircraft manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, with whom Honeywell nearly merged before Mr. Welch swooped in with
a better offer. United Technologies has spent the months since working hard to torpedo the GE-Honeywell deal. (A spokesman from United Technologies did not return calls seeking comment Friday.)

For all Honeywell's troubles, there was and is good reason for GE and United Technologies to covet it. The company's big aerospace unit, comprising about 40% of sales, has at its heart a number of cutting-edge avionics products, the electronic operating guts of airplanes. They include computerized flight-navigation systems and ground-proximity warning devices, among many others. Honeywell boasts a large market share and close ties to customers like Boeing Co.

Page 52 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Even the aerospace business, though, has been slower than the company would like. Sales rose just 3% in the first quarter. Airlines are beginning to tighten some spending, while the market for regional jets of more than 70 seats, where Honeywell saw huge opportunities, isn't growing as fast as it hoped.

While executives from Honeywell and GE have been focusing on merger plans and the phonebook-thick integration books they have been toting around, some competitors and analysts in the global aerospace industry wonder whether Honeywell has taken its eye off the ball. At the annual industry gathering in Paris last month, rivals noted that the company, which normally could be expected to unveil a handful of significant deal or product announcements, made barely a peep.

Building a strong aerospace business was a big reason for the 1999 merger between AlliedSignal and Honeywell. The former owned a grab bag of aerospace components, such as business and regional jet engines, environmental-control systems, wheels and brakes and flight-safety parts. The latter brought the integrated computer networks that are the spine of an airplane and cockpit's electronics. Together, they wanted to be the
first to offer manufacturers complete, connected navigation, communications and cabin systems.

But there were personal factors at work too. Lawrence A. Bossidy, the aggressive head of AlliedSignal -- and former vice chairman under Mr. Welch at GE -- had long wanted to increase the size of his company. He also needed a successor. In June 1999 he found both when AlliedSignal agreed to buy Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Honeywell for $14 billion.

Out of the gate, the new company aggressively promised earnings-per-share growth in 2000 of 20% -- and compounded annual growth of 18% over three years. Mr. Bonsignore, who was slated to succeed Mr. Bossidy after his April 2000 retirement, declared, "We are poised to deliver on all our commitments, making the new Honeywell a great company to do business with, invest in, and work for."

Seven months later, in June 2000, he found himself in the kind of situation every CEO dreads, shocking Wall Street by announcing Honeywell would miss earnings forecasts for the second quarter. As Honeywell shares tumbled 25% over the next two days, furious investors questioned whether he even had a handle on the
company. Within weeks, Honeywell was hit by a raft of shareholder suits accusing it of deliberately misleading the markets.

Honeywell, then and now, put a lot of blame on a weak euro and a swift slowdown, which sent material and energy costs upward while demand slowed. Certainly those were, and continue to be, problems.

But numerous current and former executives of both companies say the earnings shortfall also reflected fundamental business issues and deep cultural differences. Some of these executives say Mr. Bonsignore misjudged both, contibuting to Honeywell's current woes.

At its heart, Mr. Bossidy's AlliedSignal was a lean, acquisitive and hard-nosed organization with an operational and short-term earnings focus. "The sheer force of his personality made you make the quarter somehow," says one former executive. "That's not neceesarily a sustainable longterm proposition but you did it." Mr. Bossidy was traveling in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment last week, according to an assistant.

Honeywell, by contrast, was known to wrap itself around customers by investing heavily in people, technology and resources. Mr. Bonsignore, CEO since since 1993, had led several layoffs, but focused more on boosting sales than paring costs. Years before Boeing's long-distance 777 jetliner was even off the drawing board, for instance, Honeywell had 50 people working inside Boeing on the panel display, recall former executives.

The men at the top also had divergent styles. Like his good friend Mr. Welch, the charismatic Mr. Bossidy was a tough and hands-on boss who spent most of his time on finances and people, ruling through an unpredictable combination of praise and fear. Mr. Bonsignore, who graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a degree in electrical engineering, was both warmer and more enigmatic, a sales-oriented executive who speaks Italian, French and Spanish. While Mr. Bossidy's meetings usually began the minute he came in, Mr. Bonsignore showed up 15 minutes early to work the room, shaking hands.

Given the deep differences, Mr. Bonsignore seriously miscalculated by agreeing to close Honeywell's Minneapolis headquarters and move to Mr. Bossidy's home turf, many current and former executives say. In the first
post-merger months, with Mr. Bossidy still in charge, Mr. Bonsignore disappointed some old colleagues by deferring, like a good soldier, to Mr. Bossidy as he cut budgets and barked at Honeywell managers. Frustrated, several moved on.

Even after Mr. Bonsignore officially took over, most key functions remained in the hands of Mr. Bossidy's lieutenants, and the board was dominated by old Allied Signal directors. The more politically-minded Allied Signal veterans found Mr. Bonsignore hard to read, while the new CEO had few confidants, according to former executives.

When the earnings shortfall hit, the cultural cracks widened into chasms. Hardest hit were businesses that had once been part of AlliedSignal -- auto and transportation products and specialty chemicals, all of which would end
2000 with profit declines. Used to Mr. Bossidy's quick fixes, Wall Street demanded a rapid response, while Mr. Bonsignore grappled for ways to grow the top line, a process that often takes longer.

Mr. Bonsignore's defenders accused Mr. Bossidy of weighting his successor down with businesses that were running on fumes. Allies of Mr. Bossidy responded that Mr. Bonsignore lacked the will and skill to cut costs, integrate the two companies and restore Wall Street's confidence. At the least, it was evident to all that Mr. Bonsignore had badly underestimated the profit challenges facing the new company.

He was making an effort to address the problem, however, though few knew it at the time. In late May, less than two months after he succeeded Mr. Bossidy, Mr. Bonsignore called George David, the head of United Technologies to talk about a merger. Besides the deteriorating business outlook, he felt Honeywell needed to get still bigger. By mid-October, they were close to an accord on a $40 billion deal.

Though United Technologies would be the purchaser, Honeywell shareholders would own a majority of the new company, which would retain the Honeywell name. Mr. Bonsignore would stay on as Chairman through 2003. According to friends, he planned to be an active one, and had a sincere desire to build and run a new company.

Enter Mr. Welch. He snapped into action after hearing of the rumored merger on a Thursday evening in late October, lobbing in a preemptive bid the next morning and sealing the richer deal with Honeywell's board over the weekend. By the following Monday morning, at a celebratory press conference, Mr. Welch already seemed fully in charge. He fielded most questions himself -- many concerned his decision to delay his departure -- and boasted that the companies had no overlaps and expected no antitrust problems.

Asked about costs to be cut, he gave few specifics, but did provide a colorful example of the superfluous. "We have two of everything," he said. "I mean four months from now, if we have a meeting here, no offense to Mike, but we'll have a cost reduction, because we'll only have one of us in here." Mr. Bonsignore smiled weakly.
That set the stage for the last eight months.

A few things inside Honeywell have improved under GE, insiders say. The cultural infighting has abated somewhat, with former AlliedSignal and Honeywell workers feeling the kinship of the beleaguered under GE's glare.

Whether GE suffered buyer's remorse -- as some Honeywell executives suspect -- is far from clear, and it would undoubtedly be a central question in any lawsuit accusing GE of not expending best efforts to close the deal. Yet, given Honeywell's business prospects, some GE investors and executives don't think it's all bad that the deal isn't going through.

A Possible  United Tech-Honeywell Merger Seen As Likely
By Christopher C. Williams
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With  European regulators set to block the General Electric  Co.(GE)-Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  merger as early as Tuesday, many on Wall Street expect Honeywell  to eventually hook up with United Technologies Corp. (UTX).

For many market watchers, a United Technologies-Honeywell  merger makes as much strategic sense as GE-Honeywell.  A United Technologies acquisition of $25 billion Honeywell  would almost double United Technologies' revenue and create a formidable new player in the aerospace sector. United Technologies, of Hartford, Conn., reported $26.6 billion in revenue last year.

Nevertheless, most industry observers say GE, despite its eagerness to keep Honeywell out of United Technologies' hands, should have little to fear from a combined United Technologies-Honeywell even though it would heat up competition in the aerospace sector. On sheer size alone, GE, at almost $130 billion in revenue, would still dwarf a combined United Technologies-Honeywell.

Investors have targeted United Technologies as being the likely suitor for Honeywell if the GE deal falls through, because United Technologies made a bid for Honeywell in October, offering $50 a share in stock or $40 billion. GE quickly scooped up Honeywell with a higher offer.
The other possible suitor for Honeywell, Tyco International Ltd. (TYC), has said it isn't interested.

United Technologies couldn't be reached for comment, but the company hasn't commented recently on the speculation. GE officials declined comment.
"If I'm GE, I'd be pining for a lost opportunity, but I wouldn't be worried about a new serious competition," said
Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst with the Teal Group, of Fairfax, Va.

What makes GE great, noted Aboulafia, isn't just its market power but its integration of manufacturing, aftermarket and financial services.
"Both Honeywell and UTC failed to do that," he said.

United Technologies-Honeywell would have significant market power but not necessarily the margins, which made GE the only truly successful manufacturing stock in the last decade," the analyst said.

Eric Teal, a portfolio manager at First Union Securities Inc., which owns both GE and Honeywell shares, suggested that GE's vast and diverse portfolio of products and services and capabilities should help insulate the company from the ill-effects of any significant competition.

"Honeywell is very important to GE, both from earnings growth and competition landscape perspectives, that's why they were aggressive in trumping United Technologies' bid," said Teal. "But, with GE being such a conglomerate, I can see them meeting or exceeding earnings expectations in the next few quarters."

He noted that GE can extract cost savings from different areas of its operations. Furthermore, GE should benefit mightily from a number of power plants coming on line, as the company helps to build such plants.

NYSE-listed shares of GE recently were up $1.33, or 2.7%, to $50.08 on volume of 18.9 million shares; United Technologies shares were off $2.56 to $70.70 on volume of 2.7 million; while Honeywell shares were off 55 cents to $34.44 on volume of 14 million.

GE's apparent willingness to walk away from the Honeywell acquisition rather than make concessions that Chairman Jack Welch said would cut "the heart out of the strategic rationale of the deal," belies the importance of Honeywell to GE.

In announcing the acquisition in October, Welch triumphed Honeywell as a milestone deal in GE's history. Certainly, it was the largest and viewed as the crowning glory of Welch's storied career as the main architect of GE's remarkable operating performance.

Honeywell is a struggling industrial conglomerate, but GE favored the company's aerospace operation, particularly its avionics business. It's acquisition of Honeywell, many observers believe, was both offensive and defense: To expand its own platform of services and to keep Honeywell out of United Technologies' hands.

With Honeywell, GE, armed with its formidable aviation leasing and funding operation, would be able to service one end of an airplane to the next, making GE the world's largest maker of aircraft systems. It's the "bundling" potential of GE's GECAS operation, the concern that GE could force GE's aviation products on aircraft makers, that has the EU Commission ready to block the deal.
Beyond products, however, having Honeywell would, as The Wall Street Journal noted, be the culmination of a
20-year strategic shift at GE under Welch - to emphasize services as opposed to old-fashion manufacturing.
Importantly, Honeywell, would yield tremendous cost savings and allow GE to continue to put together its 18%
annual earnings growth, according to market observers.

GE said it continue to do double-digit earnings growth with or without Honeywell. First Call/Thomson Financial, sees GE earning jumping 16% to $1.47 this year from $1.27 a year ago. Some bulls pointed out that Honeywell would simply provide upside potential to earnings estimates.

But some are more skeptical. GE could hit earnings targets over the next two to three years, but could have a harder time of it without the merger benefits, noted Standard's & Poor's analyst Robert Friedman.

Without Honeywell, GE should continue its aggressive acquisition program, although some say the company wouldn't need to do a deal on the size of Honeywell soon. "In the long term they will continue to look for strategic acquisitions to improve its bottom line," said Teal of First Union.
Teal believes GE will continue to look within its own portfolio, using cost savings or restructuring, to replace
Honeywell as an engine for growth.

Even as it became clear GE-Honeywell might crash against regulatory rocks, many market observers believe the deal was too important for either the EU or GE to let die.

The feeling on the Street is that United Technologies wouldn't mind seeing that happen, though. The Journal reported Monday that United Technologies lobbied effectively against the deal in Brussels.

United Technologies spokesman Pete Murphy declined comment on speculation it may be interested in Honeywell, even though United Technologies chief executive reaffirmed his interest in Honeywell after Honeywell inked its deal with GE.
Why would United Technologies want Honeywell?

Honeywell would greatly expand United Technologies' exposure to the avionics market and make them the largest supplier to the aerospace industry, much larger than GE, pointed out analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Without Honeywell, GE doesn't have much presence in avionics, so a combination of United
Technologies-Honeywell wouldn't compete against GE in that arena, analysts say.

The companies, however, would continue to compete in aircraft engines, where GE is the world's largest maker, followed closely by United Technologies Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division and Rolls Royce. A Wall Street Journal reported last October that Pratt & Whitney planned to double revenue in five years. Combining with Honeywell, with a more than $10 billion aerospace operation, would certainly give it the resources.

Aboulafia of Teal Group noted that a combined United Technologies-Honeywell would have a major presence in APUs, or auxiliary power units, mostly for commercial jets and an "absurdly strong presence" in corporate jet engines, with well over two-thirds of the roughly $4 billion annual market.

GE and United Technologies would continue to go head-to-head in the same market in which they compete now - jet engines, said Aboulfia. "You won't see any new market segments (for them) to compete in," he added.

Analysts note that United Technologies would have to divest some assets if it were to buy Honeywell. "There's more product overlap in UTC-Honeywell than GE-Honeywell," said Aboulafia. But United Technologies wouldn't face the bundling issue that apparently is dooming GE-Honeywell.

Like GE, United Technologies doesn't need to do Honeywell to make earnings targets, said company observers. United Technologies has maintained that it expects to post 15% growth in earnings this year.

"The company has performed extremely well over the last several years," meeting or exceeding many of its financial goals, noted Nisbet, who has a buy rating on the stock.

United Technologies stock has been a solid performer over the past year, rising more than 23%. The stock, however, as been hurt amid the speculation it would bid for Honeywell. Market observers say United Technologies could get Honeywell for much less than the $40 billion it offered last year. But many investors are evidently spooked by the prospect of United Technologies taking on a faltering industrial conglomerate like Honeywell.

More appetizing to some analysts and investors would be for Honeywell to sell its operations piecemeal, leaving the avionics business for United Technologies.

General Electric  chairman and chief executive Jack Welch turned down a last-minute offer by Honeywell International to save their $41 billion  merger, saying it would not be enough to save the deal from rejection by European regulators, expected to vote on the proposed  merger tomorrow. Honeywell  offered to reduce GE's takeover price by $1 billion, but Welch said  Honeywell's  proposal "makes no sense" for  GE shareholders.

Monster.com and HotJobs.com, both leading online job-hunting and recruitment sites, will be owned by the same company. TMP, a New York-based recruitment firm and Monster.com's parent company, is buying HotJobs for about $460 million in stock. TMP said it intends to maintain HotJobs.com as a stand-alone site and brand.

Computer and printer giant Hewlett-Packard Co. asked its 45,000 US employees to take pay cuts or use up vacation days in a bid to trim costs. Though not mandatory, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm is offering workers three choices: a 10 percent salary cut through Oct. 31, use up eight additional paid vacation days, or a 5 percent cut and four additional vacation days. HP has been hit by falling demand for personal computers, peripherals, and servers.

Agere Systems, the semiconductor business recently spun off from Lucent Technologies, plans to cut an additional 4,000 jobs, bringing its total job cuts this year to 6,000. The firm cited a downturn in the
communications market. After cuts are complete, the Allentown, Pa.-based company will employ 12,500 workers. (c) Copyright 2001. The Christian Science Monitor

EU Commission to Vote on GE Merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union's 20-member executive  Commission plans to vote Tuesday
on General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals
or withdrawal of the merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU is widely expected to  reject the deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.
"It's on the agenda and they will vote Tuesday," said EU spokesman Michael Tscherny.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, "If the merger notification remains on the table, the Commission will have to make a decision. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at "at any time."
"There are no plans for withdrawal," GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again, EU officials said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are dim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before
Tuesday. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said Friday.
Binns refused to comment late Sunday on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application.

GE, Honeywell  Consider  Calling Off Their Merger --- Companies  May Withdraw  EU Application Deal Is
Expected to Be Rejected by European Commission
An Asian Wall Street Journal Roundup

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. were over the weekend "actively considering" whether to abandon their proposed merger and withdraw their application for the  European Commission's approval  of the deal, said a person familiar with the matter.
The 20-member commission has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether the  merger meets the restrictions of
European Union rules.

All sides expect the commission to oppose the transaction. A vote won't occur if the companies withdraw their proposal.

On Friday, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch rejected Honeywell's proposal to shave $1 billion off the price of GE's takeover offer and make major divestitures.

"What the commission is seeking cuts the heart out of the strategic rationale of our deal," Mr. Welch wrote in a letter to Honeywell. "The new deal you propose, in response to the commission, makes no sense for our share owners, for the same strategic reasons."

Honeywell offered to cut the price because European Commission regulators wanted GE to sell some operations in a move that GE viewed as financially unattractive.

GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE doesn't plan to make any further proposals to the commission before its vote on the merger. She declined to declare the deal dead.

Honeywell offered to reduce the amount of stock GE would pay for Honeywell, effectively decreasing the value of the deal from $41.7 billion to $39.5 billion.

In return, under the Honeywell proposal, GE would make $2.1 billion of divestitures it originally offered to satisfy European Commission regulators but reduced to $1.1 billion after coming up with a plan to spin off part of GE's aircraft-financing and leasing unit.

The new Honeywell proposal to EU regulators would include both the $2.1 billion in divestitures and the partial spinoff.

"Honeywell's proposal satisfies all of the competition concerns and serves the best interests of all stakeholders," Honeywell's chairman and CEO, Michael Bonsignore, said in a letter to Mr. Welch outlining the offer. "It provides GE with better economics for the deal, and it satisfies the European Commission's divestiture requirements."

GE doesn't plan to withdraw its existing proposal, Ms. Binns said, but she added, "We aren't optimistic of approval."

Before Honeywell made its new offer, EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti turned down GE's latest proposal regarding the aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, late Thursday, said people familiar with the deal, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In his letter to Mr. Welch, Mr. Bonsignore cited a conversation the two had with Mr. Monti on Thursday as the reason for the new offer.
Page 66 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The spinoff and original divestiture offer "specifically address the concerns expressed by Commissioner Monti yesterday," Mr. Bonsignore wrote.
EU Commission spokesman Michael Tscherny declined to comment on the letter.
Mr. Monti has said the commission is likely to vote on the proposed deal on Tuesday. Document awsj000020010710dx720090p

The Trader
MARKET WEEK -- Stocks
Wild First Half Ends With GE-Honeywell  Unraveling
By Andrew Bary

Stocks ended a tough first half of 2001 in a strange session Friday that featured trading difficulties on the Nasdaq and the apparent demise of the  General Electric/Honeywell International merger agreement after GE chairman Jack Welch publicly rejected proposed concessions to European antitrust regulators urged by Honeywell  chief executive Michael Bonsignore.
Despite a midweek advance following the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest-rate cut and an appeals court's
rejection of key aspects of the Microsoft  antitrust case, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at
10,502, down 102 points, or 1%, after a 63-point loss Friday. The Nasdaq, however, gained 125 points, or 6%, to
2160, in the five sessions, including a 35-point rise Friday. The S&P 500 index was down just a point in the week
to 1224.

The Nasdaq experienced trading troubles Friday afternoon that prevented a compilation of the index's value from around 2:30 p.m. EDT until nearly 4 p.m. The Nasdaq session was lengthened to 5 p.m. from the usual 4 p.m close, but the New York Stock Exchange closed on schedule. The major averages weren't compiled until after 5 p.m. The snafus came during an active session that featured heavy trading related to quarter-end portfolio shifts by investment managers and the final day of dealings related to the rebalancing of the Russell indexes.

Big Board volume was heavy at 1.7 billion shares Friday with an estimated 400 million shares trading in the final minute before 4 p.m. The frenetic late activity produced some price spikes in such big stocks as Freddie Mac, American International Group and Philip Morris, which were partly erased on after-hours composite trading. Freddie Mac shot up to 70 from 67 before ending composite trading at 68.05, down 1.84 in the week. Philip Morris moved up to 50.75 from 48.50 before falling back to 49.50. up nearly 2 points on the week. AIG jumped to 87
from 84 before settling down to 85.01, down a penny in the five sessions.

Takeover arbitrage spreads also moved on such deals as Equity Office Properties/Spieker Properties and Chevron/Texaco. Given the volatile late-session trading and the Russell rebalancing moves, there could be active dealings Monday as investors and traders seek to unwind some of the wackier price movements that occurred Friday.
The day's news was dominated by the public disclosure of a letter from Honeywell CEO Bonsignore to Jack
Welch urging GE to make certain concesssions to the EU, including a divestiture of a 19.9% stake in GE's aircraft
financing unit. The market talk was that Citigroup was prepared to buy that stake from GE. Bonsignore offered to
reduce the value of the deal for Honeywell holders to 1.01 GE shares from 1.055 GE shares, effectively saving
GE $1.8 billion. But Welch quickly shot back a letter, stating that the Honeywell CEO's proposal "makes no sense
for our share owners" and that concessions sought by the EU "cut the heart out of the strategic rationale of our
deal." It's ironic that GE/Honeywell deal, which began on friendly terms, appears to be ending acrimoniously with
Welch publicly spurning the last-ditch Honeywell salvage effort.

Takeover arbitrageurs said that GE is seeking to tread a careful path out of deal by painting the EU as the villain because of the recent Delaware court decision that prevented Tyson Foods from backing out of its deal to buy meatpacker IBP. GE wants to avoid a situation in which Honeywell sues GE to resurrect the deal.

With the Welch letter all but killing the deal, Honeywell fell 3.30 to 34.90 Friday, while GE gained 0.13 to 49. The big question now is whether United Technologies, whose original interest in Honeywell prompted GE's trumping bid last October, will reenter the fray.
Page 68 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Wall Street analysts have said that United Technologies might be willing to pay $40-$45 a share for Honeywell, whose takeover value has diminished because of operating difficulties and management distractions related to huge layoffs that had been planned by GE. Honeywell, which had been expected to earn $3.40 a share in 2001, now is seen producing profits of $2.65. And that $2.65 forecast could be at risk if Honeywell has weak
second-quarter results. If United Technologies doesn't step forward, Honeywell could trade down toward 30.

United Technologies is in a strong negotiating position because there are only a limited number of buyers for Honeywell. At 45, Honeywell would be valued at $36 billion -- equal to General Motors' market value. One potential Honeywell buyer, acquisition-happy Tyco International, has publicly stated that it's not interested. It's a good bet that Honeywell will seek another merger partner, assuming the GE deal dies. Indeed, Honeywell's willingness to accept a lower price from GE to clinch their deal seems to underscore the company's eagerness to sell out.
-- The nasdaq may have rallied 32% from its April 4 low of 1638, but it still finished the second quarter with a
year-to-date loss of 12.5%. The Dow Industrials, as the table shows, are down 2.6% so far in 2001 while the S&P
500 declined 7.3%.

Ted Aronson, president of Aronson Partners, a Philadelphia investment manager, says the year so far has been characterized by the outperformance of small stocks and value strategies, marking a continuation of what happened during the last nine months of 2000. The Russell 2000 index was up 6% in the first six months of 2001, as the value component of the index rose 11%, beating its growth counterpart by about 14 percentage points. "Most every value manager looks brilliant, while growth managers look like bums. That's just the opposite of what it occurred in the five years ending in March 2000."

Friday also marked the end of a rocky year for most university endowments, whose fiscal years usually end on June 30, coinciding with the academic calendar. The S&P was down 15% in the year ended Friday and the Nasdaq fell 45%. Many university endowments also were hurt by poor venture capital and private equity results in the latest 12 months after scoring big gains in the prior few years. Some estimate that the venture capital/private equity portion of endowments could be down 30% or more. The overall performance of endowments is apt to be poor in the latest year following the 30% to 50% advances in the prior fiscal year. Look for particularly bad showings from endowments heavy in venture investments.

-- Wall street's continued infatuation with semiconductor stocks despite terrible operating results is evident in the strength of Micron Technology, the leading maker of DRAMs, the memory devices used in personal computers.

Micron shares are up 16% this year to 41.10 and have risen 3 points since June 21, when the company reported a steep loss of 50 cents a share for its May quarter. The poor results reflect the plunge in DRAM prices, which now are around $2 for the benchmark 128-megabyte variety, down from over $4 three months ago, $6 at
year-end and over $12 a year ago.

The Micron news prompted some Street estimates to cut their earnings estimates for the company's current fiscal year, ending August, and the coming year ending August 2002. The consensus is for close to breakeven in the current year and almost $1 share in profits in the following year.

"People aren't thinking about this company rationally," says Bob Marcin, head of Marcin Asset Management. "This is a highly volatile, capital-intensive, marginally profitable business over the cycle that deserves to get valued at most for 15 times normalized earnings of $1 share." Normalized profits are what Micron can expect to earn on average over a boom and bust cycle. Of course, Micron trades for a lot higher than $15 a share. At 41, Micron is valued at $24 billion, not much less than Gillette.
Marcin takes aim at Micron bulls like Jonathan Joseph, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst, who recently kept his
$50 price target on the stock while lowering his fiscal 2002 forecast to a loss of 22 cents from profits of $1.37 and
cutting his revenue estimate to $3.7 billion from $6.7 billion. In maintaining his target price despite those cuts,
Joseph effectively raised his targeted price/sales ratio on Micron to eight times from 4.5 using fiscal 2002 profits,
way above the company's average of 2.5 in the past decade. The price/sales ratio is market value divided by
revenues. Assuming Micron operates at a loss in its current fiscal year, it will have earned virtually nothing since
1997.

The bull case on Micron is that competition is becoming more rational as weak Asian producers exit the market. But the collapse in DRAM prices suggests that the market is a long way from becoming oligopolistic. Marcin believes DRAM prices are likely to rally from depressed current levels, but Micron's stock already discounts a sizable and sustained recovery. "If there were DRAM futures, I'd buy them, but not Micron," he says.

-- All the talk about General Electric lately has involved the Honeywell deal.

Yet one of the big questions that ought to be asked is whether GE Capital, the company's giant financial services arm, can maintain its customary 16%- 17% quarterly profit gains given tough conditions in the financial industry. GE Capital accounts for nearly half of GE's earnings and thus is critical to the company's profit outlook.

A host of financial services companies have stumbled in 2001, including American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. Profit estimates even have been cut even for mighty Citigroup, which now is expected to produce 10% earnings growth in 2001 to $3 a share. Yet the Street seems unconcerned about GE Capital despite the difficulty in generating mid-teens annual profit gains off a $5 billion base.
GE has expressed confidence in its 2001 earnings outlook, saying in May that it expects to earn "solidly above
$1.45 a share" this year, which would mean at least 14% growth from last year's $1.27 in profits. The current
consenus is $1.47 a share. GE's May statement shows no doubts about GE Capital's outlook.

Street analysts, meanwhile, generally offer little insight into GE Capital because they tend to be industrial analysts used to covering stocks like United Technologies or Tyco. GE doesn't help matters because it doesn't reveal
much about GE Capital. In the first quarter, GE Capital's 16% profit rise was driven largely by its large consumer services division, while specialized financing, which includes venture capital investments through GE Equity, had a sharp profit drop. Consumer services, venture capital and reinsurance have been three of the largest parts of GE Capital.
GE partisans argue that GE Capital has a great mix of businesses. But American Express, Morgan Stanley and
Goldman don't have shabby franchises, either.

GE now is valued at nearly $500 billion. This implies the market is assuming a value on GE Capital of $200-$250 billion. Citigroup, the largest financial services company, is valued at $265 billion based on Friday's close of
52.84. Yet Citigroup this year is expected to produce $15 billion in net income, while GE Capital is seen producing profits of $6 billion. Is GE Capital effectively worth twice as much as Citigroup? That's the current verdict of the stock market. Yet it's tough to argue that Welch's financial franchise is twice as good as Sandy Weill's business. Over time, the Citigroup/ GE Capital gap could narrow, especially if GE Capital finally hits a rough patch.

-- Name a well-known company that trades for little more than three times earnings and yields nearly 15%. The answer is MCI Group, the tracking stock that recently emerged from WorldCom, which bought the old MCI Communications in late 1990s.

MCI (ticker MCIT) ended Friday at 16.10, down from around 18 when the stock began trading in early June. WorldCom holders got 1/25 of a share of the MCI tracker for each WorldCom share. With an annual dividend of
$2.40 a share, MCI yields 14.9% and the company is expected to earn around $5 a share this year before goodwill amortization charges.
Before MCI was carved out of WorldCom, analysts thought the stock might yield 10% and trade in the low 20s,
but investors have required an even higher yield to compensate for the risks of a declining business. Indeed, MCI
shapes up as an interesting case study of how to value a wasting asset. The company, which controls
WorldCom's consumer long-distance , dial-up Internet access and prepaid phone card businesses, is expected to
experience a 14% revenue decline this year to $14 billion and a similar drop in 2002. These businesses throw off
a lot of cash now, but there's apt to be an erosion in earnings years from increased competition in the
long-distance area, especially from the Baby Bells.

"The way to play MCI is to guess the rate of decay," says Marc Crossman, analyst at J.P. Morgan. "How long can it sustain the dividend. The way to look at it is that the Baby Bells will end up taking the long-distance market. " Crossman says the eroding nature of the MCI franchise leaves little room for error.

Wall Street has been lukewarm on MCI. Merrill Lynch analyst Adam Quinton pegs fair value at $21 a share; Crossman has a price target of $17 -$20, while Prudential Securities' Floyd Greenwood has a $15 target. MCI's market value is puny at under $2 billion, but it has been allocated a sizable debt load of $6 billion. The big concern is that the MCI dividend won't hold after a few years because of the need to support that debt load when profits are under pressure.

The bull case for MCI is that it can stem the erosion in its franchise and that a strategic buyer could emerge in a few years. Long distance prices have started to stabilize, and it's in the interest of MCI and its chief competitors,

AT&T and Sprint, to avoid ruinous competition. AT&T is due to spin off its consumer long-distance business later this year.

- Reports Suggest  GE May Withdraw Bid Before Tuesday  Commission Meeting

BRUSSELS (MktNews) - The  European Union's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, is to hold a press briefing Tuesday that will likely give details on the investigation into the proposed merger between U.S. companies General Electric  Co. and Honeywell,  the EU Commission said Monday.

The EU investigation into the merger to be completed no later than July 12, but the Commission's college will discuss the issue in Strasbourg on Tuesday and is expected to make a definitive announcement before the deadline.
Monti's press conference is scheduled for 1300 GMT in Strasbourg and will include comments on the
GE-Honeywell deal as well as other agenda items.

A report in the New York Times Monday said GE may withdraw its merger proposal later Monday ahead of the Tuesday Commission meeting to avoid a formal decision against it which could affect its ability to make future deals.
A spokeswoman for the Commission would make no comment on the speculation of a withdrawal until the
Commission has been formally notified.
She repeated the merger will be judged on its current merits and not on any future restructuring plans.

Honeywell  International Inc. announced a proposed restructuring of its  merger with GE in a bid to satisfy divestiture concerns by  regulators in Europe that have threatened to kill the deal. Honeywell  is offering to lower the exchange ratio of the deal from 1.055 shares of  GE for every Honeywell  share to 1.01 shares of  GE for every Honeywell  share. Honeywell  requested that  GE make a private placement of 19.9% of the common equity of GECAS. The lower price for the  merger would compensate GE for any loss of value as a result of the divestiture.

EU Commission puts GE/ Honeywellmerger in doubt

General Electric's  chairman and chief executive Jack Welch unwittingly took on more than he bargained for when he decided last year to postpone his retirement to see through the company's final takeover under his tenure.

GE's proposed $45 billion takeover of automation and control system manufacturer, Honeywell, is teetering on the boundary between success and failure, as the EU Commission decides whether or not to reject the deal on the grounds of it being anti-competitive.

This is not the first large scale corporate activity that the EU has tried to shape the outcome of. The Commission forced significant changes to AOL's acquisition of Time Warner earlier this year, and caused the withdrawal of WorldCom's proposed acquisition of Sprint.

But if it formally rejects the proposal, it will be the first time the EU has directly scuttled a large scale merger between two American companies. The Commission can block or force changes to mergers between companies with combined global sales of e5 billion, even if they are not European-based.

The process began last October with the announcement that GE had agreed to buy Honeywell for $45 billion in stock. In December, US antitrust officials opened an investigation into the takeover -- an unsurprising move, given the size of the deal and the obvious similarities between aspects of both businesses.

While that investigation was underway, GE filed for regulatory approval from the European Union early in February. Later that month, EU Competition Commissioner, Mario Monti, said he would launch an in-depth probe of the proposed purchase. Then in the first week of May, the US Justice Department approved the proposed deal, inspiring confidence within both companies that the EU investigators would follow suit.

However, the optimism was short lived, and five days later, the European Commission formally notified GE that it objected to the proposed takeover. At the end of the month, the Commission heard GE's defence of the proposed purchase in a closed hearing session.

In the middle of June, earlier reports denied by Jack Welch that Honeywell had informally proposed to divest its regional jet engine unit to quell the concerns of the EU anti-trust officials, turned out to be true. GE also offered to sell part of its avionics business.

But it soon emerged that Europe wanted additional concessions, worth more than double those that had been proposed by GE and Honeywell. GE and Honeywell subsequently refused to make any further concessions ahead of the June 14 deadline for the receipt of proposed remedies and Jeff Immelt, GE chairman-elect and president, said there was zero chance of the deal going through.

&quot;Jeff Immelt and I wanted to complete the transaction, but we have always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal,&quot; Jack Welch said at the time. &quot;The Commission's extraordinary demands are far beyond that point. The European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined.&quot;

The debate turned political when US President George Bush said he was concerned by the Commission's apparent block on the takeover. He was joined by other US politicians and officials, who warned that a failure to ratify the deal could damage US-EU trade and who hinted that the US government might be forced to retaliate.


Page 75 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mario Monti responded to these suggestions by saying he deplored &quot;attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention&quot;, and reminded all concerned that the process had not concluded.

Despite the surprise in the US at the Commission's hard line stance, experts say that the EU's objections are not without foundation. The EU is particularly concerned about GE- Honeywell leveraging its dominance in aircraft engines into other areas of its business, which could affect large European aircraft engine manufacturers such as Rolls Royce and France's Thales.

Last Monday, the EU advisory committee on mergers, which comprises experts from all member states' national competition authorities, met to review a 122-page draft decision by the Commission's merger task force of experts, which is believed to recommend blocking the deal. At the meeting, none of the 15 representatives voted against blocking the proposed deal, and one country abstained.

However, three countries, which have not been identified, expressed regret at the failure to reach a negotiated solution.
Three days later Monti told the companies a revised proposal submitted this week was too late to win approval. Then on Friday, Honeywell said it would cut $2 billion off the cost of the deal, in order to compensate GE for the
divestiture of GECAS, its aircraft leasing arm. But Welch declined the offer saying it was not in the best interests
of GE shareholders.

The Commission has until July 12 to decide on its final recommendation. But a Commission spokesperson said that a decision could be taken at its next meeting on Tuesday. Otherwise it will probably have to wait until the following meeting on July 11.

Late last week, it emerged that further informal contact had taken place between the Commission and the companies. It was also reported that GE was exploring the possibility of selling 19.9 per cent of its aircraft leasing arm to a non-competitor or financial institution, as a last ditch effort to secure approval.

But the indications were that the new proposals did not go far enough. And given that the formal deadline for concessions and divestitures has passed, it is not clear if such an offer would now be accepted.

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Well, tomorrow's a crucial day for another troubled  merger. Leaders of the European Union will hand down their verdict on the latest terms of General Electric's  proposed merger with Honeywell. The EU's 20-member executive committee is widely expected to reject it at its meeting in Strasbourg. Checking stocks of the two  merger partners, GE, parent of this network, rallied $1.45 today,  Honeywell  slipped further down, 99 cents to $34 even.

General Electric  and Honeywell  International are continuing to lobby the  European Commission for the go-ahead on a $45 bn merger. This would have a speciality chemicals activity of $1.4 bn. The EuropeanCompetition Commissioner is opposed to the deal. A failure of the  merger would put the speciality chemical operations in a difficult position. Before the proposed  merger, some of the chemical activities had been struggling and were possibilities for divestment. Previously, United Technologies had been considering a bid for Honeywell.  Honeywell  had sales of $25 bn in 2000 with 40% from the aerospace sector. Its performance materials division reported an 11% drop in 1Q sales in 2000 to $5.94 bn.

EU Commission set to vote Tuesday on GE Honeywell  deal

BRUSSELS (AP) _ The  European Union's 20-member executive commission is expected to vote Tuesday to reject General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion US purchase of Honeywell  International Inc., barring any last minute proposals or withdrawal of the  merger, EU officials said Monday.
The EU has scheduled a vote on the blockbuster deal at its meeting in Strasbourg, France.
``It's on the agenda and they will vote Tuesday,'' said EU spokesman Michael Tscherny.

EU spokeswoman Amelia Torres said, ``If the merger notification remains on the table, the commission will have to make a decision. She noted, however, that merger approval applications can be withdrawn by the companies at ``at any time.''
``There are no plans for withdrawal,'' GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday.

In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares rose 94 cents to $49.94 US while Honeywell shares fell 86 cents at $34.04 a share.

If the merger were to be officially rejected Tuesday, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the approval process all over again, EU officials said.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S., Canadian and Mexican laws to do business in North America.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal are slim, after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal ``makes no sense'' for his industrial company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said the global giant has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before Tuesday. ``We're not optimistic of approval,'' she said.
Binns refused to comment on whether GE was considering withdrawing its merger application.

General Electric is one of the world's biggest companies with operations around the world in electronics, specialized technology, jet engine and industrial manufacturing, leasing, financing and numerous other businesses. The company has key operations in Canada, centred in Ontario.

Honeywell is a major multinational company, with a focus on measurement technologies and other high-tech businesses. It also has significant operations in Canada.

MERGERS

GeneralElectric has offered to sell a 19.9% stake in leasing arm GECapital Aviation Services (GECAS) in a bid to win European Commission (EC) approval  for its $41 billion  merger with Honeywell.

The informal offer depends on the EC requiring fewer divestitures of Honeywell avionics businesses than offered by GE when it submitted its final proposal on 14 June, reports suggest.

GEis prepared to sell a minority stake in GECAS to a non-competitor, such as a financial institution, sources say. Previous EC proposals that the company sell some or all of its aircraft leasing arm to a competitor or to the public were rejected by GE.
European competitionofficials are concerned that GECAS could use its financial muscle to force clients to buy
GE/Honeywell products.

In return for selling some of GECAS, GE wants the EC to approve the deal with fewer or no divestitures. In its "best and final" proposal, the company offered to sell off Honeywell avionics, engine and other businesses totalling $2.2 billion in annualrevenues.
This fell far short of the $6-7 billion in divestitures reportedly sought by EC competition officials.

GE's offer comes amid unconfirmed reports that some national competition authorities have told the EC they are not opposed to the merger as proposed by GE.

TheEC is required to seek input from member nations before making its final ruling, which was set for 3 July, but could slip if negotiations between the two sides continue. Initial media reports suggested the EC had rejected the revised bid.

STRASBOURG, France -- The  European Union's 20-member executive  commission is expected today to block
General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc.

If the  EU rejects the deal as expected, it would be the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been squashed solely by European regulators.

The EU's veto of the deal had been widely predicted after the companies failed to allay European concerns that the world's largest corporate merger would have an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.
The Commission began its meeting shortly before 7:30 a.m. Eastern time and its top antitrust official Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti scheduled a news conference for about two hours later.

THE HONEYWELL WARS UTC MAY HAVE HELPED PERSUADE EUROPEAN REGULATORS TO OPPOSE
GE'S DEAL; MERGER REACHING CROSSROADS

Jilted suitor United Technologies Corp. had been officially very quiet -- virtually silent -- as  General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. asked  Europe to bless their $41 billion  merger.

But behind the scenes, UTC took sharp aim at its longtime nemesis,  GE, offering legal arguments that apparently helped persuade Europeanregulators to reject the deal.
And now, some UTC executives are wondering whether GE is also taking aim at them.

Hartford-based UTC, which had been in talks with Honeywell last October when GE swooped in to offer a higher price, had to approach this battle carefully. Chairman George David has said he might try again to buy Honeywell if the GE deal did not pan out.

That meant UTC could not afford to antagonize regulators on either side of the Atlantic or the competitors and customers who would have a say in the process. Not to mention, the process is supposed to be confidential.

But Monday a Wall Street Journal report credited UTC with developing the strategy European antitrust officials used to derail the GE-Honeywell merger. The report did not disclose the sources for the story.

Mark Leddy, a Washington lawyer hired by UTC, helped the company argue that GE would be too powerful if it were allowed to buy Honeywell, the report said. UTC essentially maintained that GE had a conflict of interest -- that its aircraft-leasing unit, one of the world's largest buyers of planes, could dictate that manufacturers such as the Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie buy GE-Honeywell aircraft components.
The Journal story laid out UTC's strategy in detail, and quoted a GE lawyer as saying the European Commission
"subcontracted their investigation to United Technologies."

UTC executives said privately they were chagrined to read the report on Monday; some questioned GE's role in providing information to the Journal. They are worried that it might look as if UTC is crowing that it usurped the role of European antitrust regulators. That could sour the relationship between the European Union and UTC - - and possibly hurt any attempt by UTC to gain antitrust approval in the future. Company sources insist UTC did nothing more than state its case against the GE deal.

Neither company would comment officially on the behind-the-scenes machinations. Louise Binns, a spokewoman for GE, said she would not comment on "gossip in the UTC corridors."

Through it all, UTC has also tried to preserve its relationship with Honeywell, realizing it might eventually have another chance to bid for the troubled company.
"If you are going to console a widow, you want to be crying at the funeral, not holding the smoking gun," said
Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.

But Aboulafia said many companies complained to the European Commission that GE would dominate two markets -- aircraft engines and automated controls -- if it were able to merge with Honeywell.

"It's like playing Clue. It's Col. Mustard in the library with the scissors," Aboulafia said, referring to the difficulty in figuring out specifically which arguments motivated European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to nix this deal. "Any number of people had a motive here."

Page 85 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
One industry official said the Europeans were unlikely to base their decision on the argument of any single company. European and American companies were in the mix, including Rolls-Royce PLC, Lufthansa AG, and Rockwell International Corp.

Taking the Clue game analogy one step further, the official said: "I think it's probably multiple wounds caused by different instruments."

Mark J. McCabe, an economics professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the Europeans take a decidedly different approach to antitrust regulation than the American regulators, who approved the deal in May. While the Americans focus most on the impact on consumers, the Europeans examine closely the impact on competitors who could be hurt by a deal.
"It would be surprising if UTC weren't calling and asking for meetings to get their points across," McCabe said. Simon Bishop, the London-based director of competition policy for NERA, an economics consulting firm, said
many competitors get involved in the process.

"The potential commercial benefits from doing that could be substantial," Bishop said. In this case, competitors reportedly were pushing the commission to either reject the deal or force divestitures that would create opportunities for those competitors.

But from the start, UTC was seen as one of those with the most at stake. Both UTC and GE wanted Honeywell, primarily to help build the range of aerospace products they could offer. And neither wanted the other to get Honeywell.

UTC's Pratt & Whitney division and GE Aircraft Engines compete with England's Rolls-Royce for most of the large aircraft engine orders in the world. UTC also owns Hamilton Sundstrand. Whichever parent owned Honeywell could make that company's critical avionics part of any deal.

Both UTC and GE faced potential antitrust concerns about their ability to "bundle" aircraft parts -- to offer a better price on components if purchased together -- as a way of shutting out competitors.

But UTC's lawyers reportedly stressed GE's biggest advantage -- the potential clout of GE's aircraft leasing and financing unit to force aircraft manufacturers to buy GE engines and Honeywell air conditioning, electronic systems and other systems.

In addition to a series of product divestitures, European regulators apparently pushed GE to sell the leasing operation, known as GE Capital Aviation Services, to competitors such as Pratt and Rolls-Royce. GE countered last week with an offer to sell close to 20 percent of GECAS to an independent financial house.
But the deal already had started to unravel, and tensions appeared to be worsening between top executives of
GE and Honeywell.
That left executives at UTC headquarters in Hartford quietly waiting for their chance to step in again. Why Honeywell is so attractive
* Honeywell's line of small jet engines and aerospace systems would be a nice fit for both UTC and General
Electric because it would expand the larger companies' product lines with little duplication.

Competing Views: GE-Honeywell  Deal Gets Caught Up In Diverging Histories --- Consumers vs. Competition: U.S., Europe Chose Sides Reflecting Circumstances --- A Hiatus for Megadeals? By Bob Davis and Anita Raghavan

Antitrust cops in Europe and the U.S. work the same beat, but they don't always patrol the streets the same way.

That is clear from the attempted  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc.  European       regulators tend to worry first of all about whether the merger will hurt business competition. Their American counterparts tend to focus on whether it will hurt consumers.

"The advance of consumer interests . . . is fundamentally the underlying rule of all American antitrust statutes," Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate panel a few days ago. "That's not true in Europe."

Today, the European Commission is scheduled to make a final decision on the $43 billion GE-Honeywell deal at a meeting in Strasbourg, France. There is little expectation that European regulators will withdraw their antitrust objections and approve the merger. That leaves the much larger question of how regulators from similar
free-market democracies arrived at such divergent views in the first place.

The answer lies in some powerful forces -- in the way war, peace and recovery have affected the political and economic development of the U.S. and Europe during the past 50 years. One area in which their paths have diverged since World War II is the care and feeding of the new economy emerging on both sides of the Atlantic. And while the views aren't radically different, their implications can be large.

In the proposed GE-Honeywell merger, European regulators worried about "bundling," or the potential for GE to use its clout to tie two core products into a single package -- jet engines and Honeywell avionics -- and sell it at a price lower than European competitors could match. The European Commission acknowledged that this might lead to lower prices for customers in the short and medium term. But it also worried that it might erode profit margins for GE's rivals and affect competition in the aerospace industry in the long run. U.S. regulators approved the merger after seeking remedies in two areas where they found significant market overlaps, namely helicopter engines and maintenance.

With the GE-Honeywell merger all but dead, corporate executives and government officials are going to be focusing on whether these same kinds of disagreements could arise again. When the deal faltered in Europe, current and former U.S. officials from both parties lobbied the European Commission to change its mind.

The merger's troubled history in Europe also will probably leave a cloud over Wall Street's already-sleepy merger business. "It will slow merger activity down, particularly large deals where the players have reasonable market size," says Christopher Bright, an antitrust lawyer with Shearman & Sterling who has represented GE in its Honeywell merger.

Some prospective deals could be vulnerable. United Technologies Corp., the parent of aircraft maker Pratt & Whitney and the suitor for Honeywell before GE stepped in, is likely to renew its efforts to buy the company. Also awaiting antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic is Nestle SA, which earlier this year unveiled plans to buy Ralston Purina Co. for $10.1 billion.

On the U.S. side, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who heads the aviation subcommittee, has already begun making threats about blocking mergers sought by European companies. Other lawmakers are likely to board an anti-Europe

bandwagon, especially if the U.S. fights with Europe over steel trade intensify. The Bush administration will be under increasing pressure to find a reason to block a merger European companies want, whether for national security or other rationales.

Some officials argue that, despite the views that separate the two sides, they have kept disputes to a minimum. "Our respective rules, while phrased in quite different language, and with very different historical antecedents, are, in most respects, pursuing the same objectives," Mario Monti, the European Commissioner in charge of
competition policy, said a few days ago. Though there has never been "any attempt to harmonize these laws," he added, there has been a "marked convergence" in application of them in recent times.

Charles Stark, who recently left the U.S. Justice Department after heading its international antitrust division and now works for Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, a law firm that represented Honeywell, offers a sports analogy. The European Union's antitrust cops prefer a world that resembles the National Football League: many closely matched teams, battling year after year for dominance. U.S. regulators are comfortable with the New York Yankees model: a powerhouse dynasty free to use its might to acquire players and invest in team development -- provided the fans are still getting to see good baseball at a reasonable price.

European antitrust policy rose from the ashes of World War II. In its formative years, the policy was heavily influenced by the condition of the European continent in the war's aftermath, especially in Germany. Hoping to diminish the power of the industrial barons that had bankrolled the Nazi war machine, the U.S. pushed for West Germany to establish an antitrust policy to make sure that such industrial conglomerates couldn't gain the kind of power they had accumulated in the 1930s.

The German antitrust system, which became the bedrock of European antitrust thinking, had strict legal prohibitions against abuses of dominant position, but the German approach also held that competition was defined by the absence of restrictions on economic freedom. In practical terms, this meant that antitrust policy should be geared toward keeping markets open and allowing as many competitors as possible, even if that reduced efficiency.

Then for a time Europe embraced a cartel-oriented line that departed from the maximum-competitors philosophy. The shift came as Europeans began to think of themselves as a single market rather than a collection of small ones. The Continent's leaders -- West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- also were looking to prevent another war by blocking any one country from controlling the means of war, which then were mainly coal and steel.
These and other key industries were to be organized along Europe-wide rather than national lines.
Trans-European cartel rules were set up in 1952. No central law emerged to check the spread of mergers
because there was a general belief that they "would be good for integration," says New York University antitrust
expert Eleanor Fox.

European countries promoted their so-called national champions through technology grants and government contracts. Aircraft maker Airbus was the exemplar, though at various times, Siemens of Germany, Renault of France and Philips of the Netherlands received such treatment. Eventually, policy makers came to see national champions in other areas -- computers, semiconductors, automobiles, aircraft, defense and other large industries
-- as a way to compete directly with giant companies in the U.S. and Japan.

By the late 1980s, however, European leaders had come to believe that these industrial giants had failed to produce economic growth and still lagged behind in competition with the U.S. and Japan. The new approach was to use antitrust policy to assure more competition, in the belief that this was the only way for Europe to stay healthy in global economic fights. Antitrust thinking moved back closer to its postwar roots.

"Today, the people in charge of antitrust policy are taking an aggressive position on competition because they believe in the bankruptcy of national champions," says Harvard Business School Professor David Yoffie. In short, European thinking became: Keep as many competitors on the field as possible, and the economy will benefit.

In the U.S., antitrust thinking has evolved over a different and longer timeline. The policy began taking shape with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, though the power of that legislation wasn't really brought to bear until the trustbusting Theodore Roosevelt came to the White House a decade later.

Early U.S. trustbusters weren't concerned so much with mergers but with something that is prominent in today's European worries: interlocking trusts, in which a single company can dominate not just one market niche but several. In Roosevelt's time, the interlocking trusts that roused the regulators were those that dominated railroads,

Page 89 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
harvesting machines and oil. "The concern was that big firms could steer customers to themselves, and win business not on the merit," says Prof. Fox of New York University.

Early in the century, the trust-busting impulse led the U.S. to go after Standard Oil, American Tobacco Co. and the DuPont empire. Over time, the impulse came to include proposed mergers. By the 1960s, antitrust policy sometimes was being used essentially to advance a social theory, that small businesses were better for the country than big businesses. "It was clearly social, rather than economic rationales," says James Rill, who was head of Justice Department antitrust enforcement in the first Bush administration.

But by the 1970s, that version of American big-is-bad thinking was changing, as academics and intellectuals began arguing for a different approach. With the arrival of the Reagan administration in the 1980s, a new era of antitrust thought arrived, one that reflected a broad new American belief in the power of markets to make better decisions than social engineers or regulators.

Influenced heavily by conservative economic and legal thinkers mainly at the University of Chicago, the U.S. began to focus on the effect a merger would have on prices, innovation and product development, rather than the fate of the companies left to compete with the new entity. In short, the new approach placed less emphasis on market analysis and more on economic analysis. The focus became how a merger affected the consumer, not how it affected the competitive balance between business rivals.

While Europe and the U.S. have arrived at somewhat different intellectual points, this doesn't mean that there will be constant disagreements, or that the EU is simply against mega-mergers. It allowed the AOL-Time Warner merger, which took effect in January without any required remedies, despite many complaints from some competitors or would-be competitors. And it allowed the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp., which took effect in November 1998.

But concerns about competition can arise. In the Microsoft Corp.-Telewest Communications PLC case last year, the commission argued that by taking control of Telewest, Microsoft would be able to act in concert with Telewest's second major shareholder, AT&T Corp.'s Liberty Media, and coax Telewest into choosing Microsoft software for its cable set-top boxes. Left unrestricted, Microsoft's foray into digital television through joint control of Telewest "could have substantially reduced the technological alternatives available to customers and led to
potentially higher prices for households," the commission feared. In the end, Microsoft had to sever its contractual links with Liberty Media, preventing the software concern from exercising joint control over Telewest. U.S. regulators didn't scrutinize the deal.

It's far too early to make judgments about whether the U.S. or European style of antitrust enforcement makes more sense for the modern economy. To the degree that European regulators protect local companies, and that protects the jobs of those who work there, antitrust policy is one more strand of a social safety net that is badly frayed in the U.S. To the extent that EU policy blocks megamergers -- or frightens companies from attempting such combinations -- it probably affects the U.S. and European economies equally because the companies involved are global concerns.

The imbroglio could have some positive effects. The dispute will put renewed emphasis on coming up with some common rules on antitrust enforcement, not just between the U.S. and Europe, but with the 60 or so nations that have merger controls. Indeed, says Gary Hufbauer, a trade economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., the dispute could give impetus to a new round of global trade talks, which could include competition policy.

And while the collapse of the GE-Honeywell merger would "probably deter any really big deals," says Robert Litan, a former Clinton antitrust official now at the Brookings Institution in Washington, "if we end up with a world with fewer megacompanies, I'm not sure we're worse off."

EU Commission expected to veto GE-Honeywell  tie-up

BRUSSELS, July 3 (AFP) - The European Commission was widely expected Tuesday to veto a proposed 45 billion dollar (52 billion  euro) merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  International, seeing off a perceived threat to  competition in the aircraft leasing industry.

If it does so, it will mark the first time that a US corporate  merger has been blocked exclusively by EU authorities. It also would risk opening new sores in transatlantic relations.
US President George W. Bush and his chief trade negotiator Robert Zoellick have both expressed concern, while
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has warned it would be "off the wall" for Brussels to block the merger.

EU competition regulators say the link-up of GE and Honeywell's heavyweight aerospace activities would give the new group unfair advantage over competitors in civil passenger aircraft and avionics markets.
"The issue is that of competition, regardless of where the company is based," a Commission spokeswoman said. Reports said the EU wanted GE -- a major manufacturer of jet engines -- to spin off or sell one of its most
profitable units, GE Capital Aviation Services, because of fears it might preferentially use Honeywell components
to the detriment of competitors, several of which are European.

GE announced its plans to purchase Honeywell last October. US officials have already given a green light the deal, leaving the EU as the last hurdle.
Lobbying hard in Brussels against the merger have been United Technologies, which had plans to acquire
Honeywell before GE came into the picture, and Rockwell International.

GE is the world's biggest conglomerate, with interests ranging from aerospace and financial services to mass media and home appliances. Under its legendary chairman Jack Welch it is regularly ranked as America's most admired company.
As of late Monday, GE and Honeywell had not made use of their option of withdrawing their notification to the
Commission of the proposed deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti was due to give a press conference Tuesday following a Commission meeting in Strasbourg, where the European Parliament is also holding its monthly plenary.
One of the European Commission's roles is that of competition watchdog for the 15 countries that make up the
European Union.

Last year GE reported a turnover of 130 billion dollars and a profit of 12.7 billion dollars. Its stock market capitalisation is 475 billion dollars, making it the world's top industrial group.

For the same year, Honeywell pulled in revenues of 25 billion dollars, nearly half of which came from its aeronautics activities. Its Aerospace Solutions unit reported an operating profit of 2.2 billion dollars -- the lion's share of the entire group's profit of 3.6 billion dollars.

EU blocks  GE-Honeywell  merger

ATTENTION - ADDS  Monti quotes by Robert MacPherson

BRUSSELS, July 3 (AFP) - The European Commission, in a widely expected decision, Tuesday blocked the proposed 45 billion dollar (52 billion euro) blockbuster merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  International.
"The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of
Honeywell  Inc.," the 20- member  commission, meeting in Strasbourg, said in a statement issued in Brussels.

It marked the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU authorities, and risked opening new sores in relations between Europe and the United States.

Had it gone through, the GE-Honeywell deal would have been the biggest industrial takeover in corporate history. It also would have capped the remarkable career of GE's legendary chairman Jack Welch.

"This merger, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said EU Competition Commission Mario Monti.

"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," Monti said in Strasbourg, the French city where the commission meets once a month alongside the European Parliament.

But he added: "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the commission's competition concerns."

General Electric, reguarly ranked as America's most admired company, has interests ranging from aerospace and financial services to mass media -- it owns the NBC television network -- and GE- branded home appliances.
But Monti said the commission was mainly concerned that the merger would have left GE-Honeywell with
"dominant positions" in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines.

It also, he said, would have strengthened GE's existing dominant position in manufacturing jet engines that power large commercial and regional jet aircraft.
Monti rejected warnings that the decision would strain EU-US relations, particularly after US Treasury Secretary
Paul O'Neill said last week that a thumbs-down from the Europeans would be nothing less than "off the wall."

He said his staff had worked closely with the US Justice Department on the case, but that in rare instances such as this one, "we might interpret facts differently."

As for O'Neill's claim that the European Commission was "the closest thing you can find to an autocratic organization," Monti simply said: "You will allow me not to comment."

Welch announced GE's plans to purchase Honeywell last October, and postponed his retirement to see the deal through. US officials gave their green light the deal, leaving the European Commission as the last hurdle.
Lobbying hard in Brussels against the merger have been United Technologies, which had plans to acquire
Honeywell before GE came into the picture, and Rockwell International.

Last year GE reported a turnover of 130 billion dollars and a profit of 12.7 billion dollars. Its stock market capitalisation is 475 billion dollars, making it the world's top industrial group.

GE criticizes EU decision on Honeywell  merger

English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, July 3 (AFP) - General Electric  on Tuesday criticized the decision by the  European Commission
to block its proposed merger with Honeywell,  saying the move was not justified by the facts.
"We are deeply disappointed by today's decision by the EuropeanCommission to block GE's acquisition of
Honeywell,"  the statement said.

"We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services. The facts just don't support these assertions. We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."
GE Chairman and CEO Jack Welch said, "I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and
Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

GE criticizes EU decision on Honeywell  merger

ATTENTION - ADDS details, background
NEW YORK, July 3 (AFP) - General Electric  on Tuesday criticized the decision by the  European Commission
to block its proposed merger with Honeywell,  saying the move was not justified by the facts.
"We are deeply disappointed by today's decision by the EuropeanCommission to block GE's acquisition of
Honeywell,"  the statement said.

"We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services. The facts just don't support these assertions. We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."

The European Commission, in a widely expected decision, Tuesday blocked the proposed 45 billion dollar (52 billion euro) merger, claiming it "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

It marked the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU authorities, and risked opening new sores in relations between Europe and the United States.

The US administration and some members of Congress have expressed concern about Brussels blocking a merger of the two US industrial conglomerates,

In a statement, GE Chairman and CEO Jack Welch said, "I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

GE said the EC "took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the US, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any conditions."

The statement added that "GE and Honeywell agreed on two different proposals to clear the deal, offering very significant concessions to meet the Commission's concerns. Both were rejected by the Commission."

NEW YORK, July 3 (AFP) - Stocks drifted lower in a shortened pre- holiday session Tuesday in the wake of DuPont's profit warning and news the  European Union officially blocked the  General Electric-  Honeywell            merger.

The Dow Jones industrials fell 22.41 points (0.21 percent) to 10,571.31 and the Nasdaq composite declined 10.51 points (0.49 percent) to 2,138.21.
The Standard and Poor's 500 was down 2.67 points (0.22 percent) to 1,234.04 at the 1:00 pm (1700 GMT) close. Breadth on the New York Stock Exchange was positive, with gainers outpacing decliners 1,639 to 1,495.
The market opened lower as investors mulled the latest earnings warnings, notably DuPont's announcement Monday that second quarter profits will be well below forecasts as the global economic slowdown spreads to Europe and Asia.

"DuPont has put a little fear in the market," said Morgan Stanley senior trader Michael Lyons. "But most people aren't too happy to be here today and it's not easy to get them to do anything. The pre- announcements have set the tone."

Further gloomy earnings news came from mainly second-line technology companies and an official decision from the European Commission to block GE's merger with Honeywell.

EU competition commissioner Mario Monti said a second set of remedies offered by GE "did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure."

Dealers said there was little impetus for the market in either direction as the Independence Day holiday is celebrated Wednesday.

"I don't expect much to happen for the rest of the week," said Lyons. "A lot of people will just make a week of it so it'll stay very quiet."
GE shares closed down 80 cents at 49.40. Honeywell was up 99 cents at 35.10. DuPont shares ended down 92 cents at 47.20.
In the technology sector, Qualcomm shares were up 6.00 or 10.4 percent at 63.87 after Nokia expanded the terms of a CDMA agreement to allow the US company to market CDMA components.
In the financial sector, JP Morgan Chase shares were up 10 cents at 45.60, Bank of America shed one cent at
60.49 and Citigroup was down 43 cents at 53.05.

On the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 5.382 percent from 5.326 percent Monday and on the 30-year bond to 5.725 percent from 5.694 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.

GE chief deprived  of business coup
Valerie Leroux
438 words
3 July 2001

(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, July 3 (AFP) -  General Electric  chairman Jack Welch, a legendary figure in US business circles, appears to have lost the chance to cap a remarkable career with the acquisition of  Honeywell  International.

The European Commission announced Tuesday its long-expected decision to block the  merger, prompting protests from GE and costing Welch his greatest business coup.

GE was a sleeping giant when Welch took control more than 20 years ago and he transformed the company from top to bottom, making it into the world's largest conglomerate.
His final act was to be the Honeywell merger and he delayed his retirement, set for April, to pull it off.

When he hatched the plan eight months ago, Welch gave little thought to concern in Brussels about monopoly power in the aerospace industry that eventually sank the deal.

The deal had won approval from US regulators after GE had made some concessions. If Welch thought that the political clout of the US government was enough to carry the deal in Europe, he miscalculated.
Back in October, Welch outbid rival United Technologies Corporation (UTC) with a 42 billion dollar offer for
Honeywell following a dramatic, fast-paced move worthy of a master poker player.
Informed by a journalist that UTC and Honeywell were close to a deal, Welch pounced, reactivating a plan to buy
Honeywell that GE had in fact put together the previous year.

General Electric, a diversified conglomerate active in range of activities from energy, to airplane engines to television networks, is no stranger to the takeover game. But while it averages around 100 acquisitions a year, none approached the magnitude of the Honeywell deal.

Honeywell chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore disclosed that Welch's decision to postpone his April retirement had been "critical" in Honeywell's acceptance of the GE offer.

When told by Bonsignore that Honeywell directors might turn sour on the GE bid if Welch were to leave the scene as planned in April, according to the Wall Street Journal, Welch bluntly told him: "I'm not retiring."
"I realized we were making the biggest deal in GE history and we had to make it the most successful deal in GE
history," Welch told the paper.

On his watch, General Electric's annual net earnings have risen from around two billion dollars to 12 billion, while its stock market value has soared from 13 billion dollars in 1981 to nearly 500 billion.

Welch has also overseen the integration of a range of activities, including nuclear reactors, airplane engines, financial services and media.

Moody's  says Honeywell  rating under review for possible downgrade
216 words
3 July 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
NEW YORK, July 3 (AFP) - Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday it was reviewing the credit rating of Honeywell  for a possible downgrade in the wake of the  rejection by European Union authorities of its  merger with General Electric.

"The revision of the rating review considers the continuing weak operating performance of  Honeywell,  the difficult economic outlook which could limit the prospects for any material performance improvement over the near term, and the potential for continued weak debtholder protection measures," Moody's said.

"The revision also considers the uncertainty about the company's future strategy after the collapse of the transaction with GE. For a number of months, Honeywell has operated under an anticipation of being acquired by GE. While the potential exists for alternate bidders to emerge ... Honeywell may continue as an independent
entity for some time."

Moody's noted that whatever the strategy for Honeywell, it "will need to reassess its business and operating performance, investment requirements, potential asset dispositions, financing strategies and shareholder initiatives during the near term."

Moody's has about 6.5 billion dollar in outstanding debt that is affected by the rating. Moody's currently has a top rating of A2 and Prime-1 for its debt.

GE criticizes EU decision on Honeywell  merger
565 words
3 July 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
WASHINGTON, July 3 (AFP) - General Electric  criticized Tuesday's decision by the  European Commission to block its proposed merger with Honeywell,  but there was no immediate sign that the move would create new political tensions.

"We are deeply disappointed by today's decision by the EuropeanCommission to block GE's acquisition of Honeywell,"  a GE statement said after the Commission killed its proposed 45 billion dollar takeover of Honeywell  International.

Although both firms have a variety of industrial activities, it was the dominant position of the aerospace sector they would have that troubled European regulators.
GE insisted that these concerns were unjustified.

"We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services," GE said.

"The facts just don't support these assertions. We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."
The action in Brussels marked the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU
authorities, and risked opening new sores in relations between Europe and the United States.

The US administration and some members of Congress had previously expressed concern about Brussels blocking a merger of the two US industrial conglomerates, although there was no immediate reaction to Tuesday's decision.

In a statement, GE Chairman and CEO Jack Welch said, "I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."
GE said the EC "took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the United
States, Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any conditions."
But Edward Graham, a former US Treasury official who is now a senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think tank dismissed concerns about new US-EU trade frictions.
The US and EU are not looking for an excuse to start "throwing bombs at each other," he said.

Graham said he believed European anti-trust officials gave GE's top executive the perfect cover for getting out of a merger.

"The EU now gives him great cover for probably never admitting that this was a mistake, but in his heart knowing that this was a mistake and that it was not in GE's best interest to go ahead with this merger," Graham said.

There was no immediate reaction from Honeywell, but media reports said a board meeting was expected to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore.

Analysts said the collapse of the deal leaves Honeywell in a vulnerable position with a strong need to reinforce its core technology businesses.

"There is urgency to recarve the strategic vision," said Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel, who added that the company will likely post weak earnings because of the distraction of the merger.

Rubel said Honeywell would be advised to go it alone for the moment, since another failed deal would damage its franchise.

"Investor expectations are low, but the need for showing grate leadership and vision is high," he said. "The opportunity is great to put the failures of the year in the past."

European Commission Set to Vote on GE-Honeywell  Merger

AHCV

The European Commission is set to vote on the  GE-Honeywell  merger.

SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN ANCHOR: For the latest on the  GE-Honeywell  deal, let's check in with CNN's Diana Muriel. She joins us live now from Strasbourg, France, where the European Commission is meeting to vote on the deal.
Hello -- Diana.
DIANA MURIEL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Susan.

Yes, the 20-strong European Commission, which is the European Union's executive arm, will be starting their meeting in approximately 40 minutes time here in Strasbourg. Unless they receive a full withdrawal of the merger from both GE and Honeywell, they will continue with their agenda. They will vote on the merger as it currently stands, and as it currently stands, they are likely to move to veto it.
They will then make their announcement at a press conference at 3:00 in the afternoon Central European time,
9:00 in the morning Eastern Standard Time, where Mario Monti, who's the European competition commissioner,
will make the announcement as to what the outcome of that vote has been.

But it's very likely, at this stage, that it will be a block to the merger. That's because both GE and Honeywell have given no notification of a withdrawal. As I say, it will take both companies to move. Honeywell is unlikely to make
a formal application for a withdrawal, because they want to see enshrined, if you like, on GE's record, that it's in a dominant position, that it has anti-competitive practices, if you like.

And that could lead the way open for the other companies who compete against GE, perhaps in other fields, to make complaints to the European Commission about their dominant position.
As a result of the failure of this deal -- if that is indeed how the vote goes -- we could also see Honeywell sue GE
for failing to bring the deal to a positive conclusion, for failing to use reasonable best efforts to conclude the deal.

As far as GE is concerned, it's very likely now that if the deal does not go ahead, as is likely, that Jack Welch, the chief executive officer of GE, will bring forward his retirement. He stayed on. He delayed his retirement in order to see this deal go through. It's likely that he will then leave the company very soon, in the next few weeks.

And both companies could be looking for alternative deals. It's possible that United Technologies, which was talking with Honeywell about a possible deal last October -- before GE came in with a higher offer -- will resume those negotiations for a possible merger between those two companies. But at what price is a moot point. It's unlikely to be at the same price that was being discussed in October, given the fall in the Honeywell share price in the meantime -- Susan.
LISOVICZ: Diana Muriel, in Strasbourg, France, thank you.

EU blocks  GE-Honeywell  merger, fearing it would dominate  engine and avionics market

NEW YORK (AP) -  General Electric's  $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International was vetoed Tuesday by the European Union - the first time a  merger of two U.S. companies has been stopped solely by Europeanregulators.
The decision by the  EU's 20-member Competition Commission in Strasbourg, France, was unanimous.

The merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as Honeywell's chairman and chief executive after the commission's rejection.
He will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which
in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

GE chief executive Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, characterizing the widely expected rejection as a setback. But analysts said the deal - one of the biggest industrial mergers in history - is probably dead.

The deal had won regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust regulators but ran into resistance from the EU, angering some members of Congress. President Bush also expressed concern.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The commission vetoed the deal after executives failed to allay European fears that their merged company would dominate markets for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since 1990, six have been taken to court. None of the challenges has been successful.
The combined company would have been a behemoth.

Honeywell, with some 120,000 employees worldwide, makes industrial materials such as plastics and chemicals as well as equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and factories.

GE is best known for making light bulbs and appliances, but it also includes NBC and makes power plant parts and aircraft engines. It has 313,000 employees.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators. But GE rejected the revisions Friday.

The Wall Street Journal had reported that Honeywell's board of directors would oust Bonsignore as a result of the failed deal.
GE fell 69 cents to $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell rose 99 cents to $35.10.

EU blocks  dlrs 41 billion GE-Honeywell  merger over fears they would dominate  engine and avionics market.

STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The  European Union blocked General Electric  Co.'s dlrs 41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  Commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

A statement from the Commission added that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

It said the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The Commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity said both companies were notified immediately after the decision.

The companies' plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
A statement from GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the decision.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company has not decided whether it will appeal the decision. In the statement, GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch referred to the decision as a "setback."

Nicholas Heymann, a General Electric analyst with Prudential Securities, said the response suggested GE may appeal the decision.
"It's a very good chance," Heymann said. "I think that remains a very real possibility."

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President George W. Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.
Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal - WorldCom-Sprint
- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
Honeywell's Crane would not comment Tuesday on the newspaper report.
In late morning trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares fell 93 cents to dlrs 49.27, while
Honeywell shares gained dlrs 1.01 to dlrs 35.12 a share.

NEW YORK (AP) - Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission. The ruling was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, however, announcing that chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore had resigned and saying it expected to remain an independent company.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion of this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.

Late Tuesday, Honeywell's Bossidy said the merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but that "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

He made it clear that his mandate is to turn Honeywell around as a standalone company, saying one of his main tasks would be to "try to encourage people to forget the past and forget what might have been and refocus on tomorrow."

A statement from the Commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was modified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The Commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded," he said.

Still, dissension is rare. Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal - WorldCom-Sprint - was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

Last Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would have also pared more than $1 billion from the takeover price. In return for lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

Monti left the meeting and made no comment.
The decision marks the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been squashed solely by
European regulators.

The EU's veto had been widely predicted after the companies failed to allay European concerns that the world's largest cooperate merger would have an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.

Reports over the weekend had suggested the two U.S. companies may withdraw the merger in the face of opposition from the European regulators. But GE's Sheffer said Monday that "there are no plans for withdrawal."
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares fell 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

The companies plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive
Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

EU rejects GE-Honeywell  merger;  Wants to consult US on future rulings

STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The  European Union rejected General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday and its antitrust chief suggested  EU and U.S.  regulators should work closer to prevent future mega-merger disagreements.

"GE-Honeywell  is a rare case where the trans-Atlantic  competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try to reduce this risk further," said EUCompetition Commission Mario Monti.

The EU veto of a GE-Honeywell merger marked the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies was blocked solely by European regulators.
The measure was approved by regulators by the U.S. Department of Justice May 2.
He criticized political pressure on the EU to ensure the GE-Honeywell linkup received the go-ahead.
Monti spoke of "unprecedented" comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill questioning the EU executive
Commission's authority to judge merger cases.
U.S. senators have accused EU regulators of protectionism and before the EU veto was announced, President
George W. Bush also expressed his concern.

Monti insisted the European veto was judged solely on its anticipated impact on fair competition, not political grounds.

"The nationality of companies was totally irrelevant for us," he told a news conference, pointing out that competitors that complained about the deal included both Americans and Europeans.

Under EU rules, the European Commission must approve mergers of companies whose combined worldwide turnover exceeds 5 billion euros (around dlrs 4.24 billion) and have European sales of at least 250 million euros (around dlrs 170 million).

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded," he said.

Monti said he was "genuinely interested in understanding why" American regulators had made a different forecast of the impact of a GE-Honeywell merger.
He said it showed the need to "enhance cooperation in antitrust matters."

The companies' plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none as so far been successful. In three cases, he court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

In separate statements, GE and Honeywell expressed dismay at the EU veto of their merger plans.
"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," said
GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch.

The unanimous veto by the 20-member European Commission was expected after GE failed to allay European fears its merger plans would create an aerospace giant with unfair dominance in European markets.
Monti said the companies "vastly belated, highly publicized remedies did not resolve the problems identified." These focused on fears a GE-Honeywell linkup would have lead to a dominant share of the market for corporate
jet engines, cockpit electronics as well as jet engines for large commercial and regional jets.

Additionally, the EU argued that through its aircraft-financing and leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, GE could force the price of planes up. It rejected GE's offer to sell a minority stake in GECAS arguing it didn't change the structure of its control of GECAS' purchasing policy.
General Electric Co. is one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It makes power plant parts,
plane engines, appliances and owns the NBC television network. Honeywell makes aerospace, power generation,
transportation and factory automation systems, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial
materials.
GE said on Oct. 23 it would buy Honeywell for more than dlrs 40 billion in stock.
On March 1, the EU launched an in-depth probe into the linkup and issued a formal statement of objections on
May 8, six days after the proposed merger was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Last month. GE chief executive Jack Welch flew to Brussels to try to win EU approval for the merger but said that the Europeans were making "extraordinary demands" for antitrust clearance.

Text of EU statement  on GE-Honeywell  merger

STRASBOURG, France AP) - The following is the text of the EuropeanCommission's statement explaining its veto of the  GE-Honeywell  merger:

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of Honeywell  Inc. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aero-engines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the  Commission concluded that the  merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

" The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed, " European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, adding : " I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns".

Mr Monti also said, in relation to the co-operation with the US antitrust authorities:"The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close co-operation during this investigation. It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded. This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways . The
GE-Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strenghten our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further ".

GE and Honeywell notified their merger agreement for regulatory clearance in Europe on 5 February this year. On March 1, the Commission started an in-depth investigation which demonstrated that GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Its strong market position combined with its financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft leasing were among the factors that led to the finding of GE's dominance in these markets. The investigation also showed that Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (i.e., a key input in the manufacturing of engines).

The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would
have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities and of the combination of their respective complementary products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies into the products of one another. This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices.

On 14 June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these concerns which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the Commission. On 28 June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies. This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.

Given the nature of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger and the fact that the GE was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no choice but prohibit the merger.
Background on EU merger control
This is only the 15th time the Commission has blocked a merger since September 1990, when it became the
one-stop shop for mergers and acquisitions requiring regulatory approval in the European Economic Area - the 15
European Union states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. And it is only the second time it prohibits a
merger involving only American firms.

The Commission has authority to review all mergers, acquisitions and takeover bids and other deals that can be defined as a 'concentration', involving companies with a combined turnover worldwide in excess of 5 billion euros and European sales of at least 250 million euros for at least two of the companies concerned. The key test for assessing mergers in Europe is whether they create or strengthen a dominant position.

European merger control is not about protecting competitors but about ensuring that markets remain sufficiently competitive in the long run so that consumers benefit from sufficient choice, innovation and competitive prices.

This does not mean that one authority is doing a technical analysis and the other pursuing a political goal, as some might pretend, but simply that we might interpret facts differently and forecast the effects of an operation in different ways . The
GE-Honeywell is a rare case where the trans-Atlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral co-operation in the future to try and reduce this risk further."

GE and Honeywell notified their merger agreement for regulatory clearance in Europe on 5 February this year. On March 1, the Commission started an in-depth investigation which demonstrated that GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Its strong market position combined with its financial strength and vertical integration into aircraft leasing were among the factors that led to the finding of GE's dominance in these markets. The investigation also showed that Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (i.e., a key input in the manufacturing of engines).

The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in the markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets. The dominance would
have been created or strengthened as a result of horizontal overlaps in some markets as well as through the extension of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell activities and of the combination of their respective complementary products. Such integration would enable the merged entity to leverage the respective market power of the two companies into the products of one another. This would have the effect of foreclosing competitors, thereby eliminating competition in these markets, ultimately affecting adversely product quality, service and consumers' prices.

On 14 June, GE proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these concerns which were considered insufficient to remove the competition problems identified by the Commission. On 28 June, well beyond the deadline for the submission of undertakings, GE proposed a new set of remedies. This new package could not be accepted either, because it did not resolve the problems identified in a sufficiently clear way at such a very late stage in the procedure.

Given the nature of the competition concerns resulting from the proposed merger and the fact that the GE was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no choice but prohibit the merger.
Background on EU merger control
This is only the 15th time the Commission has blocked a merger since September 1990, when it became the
one-stop shop for mergers and acquisitions requiring regulatory approval in the European Economic Area - the 15
European Union states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. And it is only the second time it prohibits a
merger involving only American firms.

The Commission has authority to review all mergers, acquisitions and takeover bids and other deals that can be defined as a 'concentration,' involving companies with a combined turnover worldwide in excess of 5 billion euros and European sales of at least 250 million euros for at least two of the companies concerned. The key test for assessing mergers in Europe is whether they create or strengthen a dominant position.

European merger control is not about protecting competitors but about ensuring that markets remain sufficiently competitive in the long run so that consumers benefit from sufficient choice, innovation and competitive prices.

Text of EU statement  on GE-Honeywell  merger

The following is the text of the European Commission's statement explaining its veto of the GE-Honeywell        
merger:

The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of Honeywell  Inc. This follows an in-depth investigation in the markets for aero-engines, avionics and other aircraft components and systems. In adopting this decision, the  Commission concluded that the  merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines. However, there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said, adding: "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

Mr. Monti also said, in relation to the co-operation with the U.S. antitrust authorities: "The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close co-operation during this investigation. It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions, but each authority has to perform its own assessment and the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded.

Honeywell  CEO Bonsignore resigns  after merger with GE rejected

NEW YORK (AP) - Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday following the EuropeanCommission's rejection of the company's planned $41 billion  merger with General Electric  Co.
Bonsignore, 60, will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

Bossidy, 66, said Honeywell's board wants him to focus on turning the company as a standalone operation, instead of breaking it up, as some analysts had speculated.

The merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but Bossidy said "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

"The idea is to stay independent, to get this company back on its feet," Bossidy said, adding that the merger process has been a major distraction for Honeywell and its 120,000 workers.

Some Honeywell assets will probably be sold and jobs cuts are likely, but Bossidy said a more pressing task is to convince employees thinking about leaving the company that they should stay on.
"One of the priorities is to retain people who were otherwise going to leave," he said.

Bossidy faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first quarter profits fall 92 percent, also said Tuesday that second quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts surveyed
by Thomson Financial/First Call.
With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Conn.-based United
Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as a likely Honeywell suitor.

Bossidy didn't rule out the possibility of Honeywell entering into another combination at some point, but said his task is to rebuild the company. He plans to stay on the job about a year.

"I have some heart and soul in this company. I hate to see it frankly in the condition it is in right now. ... I'm not here for a new career, but for a time I can restore stability," Bossidy said.
United Technologies, which makes jet engines and elevators and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked
that deal last fall.
A GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner. GE
hasn't ruled out an appeal.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

Page 139 of 153 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass," Heymann said.
Bossidy, however, said any divestitures Honeywell makes would not cut into its core aerospace business. Honeywell is known for its technology and creativity, but Heymann said that Bonsignore had failed to execute the
financial restructuring required after AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell for $14 billion in December 1999.

The combined company, which kept Honeywell's better-known name, makes equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and automated controls for homes, factories and other buildings, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial materials.

Bossidy said he was first contacted about taking the top Honeywell job about three weeks ago. He declined comment when asked whether Bonsignore was pressured to resign by Honeywell's board.
"I wasn't involved in those discussions," Bossidy said.

He acknowledged talking with GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch Tuesday morning, before his appointment was announced, but would not tell reporters what was said.
"We just had a general conversation and arranged a golf game," Bossidy quipped.

Bossidy was previously chairman of AlliedSignal and Honeywell after they merged, retiring in April 2000 and handing the reins to Bonsignore, who had been the Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive.

Bonsignore then started an aggressive cost-cutting program and bolstered Honeywell's Internet business strategy.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity.

By this April, as the economic slowdown took hold, sales in key markets continued to slump. The company again cited higher costs, but also blamed decisions to halt some business activities and delay plans to sell its consumer automotive products and friction materials businesses because of its pending merger with General Electric.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's on Tuesday affirmed its "stable" ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has "substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial policy."
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents at $35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) - Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell International Tuesday following the  European Commission's rejection of the company's planned dlrs 41 billion merger with General Electric  Co.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

"We will move quickly and aggressively to improve our performance, further strengthen our management team and rebuild the confidence of our shareowners, customers and employees," Bossidy said in a statement.

"We will re-energize and refocus our employees and, with their hard work, Honeywell will create greater shareowner value and resume our journey to become a premier global company."

Bonsignore faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first quarter profits fall 92 percent, said Tuesday that second quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Despite Bossidy's statement, Honeywell's future remains unclear. With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as the most likely Honeywell suitor.
United Technologies, which makes jet engines and elevators and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked
that deal last fall.

However, a GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner. GE hasn't ruled out an appeal, saying it is leaving all its options open.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed "surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity."

By this April, as the economy cooled, sales in key markets continued to slump. The company again cited higher costs, but also blamed decisions to halt some business activities and delay plans to sell its consumer automotive products and friction materials businesses because of its pending merger with General Electric.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 of its 125,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's on Tuesday affirmed its "stable" ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has "substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial policy."
Honeywell shares closed up 99 cents at dlrs 35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

NEW YORK (AP) - Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

DETROIT (AP) - Despite record June sales of its popular Explorer sport utility vehicle, Ford Motor Co. reported a
7.8 percent decline in sales of vehicles sold under the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands compared with June
2000.

Total U.S. sales of car and trucks produced by General Motors Corp. slipped about 3 percent, but light truck sales remained strong.

Meanwhile, the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG experienced a reversal of fortune, showing a 1.4 percent increase in U.S. sales.

VIENNA, Austria (AP) - OPEC members agreed Tuesday to continue pumping oil at current levels but braced for softer crude prices as Iraq showed a willingness to resume its oil shipments.

Delegates from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced their decision after a formal meeting at the cartel's headquarters in Vienna.
OPEC pumps about two-fifths of the world's oil, with an official production of 24.2 million barrels a day.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Orders to factories registered their largest increase in nearly a year, boosted by stronger demand for cars, semiconductors and industrial machinery.

The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that factory orders rebounded in May, rising 2.5 percent, after falling by 3.4 percent the month before.

The latest snapshot of manufacturing activity was better than many analysts were expecting. They had forecast that factory orders would rise by 1.5 percent in May. The advance was the largest since a 7.5 percent gain posted in June 2000.

Manufacturers have been hardest hit by the economic slowdown which began last year. To cope with flagging demand, companies have cut back production and laid off workers.
But recent reports have offered signs that the economy and the climate for manufacturers may be improving.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - The bidders for Wachovia Corp. are creating their own fireworks.
SunTrust Banks Inc., which is bidding for Wachovia against First Union Corp., sent a letter to the Federal Reserve
System this week asking it to investigate whether the Charlotte bank was using a questionable tax shelter.
SunTrust's letter, mailed late Monday in response to First Union's correspondence with the Federal Reserve, said
First Union's filings on its proposed merger with Wachovia contained "significant shortcomings."

The letter also accused First Union of using a complex tax shelter known as a lease-in/lease-out deal, which was outlawed by the Treasury Department in 1999.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) - BroadVision Corp.'s stock plunged more than 18 percent Tuesday after the software maker said losses will fall far short of expectations, a third of its work force has been cut and its chief financial officer resigned.
Preliminary estimates indicate the company lost between 17 cents and 20 cents per share for the quarter ended
June 30. Analysts were expecting a loss of 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.

Second-quarter revenue is now expected to be between $52 million to $58 million, sharply down from the $85 million forecast by analysts.

CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) - Apple Computer Inc. said Tuesday it will suspend indefinitely production of the Power
Mac G4 Cube.

The company said there is a small chance it will reintroduce an upgraded model of the computer in the future, but that there are no plans to do so at the moment.

Apple first introduced the snazzy-looking Mac Cube last year, but product sales were hurt by its steep price and public perceptions the computer - which featured a 450-megahertz chip - was much slower than competing systems. The Cube was introduced at a price of $1,799; the price was cut to $1,499 in January.

Customers also complained of cracks in its plastic case and misaligned switches that caused the machine to turn off unexpectedly.

ATLANTA (AP) - Airlines have grounded several Boeing 757 jets while they scramble to make repairs or find replacement parts because of cracks in the air-flow blades of their Pratt & Whitney engines.
At least two in-flight engine failures have been blamed on the cracks since late last year.

The cracking has happened in the stator vane, a stationary blade made of steel alloy that helps direct air flow through the engine.
The cracking can cause an engine to shut down. But the 757 has two engines and can fly on one.

Pratt & Whitney, based in East Hartford, Conn., is working with airlines to repair or replace the part, which it is redesigning. But the new design will not be tested and certified for use until December.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - AMF Bowling Worldwide, the world's largest operator of bowling centers, filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday under a plan that would allow it to repay debt and restructure its operations.

AMF said in April that it would likely file for Chapter 11 protection under the federal bankruptcy code to help it reorganize.

Lenders have agreed to provide the Mechanicsville-based company with up to $75 million in financing so it can keep funding its own operation, company officials said.

AMF's 518 centers will remain open. The company operates 400 centers in the U.S. and 118 centers in 10 other countries.

Under the company's reorganization plan, AMF will repay loans with a combination of cash, debt and common stock worth about $625 million.

EU Commission set to vote on GE Honeywell

Monti left the meeting and made no comment.
The decision marks the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been squashed solely by
European regulators.

The EU's veto had been widely predicted after the companies failed to allay European concerns that the world's largest cooperate merger would have an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.

Reports over the weekend had suggested the two U.S. companies may withdraw the merger in the face of opposition from the European regulators. But GE's Sheffer said Monday that "there are no plans for withdrawal."
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares fell 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

The companies plans now were not immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.
On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive
Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.
Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal - WorldCom-Sprint
- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

EU Commission to vote on GE Honeywell  merger

STRASBOURG, France (AP) - The  European Union's 20-member executive  Commission is expected Tuesday to block General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc.

If the  EU rejects the deal as expected, it would be the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been squashed solely by European regulators.

The EU's veto of the deal had been widely predicted after the companies failed to allay European concerns that the world's largest cooperate merger would have an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.

Reports over the weekend had suggested the two U.S. companies may withdraw the merger in the face of opposition from the European regulators. But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said Monday that "there are no plans for withdrawal."
In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, GE shares were up $1.20 to close at $50.20, while
Honeywell shares were down 79 cents and closed at $34.11 a share.

If the merger is officially rejected, GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again.

The chances that GE will submit a revised proposal appeared dim after GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell on Friday. GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.
GE spokeswoman Louise Binns said GE has no plans to make further proposals to the Europeans before
Tuesday. "We're not optimistic of approval," she said Friday.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.
