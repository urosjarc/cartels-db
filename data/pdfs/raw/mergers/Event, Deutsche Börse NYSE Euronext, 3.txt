MARKET TALK: NYSE Euronext  May Bid For LCH.Clearnet Again -RBC

(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
0923 GMT [Dow Jones] NYSE Euronext (NYX) could re-emerge as a bidder for LCH.Clearnet if  NYSE Euronext's planned merger with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) collapses, says RBC Capital Markets analyst Peter Lenardos. Lenardos notes London Stock Exchange (LSE.LN) is still in exclusive talks to buy a stake in LCH.Clearnet,
though any deal between LSE and LCH.Clearnet "could be delayed" pending the result of the DB-NYSE Euronext deal. Adds: "Thus, the shareholders of LCH.Clearnet may be waiting to see if more attractive bids are received." NYSE Euronext couldn't be immediately reached for comment.  Deutsche Boerse shares are 0.3% higher at EUR45.42. (vladimir.guevarra@dowjones.com)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The proposed merger of NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEF)
would hinder competition, the European Union's antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said Friday.

"My conclusion is that some problems of competition will not be solved by this  merger but will be aggravated," he told Bloomberg TV in an interview in Davos, Switzerland.

Almunia's comments support expectations that the European Commission will block the deal when it announces its decision Feb. 1.

Executives from both exchanges have been fiercely lobbying for their case and have hoped to win political support at the Davos World Economic Forum.

Almunia has previously criticized the would-be merged company's market dominance in the Europe-listed derivatives business, in which it would have a combined market share of about 93%.

The proposed merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext -- which now looks almost certain to fail -- is not vital for the German company's survival, say analysts and industry experts.

According to  NYSE Euronext chief executive Duncan Niederauer, there is only a "glimmer of hope" that the tie-up, which would create the world's largest market operator, will be approved by  European competition authorities.

EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90 percent of the European derivatives market.
A final decision is expected on February 1.

In November, the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said Brussels remained unsatisfied.
The proposed merger has also sparked controversy in the United States as it would hand over the New York
Stock Exchange to foreign owners.

A deal would see Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm.
Investors, too, seem unfazed by the likely failure of the deal, with Deutsche Boerse shares rising in recent days. At a dinner with journalists last week, the head of the company that operates the Frankfurt stock exchange, Reto
Francioni, preferred to talk instead about "organic growth" and insisted his company was optimistic about 2012,
merger or no merger.
"It was the shareholders of NYSE Euronext who would have stood to gain more from the tie-up," said LBBW
analyst Martin Peter.
"Deutsche Boerse is better positioned than the Americans."

The Frankfurt-based group is indeed active across the whole range of activities, from its Xetra electronic stock-trading platform, to its Eurex derivatives market and its Luxembourg-based clearing subsidiary, Clearstream.

In the case of NYSE Euronext, the highly competitive, low-margin stock-trading unit accounts for around half of overall business, while at Deutsche Boerse "it only plays a minor role," the LBBW analyst said.

In the first nine months of 2011 and the whole of 2010, Xetra accounted for just 12 percent of the group's overall revenues.

That means it has relatively small exposure to competition from alternative exchanges such as BATS and Chi-X, which teamed up to combine their stock trading platforms in Europe last year.

However, the German group would find itself "in danger" if alternative exchanges moved into the financial derivatives sector, warned Equinet analyst, Philipp Haessler.

Thanks to Clearstream and Eurex Clearing, however, Deutsche Boerse is well placed to benefit from the expanding post-market settlement and clearing sector, which plays a central role in both the regulated and over-the-counter markets.
The London Stock Exchange is hoping to challenge Deutsche Boerse in this area by taking over the other large
European clearing house, LCH.Clearnet.

If, contrary to all expectations, the tie-up does go ahead, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse would become the world's leading stock market and would benefit from vast cost synergies and become more profitable, said Philipp Haessler at Equinet.

However, the long-anticipated global consolidation in the sector is proving ephemeral: last year, an alliance between the London and Toronto stock exchanges ran aground and Australia also vetoed a merger between the Sydney and Singapore stock exchanges.
"National interests and regulation are proving bigger obstacles than expected," Haessler said.
Christian Muschick, analyst at Silvia Quandt, said the EU Commission's reservations about a tie-up between
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext are probably of a more political nature.
Europe "feared ceding control and being dominated by the Americans," he said. etb/spm/ric/wai

TIER ONE: NYSE's Next Option Should Be A Safe Bet

NEW YORK (Dow Jones Investment Banker)--With only a glimmer of hope remaining to push through its pending merger with Deutsche Boerse AG,  NYSE Euronext should begin reviewing its next strategic alternative. The exchange operator has the muscle to reward shareholders who have stuck by it, and buy back a large chunk of its shares.

Competition authorities for the  European Union earlier this month recommended that  EU commissioners rule against the deal, saying it would create an unfair monopoly. Then, a key member of the commission signaled that he wanted more time to review the proposed deal, confusing many investors and analysts who had already
written it off.

The European commission is expected to give a final decision in early February, but NYSE's chief executive Duncan Niederauer has recently been quoted as saying there is only a "glimmer of hope" for the deal to succeed. And the markets seem to think so as well. NYSE closed Thursday's session at a deep 11 per cent discount to the deal's implied value.

If the merger isn't allowed, it likely signals a deep pause in large, global exchange consolidations, as it would mark the third such deal halted by either regulators or politicians. However, it shouldn't affect smaller deals, or transactions that have no national interests to protect, such as domestic-only deals.

There's been some real drama since the deal was originally announced, but the EU commission's clock is finally ticking down, with a decision expected by February 9th. If approved, the deal would create a global exchange power house. Should the deal get nixed, however, NYSE needs to refresh its options.

Some analysts have speculated NYSE could turn its sights to IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. or even CME Group, Inc. Those deals, however, are unlikely to happen as both ICE and CME are larger than NYSE, significantly so in the case of CME. Also, management of NYSE shows no inclination to cede control - indeed in the pending
merger of equals with Deutsche Boerse, NYSE's Niederauer is to retain his position with the new company. Furthermore, CME's strategy hasn't included diversifying into SEC regulated products, throwing more cold water on the idea.

The exchange operator should, therefore, reward its shareholders with increased share buyback activity. Assuming the company completed its announced $100 million buyback in last year's fourth quarter, the exchange still has roughly $550 million of authorization remaining under its existing $1 billion buyback plan. At current
prices, that would equate to 20 million shares, or around 8% of diluted shares outstanding.

And the company's strong cash generation capabilities will allow it to do more buybacks without incurring any additional debt - the exchange generated about $1.3 billion in recurring Ebitda, and over $900 million in operating cash flow over the twelve months ending September 30, 2011.

Furthermore, much of the cash flow to be generated over the next year will be front-loaded. A look at recent annual data shows roughly 70% of NYSE's operating cash flows during the year have been collected in the first six months. That would certainly set the company up to announce it was doing a large buyback after the final kibosh is put on the planned merger next week, if indeed that is what happens.

Buying back shares would certainly reward investors. It would also be a very low execution risk alternative. NYSE management, after all, needs to reassure investors that it can get the job done. A buyback would be a quick, and timely reminder.

RBC meanwhile cuts NYX to sector perform from outperform on lost growth prospects tied to the $17B combination,
and slower trading ahead. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)
8:47 (Dow Jones) The long-anticipated bullish "golden cross" has finally appeared for the S&P 500, with the
50-day moving average coming in today at 1257.80 and 200-day MA at 1257.19, according to FactSet data. This
may not be a good market timing signal, and it certainly isn't infallible, but it can be viewed as long-term validation
of a rally. But significant further gains have followed the last seven golden crosses in the S&P 500, during the
past 13 years. A golden cross appeared in the DJIA on Jan 3, while an appearance is more than a week away for
the Nasdaq Composite. S&P 500 futures up 5.75. (tomi.kilgore@dowjones.com)
8:41 (Dow Jones) Investors shouldn't be surprised to see Exxon's (XOM) 2011 capital spending hitting a record
$36.8B, up 14%. That's because the company has had to invest heavily in order to try and offset declining
production. XOM's output ended up rising 1% last year on growth in natural gas while oil production fell 4.5%, hit
by the normal decline of aging fields as well as OPEC quotas. (isabel.ordonez@dowjones.com)

8:38 (Dow Jones) Valero Energy (VLO) earned more money selling ethanol than in refinging in the 4Q. While 4Q earnings at VLO's main refining segment was $40M - less than 10% of what it made during the same time last year - ethanol segment earnings more than doubled, to $181M, a record. VLO says higher gross margins and a record-high production rate of 3.5M gallons a day drove the profit. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

8:38 (Dow Jones) Treasurys are poised to break a 4-session streak of gains amid an improved attitude about Europe this morning. That has sent stocks and other risk assets higher and safe-haven Treasurys lower. Benchmark 10-year US notes are down 3/32, yielding 1.851%. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

8:36 (Dow Jones) Valero Energy (VLO) tells investors they can bank on the company nearing completion of its numerous refinery upgrade projects. VLO is replacing the coker drums at its St. Charles, La., refinery in April and is set to complete hydrocracker projects at its refineries in St. Charles and Port Arthur, Texas, by the end of 2012. Once those are done, it's all gravy for the company's cash flow, CEO Bill Klesse says. "After moving beyond the high capital spending levels in 2011 and 2012, we believe our slate of growth projects, recent acquisitions, and operational improvements will enable Valero to significantly grow free cash flow." (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

8:32 (Dow Jones) Valero Energy (VLO) CEO Bill Klesse says that sure, 4Q earnings tanked, but happier days are here again in 2012. VLO reports earnings of 8c a share, down 75%, as a whopping $4.21 a barrel decrease in profitability at its Gulf Coast refineries leads an overall poor performance. But CEO Bill Klesse says he sees the sunny side - fuel sales are expected to improve as the outlook for the global economy brightens and competitors are trimming down their refining capacity. "The macro view of refining in 2012 looks promising," Klesse says. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)
8:28 (Dow Jones) After rallying 21% this month, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC) is selling off premarket as chip- and
LED-equipment maker again issued disappointing revenue guidance. The company cites "the continued uncertain
economic environment and ongoing conservative capital spending by its customers." Chip demand was muted in
the latter portion of 2011, and analysts have been raising concerns about where the LED space is headed. KLIC
is down 6.6% premarket at $10.47. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

Page 34 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
8:26 (Dow Jones) UPS says 4Q revenue was crimped a bit by shorter delivery routes because of continued weakness in Asia-to-US trade lanes. However, intraregional growth in Asia and European exports drove international results. Overall revenue fell short of Street views, but EPS beat and 2012 profit guidance was solid. Shares rise 0.7% premarket to $76.65. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)

8:15 (Dow Jones) UPS says peak shipping season exceeded expectations, with volume up more than 7% from prior year during critical Thanksgiving-to-Christmas period. But we'll have to take its word, since UPS never publicly forecast volume growth for the period. In November, it forecast a 6.2% volume gain for the hectic week before Christmas but declined to reveal full holiday expectations. Still, company notes it exceeded 27M packages on two different days, after previously saying it expected to "approach" 26M on its anticipated busiest day. UPS
up 1.7% at $77.45 premarket. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)

8:13 (Dow Jones) Truck maker Paccar (PCAR) ran over analysts' 4Q estimates, reporting record quarterly revenue for the company and EPS that easily topped expectations. The top line soared 58%, and hopes for the quarter were evidence by PCAR shares jumping 18% already this month. They're up another 3.9% premarket at
$45.90 and at 6-month highs. But still off 22% from a year earlier as shares tumbled after PCAR's 2Q report, when earnings didn't surge as much as anticipated because parts shortages held down production volumes and drove up costs. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

8:08 (Dow Jones) Despite an upward trend to end 2011, Brazilian industry still registered a weak 4Q that will undermine GDP, Barclays Capital says. Output at mines and factories up for second-consecutive month in December, but falls 1.5% in the 4Q after 0.8% decline in 3Q, firm notes. The figures suggest that "4Q11 growth should still be weak," Barclays says. Firm estimates Brazil's 4Q GDP advanced 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-end momentum, however, bodes well for the new year. "The acceleration we observed at the end of the quarter is already pointing to a better 1Q12," firm says. (jeff.fick@dowjones.com)

EU Vetoes Merger of Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext
By Marlene Y. Satter, AdvisorOne
446 words
1 February 2012
AdvisorOne
ADVONE

Copyright © 2012 Summit Business Media, All Rights Reserved.
The European Union has vetoed a proposed  merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext to create the world’s largest exchange, after measures proposed by the two companies failed to satisfy the Competition Commission. The  European Commission characterized the proposal as leading to a “near-monopoly” that would bring harm to customers.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the  EC said such a merger would harm competition. It is the fourth  merger prohibition enacted by the commission since 2004, when it instituted new rules on the review of such deals. In a statement, the  EC said that the arrangement would have led to a “near-monopoly” in  European exchange-traded derivatives, and added, “Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger.”
The deal, valued at $9.5 billion when originally agreed to by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext in February
2011, has dropped to around $7.3 billion as Deutsche Boerse’s shares have fallen. Both companies resorted to a
direct appeal to Jose Barroso, president of the commission, in January in an effort to salvage the deal, saying that
forbidding the merger would harm European exchanges and send business to other parts of the world.

Had the merger proceeded, the acquisition of NYSE Euronext by Deutsche Boerse would have consolidated more than 90% of Europe’s exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30% of stock trading with a single company.

The two companies had offered to sell overlapping businesses and provide access to post-trade services to rivals in an effort to persuade regulators that the move would not squash competition. However, in December the EC told both companies that their concessions were not extensive enough.

Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the EC statement, “We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive.”

Deutsche Boerse was critical of the decision, issuing a statement that said in part, “This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets. The EU Commission’s decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong.”

Antitrust officials had previously told the companies that they would have to divest of an entire derivatives business in order to proceed. Neither company was willing to consider such an action.

EU blocks  Deutsche Boerse, NYSE tie-up
624 words
1 February 2012

The European Commission said Wednesday it had "no alternative" but to veto a transatlantic tie-up of the
Frankfurt and New York stock exchanges, a decision slammed in Germany as a "dark day" for  Europe.

The European Union's senior competition regulator Joaquin Almunia confirmed in Brussels the long-anticipated decision to block the planned  merger on the grounds the combined company would control 90 percent of a key sector.

The trade in certain derivatives products on such exchanges and whose values are dependent on underlying European economic fundamentals, Almunia said, would become skewed because the joint company would dominate the global market there.

"We could only have allowed a merger if the parties had offered sufficient remedies," Almunia said in reference to conditions involving disposals by both set down by the Commission last year for the EU to give its green light.
"Unfortunately they only offered remedies limited in their scope," he said.
As a result, "in the end, we had no alternative other than to prohibit the merger."

Well-steeled in advance for losing the chance to become the world's biggest market operator, Deutsche Boerse said the decision showed the EU was "out of touch with reality."
"This is a dark day for Europe and its future competitiveness on global financial markets," it raged.

"The EU Commission's decision is totally out of touch with reality and is based on a narrow definition of the markets which does not take into account the global nature of the competition on the derivatives markets," Deutsche Boerse fumed.

Deutsche Boerse chief Reto Francioni described the decision as "wrong," saying it was "inconsistent with and even contradictory to the Commission's stated aim of expanding regulation on the over-the-counter derivatives market."
Blocking the merger would prevent the creation of a Europe-based globally competitive stock exchange that
"would have contributed to standardised, transparent and stable markets in Europe," Francioni said.

The proposed merger had similarly sparked controversy in the United States as it would have handed over the New York Stock Exchange to foreign owners, with Deutsche Boerse shareholders owning 60 percent of the new combined firm.

NYSE Euronext, which also controls markets in Paris and Amsterdam, said the decision was "based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market."

"As we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination," said NYSE Euronext chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels.

NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told AFP they had not yet decided on whether to launch an appeal.



Page 55 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"If we do, it will mainly be to demonstrate the strength of our arguments, in particular on how to define relevant markets affected," he said.
Investors appeared a little disappointed, with Deutsche Boerse shares underperforming the overall market.

In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the government "respected" the decision and would focus primarily on "the interests of the financial capital of Frankfurt."

Analysts argue Deutsche Boerse is better positioned than its US counterpart, anyway, because it is active across the whole range of activities, from its Xetra electronic stock-trading platform, to its Eurex derivatives market and its Luxembourg-based clearing subsidiary, Clearstream.

Deutsche Boerse generates just 12 percent of its revenues from the highly competitive, low-margin stock-trading activities, while in the case of NYSE Euronext it accounts for around half of overall business.

There has long been talk of global consolidation in the stock markets sector, but so far national interests and competitive concerns have torpedoed planned alliances, for example between those in London and Toronto, and Sydney and Singapore.

(ANSA) - BRUSSELS, 1 FEBRUARY - "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns", Almunia continued, explaining that  NYSE and Deutsche Boerse control more than 90% of the global derivatives' trade. According to the  EU antitrust authorities, with the merger and setting up of such a power, it would be difficult for new actors to enter the derivatives' market and become "credible competitors". Brussels also explained that the two companies have offered to sell some assets and access to their "compensation chambers" for some categories of new contracts; however, commitments were overall unable to resolve concerns on competition. Eurex, managed by  Deutsche Boerse and Liffe, managed by  NYSE Euronext, are the two main financial markets for  European derivatives and are competing with each other.

"A merge would have cancelled this global competition The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide in several fields, causing significant damage to derivative traders and to European economy in general ''. Without competition on the market, Brussels concludes, there would be no more benefits for clients connected to price competition.(ANSA).

1 February 2012 - NYSE Euronext (NYSE:NYX) said on Wednesday that it is holding talks with Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) to terminate their USD9bn (EUR6.9bn)  merger after the  European Union (EU) watchdog announced it is prohibiting the deal.

The European Commission (EC) said earlier today it would not clear the tie-up to go through since it would lead to the formation of a company that controls over 90% of global trade in  European financial derivatives. The parties had offered certain concessions to the commission but the latter considered them to be inadequate.

In turn, NYSE’s chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in a statement that the company would not agree to any remedies that would undermine the industrial and economic logic of the merger.

The US company will now concentrate on its stand-alone strategy and plans to resume a USD550m share buyback programme after the termination of the deal and the release of its fourth quarter and full year financial results on 10 February.

NYSE - New York Stock Exchange

NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with  Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their  merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders. In that regard, NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext Chairman said, "Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets, and we proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction. But as we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy - a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year.

"The strong underlying fundamentals of our core business, the strength and depth of our management team, and our diversified global footprint give us unique competitive advantages to exploit in the rapidly evolving global landscape as we continue to grow our successful franchises and return capital to shareholders."

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer said: "I'm extremely proud of the efforts of the entire NYSE Euronext team over the last year. While effectively advancing our proposed merger on to the final step, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver the commitments we made to our shareholders.

"While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy. Our business had a strong year, giving us the opportunity to return more capital to our shareholders, as evidenced by today's buy-back announcement.

"We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services. And, as always, we will continue the success we have had in optimizing the business through continued cost discipline and operational efficiency.

"In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing with our investors, employees, customers and partners, the exciting plans we have to continue our growth strategy, build on our reputation as the leading global operator of financial markets and create value for shareholders.

"On behalf of our company, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the regulators in our various markets, who worked very hard to accommodate the approval process for our transaction under very tight deadlines."

Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues at Deutsche Boerse for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made to see the deal through to approval."

Following termination of the merger agreement with DB, share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The
$550 million buy-back is being executed under a $1.0 billion Board authorization established in March of 2008.

European Competition Commission blocks  Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronextmerger

The European Competition Commission has vetoed the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext. The merger would have created the biggest exchange in the world. The European Commission is of the view that the merger would create a "near-monopoly" in exchange trading of derivatives in the continent. The
acquisition of NYSE Euronext by Deutsche Boerse would have put 90 per cent of  European exchange trading of derivatives in the hands of Deutsche Boerse.

Deutsche Boerse made the USD 9.5 billion acquisition offer in February 2011. After the decision of the European Commission came today, Deutsche released a statement saying, "This is a black day for  Europe and for its future competitiveness in global financial markets."

Competition regulators around the world are blocking merger of exchanges on antitrust concerns. Before this the US Justice Department blocked the merger of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Similarly the bid of Singapore Exchange ltd for ASX ltd was foiled after the Australian treasury said that it was not in the interests of Australia.

(Reuters) - European Union regulators have blocked the merger of exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse and
NYSE Euronext to avoid giving them a stranglehold on the European futures market.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which unveiled the plan to create the world's biggest stock exchange as long ago as February last year, said they would now unwind the deal, the sector's fourth failed tie-up attempt in a year.

The European Commission said Wednesday that the combined entity would make it hard for new players to compete.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext had refused to sell either the German operator's Eurex derivatives market operator or the U.S. company's London-based futures exchange Liffe to address such concerns.

NYSE said it would return $550 million to shareholders via a share repurchase program and seek to grow its derivatives business.

"While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy," NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said in a statement.

"We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives, including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services," he said.
Deutsche Boerse said it was positive about the outlook for this year despite the failed deal.

The Hessian economics ministry, Deutsche Boerse's home regulator in Wiesbaden, Germany, had said Tuesday that the exchanges had not eased its legal concerns over the deal. The ministry was planning to issue a decision after the Commission's ruling.
U.S. regulators approved the merger in December last year on condition the exchanges sell a minor asset. In the past year the sector has seen three other large deals fail.
Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange Inc's bid for NYSE Euronext was rejected by the U.S. Department of Justice, London Stock Exchange's takeover of TMX Group was rejected by shareholders of the Toronto Stock Exchange operator, and Singapore Exchange Ltd's bid for Australia's ASX Ltd was stopped by the Australian government.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation
By Jacob Bunge
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
1,115 words
1 February 2012
11:44
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
AER
English
(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.


Page 65 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Brokers privately expressed reservations that many of the cost-savings would extend to individual traders, though, and some voiced concerns to EU regulators that together the exchanges would hold too much power over trading fees.

Michael Spencer, chief executive of U.K.-based inter-dealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Wednesday that the move should be welcomed. "That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters in London.

Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners who charged that regulators were overlooking the much larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among Wall Street banks, as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.

In recent weeks, executives complained that the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, whose derivatives trading has drawn scrutiny following the financial crisis and which have built their own exchanges in an effort to bring down the cost of trading.

The EU ruling will spur some soul-searching among the world's leading exchange groups, now confronting limits to a consolidation strategy that has dominated the sector's evolution for a decade.

The Australian government last year blocked the purchase of domestic exchange group ASX Ltd. (ASX.AU) by Singapore Exchange Group on fears that control would be lost over key aspects of the market, while shareholders of Canada's TMX Group Inc. (X.T) in June shot down its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE.LN) after a consortium of banks launched a rival bid to keep TMX under Canadian control.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) last spring outlined the attraction of creating a U.S. super-exchange in their rival takeover attempt of NYSE Euronext, though the Department of Justice threatened to block that deal in May.

Though nationalism played into the downfall of other exchange mergers, EU lawmakers rejected NYSE and Deutsche Boerse's assertion that allowing their merger would create a "European champion" and bolster the region's standing in the increasingly borderless business of securities trading.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni and NYSE's Niederauer have maintained that their exchanges can thrive independently, and investors in both companies over the last two months have come to expect the merger to collapse.

Some have seen the potential for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to pursue joint ventures that accomplish some aspects of the merger, such as an agreement that would seek Deutsche Boerse process some derivatives trades for NYSE Euronext and make the transactions more efficient for customers.

Deutsche Boerse said Wednesday that the  EU Commission in Brussels had told it that its planned  merger with
NYSE Euronext has been blocked.

"Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have been informed that the  European Commission today has decided to prohibit their proposed business combination," the German company, which operates the Frankfurt stock exchange, said in a statement.

The EU Commission is scheduled to issue its ruling later on Wednesday, but it had been widely expected to block the tie-up -- which would have created the world's largest market operator -- even though Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext had offered to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay competition concerns.

"Despite the remedies offered by the companies, the European Commission concluded that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the common market," the statement said.

"Upon receipt of the official notification of the prohibition decision, the exchange offer will therefore automatically lapse."
The proposed merger has also sparked controversy in the United States as it would hand over the New York
Stock Exchange to foreign owners.

A deal would have seen Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm.

EU blocks  $10 billion Deutsche Boerse, NYSEmerger, citing  dominance in derivatives trading

By GABRIELE STEINHAUSER AP Business Writer

BRUSSELS (AP) - The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with
NYSE Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said it was ruling against the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 percent of the trading in European derivatives -- complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.

It said that the combined company's dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
"These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The Commission's decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, which hoped combining their businesses would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

But it also underlines the profound transformation their businesses -- and financial markets as a whole -- have undergone over the past decade. Today, the value of outstanding derivatives contracts has surpassed by many times the value of traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext both managed to build highly profitable businesses out of this trend and today own Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges. A push from regulators across the globe to push more derivative trades onto exchanges to make the market more transparent has opened even bigger opportunities for established players.

To make the merger acceptable, the Commission wanted the companies to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or NYSE Euronext's Liffe -- something they refused.
"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets," Deutsche Boerse Chief
Executive Reto Francioni said in a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany.

Francioni added that the decision will prevent the creation of a "globally competitive" European exchange group that would have helped strengthen the Commission's push for transparent and stable financial markets.
NYSE said in a statement that the two companies are now discussing terminating the merger agreement. "While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally
different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on," NYSE Euronext Chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels said.

The Commission's decision did not come as a surprise as last month a competition case team recommended the merger should be blocked, based on the combined company's dominance in the trading of some of the most popular and liquid European derivatives.

Page 69 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the two exchanges argued that the vast majority of derivatives are traded directly between banks and other investors, or over-the-counter (OTC), rather than on exchanges, providing healthy competition in the overall market.

They also pointed to Chicago-based CME Group, which has a similar dominance over trading in key American derivatives.

But Almunia argued that neither the over-the-counter derivatives market nor CME Group could have been true competitors to a company owning both Eurex and Liffe.

He said derivatives based on U.S. indexes or interest rates traded on the CME were useless for investors trying to hedge against changes in their European equivalents. Over-the-counter trades, he argued, were riskier than exchange-based trades, eliminating then as an alternative to many companies.

Deutsche Boerse announced nearly a year ago that it was looking to buy NYSE Euronext for $10 billion. NYSE Euronext owns bourses in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, in addition to New York.

EU Is Set To Formally  Nix Bourse Merger Plan
By Ulrike Dauer

1 February 2012
The Wall Street Journal Asia

FRANKFURT -- Exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext are expected to see their $17 billion tie-up collapse Wednesday, as European Union regulators declare the yearlong plan to be anticompetitive.

The EU's 27 commissioners are likely to formally nix the move at their regular weekly meeting, backing the opinion of the  EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

He has said the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company 93% of the region's market. He rejected a call by the exchanges to consider derivatives that are traded over-the-counter, rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% world-wide.

Concessions offered by both merger partners have had little impact. They offered to sell NYSE Euronext's European stock-derivatives business, to cap some trading fees for three years and to open up Deutsche Boerse's clearing platforms to competitors.

The failure of the high-profile deal 12 months after it was announced joins a list of other failed cross-border exchange tie-ups.

The London Stock Exchange's intended tie-up with Canada's TMX Ltd. was withdrawn after failing to secure enough support from TMX investors. Singapore Exchange's proposed buyout of Australia's ASX Ltd. was blocked by Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, who said the deal wasn't in Australia's national interest.

Chief executives at Germany's Deutsche Boerse, which runs the main German stock exchange as well as the Eurex derivatives business, and NYSE Euronext, which owns the Big Board and four European stock markets, acknowledged in recent days that hopes of getting the deal approved were fading, despite fierce lobbying efforts.

NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos that there was only "a glimmer of hope" for the tie-up, though he hadn't given up and may consider challenging the EU decision in court.

"It does appear that, at least in our case, nationalism and a little bit of protectionism are winning out," Mr. Niederauer told CNBC. He told the Financial Times that he misjudged the response of European regulators to the deal.

Mr. Niederauer and his Deutsche Boerse counterpart, Reto Francioni, have said they still strongly advocate the deal, while emphasizing that each company could continue to survive alone.

Mr. Niederauer said Friday that the exchange was "comfortable" with a stand-alone strategy. Mr. Francioni told attendees at his company's New Year reception last week that the tie-up would be a great chance for Europe with its scattered exchanges. But he added that Deutsche Boerse's business model also enables it to grow
organically.

Deutsche Boerse shares gained about 8% in the past week, outperforming the German DAX blue-chip index, which gained 2%.

Analysts said there was some relief in that the two executives didn't give in to pressure from the EU by offering to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex unit or NYSE Euronext's Liffe derivatives business, as that would have destroyed the deal's business logic.
Page 71 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There also were political fears in Europe that although the deal would create a European champion, regional jobs, tax revenue and exchange regulation would be lost through the merger. Since NYSE Group Inc. took over Euronext NV in 2007 the merged group's exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon have effectively become peripheral regional branches.

There is a <euro>250 million ($328.6 million) breakup fee that one of the merger partners would have to pay to the other if it decided on its own to walk away from the deal. However, this doesn't apply if the deal is killed because of regulators, according to the merger documents.

The breakup fee applies, however, if either strikes a new deal with a third party that takes 40% or more in equity within nine months of this deal's termination. That would discourage both from doing another big deal and limit them to bolt-on acquisitions in that time, said one person familiar with the matter.

That's in line with recent comments by Mr. Niederauer to CNBC that near-term consolidation in the exchange sector "appears to be challenging" and that it would be more appropriate to look for "bolt-on" deals.

The merger offer now expires on March 31; by that date, all regulatory approvals would have had to be secured for the deal to go through.
It wasn't immediately clear whether both companies plan to challenge the EU verdict.

A legal challenge could, however, help influence a precedent over how over-the-counter derivatives are viewed in such deals in the future.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation

Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Stock market operators  NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) started discussions Wednesday to terminate their planned $17 billion  merger, which has been blocked by the  European Union antitrust authority.

NYSE Euronext will focus on a standalone strategy and intends to resume a $550 million share repurchase program after the issue of its fourth-quarter and 2011 results on Feb. 10, the company said in a statement.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy--a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year," NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in the statement.

The European Commission rejected the stock market operators' merger, which would have created the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, because it would have impeded effective competition. The planned new company would have had a 93% market share of on-exchange derivative trading in Europe. All 27
EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday that it plans to end its proposed  merger with the parent of the Frankfurt exchange, after  European officials blocked the deal.

NYSE Euronext said it will instead repurchase shares, as a way to bolster value to investors once the agreement with Deutsche Boerse is officially terminated.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in a statement.

But, he added, "we would not agree to any concessions that would undermine or compromise the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination."

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday that it plans to end its proposed  merger with the parent of the Frankfurt exchange, after  European officials blocked the deal.

NYSE Euronext said it will instead repurchase shares, as a way to bolster value to investors once the agreement with Deutsche Boerse is officially terminated.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in a statement.

But, he added, "we would not agree to any concessions that would undermine or compromise the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination."

The European Commission said it prohibited the merger on the basis that it would stifled competition by creating a "quasi-monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges."
The EC said the two exchanges already control more than 90% of global trade in European derivatives.

Hessels said he "strongly" disagrees with the EC's decision, noting that it is "based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market."

NYSE Euronext said that it planned to resume its $550 million share repurchase program after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 results on Feb. 10.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation

Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.

Brokers privately expressed reservations that many of the cost-savings would extend to individual traders, though, and some voiced concerns to EU regulators that together the exchanges would hold too much power over trading fees.

Michael Spencer, chief executive of U.K.-based inter-dealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Wednesday that the move should be welcomed. "That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters in London.

Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners who charged that regulators were overlooking the much larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among Wall Street banks, as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.

In recent weeks, executives complained that the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, whose derivatives trading has drawn scrutiny following the financial crisis and which have built their own exchanges in an effort to bring down the cost of trading.

The EU ruling will spur some soul-searching among the world's leading exchange groups, now confronting limits to a consolidation strategy that has dominated the sector's evolution for a decade.

The Australian government last year blocked the purchase of domestic exchange group ASX Ltd. (ASX.AU) by Singapore Exchange Group on fears that control would be lost over key aspects of the market, while shareholders of Canada's TMX Group Inc. (X.T) in June shot down its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE.LN) after a consortium of banks launched a rival bid to keep TMX under Canadian control.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) last spring outlined the attraction of creating a U.S. super-exchange in their rival takeover attempt of NYSE Euronext, though the Department of Justice threatened to block that deal in May.

Though nationalism played into the downfall of other exchange mergers, EU lawmakers rejected NYSE and Deutsche Boerse's assertion that allowing their merger would create a "European champion" and bolster the region's standing in the increasingly borderless business of securities trading.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni and NYSE's Niederauer have maintained that their exchanges can thrive independently, and investors in both companies over the last two months have come to expect the merger to collapse.

Governments' dim view of large-scale exchange tie-ups means that the transformative, multi-billion dollar deals of the past year will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and instruments. Ties to fast-growing Asian markets will continue to be a focus as financial regulators there take steps to allow in more foreign-based investing.

Some have seen the potential for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to pursue joint ventures that accomplish some aspects of the merger, such as an agreement that would seek Deutsche Boerse process some derivatives trades for NYSE Euronext and make the transactions more efficient for customers.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Stock market operators  NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) started discussions Wednesday to terminate their planned $17 billion  merger, which has been blocked by the  European Union antitrust authority.

NYSE Euronext will focus on a standalone strategy and intends to resume a $550 million share repurchase program after the issue of its fourth-quarter and 2011 results on Feb. 10, the company said in a statement.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy--a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year," NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in the statement.

The European Commission rejected the stock market operators' merger, which would have created the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, because it would have impeded effective competition. The planned new company would have had a 93% market share of on-exchange derivative trading in Europe. All 27

NYSE Chairman:  'Certainly' Did Everything Possible  To Win Deal Approval

NYSE Euronext (NYX) may revive a plan to build its own  European trade-clearing facility, and will continue to look at bolt-on deals for its technology arm, Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said Wednesday after regulators blocked the planned  merger with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF).

Niederauer said the exchange operators may appeal the decision by the  European Commission, though time is needed to review the ruling from Brussels in more detail.

NYSE Euronext on Wednesday also announced it would restart a $550 million share buyback program after the company reports earnings Feb. 10.
"Investors have been patient and supportive and it's time to reward them for that patience and support," said
Niederauer in an interview.

The executive said that he and his Deutsche Boerse counterpart, Reto Francioni, remain on good terms and did not rule out working together in the future.

Niederauer acknowledged that neither firm anticipated that the EU antitrust review of their merger would focus on their combined market share in exchange-traded derivatives, while overlooking similar contracts that are traded
off-exchange and on foreign-based markets.

The exchange industry will next look to forming smaller-scale partnerships in lieu of mega-merger deals, Niederauer said, though NYSE Euronext would "not shy away" from such a deal if the prospect presented itself.

European antitrust regulators just nixed the planned  NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Boerse merger, warning that combining the exchanges'  European derivatives businesses would have broken EU competition rules.
Here's a refresher on what the companies had hoped to achieve with the deal. Rationale for the merger:
--The combination would have created a European futures and options market to rival U.S.-based CME Group in terms of trading activity. Together exchanges run by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse account for about
93% of regional derivatives traded on-exchange, a concentration that proved too high for EU antitrust regulators.

--The exchanges estimated customers including banks could save EUR3 billion in collateral costs by processing NYSE Euronext's European trading via Deutsche Boerse's German clearinghouse, with further cost reductions via a slimmed-down, unified technology platform.

--The NYSE and Deutsche Boerse had projected about EUR400 million in cost savings for the exchanges themselves by streamlining technology, operations and staff, with an extra EUR150 million in revenue seen from jointly developing new products and harnessing the combined exchange group's scale.

--The addition of Deutsche Boerse's Frankfurt stock listings would have burnished the Big Board's position as the leading venue for capital formation worldwide, with more than $14.2 trillion in company value listed on its markets.

--The creation of a European market leader with the brand power of the NYSE was seen by the companies as the first step in a longer-running strategy to link up with Asian markets growing faster than their Western counterparts.

BRUSSELS(Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

The move, widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the  European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the  merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The commission's concerns centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European exchanges operated by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than 90% market share in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that clearing houses can offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than use other competitors.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--The widely expected failure of a planned  merger between Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) should be welcomed, ICAP PLC (IAP.LN) Chief Executive Officer Michael Spencer said Wednesday.

"That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in  Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters.

Spencer also said an emergency borrowing facility by the European Central Bank to European banks may need to be extended.

"The Long-Term Refinancing Operation was clearly extremely useful in stabilizing confidence in the euro zone and providing liquidity into the banking system. It was an extremely timely and foresightful move by the ECB. But is it enough? Possibly, but I think unlikely. They may well be preparing perhaps to extend that facility if it's needed, which would be a good move also," he said.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) Wednesday said the  European Union has informed them about the decision to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination.

Both would-be  merger partners said that the  EU Commission concluded "that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market," despite remedies offered by both companies.

Both companies said it will now be impossible to fulfil one of the completion conditions for the exchange offer, that the EU clearance must be received by March 31. As a result, the exchange offer will automatically lapse once the merger partners officially receive the prohibition decision, they said. The merger partners will publish the termination offer and will unwind the offer, they said.

With their decision to reject, on antitrust grounds, the plans to create the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, all 27 EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global market.
Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni will comment on the EU decision later Wednesday.

The EU's 27 commissioners were discussing the decision at a meeting Wednesday morning. "The EU has adopted its position as opposed," the person said.
The person said European Financial Markets Commissioner Michel Barnier made a formal declaration to the meeting minutes stating his view. Barnier has reportedly been more favorable to the deal.
The Commission was widely expected to decide against the deal.

PARIS (Dow Jones)--Stock market operators  NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) started discussions Wednesday to terminate their planned $17 billion  merger, which has been blocked by the  European Union antitrust authority.

NYSE Euronext will focus on a standalone strategy and intends to resume a $550 million share repurchase program after the issue of its fourth-quarter and 2011 results on Feb. 10, the company said in a statement.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy--a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year," NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in the statement.

The European Commission rejected the stock market operators' merger, which would have created the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, because it would have impeded effective competition. The planned new company would have had a 93% market share of on-exchange derivative trading in Europe. All 27
EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation
By Jacob Bunge

Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.

Brokers privately expressed reservations that many of the cost-savings would extend to individual traders, though, and some voiced concerns to EU regulators that together the exchanges would hold too much power over trading fees.

Michael Spencer, chief executive of U.K.-based inter-dealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Wednesday that the move should be welcomed. "That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters in London.

Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners who charged that regulators were overlooking the much larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among Wall Street banks, as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.

In recent weeks, executives complained that the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, whose derivatives trading has drawn scrutiny following the financial crisis and which have built their own exchanges in an effort to bring down the cost of trading.

The EU ruling will spur some soul-searching among the world's leading exchange groups, now confronting limits to a consolidation strategy that has dominated the sector's evolution for a decade.

The Australian government last year blocked the purchase of domestic exchange group ASX Ltd. (ASX.AU) by Singapore Exchange Group on fears that control would be lost over key aspects of the market, while shareholders of Canada's TMX Group Inc. (X.T) in June shot down its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE.LN) after a consortium of banks launched a rival bid to keep TMX under Canadian control.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) last spring outlined the attraction of creating a U.S. super-exchange in their rival takeover attempt of NYSE Euronext, though the Department of Justice threatened to block that deal in May.

Though nationalism played into the downfall of other exchange mergers, EU lawmakers rejected NYSE and Deutsche Boerse's assertion that allowing their merger would create a "European champion" and bolster the region's standing in the increasingly borderless business of securities trading.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni and NYSE's Niederauer have maintained that their exchanges can thrive independently, and investors in both companies over the last two months have come to expect the merger to collapse.

Governments' dim view of large-scale exchange tie-ups means that the transformative, multi-billion dollar deals of the past year will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and instruments. Ties to fast-growing Asian markets will continue to be a focus as financial regulators there take steps to allow in more foreign-based investing.

Some have seen the potential for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to pursue joint ventures that accomplish some aspects of the merger, such as an agreement that would seek Deutsche Boerse process some derivatives trades for NYSE Euronext and make the transactions more efficient for customers.

BRUSSELS(Dow Jones)--The  European Commission Wednesday blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

The move, widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the  European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the  merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The commission's concerns centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European exchanges operated by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than 90% market share in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that clearing houses can offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than use other competitors.

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) Wednesday said the European Union has informed them of its decision to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination.

Both would-be merger partners said that the EU Commission concluded "that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market," despite remedies offered by both companies.

Both companies said it will now be impossible to fulfil one of the completion conditions for the exchange offer, that the EU clearance must be received by March 31.

The merger partners will publish the termination offer and will unwind the offer, they said.

He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is global.

"The Commission's decision is highly regrettable and very hard to comprehend," the chairman of Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board said. "It negates the existing, fast-growing global competition among exchanges and it contradicts reality in putting up a strict separation between the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets. For Europe, the decision squanders a great opportunity to create a globally competitive exchange based in Europe and Germany and with a strong U.S. partner," Chairman Manfred Gentz said.

Deutsche Boerse said, however, that it is in a position for growth even without a merger, following earnings and revenue growth in 2011.
Concessions offered by both merger partners were deemed insufficient to ease competition concerns.

Both exchanges now have to consider other, stand-alone options. They are unlikely to come up with a revised merger plan to the current offer which ends March 31. They could challenge the EU decision in court, but such proceedings could take at least a year.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

An open question is whether both would-be merger partners, who closely looked into each other's books, will return to their roles as competitors or whether they will join forces on a sub-regulatory level, possibly with a focus on key growth markets such as Asia and Latin America.

The European Commission on Wednesday blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE
Euronext (NYX), saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

The move, widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator, after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The companies may yet appeal the ruling in court, though NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said executives would take some time to evaluate the ruling before deciding to pursue the matter further. Such an effort could be expensive and take years, and success is not assured.

"Before we go there we would like for all of us to have some time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think," Niederauer said in an interview. "But it's something we both would consider."

The commission's objections centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European exchanges operated by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than 90% market share in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that combining the two firms would have created a dominant EU clearing house that could offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than switch to competitors.

The exchanges argued that creating a giant, European trading venue -- complete with its own clearing house -- would mean lower trading costs. But the commission said the new firm's monopoly power would have allowed it to retain those benefits as profits, rather than pass them on to customers as lower costs.

"Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.

Derivatives trading, more profitable than stock dealing, had been the keystone of the $17.9 billion combination since it was unveiled in February 2011. The companies argued that their European derivatives trading businesses focus on different segments of the market: short-term interest-rate futures for Liffe and long-term futures for Deutsche Boerse. They also noted that the over-the-counter market, still home to the vast majority of derivatives trading globally, offers plenty of competition to trading done through exchanges.


Page 100 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the commission took a different view of the market: "The investigation showed that [exchange-trade derivatives] and OTCs are generally not considered as substitutes by customers, since they use them for different purposes and in different circumstance," it said.

Serious threats to the deal emerged in December, when EU competition regulators proved unsatisfied with several deal concessions put forward by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. Proposed remedies included allowing rivals limited access to the combined company's trade-clearing operations, as well as the spinoff of some contracts traded on both companies' markets.

Neither exchange company was willing to divest its derivatives franchise to make the deal happen. Executives of both firms said such a step would undermine the logic of the merger plan.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse pushed for their deal up until the end, with officials from both companies lobbying European Commissioners at last week's World Economic Forum in Davos to approve the deal in spite of the antitrust regulators' conclusion.

Deutsche Boerse said Wednesday that it is in a position for growth even without a merger, following earnings and revenue growth in 2011. NYSE Euronext immediately announced plans to resume a $550 million share buyback program after release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

EU's Almunia: Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Deal Would Have "Practically Eliminated" Market Competition

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)-The proposed tie-up between exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) would have "practically eliminated" market competition and remedies proposed by the two companies "fell far short," the  European Union's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said Wednesday.

Earlier Wednesday, the  EU, which had been considered the main regulatory hurdle, blocked the  merger plans, about a year after the plans were first announced.

The commission's review of the plans "found ample evidence" that both companies and their derivative exchanges --Eurex and Liffe-- "compare head to head and are each other's closest competitors," Almunia told reporters at the press briefing following the EU's decision.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global market.

The review found that the two companies themselves "don't view OTC products as competitors for the derivatives they trade," they only consider each other as competitors, Almunia said.

The European Union regulators prohibited  Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronextmerger, as they concluded that this merger could hurt competition, breaking the companies' dream of creating the world's largest exchange.

The companies said in a statement today that "Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have been informed that the European Commission today has decided to prohibit their proposed business combination," adding that "despite the remedies offered by the companies, the  European Commission concluded that the combination would significantly impede effective competition."

Deutsche Boerse accepted to merge the New York rival for 9.5 billion dollar a year earlier; however, the the value of the deal declined to $7.3 billion after the value of Deutsche Boerse dropped.
Both companies held talks with the commission president, Jose Barroso, last month in attempts to protect the
deal as the firms argued that this forbidden deal could harm European exchanges and lead business to search for
another part in the globe.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation
By Jacob Bunge
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
1,115 words
1 February 2012
11:44
Dow Jones Emerging Markets Report
EM
English
(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.

Brokers privately expressed reservations that many of the cost-savings would extend to individual traders, though, and some voiced concerns to EU regulators that together the exchanges would hold too much power over trading fees.

Michael Spencer, chief executive of U.K.-based inter-dealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Wednesday that the move should be welcomed. "That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters in London.

Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners who charged that regulators were overlooking the much larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among Wall Street banks, as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.

In recent weeks, executives complained that the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, whose derivatives trading has drawn scrutiny following the financial crisis and which have built their own exchanges in an effort to bring down the cost of trading.

The EU ruling will spur some soul-searching among the world's leading exchange groups, now confronting limits to a consolidation strategy that has dominated the sector's evolution for a decade.

The Australian government last year blocked the purchase of domestic exchange group ASX Ltd. (ASX.AU) by Singapore Exchange Group on fears that control would be lost over key aspects of the market, while shareholders of Canada's TMX Group Inc. (X.T) in June shot down its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE.LN) after a consortium of banks launched a rival bid to keep TMX under Canadian control.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) last spring outlined the attraction of creating a U.S. super-exchange in their rival takeover attempt of NYSE Euronext, though the Department of Justice threatened to block that deal in May.

Though nationalism played into the downfall of other exchange mergers, EU lawmakers rejected NYSE and Deutsche Boerse's assertion that allowing their merger would create a "European champion" and bolster the region's standing in the increasingly borderless business of securities trading.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni and NYSE's Niederauer have maintained that their exchanges can thrive independently, and investors in both companies over the last two months have come to expect the merger to collapse.

Governments' dim view of large-scale exchange tie-ups means that the transformative, multi-billion dollar deals of the past year will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and instruments. Ties to fast-growing Asian markets will continue to be a focus as financial regulators there take steps to allow in more foreign-based investing.

Some have seen the potential for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to pursue joint ventures that accomplish some aspects of the merger, such as an agreement that would seek Deutsche Boerse process some derivatives trades for NYSE Euronext and make the transactions more efficient for customers.

MERGERS : NYSE-DEUTSCHE BÖRSE MERGER: COMMISSION VETO LIKELY

1 February 2012

It seems most likely that on 1 February the European Commission will veto - under the  EU's merger control regulation - the  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext. NYSE Euronext groups the New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges. If the merger took place, Deutsche Börse shareholders would have 60% of the holding, while  NYSE shareholders would have 40%. NYSE would become the world's largest stock market operator in all market activities (cash, derivatives, delivery versus payment, custodial services and market data). Over the last weeks, the leaders of the two financial firms took many steps and made many declarations to demonstrate their determination to see the project through. But the Commission is concerned about overlaps in the stock options sector in  Europe and in stock-index futures and interest rates.

Moreover, the Commission did not feel that efforts made by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext - parting with certain activities but refusing to sacrifice their respective derivatives platforms, Liffe and Eurex - were sufficient. Furthermore, in mid-January, the national competition authorities of the member states also expressed a negative opinion on this merger (see Europolitics 4349).

It is quite rare for the Commission to veto mergers. In just over 20 year, it has only vetoed 21 operations out of over 4,800 dossiers it examined. Below are listed the Commission's 21 vetoes so far, with the companies and the sectors of activities concerned:
- 2 October 1991: Aérospatiale (France), Alenia (Italy) and De Havilland (Canada) - airplane construction

- 9 November 1994: German project MSG Media service, between Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom groups - pay-per-view digital television

- 19 July 1995: a Scandinavian project, Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD), proposed by Norsk Telekom, TeleDanmark and Kinnevik - satellite broadcasting of TV programmes

- 20 September 1995: CLT (Luxembourg), Veronica (Netherlands) and Endemol (Netherlands) - commercial television in the Netherlands
- 24 April 1996: Gencor and Lonrho (South Africa) - platinum production
- 20 November 1996: Kesko and Tuko (Finland) - retail shops

- 4 December 1996: Saint Gobain (France) and Wacker Chemie (Germany) - silicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum, production
- 26 June 1997: Blokker and Toys R' Us (Netherlands) - toy retail
- 27 May 1998: Deutsche Telekom and Betaresearch (Germany) - decoder for pay channels
- 27 May 1998: Bertelsmann and Kirch (Germany) - digital television
- 22 September 1999: Airtours and First Choice (UK) - organised tours
- 14 mars 2000: Volvo and Scania (Sweden) - building heavy-weight and utility vehicles
- 28 June 2000: MCI Worldcom and Sprint (USA) - internet
- 31 January 2001: SCA-Moelnlycke (Sweden) and Metsae Tissue (Finland) - tissue paper

Page 108 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- 3 July 2001: General Electric and Honeywell (USA) - aeronautics
- 10 October 2001: Schneider Electric and Legrand (France) - electrical equipment
- 17 October 2001: CVC (multinational) and Lenzing (Austria) - artificial fibres
- 30 October 2001: Tetra Laval (Sweden) and Sidel (France) - drinks packaging
- 9 December 2004: EDP and GDP (Portugal) - energy
- 27 June 2007: Ryanair and Aer Lingus (Ireland) - air transport
- 26 January 2001: Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines (Greece) - air transport

In three cases, the EU Court of Justice subsequently annulled the Commission's veto: Airtours-First Choice, Schneider Electric-Legrand and Tetra Laval-Sidel. A fourth case (MCI Worldcom-Sprint) was also overruled by the ECJ, but for technical reasons, since the companies withdrew their project.

Mergers: European Commission Prohibits Proposed  Merger Between Deutsche Börse AG And NYSE Euronext  – Frequently Asked Questions
2,263 words
1 February 2012
Exchange News Direct
EXNEWS

(See IP/12/94)
What is the role/importance of derivatives for the  European economy?

Derivatives are contracts traded on financial markets that are used to transfer risk. Derivatives are of key importance for the European economy. This is because they serve as insurance against price movements and reduce the volatility of companies' cash flows, which in turn results in more reliable forecasting, lower capital requirements, and higher capital productivity. Derivatives have in recent years developed into a main pillar of the international financial system and are an indispensable tool for risk management and investment purposes. Derivatives contribute to improve the operational, information, and allocation efficiency, thereby increasing the efficiency of financial markets. They help lower the cost of capital and enable firms to effectively invest and channel their resources, thereby making them an important driver of economic growth.
On what basis was it concluded that OTC and exchange traded derivatives are in separate markets?

The Commission conducted a far-reaching market investigation to assess the extent to which customers of derivatives based on European financial underlyings switch between derivatives traded on exchange and over the counter. The evidence collected, which also includes the Parties' own documents, showed that derivatives traded on-exchange and OTC derivatives are products with different characteristics and which fulfill different customer demands. Exchange-traded derivatives are fully standardised liquid products typically traded in small size (around Euro 100 000 per trade). In contrast, OTC derivatives allow for customisation of their legal and economic terms and conditions, their average trade size is much larger (around Euro 200 000 000 per trade) and by definition cannot be executed on exchange. When a contract is available on exchange, derivatives users generally prefer this execution as it is much cheaper than OTC. This is why derivatives users would not switch from exchange to OTC if the merged entity were to increase trading fees. Indeed, already today, trading the same contract OTC is substantially more expensive (up to eight times according to a White Paper published by Deutsche Börse in
20081). In addition, there is an ever growing category of customers for which an exchange is the only option as, for various reasons, they cannot and would not trade OTC. This concerns in particular customers that, for risk management reasons, have no mandate or operational set-up to trade OTC.

What does the Decision conclude about competition between European short-term and long-term interest rate derivatives?

While European short-term interest rate derivatives are based on European interbank lending rates and European long term interest rate derivatives on European government debt securities, the market investigation showed that the boundaries between the two are becoming blurred. In addition, whether they are in one market or two, Eurex and Liffe compete with each other both as actual and potential competitors. Eurex has been trying to compete
with Liffe's Euribor contract while Liffe has been trying to rival Eurex's long-term derivatives business. This competition has resulted in fee cuts in the past and would be eliminated by the merger.
What is the geographic scope of the market?

Globally, Eurex and Liffe are by far the largest players offering trading in European financial derivatives. Except for them, there are only two other exchanges offering trading in these contracts: CME in Euribor and the Singapore Stock Exchange in derivatives based on Stoxx indices. None of these achieves significant volumes. Indeed, since it started offering trading in Euribor futures, CME achieved a volume of around 2000 contracts in comparison with close to 250 million traded by Liffe annually. Therefore, whether the market is global or European, the merger would lead to a near monopoly in this product area.

Page 110 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Did the Decision take into account competition from other exchanges active worldwide, including the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange?

Yes. CME, while being a significant player worldwide, has very limited presence in derivatives based on European underlyings which are at the heart of this case. Indeed, its volumes in Euribor futures are by no means comparable to volumes achieved by Liffe or even Eurex.2 CME focuses on US interest rate and equity index futures, and commodity futures. It is therefore very unlikely that CME would become a credible competitive force
in this area. This is because it would face considerable obstacles, as owing to its very different product portfolio, it could not offer collateral savings comparable to those offered by the parties individually or the merged entity in
the product area concerned.
Isn't the Commission, by prohibiting this merger, unduly preventing the creation of a "European champion"? The Commission is not against "champions" as long as these are not created through mergers eliminating the
only rival. The creation of a "European champion" at the expense of entrenching a monopoly with market power
would not be beneficial for the European economy or for European consumers.

On what basis did the Decision conclude that Eurex and Liffe are each other's closest competitors in the markets concerned?

Eurex and Liffe are of comparable size in terms of their membership base and portfolio of contracts they offer for trading and clearing, and they both focus on European financial derivatives, namely European interest rate and equity derivatives. As a result, users of these contracts, at any given moment, have a choice between these two platforms. At the same time, there is no other competitor who can come close to matching the Parties' offering and margin pool in these contracts. Eurex and Liffe exert a significant competitive constraint on each other both as concerns the contracts where they currently compete and the contracts where liquidity has settled on one of their platforms. Indeed, the mere threat to move business from Eurex to Liffe and vice-versa means that they constantly keep each other on their toes. This has resulted in fee cuts and prompted innovation in the past. The proposed merger would have removed this constraint, likely leading to higher fees and less innovation.
How did the Commission analyse the role that banks play in the market?

Banks are key participants in financial markets. Their role in the derivatives markets in question has been analysed in great detail. The market investigation showed that banks, in their interdealer broker role, principally focus on the OTC market. They are also customers of exchanges for exchange-traded derivatives.
How did the Commission assess the claimed collateral benefits of the proposed merger?

The Commission analysed in great detail the claimed benefits of the merger between Eurex and Liffe. The Commission's analysis showed that it is likely that the merger would lead to some collateral savings due to increased cross-margining opportunities. However, the level of these savings is significantly lower than the figure of Euro 3.1 billion initially claimed by the Parties (which is acknowledged by the Parties themselves), and is rather in the range of tens of millions of Euros. This is because it is not the collateral savings but the opportunity cost of holding cash or securities as collateral (i.e. the extra benefits that could be gained by using this money in the best alternative usage) that are the relevant measure of actual cost savings from lower collateral requirements. The Commission also found that some of the collateral benefits could be achieved by other means than the merger and that, in view of the market power of the merged entity, it could recoup a portion of any such savings, thereby reducing any actual benefit for customers. In any case, any such savings would be insufficient to outweigh the significant harm that would be generated by a merger to near monopoly.
How did the Commission assess the claimed liquidity benefits of the proposed merger?

The Commission analysed to what extent a merger between exchanges has the potential to increase liquidity. On the basis of a detailed analysis of various economic studies, the Commission concluded that there is no evidence that liquidity would be likely to increase as a direct consequence of the merger. Academic studies have shown
that rather than consolidation, it is competition such as that observed in cash equity markets since the introduction of MIFID in 20073 which has the potential to generate significant liquidity benefits.

Why were the remedies proposed by the Parties considered insufficient to remove the competition concerns identified in this case?

The Commission took very seriously all remedy proposals and conducted two extensive market tests. The Parties offered a remedy that consisted in three parts: (1) a divestment of a part of Liffe's European single stock

Page 111 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
derivatives business, (2) access to the merged entity's clearing house for materially "new" interest rate, bond and equity index derivatives contracts, and (3) a licence to Eurex's interest rate derivatives trading software. The market test showed that overall, this remedy package would be insufficient in scope, difficult to implement and unlikely to be effective in practice.

As regards the divestment part of the remedy, there were question-marks about the viability of the proposal in light of the necessary regulatory approvals and the likelihood that customers would trade out of their positions rather than transferring them to a new acquirer. This would lead to the erosion of the transferrable open interest. In short, the divested assets could be too small and not diversified enough to be viable on a stand-alone basis.

As concerns the access remedy, the market test showed that besides a number of technical issues associated with such access, there were essentially no contracts that would meet the stringent eligibility criteria and for which there would be a customer demand. This remedy only applied to materially new products although such products are rare. Indeed, most innovations in the derivatives industry concern products that are developed around existing contracts. The Parties constrain each other today with regard to both existing products and adjacent innovations.

Finally, the licence commitment proved to be immaterial as other competitors in most cases already have such software.

As a result, no competitor showed credible interest in the commitments as a whole. It follows that the Commission was not in a position to accept these remedies as they would not restore the competition lost as a result of the merger.
Did the Commission take into account the Parties' public commitment not to increase prices for three years? Although it was never offered as a formal commitment, the Commission took note of the Parties' pledge not to
increase prices. In any event, the pledge concerned list prices and would be ineffective as in practice, actual
prices are often based on rebates. In addition, any such behavioural commitment would be difficult to implement
and monitor. Its relevance was therefore limited.
Did you co-operate with the US authorities?

As is our practice, the Commission and the US Department of Justice (DoJ) cooperated closely in this matter, although the issues on which we focused were different. Whereas we were concerned about derivatives based on European underlyings, DoJ saw some issues in the US cash equity markets.
Would the transaction not bring economy wide benefits, in particular improving the financing possibilities for
SMEs?

The effects of the MIFID regulation on cash equity markets have shown that it is competition, and not consolidation leading to monopoly, that brings about benefits to the economy and users in terms of lower fees, better liquidity, higher quality services and more innovation. As regards SME financing, it is unlikely that the transaction would facilitate better access of SMEs to equity finance. Even if the transaction would have led to a wider investor base, this would not have a significant effect on SMEs given that SMEs mainly appeal to local investors. In any event, the Commission did not find competition concerns in the cash listing, trading and
post-trading markets. Therefore, if the Parties had offered suitable commitments in the area of derivatives markets, the merger could have been cleared and any claimed benefits in cash markets safeguarded.
Did the Commission take the regulatory environment into account?

Exchanges already operate in a very regulated environment. In line with G20 Commitments, upcoming regulation is likely to result in greater volumes being cleared and traded on exchange. The shift of certain contracts from OTC to the exchange environment will enlarge the scope of exchange-traded derivatives for which Eurex and
Liffe compete. Contracts that cannot be traded on exchange will still continue to be traded OTC.
Is this decision consistent with the Commission's own efforts in regulating the financial sector?

MIFID introduced competition in cash equity markets. In its ongoing regulatory efforts4, the Commission seeks to move some opaque and risky OTC derivatives onto clearing houses and exchanges, while also ensuring access to clearing in order to guarantee an open derivatives market with many players. This Decision is therefore fully consistent with the Commission's regulatory objectives.

Mergers: European Commission Blocks  Proposed  Merger Between Deutsche Börse And NYSE Euronext
1,196 words
1 February 2012
Exchange News Direct
EXNEWS
English
(c) 2012 Mondo Visione
The European Commission has prohibited, on the basis of the  EU Merger Regulation, the proposed  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, as it would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges. Together, the two exchanges control more than
90% of global trade in these products. The Commission's investigation showed that new competitors would be unlikely to enter the market successfully enough to pose a credible competitive threat to the merged company. The companies offered, in particular, to sell certain assets and to provide access to their clearinghouse for some categories of new contracts, but overall, the commitments were inadequate to solve the identified competition concerns.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

Eurex, operated by Deutsche Börse, and Liffe, operated by NYSE Euronext, are the two largest exchanges in the world for financial derivatives based on European underlyings. They compete head-to-head and are each other's closest competitors.

The proposed merger would have eliminated this global competition and created a quasi-monopoly in a number of asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole. With no effective competitive constraint left in the market, the benefits of price competition would be taken away from customers. There would also be less innovation in an area where a competitive market is vital for both SMEs and larger firms.
Summary of the Commission's conclusions
1. Relevant market

The Commission's analysis focused on the effects of the proposed merger on the markets for European financial derivatives (European interest rate, single stock equity and equity index derivatives) traded on exchanges. It did not identify any significant competition issues in other areas, such as cash listing, trading and post-trading activities.

Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset (e.g. interest rate, equity). They are used by companies and financial institutions to manage financial risk. They are also used as an investment vehicle by retail and institutional investors – including mutual and pension funds investing on behalf of final consumers. See  MEMO/12/60

Derivatives can be traded on exchanges or "over-the-counter" (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs) are highly liquid, relatively small size (around €100 000 per trade) and fully standardised contracts in all their legal
and economic terms and conditions. In contrast, OTC derivatives typically concern much bigger contracts (around
€200 000 000 per trade) that allow customisation of their legal and economic terms and conditions. The
investigation showed that ETDs and OTCs are generally not considered as substitutes by customers, since they
use them for different purposes and in different circumstances. Some users of exchanges are also not authorised
by their mandates to operate in the OTC market due to risk management considerations.
2. Near monopoly on European financial derivatives traded on exchanges


Page 114 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Eurex, operated by Deutsche Börse, and Liffe, operated by NYSE Euronext, are the two largest exchanges in the world for financial derivatives based on European underlyings. They compete head-to-head and are each other's closest competitors.

The proposed merger would have eliminated this global competition and created a quasi-monopoly in a number of asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole. With no effective competitive constraint left in the market, the benefits of price competition would be taken away from customers. There would also be less innovation in an area where a competitive market is vital for both SMEs and larger firms.

Although other companies, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), provide similar services worldwide, they only do so marginally in the asset classes concerned. The investigation showed that due to the high barriers to entry, no other player would be able to develop trading in European financial derivatives on a sufficient scale to keep the market competitive.

Both Eurex and Liffe operate closed vertical silos linking their exchange to their own clearing house. The merger would have resulted in a single vertical silo, trading and clearing more than 90% of the global market of European financial ETDs. It would have been difficult for a new player to enter the market because given the advantages of clearing similar contracts in a single clearing house, customers would have been reluctant to trade similar derivatives at another exchange. Therefore, the dynamics of the market would have reinforced the monopolistic position of the merger thus resulting in higher prices and lower incentives to innovate.

The two companies claimed that the merger would benefit customers through greater liquidity. However, it is unlikely that the merger would directly yield such benefits. Historically, competition - rather than exchange consolidation - has generated liquidity gains.
The companies also argued that customers would benefit from having to post less collateral for security.
However, these benefits would be significantly less than argued by the merging companies and they could in part
be achieved without the merger.

In any case, any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger. Because of the creation of a near monopoly, any benefits would also be unlikely to be fully passed on to customers.
3. Remedies proposed by the two companies

The two companies offered in particular to sell Liffe's European single stock equity derivatives products where these compete with Eurex. However, the divested assets would be too small and not diversified enough to be viable on a stand-alone basis.

In the commercially more significant area of European interest rate derivatives, the companies did not offer to sell overlapping derivatives products, but only offered to provide access to the merged company's clearing for some categories of "new" contracts. This was considered as insufficient, in particular because it did not extend to existing competing products. There were also fundamental concerns about the workability and the effectiveness
of such an access remedy.

The Commission, therefore, had no alternative but to conclude that the concentration "would significantly impede effective competition in the internal market or a substantial part of it" (Art 2.3 of the Merger Regulation) and prohibited the transaction.
Previous steps

The merger was notified on 29 June 2011. On 4 August 2011, the Commission decided to launch an in-depth investigation. The deadline for a ruling was extended twice in order to assess the remedies. The parties were advised in a Statement of Objections sent in October 2011 that the merger as notified raised serious concerns and, in the absence of a sufficient remedy, might be prohibited.

NYSE Euronext  Statement On EU Decision  To Prohibit Merger Announces Resumption Of $550 Million
Stock Repurchase  Program Following Termination Of Merger Agreement
644 words

Exchange News Direct

NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with  Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their  merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders. In that regard,  NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the  merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext Chairman said, “Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets, and we proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission’s concerns with the transaction. But as we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination.

“While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy – a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year.

“The strong underlying fundamentals of our core business, the strength and depth of our management team, and our diversified global footprint give us unique competitive advantages to exploit in the rapidly evolving global landscape as we continue to grow our successful franchises and return capital to shareholders.”

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer said: “I’m extremely proud of the efforts of the entire NYSE Euronext team over the last year. While effectively advancing our proposed merger on to the final step, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver the commitments we made to our shareholders.

“While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy. Our business had a strong year, giving us the opportunity to return more capital to our shareholders, as evidenced by today’s buy-back announcement.

“We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services. And, as always, we will continue the success we have had in optimizing the business through continued cost discipline and operational efficiency.

“In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing with our investors, employees, customers and partners, the exciting plans we have to continue our growth strategy, build on our reputation as the leading global operator of financial markets and create value for shareholders.

“On behalf of our company, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the regulators in our various markets, who worked very hard to accommodate the approval process for our transaction under very tight deadlines.”

Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues at Deutsche Boerse for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made to see the deal through to approval.”

Following termination of the merger agreement with DB, share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The
$550 million buy-back is being executed under a $1.0 billion Board authorization established in March of 2008.

"The European Commission’s decision is highly regrettable and very hard tocomprehend. It negates the existing, fast-growing global competition amongexchanges and it contradicts reality in putting up a strict
separationbetween the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets. For Europe, thedecision squanders a great opportunity to create a globally competitiveexchange based in Europe and Germany and with a strong US partner.

Deutsche Börse will pursue and expand its proven business model. It willcontinue to grow profitably with new products and new international sitesand cooperation as well as adapt and fine-tune its strategy in line withchanging conditions in the interests of its shareholders, employees andGermany as a financial center. It is a healthy company that will also bepresenting very sound business results for 2011. There are no grounds forany fundamental shift in terms of our strategy, organizational structure ormanagement—rather, now is the time for calm and continuity.

I wish to thank all those who have worked on this exceptional project withgreat effort and commitment. This goes for our staff, the Executive Boardand also the Supervisory Board who lent the project a great deal ofintensive support."

European Commission Blocks  Merger Between Deutsche Börse And NYSE Euronext  - Deutsche Börse Achieves  Substantial Earnings  Growth In 2011/ Company Targeting  Organic Growth/ Key Decisions For Further Growth Already Made
916 words
1 February 2012
Exchange News Direct
EXNEWS
English
(c) 2012 Mondo Visione
The European Commission today announced that it is prohibiting the planned  merger between Deutsche Börse AG and NYSE Euronext because, based on its definition of the market for derivatives trading, it considers the merger to be inadmissible under competition law. Deutsche Börse AG has taken note of the decision with disappointment. The Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG responded: “This is a black day for  Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets. The  EU Commission’s decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. The over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, the major part of the market as a whole, is completely precluded. We therefore regard the decision as wrong. What’s more, it is inconsistent and runs
counter to the aim of extending financial market regulation to the OTC derivatives market which the Commission is simultaneously pursuing.

In its decision, the European Commission also takes a contrary stand to the assessment of the derivatives market arrived at in the USA back in 2007. There, the two Chicago exchanges CME and CBOT were allowed to merge to form the largest globally operating derivatives exchange.”

Reto Francioni, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Börse AG, added: “Prohibiting the planned merger prevents the creation of a European-based, globally competitive exchange group. The merged exchange group would have been the ideal partner to European regulators when it came to providing support in establishing standardized, transparent and stable markets in Europe and worldwide. Deutsche Börse is well equipped and strong enough to grow further and be successful, even without the merger, and will continue to work in partnership with government to promote the stability and integrity of markets. In 2011, we paved the way for our further growth with a binding agreement for the acquisition of 100 percent of shares in Eurex. As one of the world’s leading exchange groups with an integrated business model that sets us apart from many competitors, we are outstandingly positioned – including in the international arena – and are well received on the capital market. On behalf of the entire
Executive Board, I would like to thank all employees who have worked with great commitment to bring about the merger over the last twelve months.”

The Executive Board has assured the Chairman of the Supervisory Board that it will ensure the desired continuity and further advance the company also in light of the EU Commission’s prohibition.
EU decision in contrast to approval from other regulators

The European Commission’s decision stands in contrast to approval already obtained from many other major regulators. Approval had already been granted in Germany by the Bundesamt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), in Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), and in the USA by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the Department of Justice (DOJ) as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Furthermore, to obtain the European Commission’s approval despite what both companies considered to be an erroneous market definition, Deutsche Börse AG and NYSE Euronext had offered substantial concessions within economically reasonable bounds. The shareholders of both companies supported the planned merger with an overwhelming majority.
Deutsche Börse achieves substantial earnings growth in 2011 and will continue growth strategy on organic basis
In line with market expectations, Deutsche Börse delivered solid growth in sales revenue in 2011 compared with
2010. Despite spending some €120 million on further expansion of its core business and around €80 million in
project expenses during 2011 to bring about the planned merger, and even excluding special effects in 2010,
Deutsche Börse substantially boosted earnings relative to the prior year. The positive performance trend from the
Page 120 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
first nine months was thus sustained through the last quarter. Preliminary results for 2011 will be published as planned on February 13 and explained at the annual press briefing on February 14.

Deutsche Börse Group will continue its growth strategy for geographic expansion and at product level and will pursue ongoing development of its integrated business model. The company consequently expects to continue the growth trend sustained over the last three years in 2012.

Reto Francioni: “We associate 2012 with positive growth expectations for Deutsche Börse AG. This assessment is based on the assumption that the euro zone rigorously maintains the stabilization trajectory it has already embarked on. Completing the acquisition of the SIX Group’s 15 percent stake in Eurex in 2012, which will still go ahead without the merger with NYSE Euronext, will also contribute around €100 million revenue.”

Further considerations and details on business performance in 2012, including distributions to shareholders, will be given by the Executive Board in consultation with the Supervisory Board on presentation of the preliminary results for 2011 at the annual press briefing on February 14.

Reto Francioni concluded by adding: “On behalf of my colleagues on the Executive Board, I would like to thank all involved who worked with great commitment to bring about the merger over the last twelve months. My thanks also go to our shareholders, who gave us outstanding support with their near-unanimous approval of the merger. Finally, we would like to thank our colleagues at NYSE Euronext for working with us in a spirit of partnership.”

Financial  Times Deutschland: Deutsche Boerse, Nyse Euronextmerger may fall through on EU ruling

(c) 2012 AII Data Processing Ltd. All Rights Reserved.
The European Commission (EC) is expected to block, in a ruling on Wednesday, the planned  merger between stock exchange operators Deutsche Boerse and Nyse Euronext as it fears competition disadvantages.

Most of the 27  EU commissioners have already expressed their disagreement with the proposed transaction at a preliminary meeting last week.

The commission is mainly concerned that the future company emerging from the deal would monopolise derivatives trading in the region. So far, an approval of the merger has been conditional on the sale of one of the respective derivatives trading subsidiaries -- Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or Nyse's London-based Liffe market.

EC blocks  Deutsche Boerse, Nyse merger

(SeeNews) - Feb 1, 2012 - The European Commission (EC) had decided not to approve the  merger of stock exchange operators Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX) as it would considerably harm competition, Deutsche Boerse said today.
The two companies can appeal  EC's decision in the  European Court of Justice.

According to the initial plans of the stock exchange operators, the merger was supposed to be completed by the end of 2011. However, despite the success in the United States, the European Commission (EC) and the economy ministry of the German state of Hesse showed serious concerns about the effect of the merger on competition in Europe's derivatives markets. Therefore, at the end of December 2011, Deutsche Boerse and NYSE extended the deadline for completing the deal until the end of March 2012.

However, upon the official ban, it will become impossible for the stock exchange operators to fulfill the completion condition for the exchange offer made by Alpha Beta Netherlands Holding to Deutsche Boerse's shareholders prior to March 31, 2012. Therefore, the exchange offer will automatically lapse, Deutsche Boerse said.

The European Commission is set to announce today whether it approves the  merger of stock exchange operators Deutsche Boerse and Nyse Euronext.
Almost a year after announcing their tie-up, the two companies will finally know the future of their project.

The Directorate General for competition considers the merger should be prohibited because it would create a monopoly on the market for derivatives. The potential approval of this deal will create serious problems, Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said last week.

Global Exchange Consolidation Stymied By Regulation

Consolidation of the global exchange industry has now been blocked by regulators on three continents, with banks the only ones likely to cheer the end of an 18-month deal boom that fizzed and then fizzled.

The collapse of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) after objections from  European competition authorities has left executives at both companies looking bruised after their failure of a nearly four-year quest to create the world's biggest venue for trading shares and derivatives.

Regulators and some lawmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia have fared little better, resorting at times to nationalist sentiment to block exchange consolidation, alongside analysis that at times seemed out of step with a world of round-the-clock global trading.

Proponents of consolidation will cite other losers. The march toward globalization spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading hasn't ground to a halt, but some of the claimed benefits are on hold.

Exchanges promised investors access to a broader slate of securities and financial instruments, with cheaper trading fees and less of a drain on banks' strained balance sheets.

Regulators baulked, fearing higher fees, while flag-wavers worried about "national assets" falling into foreign hands.

Wednesday's ruling preserves the independence of the New York Stock Exchange parent, but makes its future influence on the global stage more difficult to gauge as exchanges in Hong Kong, Brazil and Singapore become more of a magnet for traders and companies looking to list.

NYSE Euronext is only the third-largest U.S. exchange by market value and had hoped to leverage the pulling power of the Big Board and its London-based futures arm to seal a deal with Deutsche Boerse.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

The German group is a third larger, runs Europe's biggest derivatives market and is known for its technology savvy.

The one positive for executives from the two companies is that they never had to deal with the likely political storm that selecting a name for the enlarged entity would likely cause.

With Deutsche Boerse shareholders set to own 60% of a combined company, control of the Big Board would have passed to an Amsterdam-based holding company, even though NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer was slated to serve as CEO.

The deal's collapse means that investors will continue to buy and sell shares and derivatives contracts from two different corporate parents running multiple technology systems. The exchanges had pledged to combine their markets and unify trading software, reducing expenses for both the new company and its customers, while
share-issuing companies were to find it easier and cheaper to list their stock in multiple markets.

Brokers privately expressed reservations that many of the cost-savings would extend to individual traders, though, and some voiced concerns to EU regulators that together the exchanges would hold too much power over trading fees.

Michael Spencer, chief executive of U.K.-based inter-dealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Wednesday that the move should be welcomed. "That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters in London.

Together NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of trade in European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

Antitrust authorities in Europe fixated on that figure, over the objections of the merger partners who charged that regulators were overlooking the much larger market for customized derivatives traded privately among Wall Street banks, as well as products offered by foreign-based exchanges.

In recent weeks, executives complained that the antitrust review relied too heavily on input from those banks, whose derivatives trading has drawn scrutiny following the financial crisis and which have built their own exchanges in an effort to bring down the cost of trading.

The EU ruling will spur some soul-searching among the world's leading exchange groups, now confronting limits to a consolidation strategy that has dominated the sector's evolution for a decade.

The Australian government last year blocked the purchase of domestic exchange group ASX Ltd. (ASX.AU) by Singapore Exchange Group on fears that control would be lost over key aspects of the market, while shareholders of Canada's TMX Group Inc. (X.T) in June shot down its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE.LN) after a consortium of banks launched a rival bid to keep TMX under Canadian control.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) last spring outlined the attraction of creating a U.S. super-exchange in their rival takeover attempt of NYSE Euronext, though the Department of Justice threatened to block that deal in May.

Though nationalism played into the downfall of other exchange mergers, EU lawmakers rejected NYSE and Deutsche Boerse's assertion that allowing their merger would create a "European champion" and bolster the region's standing in the increasingly borderless business of securities trading.

Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni and NYSE's Niederauer have maintained that their exchanges can thrive independently, and investors in both companies over the last two months have come to expect the merger to collapse.

Governments' dim view of large-scale exchange tie-ups means that the transformative, multi-billion dollar deals of the past year will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and instruments. Ties to fast-growing Asian markets will continue to be a focus as financial regulators there take steps to allow in more foreign-based investing.

Some have seen the potential for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to pursue joint ventures that accomplish some aspects of the merger, such as an agreement that would seek Deutsche Boerse process some derivatives trades for NYSE Euronext and make the transactions more efficient for customers.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The widely expected failure of a planned  merger between Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) should be welcomed, ICAP PLC (IAP.LN) Chief Executive Officer Michael Spencer said Wednesday.

"That [DB-NYSE] deal was very appropriately rejected by the Competition Commission because it would have created a monopoly in  Europe in financial futures similar to the monopoly that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has in the U.S. And I don't believe we should be in the business of providing monopolies or allowing monopolies to be created," Spencer told reporters.

Spencer also said an emergency borrowing facility by the European Central Bank to European banks may need to be extended.

"The Long-Term Refinancing Operation was clearly extremely useful in stabilizing confidence in the euro zone and providing liquidity into the banking system. It was an extremely timely and foresightful move by the ECB. But is it enough? Possibly, but I think unlikely. They may well be preparing perhaps to extend that facility if it's needed, which would be a good move also," he said.

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) Wednesday said the  European Union has informed them about the decision to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination.

Both would-be  merger partners said that the  EU Commission concluded "that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market," despite remedies offered by both companies.

Both companies said it will now be impossible to fulfil one of the completion conditions for the exchange offer, that the EU clearance must be received by March 31. As a result, the exchange offer will automatically lapse once the merger partners officially receive the prohibition decision, they said. The merger partners will publish the termination offer and will unwind the offer, they said.

With their decision to reject, on antitrust grounds, the plans to create the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, all 27 EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global market.
Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni will comment on the EU decision later Wednesday.

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Stock market operators  NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) started discussions Wednesday to terminate their planned $17 billion merger, which has been blocked by the European Union antitrust authority.

NYSE Euronext will focus on a standalone strategy and intends to resume a $550 million share repurchase program after the issue of its fourth-quarter and 2011 results on Feb. 10, the company said in a statement.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy--a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year," NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in the statement.

The European Commission rejected the stock market operators' merger, which would have created the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, because it would have impeded effective competition. The planned new company would have had a 93% market share of on-exchange derivative trading in Europe. All 27

FRANKFURT -(Dow Jones)- Exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) Wednesday said the European Union has informed them of its decision to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination.

Both would-be merger partners said that the EU Commission concluded "that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market," despite remedies offered by both companies.

Both companies said it will now be impossible to fulfil one of the completion conditions for the exchange offer, that the EU clearance must be received by March 31. As a result, the exchange offer will automatically lapse once the merger partners officially receive the prohibition decision, they said. The merger partners will publish the termination offer and will unwind the offer, they said.

The EU's 27 commissioners were discussing the decision at a meeting Wednesday morning. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that "the EU has adopted its position as opposed."

With their decision to reject, on antitrust grounds, the plans to create the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, all 27 EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is global.

"The Commission's decision is highly regrettable and very hard to comprehend," the chairman of Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board said. "It negates the existing, fast-growing global competition among exchanges and it contradicts reality in putting up a strict separation between the exchange-traded and OTC derivatives markets. For Europe, the decision squanders a great opportunity to create a globally competitive exchange based in Europe and Germany and with a strong U.S. partner," Chairman Manfred Gentz said.

Deutsche Boerse said, however, that it is in a position for growth even without a merger, following earnings and revenue growth in 2011.
Concessions offered by both merger partners were deemed insufficient to ease competition concerns.

Page 137 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Both exchanges now have to consider other, stand-alone options. They are unlikely to come up with a revised merger plan to the current offer which ends March 31. They could challenge the EU decision in court, but such proceedings could take at least a year.

NYSE Euronext said Wednesday that, in view of the rejection, that it would focus on the standalone strategy "that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders." It added that it would resume a $550 million share-repurchase program after the release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

An open question is whether both would-be merger partners, who closely looked into each other's books, will return to their roles as competitors or whether they will join forces on a sub-regulatory level, possibly with a focus on key growth markets such as Asia and Latin America.

EU Blocks  Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext  Deal

BRUSSELS-(Dow Jones)- The  European Commission Wednesday blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

The move, widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the  European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the  merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The commission's concerns centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European exchanges operated by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than 90% market share in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that clearing houses can offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than use other competitors.

2nd UPDATE: EU Blocks  Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext  Deal

The European Commission on Wednesday blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE
Euronext (NYX), saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

The move, widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator, after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The companies may yet appeal the ruling in court, though NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said executives would take some time to evaluate the ruling before deciding to pursue the matter further. Such an effort could be expensive and take years, and success is not assured.

"Before we go there we would like for all of us to have some time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think," Niederauer said in an interview. "But it's something we both would consider."

The commission's objections centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European exchanges operated by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than 90% market share in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that combining the two firms would have created a dominant EU clearing house that could offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than switch to competitors.

The exchanges argued that creating a giant, European trading venue -- complete with its own clearing house -- would mean lower trading costs. But the commission said the new firm's monopoly power would have allowed it to retain those benefits as profits, rather than pass them on to customers as lower costs.

"Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.

Derivatives trading, more profitable than stock dealing, had been the keystone of the $17.9 billion combination since it was unveiled in February 2011. The companies argued that their European derivatives trading businesses focus on different segments of the market: short-term interest-rate futures for Liffe and long-term futures for Deutsche Boerse. They also noted that the over-the-counter market, still home to the vast majority of derivatives trading globally, offers plenty of competition to trading done through exchanges.


Page 140 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the commission took a different view of the market: "The investigation showed that [exchange-trade derivatives] and OTCs are generally not considered as substitutes by customers, since they use them for different purposes and in different circumstance," it said.

Serious threats to the deal emerged in December, when EU competition regulators proved unsatisfied with several deal concessions put forward by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. Proposed remedies included allowing rivals limited access to the combined company's trade-clearing operations, as well as the spinoff of some contracts traded on both companies' markets.

Neither exchange company was willing to divest its derivatives franchise to make the deal happen. Executives of both firms said such a step would undermine the logic of the merger plan.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse pushed for their deal up until the end, with officials from both companies lobbying European Commissioners at last week's World Economic Forum in Davos to approve the deal in spite of the antitrust regulators' conclusion.

Deutsche Boerse said Wednesday that it is in a position for growth even without a merger, following earnings and revenue growth in 2011. NYSE Euronext immediately announced plans to resume a $550 million share buyback program after release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

NYSE CEO: Appeal Possible,  Clearing Strategy Again In Focus

NYSE Euronext (NYX) may revive a plan to build its own  European trade-clearing facility, and will continue to look at bolt-on deals for its technology arm, Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said Wednesday after regulators blocked the planned  merger with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF).

Niederauer said the exchange operators may appeal the decision by the  European Commission, though time is needed to review the ruling from Brussels in more detail.

NYSE Euronext on Wednesday also announced it would restart a $550 million share buyback program after the company reports earnings Feb. 10.
"Investors have been patient and supportive and it's time to reward them for that patience and support," said
Niederauer in an interview.

The executive said that he and his Deutsche Boerse counterpart, Reto Francioni, remain on good terms and did not rule out working together in the future.

Niederauer acknowledged that neither firm anticipated that the EU antitrust review of their merger would focus on their combined market share in exchange-traded derivatives, while overlooking similar contracts that are traded
off-exchange and on foreign-based markets.

The exchange industry will next look to forming smaller-scale partnerships in lieu of mega-merger deals, Niederauer said, though NYSE Euronext would "not shy away" from such a deal if the prospect presented itself.

EU's Almunia: Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Deal Would Have "Practically Eliminated" Market Competition

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)-The proposed tie-up between exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) would have "practically eliminated" market competition and remedies proposed by the two companies "fell far short," the  European Union's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said Wednesday.

Earlier Wednesday, the  EU, which had been considered the main regulatory hurdle, blocked the  merger plans, about a year after the plans were first announced.

The commission's review of the plans "found ample evidence" that both companies and their derivative exchanges --Eurex and Liffe-- "compare head to head and are each other's closest competitors," Almunia told reporters at the press briefing following the EU's decision.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global market.

The review found that the two companies themselves "don't view OTC products as competitors for the derivatives they trade," they only consider each other as competitors, Almunia said.

Fox Business Network: Imus in the Morning
FBNIM
English
© 2012 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. Prepared by CQ-RollCall Inc.
DON IMUS, HOST, "IMUS IN THE MORNING": This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the FOX Business Network. Now, here's Diane Macedo.

DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone.  European Union regulators had blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. Our FOX Business' Charlie Gasparino for us reported the NYSE has confirmed the news saying, the two companies are in talks to terminate the  merger agreement. NYSE Euronext says, it will focus on a stand-alone strategy and will aim to grow us derivatives business. It will also resume its $550 million stock repurchase plan.

The E.U. competition commissioner is scheduled to hold the press conference this morning to give more details on that.

And Mitt Romney scored a convincing victory over his rivals last night, but the race for the GOP presidential nomination is far from over. For more, let's head over to Rich Edson in Tampa, Florida. Good morning, Rich.

RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Diane. You need more than 1,100 delegates, Mitt Romney is securing all 50 republican delegates from Florida last night. Here are your totals. Forty six percent of the vote for Mitt Romney. Newt Gingrich finishing second at 32 percent. Rick Santorum at 13 percent. Ron Paul at seven percent. A very strong finish for Mitt Romney here. This is a very ugly race at times, nasty republican in-fighting. Still Mitt Romney says, this entire process has made Republicans stronger.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Primaries are not easy. And they're not supposed to be. As this primary unfolds, our opponents in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided and weak. But I've got news for them. A competitive primary does not divide us. It prepares us. And we will win.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: Newt Gingrich says, he will carry on and recapture that momentum that he had just a short while ago. From here the candidates are heading out west. Nevada, Colorado and Minnesota. Many of these western primaries and caucuses begin this weekend with Nevada. Back to you, Diane.

MACEDO: All right. Rich, thank you. Will it be Newt's first comeback? So, we'll see. And Facebook is expected to file for a $5 billion initial public offering as early as this morning. Robert Gray is following that story for us. Robert, what happened to $10 billion?

ROBERT GRAY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, Diane. They report said, they could start at $5 billion. That amount could go much higher of course. This would just be a sort of the amount they would give to
the Securities and Exchange Commission when they do file to base their fees off of. So, we'll be watching those filings all day for the SEC to see if it comes out this morning or perhaps after the close today. Five billion dollars, it


Page 146 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would still be the biggest internet IPO in the U.S. ever. Google raised 1.9 billion back in 2004. By the way, that was the year Facebook was founded.

The IPO sale could raise up to $10 billion. We talked about that last week. That would make it the biggest tech IPO ever. The value would approach $100 billion for the company, anywhere between $75 billion and $100 billion obviously, a very wide range. So, looking to see what kind of valuation we could see from this filing. Some things to look for in the filing today, investors and analysts looking to check out the profitability, how profitable are they? Where are they getting the profits from? Same story with the revenue growth. Is it still booming for Facebook? Is the growth still there? The sales, the amount of on-line ad sales versus the virtual transactions.

And I'm talking about the likes of Farmville and other virtual transactions to go on there. Where will they list? That may not be in the document, their tickers expected to be FB. But that doesn't mean anything these days. And of course, they changed the rules a couple of years ago. So, two-letter tickers can be on the NASDAQ or on the New York Stock Exchange. We've seen four letters like LinkedIn go last year to the NYSE. And of course, which early investors are selling stakes and -- when like Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO, is he going to sell anything in there? We'll have to wait for the document -- Diane.
MACEDO: All right. Robert, thanks. Let's take a look at the markets now. Here in the U.S., futures are in the
green across the board. Dow futures are up almost triple digits. We're seeing a gain of about 93 points so far. The
S&P is up by about 10. And the NASDAQ is up by 13. Over in Europe, manufacturing reports in the U.K. showed
improvement in January over December. And there's still some optimism that a Greek debt deal will be reached
soon. Markets there are also in the green. London is up by 81. Paris is up by a little more than 50 points. And
Frankfurt is up 126.

Now, for more on the markets this morning, let's go to Brenda Kelly. She's a market analyst over at CMC Markets and live in London. Good morning, Brenda. So, it's manufacturing data that's driving trade this morning or is there more to these gains?

BRENDA KELLY, CMC MARKETS MARKET ANALYST: To some extent, there does seem to be some progress in regards to the Greek deals also. But the manufacturing output from the Eurozone, while -- contraction chargely beat consensus. Germany was in (INAUDIBLE). But the U.K. really surprised to be upside. But I would temper
that with the fact that we do have services coming out, services on Friday which makes up a bigger amount of the economy. So, that would be something closely watched. To some extent, the market is expecting further QE from the Bank of England. And if it comes out better than expected, then that control that into this array.

MACEDO: All right. That's Brenda Kelly over CMC Markets, thanks Brenda. Let's take a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are also in the green. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business, giving you the power to prosper.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.

IMUS: Well, Gingrich can keep campaigning. Remember the Huckabee wouldn't stop? It was over, and he'd still go to that phantom caucus or whatever the hell they had, in Puerto Rico. Remember that? Just would not get off the stage.
CONNELL MCSHANE, NEWSMAN: It's over you're saying.
BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Yes. He's going to be like the Japanese soldier on the Pacific
Island, 1950's still fighting World War II.
IMUS: I mean, it's just over. Get out. MCSHANE: Forty six more states, he says. IMUS: Well, it's just over.
MCGUIRK: He got clubbed like the elderly seal that he is.

IMUS: Yes. So, all right, Carl Jeffers is already here. I came here. I walked in about 5:30 Eastern Time this morning, and there's Carl.
MCSHANE: Yes, he was here. IMUS: I walked in before that.
Page 147 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: He was here before I got here. Yes.
IMUS: And so, I started to ask Carl why he was here, and I did ask him, and he started to tell me, and I realized I
didn't really want to know. He's still telling me, he drove up from Baltimore or someplace.
MCSHANE: We'll have the end of that answer later this morning. IMUS: Right. So, he's here.
MCGUIRK: He loves the I-man.

IMUS: And then the blonde babes are coming up, Deirdre Imus and Lis Wiehl. And we'll ask them about the big election, and the Donkey Semen. So, Blonde on Blonde and Donkey Semen, you know what that translates too?
MCSHANE: What's that?
IMUS: Howard Stern numbers. That's what I'm talking about. MCSHANE: Yes, ratings go.
IMUS: OK. So, then Jay Mohr, he's out in Indianapolis for doing something. MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: He's a big sports guy, right? Isn't he Lou?
LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: I believe he is.
IMUS: Yes. So, there's nothing not to like about him. So, he'll be on. RUFINO: Loving the gay bar.
IMUS: Yes. And then Chris Christie and Jesse Jackson are here as well. I was telling Connell if I like something about FOX or FOX News or whatever, I say it. If there's something I don't like, I just keep it to myself because what's the point? Why work for somebody? Well, there's just no point in going number one inside your own head. It's just stupid.
MCSHANE: No, but you were saying positive things.
IMUS: Well, I was saying to Connell the election coverage for the FOX News Channel -- I switch back and I watch
Cavuto a little bit.
MCSHANE: Yes, me too.
IMUS: You put Megyn Kelly and what's her name? MCSHANE: Megyn Kelly.
IMUS: Megyn Kelly. And Bret Baier. MCSHANE: Sure.
IMUS: And then Martha -- MCSHANE: MacCallum.
IMUS: And then who's the guy, what's his name?

MCSHANE: Brit Hume and then that Kristin woman, and then the kind of the cute guy with the goatee, you can't get any better. CNN's got a whole room full of ugly people. Well, there's no point --
MCSHANE: Well, they have like 80 people.
IMUS: They've got a room full of ugly people. It's television, you know. MCSHANE: Very distracting.
Page 148 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: The difference in FOX News and every other network is the people are happy to be here and they're happy to be on the air.

IMUS: Oh, God. I thought I turned her mic on just -- well, so I wouldn't forget when she does her business report. But who would think that she would start blabbing away?
MCDOWELL: I worked here longer than any of you idiots. So, I would know better.

IMUS: That's Mr. Idiot to you, sweetheart. And where were you this morning? I didn't get a chance to talk to you, our little makeup chat.
MCDOWELL: Downstairs getting my face and my hair done. IMUS: Well, you look good today.
MCDOWELL: Thank you. MCGUIRK: Yes.
IMUS: Anyway, so that's coming up. Lou Rufino is here and Bernie and -- hey, Warner. WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Yes.
IMUS: So, I watch ESPN all the time. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Here's another thing about ESPN, which I have no reason -- there is nobody on there who is not any good. You ever watch them, Warner?
WOLF: Yes, I mean, I watch.
IMUS: You don't. Lou, do you watch them? WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Warner, don't worry about them. RUFINO: Yes, Warner, stop.
IMUS: Is there anybody on there who's not any good? RUFINO: I'm thinking that I can't.
IMUS: No. None of them are great, but none of them -- there's nobody there who -- you don't look at them and say how did they get the job?
MCSHANE: Yes. I know your point. Nobody's horrible. IMUS: Nobody is horrible.
MCSHANE: Good point.
IMUS: So, Trey Wingo -- he's one of their anchors. MCSHANE: Yes. One of their anchors. Yes.
IMUS: Peyton Manning is doing this promotion for Gatorade. It's a good promotion by the way, because I-man be loving some Gatorade but I can't -- because it got sugar in it. And I don't drink it because I have cancer.
MCSHANE: Sure.

IMUS: However, they have this whole nutritional program they're promoting now which is a good idea by the way. And Peyton Manning is their spokesman. Did you see any of this interview with Peyton Manning, Warner?
WOLF: Yes. In fact, we have an interesting cut where he's asked about the doctor and if he's going to come back.
Page 149 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Didn't you think Peyton was great in this interview?
WOLF: Well, yes man, he's polished.

IMUS: You know, here's the thing. And the guy, the Trey Wingo person did an incredible job. He asked him every possible way he could ask him about trying to get an answer out of him. And the thing about Peyton is he did never indicated at all that he was irritated.
WOLF: No.
IMUS: I mean, you could see why he's great. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: I mean, he was charming and he was relaxed. And the guy just kept asking. It was irritating. He did it skillfully. I said man, that's.
MCGUIRK: Two thumbs up, baby.
IMUS: Two thumbs up for Peyton Manning. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: The guy did a good job, too. The ESPN guy did a good job. MCGUIRK: Bingo for Wingo or whatever.
MCSHANE: That's it.
IMUS: What were you going to say about Peyton Manning?

WOLF: Well, we have a cut where he was asked by Trey Wingo about the doctors and the situation. And here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PEYTON MANNING, INDIANAPOLIS COLTS: Everything they're saying, though is everything's right on point. Everything looks good. And I'll be cleared and ready to go. So, that's encouraging to me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

WOLF: You know, I was talking to an orthopedic surgeon. He said, let me tell you something, I don't care who the doctor is, he can tell him OK if you want to play, but that Peyton Manning in all likelihood had to sign a paper, whoever the orthopedic surgeon is, absolving him of any, you know, sending him in or it was on his watch that he played and got hurt. So, I mean, it just -- it's beyond me, this orthopedic surgeon that he would play and risk -- I don't care how fit he is. If you have three neck operations in a year and a half, you don't want to play football. This isn't tennis.

IMUS: Well, you know, on ESPN, they had some kind of graph, graphic about these great quarterbacks and how they concluded their careers. Montana, remember went to the Chiefs. Namath went to the Rams. Remember the L.A. Rams.
WOLF: Well, Montana got the chiefs into the playoffs. Joe Namath was -- IMUS: Well, you know, Brett Favre went to the Jets.
WOLF: Well, they were eight in three, you know, for a point.
IMUS: There was some other guy, can't remember who was. But the point is, why. WOLF: Well, Bobby Layne did it.
IMUS: Who?



Page 150 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Bobby Layne went from the Lions to the Steelers. And Norvin Brooklin (ph) took the Eagles to the championships. He had played for the Rams all those years. But they didn't have a neck injury, I-man.
MCGUIRK: All right.
WOLF: That's the difference. IMUS: Here's my prediction. MCSHANE: Here it comes.
IMUS: Well, I just can't imagine he'll ever play again. WOLF: I agree.
IMUS: He's a smart guy. I mean, what a charming guy?
MCSHANE: That sounds like he wants to, right, from the interview? Or no? IMUS: Doesn't he, Warner?
WOLF: Well, I'm sure he does want to. RUFINO: He definitely want to.
WOLF: But I think he has enough sense, people say, hey, is it worth the risk? No.

IMUS: He was really good in the interview. You can see why he could -- I mean, that translates into playing football and playing quarterback, some other guy described him as a surgeon out there. That's what he was, speaking of surgery.
All right. Thirteen after the hour. All that's coming up. Time for a little news now. And here with that is Connell
McShane. Good morning, Connell.

MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, I-man. It was a convincing win for Mitt Romney in Florida right now. Nearly half the vote. Percentage wise Romney 46, Newt Gingrich 31, Rick Santorum 13. So, with that, Romney going after President Obama in last night's victory speech.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROMNEY: Another era of American crisis, Thomas Payne is reported to have said, lead, follow or get out of the way. Well, Mr. President, you were elected to lead. You chose to follow. And now it's time for you to get out of the way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCSHANE: One guy not getting out of the way would be Newt Gingrich. He had the signs around him last night. IMUS: One of the things that Romney proved in this primary is that he's tough and mean enough to run. MCSHANE: Yes, in those debates.
IMUS: Thought he was an empty suit, at least I did. And you know, I mean, you've got to be able to get -- right, Bernie? Got to get tough.
MCGUIRK: No doubt. He stepped up. I-man back on the wagon. I like that. IMUS: But I don't think I ever got off the wagon. Was I off the wagon, Dagen? MCDOWELL: Yes.
IMUS: I did?
MCDOWELL: Oh, yes. You dropped Mitt Romney like. IMUS: Well, no, I didn't. Whose wagon did I get on?
Page 151 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCDOWELL: You got on Newt Gingrich's.
IMUS: No, I did not. That is a vicious lie. I did not get on skunk vomit's wagon. That's crazy. MCSHANE: You're off the suit dummy, the whole thing, I mean, you ripped them.
IMUS: That was constructive criticism. MCGUIRK: Exactly.
IMUS: Connell continues.

MCSHANE: Well, Gingrich, 46 more states, he says. And we'll see. This month, it's February 1st, this month's fairly quiet. Yet, the caucuses this weekend in both Nevada and Maine and then Arizona and Michigan would be the next big primaries towards the end of the month. Super Tuesday, March 6 with ten different states.

So, the Obama administration making a pledge to fix the housing mess today. As the President will outline plans to allow all homeowners to refinance their mortgages at more lower rates even if they're under water, owing more than their homes or worth. Then, the first lady.
IMUS: I wouldn't want to do that, then.
MCSHANE: Oh, you'd rather walk away from the home when you're...
IMUS: Well, if you're under water and you owe more than it's worth, I mean, see you. MCSHANE: Well, no, no, that's not the American way I-man.
IMUS: Live in a car.

MCSHANE: That's not the way. That's not the way. People want to sell their house or then whatever they want to do. A lot of people want to refinance and can't because they are underwater. Michelle Obama was on Jay Leno last night promoting her let's move campaign, trying to get kids to eating healthy and what not. And Leno was there eating Apples. And he had a pizza made of egg plant but apparently, he has awful eating habits. But Leno also asking the First Lady about the Obama girls.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAY LENO, HOST, THE TONIGHT SHOW: Do the girls have cell phone? MICHELLE OBAMA, U.S. FIRST LADY: Malia does.
LENO: Malia does.
OBAMA: He got one last year.
LENO: How do you explain to the other one, you sister got a cell phone but you don't. OBAMA: No, you don't get a cell phone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCSHANE: Michelle Obama. Secretary of State.
IMUS: You know who else I love like her? I tell you who else is great? MCSHANE: Who's that?
IMUS: Ann Romney.
MCSHANE: Yes, everybody likes her, right?

IMUS: Oh, mean. I mean, I didn't pay attention to her until, well, I know her but I mean, I just know her from her being on the program, the big horse thing she's into too. But she was so charming last night, man -- that's a winner there. So, I like Michelle Obama too. I think she's a winner. But Ann Romney, that's all right, babe.

Page 152 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: There you go. Speaking of first ladies, former First Lady Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warning the U.N. about instability in Syria saying the violence on the increase there, the nation is on the brink of civil war.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HILLARY CLINTON, SECRETARY OF STATE: The evidence is clear that Assad forces are initiating nearly all of the attacks that killed civilians.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCSHANE: And then from Pakistan this morning, government and security officials say, Pakistani fighter jets have bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the border with Afghanistan. What are you laughing at?
IMUS: It's not funny. MCSHANE: Next line.
IMUS: Somebody said that Hillary Clinton looks like Jesse Ventura with her hair pulled back and just angry. And I
reject those kinds of characterizations.
MCSHANE: Yes, you do.
IMUS: Former first lady of this country and the current secretary of state. MCSHANE: Right, of course.
MCGUIRK: Working hard for this country.

MCSHANE: The good timing, I-man. You've always been known for that. TSA, Transportation Security Administration confirming it is pursuing disciplinary action against six baggage screeners out of Newark Airport including some who are suspected of sleeping during parts of their shifts.

IMUS: Well, 17 after the hour. Time for business news. And here with that is, here she is, Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.

MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. The upside is they're sleeping and not stealing from you. So, they're not rifling through your bags finding unmentionables. Remember that story Bernie told you about the --
IMUS: Yes.

MCDOWELL: Yes. Hey, morning, everybody. The Dow, it looks like we're set to start a February on an up note. The Dow actually gained 415 points in January, up 3.4 percent. It's the best percentage gain in January since
1997. So, pretty incredible performance. By the way though, why do we care? Because every time the Dow ends up in January, 82 percent of the time it finishes the entire year higher. So, that is good news there. And then watch today for Facebook to file its paper work to go public. Again, the offering size is expected to be $5 billion, that's smaller than the 10 billion that was originally discussed. But you know what? If the demand is there, they can always up the size of the offering and it still could wind up being $100 billion company.
IMUS: Are you on Facebook? MCDOWELL: Yes.
IMUS: How do you use it?
MCDOWELL: I post just observations occasionally, some photos. IMUS: Of yourself?
MCDOWELL: There is a photo I posted the other day of me and Tracy Byrnes together. Fully clothed. IMUS: What would be the reason for that?
MCDOWELL: Just to share my life and all the people who really couldn't give a damn, I guess.


Page 153 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: OK. All right. Nineteen after the hour. So, if you become an inside Imus member, go to Imus.com and become an inside Imus member. I'll give you a copy of the Imus Ranch record, either one of them.
MCSHANE: Very nice.

IMUS: But then you have access to all of the shows, all the radio programs on your iPod, iPhone or whatever. But you also get the behind the scenes blog that Rob and Tony wrote. The one they wrote yesterday made me laugh out loud. So, I have to approve it before it goes out. Before they would post it, and then I had to join inside Imus in order to be able to read it. But funny stuff, so. And 100 percent of the money goes to the Imus Cattle Ranch for Kids with Cancer, so everybody wins. Become an inside Imus friend and get access to all that. You know, Elvis's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley is 44 years old today.
MCSHANE: How about that? MCGUIRK: Happy birthday, baby.
IMUS: Come on. Anyway, time for sports now. Sports sponsored by Bigelow tea, the official tea of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program and the number-one selling tea in this company, the number-one Tea company in the world. Bigelow. Here's Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.

WOLF: Good morning, I-man. Broadcasting from the Small Business Authority Studios. NBA, the Lakers beat the Bobcats by 33 points. The Bobcats are horrible. Three in 19. Celtics almost blew a 22-point lead, third-quarter lead -- beat the Cavs 93-90. The Knicks beat the four and 19 Pistons, 113-86.
IMUS: Yes. The Knicks lost last night. WOLF: Oh, with the Pistons.
IMUS: I mean, they would have had to back the truck up, you know. Come on.

WOLF: You know, I mean, there are really some bad teams in the NBA. Pistons four in 19. The Wiz and Hornets are four in 17. Charlotte three in 19.
IMUS: How did this Piston people get jobs in the NBA? I mean. WOLF: That's a good question.
IMUS: Weren't they all pretty good players at some point in college. Lou, weren't they? RUFINO: I didn't even know who's on the team now.
WOLF: Well, they traded Richard Hamilton. RUFINO: They got rid of the guy, yes.
WOLF: Yes. He was one of the best players.
IMUS: Well, these other people, where did the other players come from?
WOLF: Oh, they did come from college. Sure, of course. Which is a minor league system for the NBA. IMUS: Yes. Somebody must have drafted them, thought they were pretty good.
WOLF: Well, maybe they took some hints from Isaiah Thomas. IMUS: What was that?
WOLF: Well, who to pick. IMUS: Oh, I see.
WOLF: You know, former Piston. Forget the Pistons.
IMUS: Yes.


Page 154 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Kentucky, number-one team in the country, beats Tennessee, 69- 44. And North Carolina wins. They're number six. Sixty eight-53 over Wake Forest. The good news for the Patriots, all pro-tied in, Rob Gronkowski, lead the entire NFL was 17 touchdown catches, took off his boot and is walking without a limp. And finally, I-man, the invisible man, Chad Ochocinco of the Patriots, you know, he's been there all year -- but he caught only 15 balls for just one touchdown. So he was asked by a reporter if he was more capable than that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHAD OCHOCINCO, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: I don't know. Are you trying to bait me? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: No.
(CROSSTALK)
OCHOCINCO: I just go out and have fun. And you guys probably put that label on me. I didn't. All I did was
(bleep), I never said I was good. Two things I like to do, it's -- to celebrate.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

IMUS: Deion Sanders is obsessed whether Ocho was going to get a ball. He asked Tom Brad, Chad going to get a ball?
MCGUIRK: Get some balls, baby. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: So, what's coming up in your briefing, Bernie?
MCGUIRK: Newt Gingrich's classless speech from last night, boss. And Michelle Obama rates the President and
Mitt Romney singing. Coming up.
IMUS: Well, Mitt Romney should not try to sing. That's the first thing. We played him singing "America the
Beautiful." Then we played Ray Charles' version. I mean, the President wins that one. All right, Maroon 5.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER: IMUS IN THE MORNING. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. There's a shakeup at Sony. Howard Stringer, the current chairman,
president and CEO is being partially replaced by Kazuo Hirai. The company says, Hirai will become president and
CEO on April 1st while Stringer will stay on as chairman. Sony wants a driving force and the consumer electronics
sector has been struggling to regain its standing. The company says, it is the fourth straight year of net losses for
the year ending March 31st due to its struggling TV unit and has also been losing ground to the South Korean
rival Samsung Electronics.

Aetna says, it made an adjusted profit of 97 cents a share in the fourth quarter, that's just what analyst is expected. Revenue $8.54 billion just topped expectations. The health insurance company says it sees a 2012 full-year operating profit of about $5 a share. The estimate is for 509.

Here's a look at futures now. They're up across the board. Dow futures are up by 84. The S&P is up by eight points. And the NASDAQ is up by 12. Let's take a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are also in the green. Oil is up by about 70 cents, around $99 a barrel. Gold is up a little more than seven bucks at $1,747 an ounce.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on FOX Business, giving you the power to prosper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
IMUS: What is the matter, Godfather?
ROB BARTLETT, AS THE GODFATHER: What is going on here? IMUS: I'm just fixing my hair.

Page 155 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BARTLETT: You're fixing with your hair like you're in "Steel Magnolias." Why don't you act like a man!
(LAUGHTER)
IMUS: That will be fine. What are you doing now? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I'm trying to fix it.
IMUS: That's fine!
MCSHANE: That's organic hairspray. (END VIDEO CLIP)
IMUS: All right. It is 29 minutes after the hour. Carl Jeffers is here. And he's coming up. He broke the record the last time he was on. One of his answers ran -- we had a clock on it -- it was over five and a half minutes. He broke the record last time he was on. One of his answers ran -- we had a clock on it. It was over five and a half minutes.
CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. IMUS: Five and a half minutes.
MCSHANE: Details.

IMUS: And he's a smart guy, so it's not like it's -- like some nut in the park who's drunk or deranged. I mean he makes sense, you know. So he's already here. He's ready to go.
BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: All fired up, baby.

IMUS: Yes, he's fired up. But first we have a "Bernie Briefing" sponsored by Planet Fitness. And with that, Bernard McGuirk.
Good morning, B.
MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss, from the Small Business Authority Studios here.

And Newt Gingrich, last night in the Florida primaries, he got, like I said, he got clubbed like the elderly seal that he is and class act that he was. He never called Mitt Romney to congratulate him, nor did he mention Romney's name during his speech last night. Instead, he referred to him as Massachusetts moderate again. And listen to his delusion about going forward. Take a listen. It's quick.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NEWT GINGRICH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The same people who said I was dead in June and July and said I was gone after Iowa, who seemed totally quiet the night of the South Carolina victory, are now going to be back saying, what's he going to do, what's he going to do, what's he going to do? So I just want to reassure them tonight. We are going to contest every place and we are going to win. And we will be in Tampa as the nominee in August.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCGUIRK: Are you kidding me? IMUS: Save that clip, by the way.
MCGUIRK: Yes. Like I said, the Japanese soldier in the Pacific in the '50's still fighting World War II, somebody's got to tell him, the war is over, man, you lost.
IMUS: Jerry Sandusky will be the nominee before he is. Who's he kidding?

MCGUIRK: And then of all the things you could go after Obama on, last night he goes after President Obama on singing. Take a listen. Quick.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GINGRICH: And I'll tell you up front, I'm not going to compete with Obama in singing, because I'm not running for entertainer, I'm running for president.
And I would say to him now, Mr. President, you can -- (END VIDEO CLIP)
IMUS: Oh, God, enough!
MCGUIRK: Cut it off. What's the matter with you guys? IMUS: No, but, I mean --
MCSHANE: Anybody listening?
IMUS: We want to see -- I'd rather you talk about the donkey semen than have to listen to skunk vomit. MCGUIRK: But he's just -- he's very revealing is what it is.
IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: He just -- he hurts himself when he opens his fat mouth is the point. IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: And we have Michelle Obama yesterday -- last night on Jay Leno rating her husband's singing, Mitt
Romney's singing. But seeing as how we're out of time, boss, we'll bring it to you a little bit later. How about that?
IMUS: Well, it's pretty obvious how that went. We could rate it. The president was pretty good. Mitt Romney was
--
MCGUIRK: Well, the first lady has her own opinions and we're going to bring it to you. IMUS: Well, let me hear it. We can't -- we've got to hear it now.
MCGUIRK: Oh, we've got to hear it now. OK, play it, Lou. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY (voice-over): I didn't even hear about it until it got on YouTube, but -- JAY LENO, "THE TONIGHT SHOW" (voice-over): Right.
OBAMA: But he does have a beautiful voice. And he singes to me all the time. LENO: Really?
OBAMA: Yes.
LENO: Like (INAUDIBLE)?
OBAMA: He sings that song. That's why I knew when people said he sang -- LENO: Yes.
OBAMA: I said, I bet he sang Al Green. And that I -- he does that all the time. I can't sing, but -- LENO: I think you would say he has a better singing voice than you, is that fair?
OBAMA: Yes, he does. Absolutely does. But, yes, he doesn't hesitate to show off his lungs to his wife. He's good. LENO: Now, did you hear Mitt Romney sing? What did you think?
OBAMA: I saw it in the green room.
LENO: Right.

Page 157 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
OBAMA: Beautiful.
LENO: Beautiful. (END VIDEO CLIP) IMUS: She's charming.
MCGUIRK: There you go.
IMUS: There's nothing not to like about her either, by the way. MCGUIRK: Not at all.
IMUS: Thirty-three after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. We'll talk with Carl Jeffers next. Rick James would have been 64 today. But, of course, he's not. He's with Elvis.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here's Diane
Macedo.
DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everyone.

European Union regulators have blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. As Fox Business' Charlie Gasparino first reported, the NYSE has confirmed the news, saying the two companies are in talks to terminate the merger agreement. NYSE Euronext says it will focus on a stand-alone strategy and will aim to grow its derivatives business. It will also resume its $550 million stock repurchase plan. The EU competition commissioner is scheduled to hold a press conference this morning to give more details.

Keep an eye on shares of amazon.com today. The stock is down more than 8 percent in the pre- market after the online retailer reported mixed fourth quarter results and issued a disappointing first quarter outlook. Amazon beat expectations on the bottom line, but revenue of $17.4 billion was nearly $1 billion below the street's forecast. Still, the company says Kindle sales nearly tripled over the holidays compared to the year before.
Now let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina in the Fox Business Weather Center. More mild weather at least for the northeast, right, Maria?
MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, that's right, Diane. Thankfully we're going to be looking at more mild temperatures today. And enjoy them while you've got them because we are going to see a bit of a cool-down coming up at least for the weekend.

Now, the reason for that is that we do have a cold front pushing eastward. So ahead of it you get those southerly winds pulling all of that warmer air northbound. So we're going to be seeing a high in the upper 50's here in New York City and possibly breaking 60s in Philadelphia. So, well above average.

Another thing we will see with this cold front, though, is some rainfall. So you're also going to need the umbrella. As far south as parts of Louisiana, also across Mississippi, heavy rain just south of Jackson. That rain does stretch northward across the northeast. And right where temperatures got cold enough across northern Maine, we're going to pick up some snow. And it could be significant at times. We're looking at some possible accumulations, Diane, of up to 10 inches.
MACEDO: All right, Maria, thanks.
Let's take a look at futures now. Dow futures are up by 87 points.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. IMUS: Oh, come on.
MCSHANE: What?

IMUS: All these telephone numbers just over and over again is so annoying. I'm referring to a radio commercial here in New York and --

Page 158 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: I'm sure people got it.
IMUS: Oh, God. They have pretty good products, but, I mean --
MCSHANE: I know. Well, you've got to repeat the number sometimes, make sure people know it.
IMUS: All right, 21 till the hour. Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, our old friend Carl
Jeffers.
Good morning, Mr. Jeffers.
CARL JEFFERS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Good morning, Don. Good to be here with you today. IMUS: How are you?
JEFFERS: I'm OK. I'm OK.
IMUS: So are you a Democrat? Is that your deal?

JEFFERS: Actually, I am an independent, but I generally support the Democratic positions because those are the closest to where I feel on the issues.
IMUS: Right. JEFFERS: Sure.
IMUS: So, in the election coming up, you'll vote for Obama or --
JEFFERS: Oh, I don't see any other option really. I think that with -- it's my judgment that between 2012 and
2016, the next president will have two to three Supreme Court appointments. And at least one of them this time
will be to replace a conservative on the bench. And if that's the case, I want Barack Obama making those
appointments. Not to mention the fact that I do think he offers the best future for America. And let's hope he can
get past the limitations he had the last four years that disappointed a lot of people.

IMUS: Yes, so, I mean -- I just -- on the basis of Supreme Court appointments, hardly seems to me -- I mean it might be one reason to vote for somebody, but --
JEFFERS: Sure. Sure.
IMUS: He's a nice guy. He sings. He can hit those Al Green notes. But -- JEFFERS: Yes.
IMUS: But -- and I'm -- I try to be pretty fair, and I don't really have -- JEFFERS: And you are.
IMUS: And I don't have an agenda. JEFFERS: Yes.
IMUS: But it just seems to me that he's been a disaster as president.

JEFFERS: Well, I know that that's your take on it. And you are a fair man. But, listen -- well, first of all, the recent singing of Al Green by President --
IMUS: I mean he killed Osama bin Laden. That's good. So he's dead.

JEFFERS: Yes. Yes. And Romney singing "America The Beautiful," is like turning the race into "American Idol" for the presidency.
IMUS: Yes.

JEFFERS: But here's the thing, Don. This president came into office with an extraordinary burden that we really have never seen. It's been unprecedented. And I supported him then.

Page 159 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: And he made it worse.

JEFFERS: I supported him then, and I do not think that he made it worse. I think the stimulus package worked. They sold it the wrong way. And he was such a great communicator that it disappointed me that he's done it that way.

And the other thing I'm disappointed about is in terms of him not tackling the race issue in a way that we would have expected. But, and here's the key to the election this year, if President Obama can get the electorate to make this an election of choice, which I'm saying I'm doing, I choose Obama, and so will America. If the Republicans are successful in making this election a referendum on the past four years, they have a chance. But only Mitt Romney has that chance. And his chance is receding every week as the president gets stronger and the Republicans keep going after each other in a way that's absolutely destroying some of the momentum they need.

Listen, when you're trying to defeat an incumbent president of the United States, I don't care who he is or what color he is, you need to coalesce around one candidate early to raise all the money you can and stop making the ads that the Democrats are going to use against you in the fall. That's how you can defeat an incumbent president. And even then it's difficult.
IMUS: Yes. But people are going to vote, as James Carville and Paul Begala famously said -- JEFFERS: Yes.
IMUS: It's the economy. And it's still going to be the economy. And so --

JEFFERS: I agree that the economy will be an issue. But, Don, you have to acknowledge this. If President Obama had been running for reelection in the first year of his presidency, he would have been defeated very easily.
IMUS: Yes.

JEFFERS: But at this stage, there are positive enough signs in the economy, know that -- make it clear, everyone is still suffering a great deal and more than before, but the attitude about the future, it has enough glimmer of
hope that the president can capitalize on that and possibly, even with the economy, be able to succeed in getting people to feel that he represents the best choice for the future. That's the argument (INAUDIBLE).

IMUS: Well, who are you talking to? I mean, where are you getting this information? Because they -- you go out and talk to regular people in this country, nobody thinks that.

JEFFERS: I agree with you. But the overall economic indicators are enough and show enough of a positive trend that it is not the universal without reservation kind of condemnation of the economic policy that you had in the first and second year of the president's term. And I said all along that the timing was going to work out well for him. I actually was off a bit. I said at the beginning of his term that in three years things would be so good that people would be walking around buying homes again with no money down, no income and all that.

Well, we're not there yet, but it is beginning to show enough. And by the fall of this year, I think it will be enough that other issues could at least play into the voters' minds when they're in the voting booth.
IMUS: People will be out buying homes by this fall, do you think? JEFFERS: Well, no, not at all. That was what I thought three years ago -- IMUS: Oh, OK. Good.
JEFFERS: In terms of how -- but the overall point is, the timing worked in his favor. The economy was bound to improve at some point. We've now made it much longer than anyone expected. But to the extent that it is showing some signs of vitality, the president is improving.
Listen, here's the thing that we have to think about also. I mean you have well-to-do Americans, wealthy
Americans --
IMUS: Why are you hollering, by the way?
JEFFERS: Well, I'm just trying to make sure we all hear --


Page 160 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Well, we're three feet from each other.
JEFFERS: Well, but, actually, this is part of the enthusiasm I have from appearing with you. IMUS: Oh, OK. You know the last time you were on --
JEFFERS: Yes.
IMUS: You broke your record. You had one answer that was five and a half minutes. JEFFERS: Well, I heard that. I didn't know about it until today.
IMUS: That's pretty good. That's pretty good.

JEFFERS: But I will say this. That was the Martin Luther King tribute. And I, in fact will use that to say that I honor you for having allowed us to pay that kind of a tribute to Dr. King.
IMUS: Yes.

JEFFERS: And five minutes was worthwhile. That's the only reason it went that long. And I didn't know that until today.
IMUS: I had forgotten what the subject was about, but -- JEFFERS: Yes. No, I remember the subject.
IMUS: But it was good.
But what were you just saying now? Some nonsense about --

JEFFERS: Well, that -- when we look at the future here, the Republicans, wealthy Americans had to be absolutely distraught to see Republican candidates for president in the primaries on the stage debating, accusing each other of making too much money, of not paying enough taxes.
IMUS: Yes.

JEFFERS: I mean these are not issues that Republicans should be complaining about. And that's why Newt Gingrich has a problem. One Republican insider said if Newt Gingrich was at the top of the ticket as the nominees, Republicans could lose 45 states.
IMUS: I like when -- skunk vomit, I call him -- appears with Sean Hannity, they do that Charlie McCarthy-Edgar
Bergen deal.
JEFFERS: Yes. Yes.
IMUS: Where Gingrich has Sean sit on his lap and -- that's a fun hour, that -- when he's on there, but -- JEFFERS: Now, the Republicans, by the way, do have some positive things going for them. First of all, I've said
all along, Mitt Romney has the only chance.
IMUS: Yes.

JEFFERS: And so they need to focus on that. But listen to this, Don. In 2008, Barack Obama won seven states by less than 5 percent of the vote. Now, with the talk about Newt Gingrich, up until a month and a half ago, I had picked -- taken four of those states and put them back into the red column. In fact, Indiana I put back in there the week after the election in 2008.

But with the possibility of Newt Gingrich running the ticket and being at the top, I had all seven states now back in play for the president to win again. With Mitt Romney at the ticket head, they have a chance, if they got two of those seven and those two were Ohio and Florida, the president would still win, but it could be a very difficult time for him.
IMUS: Are you -- are you a sports fan at all? JEFFERS: A big sports fan.

Page 161 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Oh, you are?
JEFFERS: A big sports fan.
IMUS: Who do you like in the Super Bowl?

JEFFERS: Well, I think the Giants possibly have the strongest team in all of the categories. I would like to see -- we were having this conversation earlier. I'm a big supporter of excellence. I'd love to see Tom Brady have, you know, four Super Bowl wins, five appearances. I like that. And I think Eli Manning still has opportunities down the road. I like Tiger Woods for the excellence. I like the Eagles now because I want to see Michael Vick have a successful time. I like (INAUDIBLE), Miami.
IMUS: You don't have a dog, do you? Do you have a dog? JEFFERS: A dog?
IMUS: Yes.
JEFFERS: Not anymore. I had one as a kid.
IMUS: No, you don't. You know why you don't have a dog? JEFFERS: It's tough when I travel so much --
IMUS: Because Michael Vick's dog ate your dog, that's why. JEFFERS: What's that?
IMUS: Because Michael Vick killed your dog. That's why you don't have a dog. Michael Vick? Have you lost your mind?
JEFFERS: Well, then I really believe in redemption. I really believe in redemption.

IMUS: So, who do you think is going to win the Super Bowl? I know who you want to win. You want Brady to win and the Patriots.

JEFFERS: I think that -- I think -- frankly, I think the Vegas odds, which I believe is about two and a half points right now, that could go either way. But I think, in the end, I think that the Patriots win.
IMUS: Oh, you do?

JEFFERS: Only because I think that Gronkowski will play better than people are expecting. And I think that you could get a big surprise from Wes Welker or from even Ochocinco is a possibility.
IMUS: OK. Ochocinco going to get a ball?
JEFFERS: He could get -- well, he could get one ball -- IMUS: Oh, OK.
JEFFERS: If they don't play him right because they're trying to cover Hernandez and Welker and Gronkowski, then you could see Ochocinco get open.
IMUS: Yes, all right. I've got to go. Carl "two questions" Jeffers, it was good this morning. JEFFERS: I think we got four or five in today.
IMUS: You were pretty good. Carl Jeffers here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I'll be working on the forward to Carl's book, as soon as he tells me again -- he's only been trying to get me to do it for a couple of years now, but I will do it.
JEFFERS: Well, the operative word is "again."
IMUS: But just -- well, but just tell me again what it's about and I'll knock that bad boy out. JEFFERS: OK. We'll look forward to that.
Page 162 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Coming up on 11 till the hour now.
MACEDO: We just got in earnings from Chrysler. The car company is reporting a fourth quarter operating profit of
$508 million. Revenue came in at $15.1 billion. And let's take a look at the markets and how they're reacting to
that.

Let's start over in Europe, though. A manufacturing report in the U.K. showed improvement in January over December. And there's still optimism that a Greek debt deal will be reached soon. You can see stocks there are in the green. London's up by 78, Paris is up by 51, and Frankfurt's up almost 124.

Asian markets were mixed overnight. Economic growth in Hong Kong fell to 3 percent in the fourth quarter. In China, there was mixed data on manufacturing. A state affiliated survey showed improvement for a second straight month. Another survey from HSBC showed activity was unchanged.

Here in the U.S. futures are in the green across the board. Dow futures are up by 91, the S&P's up by nine, and the Nasdaq's up by 15. And they finished the first month of the year off with a mixed session as weak reports on home sales and Midwest manufacturing weighed on the markets here. But what a month it was for stocks here in January. The Dow and S&P had the best January since 1997. The Dow rose 3.4 percent, the S&P by 4.4 percent, and the Nasdaq was a big winner, soaring 8 percent.

Investors are awaiting a string of labor-related reports this week starting with the Challenger report on mass layoffs. We'll get that one in at 7:30 Eastern this morning, followed by the ADP employment report at 8:15
Eastern. That's expected to show the private sector added 185,000 jobs in January. Then tomorrow we'll get jobless claims in. And on Friday, we'll get the big monthly jobs report. Employers are expected to have added
150,000 jobs last month. And later this morning, we'll also get numbers on manufacturing and construction.

Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are both up. Oil's up about 86 cents at $99 a barrel. Gold's up almost nine bucks at $1,749 an ounce.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continue after this on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
IMUS: The "Blonde on Blonde" babes, Deirdre Imus and Lis Wiehl, they're coming up. And then Jay Mohr is in Indianapolis, site of the Super Bowl, and we'll find out what's on his mind. He's coming up. So, Chris Christie's here. And Governor Christie will be discussing what this morning?
ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: Numb-nuts. IMUS: Numb-nuts, OK.
And Jesse Jackson is here. And Jesse Jackson, Reverend Jackson, will be discussing?
TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN: Well, Newt thinks that he's Rocky. And Survivor told him to stop it. IMUS: Oh, I see. So, using the Rocky theme in his -- what's coming up in the news, numb-nuts?
MCSHANE: Well, of course, more on the primary, speaking of which. And speaking of New Jersey, there's a request of the -- of the mayor of Hoboken that has just come in. And, well, she's rejecting the request. So we'll tell you what that is.
IMUS: This is like a Warner Wolf deal? MCSHANE: Keep it on your mind. MCGUIRK: That's a good tease, man. IMUS: Five minutes now till the hour. MCSHANE: What?
IMUS: What's the request?
MCSHANE: I'm not telling you until we do it on the news.

Page 163 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: What is it?
MCSHANE: It's about -- it's about "Jersey Shore."
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's about "Jersey Shore." IMUS: What about it?
MCDOWELL: They wanted to tape a spinoff show with Snooki and JWoww in Hoboken and the mayor is saying xnay (ph) to ooki-sna.
MCSHANE: Would you have been in favor of that, Governor Christie? BARTLETT: Oh, I'm in favor of anything that would lighten up Hoboken. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: What was her objection?
MCGUIRK: I mean do you watch "Jersey Shore"?
BARTLETT: She's afraid it was going to give Hoboken a bad name. MCGUIRK: Yes.
MCSHANE: Yes, right.
MCGUIRK: She said that she was afraid that people would pour out of the bars, you know, if they heard that
Snooki was on the street and it would cause problems. It would be dangerous.
MCDOWELL: Melee. BARTLETT: Maybe. MCSHANE: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Come on, it's good for business. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Yes, what's the matter with her? MCGUIRK: Take it easy.
MCSHANE: Come down, man. BARTLETT: Got to loosen up. IMUS: Come on, baby.
MCGUIRK: Don't be a hater, lady. BARTLETT: She's got the cork in too tight. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Huh?
BARTLETT: She's got to loosen up. She's got the cork in too tight. IMUS: Did I tell you I'm sick today?
POWELL: No, you hadn't mentioned it. Really?
MCDOWELL: Really?


Page 164 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
POWELL: Tell us more.
MCSHANE: What's wrong?
IMUS: I have some -- horrible. I mean, I don't know. MCSHANE: Let's not dwell on it, I-man. Let's not dwell on it. MCDOWELL: Yes. You look good. That's all that matters.
IMUS: But I'm here because of my great dedication to all of you and -- MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Millions of fans. BARTLETT: We appreciate it. MCDOWELL: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Uh-huh. POWELL: Oh, yes.
IMUS: Not that those bastards don't care. BARTLETT: No.
MCGUIRK: Ingrates. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: So I get my new jackets from Joseph Abboud today. MCSHANE: Yes.
BARTLETT: And they all look exactly like that one.

IMUS: Yes, I mean, I have 25 of them. They all look the same. You can -- I need three jackets. That's all anybody needs.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: That's what you have, right, Warner, three jackets? MCSHANE: Warner, he doesn't have headphones -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox
And now here's Diane Macedo.
DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning everyone.

Mitt Romney scored a convincing victory over his rivals last night but the race for the GOP presidential nomination is far from over.
For more on this, let's go over to Rich Edson over in Tampa, Florida. Good morning Rich.

RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Diane. There's an awfully long way to go. First off, late August is when we'll be back here in Tampa. That's the Republican committee or the RNC is going to hold its -- its nomination. So we've got plenty of time.

Also Mitt Romney has fewer than 100 delegates. He'll need more than 1,100 to take this race. But a real convincing win for him yesterday in the Florida Republican primary, taking 46 percent of nearly 1.7 million votes.

Page 165 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And by the way, this is a key point for Mitt Romney here. Basically if you take Newt Gingrich's total, combine it with Rick Santorum's total, still beat -- Mitt Romney still beats them; 46, 32, 13 for Romney, Gingrich and Santorum.

Now this has been a real nasty race down here in Florida, lots of negative ads Diane. When Mitt Romney spoke after the results were announced last night, he decided not to hit Newt Gingrich, which he had been doing so effectively for the better part of two weeks here. Essentially he took time to criticize the President.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want you to remember when the White House reflected the best of who we are, not the worst of what Europe has become.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: So, the reasons that Florida voters voted for Mitt Romney? Well, Fox News exit polls essentially showed the top issue here was the economy. They thought Romney could best manage the economy out of the candidates who are on the ballot here. And also a feeling among many that Mitt Romney can beat Barack
Obama; at least he would be a more formidable challenger than the other candidates. Back to you.
MACEDO: All right, thanks Rich.

We're also getting earnings in from Hershey the candy company is reporting a profit of 70 cents a share. That matched the estimate of 70 cents. Revenue came in at a slight beat with $1.57 billion; the estimate there was for
$1.56 billion.

We also got earnings in from AOL. The online company is reporting a profit of 23 cents. That topped the estimate easily which was for 16 cents. Revenue came in at $576.8 million. Also a beat; the estimate there was for $573 million.

European Union regulators meanwhile had blocked the proposed merger of the Deutsche Boerse and NYSE/Euro Next. As Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino first reported the NYSE has confirmed the news saying the two companies are in talks to terminate the merger agreement. NYSE/Euro Next says it will focus on a standalone strategy and will aim to grow its derivatives business. It will also resume its $550 million stock repurchase plan.

Checking the markets now; here in the U.S., futures have been up across the board all morning. Dow futures are now up by about 80 points. The S&P is up by eight. And the NASDAQ is up by 13.

And you just saw a look over at the European markets there. Manufacturing reports in the U.K. showed improvement in January over December. And there is still optimism that a Greek debt deal will be reached soon. You can see London is up by 73. Paris is up by 51. And Frankfurt is up almost 127. Now with more on what's moving these markets, joining me now is Commerce Bank Global Equities economist Peter Dixon. Peter, markets have been getting a boost from some upbeat manufacturing data out of Germany and the U.K. Does this ease fears of a U.K. recession?

PETER DIXON, COMMERCE BANK GLOBAL EQUITIES ECONOMIST: Well I think it does. I mean, I think that to a large extent the weakness in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by a run down in inventory. And as we head into the first quarter of 2012 we'll see that level off a bit.

I'm not expecting a fantastically strong number in the first quarter of this year. Moderately positive will do. But if we get that, at least it will avoid a technical recession.
MACEDO: Now we'll take the bright spots where we can find them. All right, thanks Peter.
And now Facebook is expected to file for a $5 billion Initial Public Offering as early as this morning. Robert Gray
is following that story for us. And Robert, I know they were expecting $10 billion. Now they're saying $5 billion. But
that number can still be revised I understand is that right?

ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Yes $5 billion could just put the floor in right here Diane. So we'll be watching the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reports say they could come as soon as today. It could value the company anywhere from $75 billion to $100 billion. So we'll be watching that, we'll also be looking to see just how their revenue is garnered. Where they're getting the bulk of it from, what the growth rate is and the same thing for their bottom line as well.

Also we'll be looking to see where they're listing if it is indeed told. They're expected to take the ticker FB but they could be on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange; and which investors are cashing in or cashing out as the case maybe; and are any of the insiders are selling shares as well.

So all of this are questions we're looking to find out when they do file the SEC expected again to be today. Diane, back to you.
MACEDO: All right, we'll find out later thanks, Robert.

Let's take a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are both up. Have been all morning. Oil is up by about 64 cents around $99 a barrel. Gold is at $1,748 an ounce.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING. IMUS: Yes, you know what kind of amazes me?
CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: What's that?

IMUS: As I watch, I'm sitting here and watch Fox, the Fox Business Channel. Well, is the stuff that people wear that they think looks good?
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: There's a guy who was just on with Maria -- MCSHANE: Or Diane.
IMUS: Or Diane, rather. MCSHANE: Sure.
IMUS: Did you see him, Dagen?
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. IMUS: This guy had on a checked shirt.
MCDOWELL: Yes.
IMUS: Can you put that up, Big Foot?
TOM BOWMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I don't have it now. IMUS: What do you mean you don't have it?
BOWMAN: He left.
LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Well, he's gone probably, yes. MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: Well don't you have a record of it? Wasn't it -- didn't you record it or something?

BOWMAN: Yes we recorded it but we don't have enough time to turn it around. You just told me like 30 seconds ago.
RUFINO: Turn -- turn it around right now. Right now turn it around, quick, quick. BERNIE MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes, what the hell is it? MCSHANE: Yes, I want to see this guy with the checked shirt.
RUFINO: Instant replay.

Page 167 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Well this hideous checked shirt on that nobody would wear any way. And then some -- oh God it's just --
MCSHANE: He's British though. MCDOWELL: Yes he's British. MCGUIRK: Well, then.
IMUS: Come on, dude.
MCSHANE: On from London it's all different. IMUS: Any way, my boy won.
MCSHANE: Yey Romney.
IMUS: Romney and skunk vomit. MCSHANE: Gingrich.
IMUS: What an ungracious pig. Wasn't he, Bernie? MCGUIRK: Yes, totally classless.
IMUS: He's just a classless --
MCGUIRK: That doesn't congratulate Mitt. Doesn't call him, doesn't even address him by name. MCSHANE: Oh man.
IMUS: He's a repulsive pig. Anyway, so that all of that is -- I just sound so negative. And I hate to be so angry and all that and a lot of things to be up about. Warner and I were talking about the Peyton Manning interview.
WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes.

IMUS: That Trey Wingo did, which Trey Wingo, I thought was terrific. And I thought Peyton Manning was even better. He was gracious, he never lost his temper. He didn't get irritable. But this -- that -- the guy just spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find out what was going on, which is -- which was good. But, I mean, well that Payton really handled that well, man. So --
WOLF: Yes, he gets it.
IMUS: Yes he does. So, all that's coming up. And I guess apparently the -- the Kentucky won last night, right? WOLF: Yes number one. They go 22 in 1.
IMUS: North Carolina won? WOLF: Yes 19 in 3.
IMUS: The Knicks beat the hapless Detroit Pistons. WOLF: Oh God.
MCSHANE: Right.

WOLF: Oh man you've got to change the rule. I mean, this is -- this is embarrassing for the NBA. You've got four teams that you know, that have won only four games. And Charlotte's won only three. Just change the rule. If you can't win five games by February 1st, get out. You're out.
IMUS: But they're not going to do that, Warner. WOLF: Nobody wants to see you play.
IMUS: So all of that is coming up. Dagen is here. Lou Rufino is here. Bernie is going to have a briefing and all sort of stuff. And Maria Molina is doing the weather. What's the New York weather going to be, Maria?

Page 168 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MARIA MOLINA, METEOROLOGIST, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER CENTER: Today let on settled --
(CROSSTALK)
IMUS: Oh no, no, no, no. MCSHANE: Next week. IMUS: For July 16th. MCSHANE: Here we go.
MOLINA: I wouldn't believe that from you. IMUS: Ok.
MOLINA: For 2014 --
MCSHANE: Yes, you ask for specifics in random towns. IMUS: Yes today, I don't feel well today, Maria. So -- MOLINA: Oh I'm sorry. I hope you feel better. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: I haven't said anything because I -- I'm trying to soldier on here. But -- (CROSSTALK)
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: -- I have -- I'm very ill. So -- MOLINA: I'm very proud of you. RUFINO: Please stop.
IMUS: The weather here in New York is going to be what? MOLINA: It's going to be a mild day, for a high of like 59 degrees. IMUS: It's raining now, Maria.
MOLINA: Exactly. It's unsettled so there's some rain showers around. MCSHANE: Yes.
MOLINA: But it's not going to rain the entire day. There will be a little break here and there. You're actually about to get a break coming up soon.
IMUS: Ok, Jennifer --
MOLINA: But it won't be raining the whole day. IMUS: Jennifer Nittoso says --
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: What's the matter?

MOLINA: We just have this conversation yesterday you almost yelled at me because I told you -- never mind. Anyway, go ahead. What did Jennifer say?
IMUS: Ok she said that it was going to be sunny and breezy this afternoon, didn't she, Connell?


Page 169 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCGUIRK: Just like you.
MCSHANE: Showers possible this morning, some sun and breezy this afternoon. IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: Mild, high around 60. IMUS: So a much more -- (CROSSTALK)
MCSHANE: Jennifer Nittoso --
IMUS: -- optimistic forecast from Jennifer than from you.
MOLINA: Yes, I told you there would be some breaks. So when you get a break, you'll get a little bit of sun. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: But that -- but that's not what -- MCSHANE: Oh, my God. No please never mind. (CROSSTALK)
MOLINA: But I --
MCSHANE: At least you caught yourself. IMUS: So.
MOLINA: You want your Huntsville forecast for the weekend? IMUS: Yes I do, yes.
MOLINA: Ok, dokey. By the way, tomorrow is Groundhog Day. MCSHANE: All right.
IMUS: Yes, with a bunch of old fat white drunks out there and wherever they are and they drugged this poor little groundhog.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: I mean it's just ridiculous. They should be arrested. MCSHANE: The I-Man will be anchoring our live coverage.
IMUS: I mean it's stupid groundhog. I mean it's -- it's a -- where's the ASPCA or somebody? MCSHANE: I can't wait for that.
IMUS: Protecting the little marmot or whatever it is. RUFINO: That's what they should do. Swarm in on them. IMUS: What?
RUFINO: They should have the ASPCA just come right in. IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: What time does it all happen? It's about this time tomorrow, right?



Page 170 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MOLINA: Yes, 7:35, about that time. He'll make his prediction and I think read that PETA, I don't know if this is
100 percent accurate, I'll have to double check, but I think PETA, there was a report that they would want them to
replace the groundhog with a robotic groundhog.
MCGUIRK: Oh please. It's a stupid, fat little rodent. MCSHANE: Oh my God.
MOLINA: A double check with you on that. MCSHANE: A robotic groundhog.
IMUS: Stupid, little, fat rodent has feelings too, Bernie. MCSHANE: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Yes, so I heard.
IMUS: And of course if somebody would run over it, Dagen would eat it. Anyway -- MCDOWELL: Yes, I was thinking about how to cook it and make it most tender. IMUS: Yes, what's the forecast now for Huntsville?
MOLINA: A little unsettled as well. Not as much as what you're seeing today though here in New York City. So, about a 10 percent, 20 percent chance of showers both days. Partly sunny. Higher chance on Sunday, high temperature on Saturday, 65 degrees between and it's going to be early in the day, like in the morning hours. The temperatures will actually drop in the afternoon. And then on Sunday your high should be at 61 degrees in the afternoon. Winds out of the north --
(CROSSTALK)
IMUS: That's fine, that's enough. That's enough. Thank you. Maria Molina. MCSHANE: That's her.
IMUS: Still open -- not open for two-foot Fred, by the way? That's off -- MOLINA: Sure let's -- let's do it.
MCSHANE: All right. IMUS: Ok.
MOLINA: When can I meet him?
IMUS: Ok so I don't know when he's going to be in, but it's something to look forward to. MOLINA: Are you sure he's going to want to meet me? Have you asked him?
IMUS: Well, I don't think that will be a problem, Maria.

It's 11 minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's time for the news. And here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.
MCSHANE: Good morning, I-Man.

Mitt Romney winning last night 46 percent of the vote in Florida, 32 percent for Newt Gingrich; so that sounds certainly by the numbers like an easy win but it's not how Romney described it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROMNEY: Primary contests are not easy. And they're not supposed to be. As this primary unfolds our opponents in the other party have been watching and they like to comfort themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided and weak.

Page 171 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But I've got news for them. A competitive primary does not divide us. It prepares us. And we will win.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCSHANE: There you go. Newt Gingrich plans to keep it competitive. He says he will stay in this chase for the nomination.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

NEWT GINGRICH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to contest every place and we are going to win --
(END AUDIO CLIP) MCSHANE: There you go.
IMUS: You know what the problem is? That's it. Mitt is Mitt is what we have. That's it. So -- MCSHANE: But you're all for him.
IMUS: I am for him but I mean.
MCSHANE: What do you mean he's all we have? IMUS: That's it.
MCGUIRK: This is even a quicker turnaround that we've ever seen for the last hour. RUFINO: For an hour.
MCSHANE: I didn't know what to say. MCGUIRK: Now what happen now?
IMUS: No I'd be loving me some Mitt. But I mean --
MCSHANE: Yes, you started this -- this hour by saying my boy won.

IMUS: The choice between the two of them is just not -- I mean the President's charming. He sings like Al Green, but that's it.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: And Mitt is just a suit dummy, so.
MCGUIRK: Now we're back to that in one hour. One hour's time. I feel dizzy right now. MCDOWELL: Drop -- dropped him like a hooker with a cold sore.
MCGUIRK: Yes. IMUS: Like a what?
MCSHANE: No, no don't ask her to repeat.
IMUS: Except that I do think in terms of straightening out the economy. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: I do think Romney can do that. MCGUIRK: Oh that little thing.
IMUS: Well, I do so.



Page 172 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Yes that unemployment rate. Yes just these little things that we can work our way through. You ok now?
IMUS: Yes.

MCSHANE: And 13 percent for Santorum last night; seven percent for Ron Paul. So the campaign goes on. Gingrich will be in Nevada today. They have a primary on Saturday. Romney will be there too. Also in Minnesota as they have a contest -- a contest next week, along with Colorado and Missouri.

As for other news that we're following, and while we're speaking about Florida, Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 11th person has been found, pickup truck, just days after that terrible pileup on Interstate 75.

The severe cold in Eastern Europe continues to be a horrible story. Ukrainian officials say 43 people have died, including 28 found dead on the streets there.
President Obama has a plan for homeowners refinancing. He's going to outline today.
And then we have this, I-Man, the Mayor of Hoboken in New Jersey shooting down a request from MTV to film a
"Jersey Shore" spinoff in the city warning the producers not to try to bribe their way in.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

DAWN ZIMMER, MAYOR, HOBOKEN, NEW JERSEY: I don't want people coming in and destroy and hooting and hollering in the middle of the night destroying our city. You're welcome to come and enjoy our city but we prefer the show is not taped here.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MCSHANE: Mayor Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, New Jersey she doesn't want Snooki and the whole -- MCGUIRK: It sounds like a fun that one.
IMUS: It's 14 after the hour, 14 after the hour. Deirdre Imus and Lis Wiehl are coming up. And then live from
Indianapolis, Jay Mohr out there. He must want something, but he's a big sports guy. So who knows what's there.

Time for some business news now and with that, Dagen McDowell here at 14, almost 15 minutes after the hour. Good morning, Dagen.
MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir.

Big week for jobs; on Friday we're going to get the big government jobs report. Unemployment rate expected to hold at 8.5 percent. But this hour and next hour we'll get a kind of preview of that: a layoff report from Challenger Gray and then an ADP report on private-sector job creation.

And then there's this. "The New York Times" is saying that the missing money at Jon Corzine's MF Global has been traced to banks, trading partners, even securities customers. But investigators have kept it on the DL because the real issue is how to claw this money back.

Say if you were a customer in the securities business, you took some money out as the firm was collapsing last year, but it came from a futures customer's account, that's going to be a problem. So apparently the money is out there around, but is it in the right hands. That's the big question mark.
IMUS: Dagen McDowell here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It's coming up on 16 after the hour. Hey Carley --
CARLEY SHIMKUS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we're going to get Super Bowl predictions from everybody, including Governor Christie and Reverend Jackson. So I want -- so your job will be to write them all down.
SHIMKUS: Ok.
IMUS: Then we'll get the bulk of them on Friday. SHIMKUS: Perfect.

Page 173 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Like from Connell and Dagen and you and Maria and -- we need to get Maria's today. Hey, Maria?
MOLINA: I can give it to you guys Thursday night. That way I can try to come up with as close to -- MCGUIRK: Watch the tapes in the meantime?
MOLINA: Yes.
MCSHANE: Do some research.
IMUS: Let's get yours now. What's your -- Governor Christie, what's yours going to be? ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: 36-21 Giants.
IMUS: All right. Did you write that down Carley? SHIMKUS: Yes, I have it right now.
IMUS: And Reverend Jackson?
TONY POWELL, IMUS IN THE MORNING: 20-19 Giants. IMUS: 20-19 Giants?
SHIMKUS: Wow.
IMUS: That is not good. That's insane. POWELL: The lord told me, Imus.
IMUS: Well, then I won't take issue with the Lord. 20-19 sounds crazy, doesn't it Warner?

WOLF: Well to me, it's too low. That's a lot of field goals in there unless somebody wins for a two-point conversion.
IMUS: Or add a safety. WOLF: That's right. Yes.
POWELL: If we knew, we wouldn't have to guess now, would we? IMUS: No, we wouldn't Reverend Jackson.
All right. Time for sports; Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers, they make America's best boiler. Here's the best sports caster in the country, Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.
WOLF: Thank you very much. Good morning, broadcasting from the Small Business Authority Studios. Good news for the Patriots. They're all-pro tight-end Ron Gronkowski took off that ankle boot. He is walking
without a limp.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

RON GRONKOWSKI, NFL PLAYER: Just trying to get better every day; trying to get stronger every day and just trying for (INAUDIBLE) every day. So when it comes down to game time, I can just help out the team in the whole game and the total plays. Just try to help out the team as much as possible.
(END AUDIO CLIP)

WOLF: And what's wrong with this picture? Come on. If there was any question as to what America's national past time was, there shouldn't be now. Last Sunday's bogus who cares pro-bowl, where they agree to have no blitzing, many of the players are out of shape, haven't played in a month, drew an 8 rating. 12.5 million viewers watched the pro-bowl, which was higher than game 3 of the Cardinals-Rangers World Series.

That's a sad commentary. Speaking of the pro-bowl, I-Man, Packer quarterback Aaron Rodgers took a shot at his own NFC pro-bowl teammates.
Page 174 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
AARON RODGERS, GREEN BAY PACKERS: I'm a little bit disappointed. I felt like some of the guys on the NFC side embarrassed themselves. I was surprised by some of the efforts by some of the guys. I was surprised that some of the guys either didn't want to play or when they were in there didn't put any effort into it.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
WOLF: Wow. He called them out. IMUS: Talking about the pro-bowl? WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Oh, come on here.

WOLF: He's saying his teammates tanked it. The NFC tanked it, which is true. Nobody cares about it. They ought to dump that game.
IMUS: 12.5 million people watched it.
WOLF: Yes. My gosh, get out. Get out of the house. Turn your sets off before -- IMUS: I'm not feeling the love, Warner.
WOLF: No.
IMUS: 19 after the hour. Bernie has a briefing coming up. What's there B?
MCGUIRK: Got some laughs with your friend Jon Stewart and your other boy, Lou Dobbs, boss. Coming up. IMUS: Oh, yes.
MCGUIRK: Yes.

IMUS: Dobbs go off taking -- I don't know why Dobbs would go on Jon Stewart because Dobbs is all serious about -- does he realize he's being made fun of? Dobbs?
MCGUIRK: He totally gets it and rolls with it and gives as good as he gets.

IMUS: Ok. Well, never mind then. That's coming up. And then Chris Christie's here and so is Reverend Jackson and the "Blonde on Blonde" babes. They're coming up. So we'll try to get to them.
Girl got a lot of hit records. What's that all about? Adele. (MUSIC)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.

Investors are awaiting a string of labor-related reports this week, starting with the Challenger report on mass layoffs. We'll get that one at 7:30 Eastern this morning, followed by the ADP employment report at 8:15 Eastern. That's expected to show the private sector added 185,000 jobs in January. Then tomorrow, we'll get the jobless claims numbers and on Friday, we'll get the big monthly jobs report. Employers are expected to have added
150,000 jobs last month.

Later this morning, we'll also get numbers on manufacturing and construction. Here is a look at futures now, ahead of those jobs numbers, they're green across the board. Dow futures are up by 85 points.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
IMUS: Maria Marino is doing the weather -- Molina
MCSHANE: So is Maria Molina.

Page 175 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: What did I say?
MOLINA: Call me whatever you want. MCGUIRK: You said Marino.
IMUS: No, I want to get your name right, Maria? I'm very sorry. MCGUIRK: That Dan Marino, doing the loving.
MOLINA: I-Pad. MCSHANE: I-Pad.
IMUS: Did you just call me I-Pad, Maria? MOLINA: No, I-Man, sir.
IMUS: It sounded to me like you did something different with your hair today. What did you do it's straight or something.
MOLINA: Someone different than the past two days. Yours looks great. RUFINO: Of course, it does.
MCGUIRK: Well said, Maria.
IMUS: You're a such an insincere little person I just -- (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: I just hope you have bit old hairy feet like "The Lord of the Rings" people. MOLINA: I never liked to before.
IMUS: You and Frodo still climbing the mountains -- MOLINA: Frodo?
IMUS: -- looking for the ring. MOLINA: Listen Gandalf. (END VIDEO CLIP)
MCSHANE: IMUS IN THE MORNING here at 26 minutes past the top of the hour. The I-Man has "Blonde on Blonde" coming up with Deirdre Imus and Lis Wiehl, once he takes a drink. Big Roy, right. All right now time for a Bernie Briefing. Oh, you're back.
RUFINO: Connell, please. MCSHANE: Oh, yes, he's back.
A Bernie Briefing, that's what I was going to do, introduce Bernard. The Bernie Briefing brought to you by Planet
Fitness.
MCGUIRK: TMI on what he's doing.
MCSHANE: Here is Bernard McGuirk. Yes, you're the right, Bernie. MCGUIRK: Yes. Thank you, Connell McShane.
And Fox Business Network superstar Lou Dobbs went on "The Daily Show" with Jon Stewart and they were talking about how the economy is kind of turning around and Lou Dobbs took some good-natured ribbing from Jon Stewart.

LOU DOBBS, FBN HOST: I think the rest of the country, I think, is starting to do better. JON STEWART, TALK SHOW HOST: It is starting to do better.
DOBBS: I absolutely believe we've reached a turning point last October. I think we're seeing things improve slowly, gradually, not as much as we like, but --
STEWART: How will Fox Business News blame that on Obama? Will it be difficult?

DOBBS: Yes. The fact is that President Obama has all of his causal relationships already established. We just report the facts.
STEWART: Oh, when did that start?
DOBBS: Well, all I can speak for is what I do. STEWART: No, I understand. It's excellent work. (END AUDIO CLIP)
MCGUIRK: Always cool as a cucumber, Lou Dobbs. And are you back with us, chief? IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Stewart also asked Dobbs about the nasty Republican primary race, and Dobbs likes the race. He likes the ugliness and listen to how that went.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DOBBS: We love it. STEWART: You're terrible.
DOBBS: Are you kidding me? A year ago you tell me anybody who would have predicted that the Republican primary would be interesting, galvanizing, compelling, entertaining. Come on, I mean, this is where it all gets (INAUDIBLE)

STEWART: But in the way that "Fear Factor". It's not -- there's nobody emerging that feels statesmanlike. It's more like, oh, my God, he just ate a bull testicle.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MCGUIRK: There you go. Good time was had by all. MCSHANE: Sounds like it.
IMUS: And he's right, too, by the way, Stewart. Anyway, Dobbs was fine, so. MCGUIRK: Yes.
IMUS: All right. 28 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. The -- man, I feel horrible. MCSHANE: You'll get through it.
IMUS: Huh?
MCSHANE: You'll get through it. MCGUIRK: Hang in there, I-Man. MCSHANE: Come on.
IMUS: Well, here's the difference. See, I'm so dedicated to you folks listening to the radio and watching TV, that -- and you know what I've learned over the years, you don't feel any better at home. Why is this amusing to you?

Page 177 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BARTLETT: Well, maybe you don't feel better.
IMUS: I really hate you. You know something? 25 years with you is enough. BARTLETT: Yes.
IMUS: Yes.
BARTLETT: What do you do about it? IMUS: I don't know.
BARTLETT: Bring it on happy pants.
IMUS: At least Tony it's only been -- how long has it been with you, four years? POWELL: Four years.
IMUS: That seems like a long time too. RUFINO: Multiplied by something. POWELL: It feels like 12.
RUFINO: It feels like 40. IMUS: What, Lou?
RUFINO: It probably feels like 40 there right now. (MUSIC)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

DON IMUS, FBN ANCHOR: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network, and now, here is Diane Macedo.
DIANE MACEDO, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone.

Chrysler is reporting fourth quarter sales that increased 44 percent. Earlier the ccompany reported a fourth quarter operating profit of 508 million dollars, up sharply from 198 million from a year ago. Revenue rose 41 percent to just over 15 billion dollars, compared to last year and Chrysler made the first annual net profit since
1997 thanks to higher sales of jeeps and other revamped vehicles. The automaker is now privately held and the majority owned by Fiat.
Sony is naming a new CEO and President. The company says come April, Kazuo Hirai who runs Sony's
consumer products business will take over both posts from Howard Stringer, who will stay on as Chairman. Sony,
once the driving force in the consumer electronics sector has been struggling to regain standing. The company
says it sees it fourth straight year of net losses for the year ending March 31st due to the struggling TV unit and
has also been losing ground to South Korean rival, Samsung Electronics.
Now let's get the latest on weather from Meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather Center. Hi Maria.
MARIA MOLINA, FBN METEOROLOGIST: Hi, Diane, good to see you.

We do have a large system that we are tracking bringing in some showers all the way from the Northeast down into parts of the South, including Mississippi and Louisiana.

By the way, there's a second storm system that we're going be to be tracking the next several days and right now bringing light stuff across the Northwest and higher elevation snow but over the next several days it's going to produce problems especially across the Plains.



Page 178 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Here is a look at some of the rain falling across Mississippi and Tennessee into the Northeast and where it's cold enough, basically around Maine, we do have some snow falling out there and some areas of freezing rain right before you get there and temperatures are mild ahead of the system, so, good for New York City.
MACEDO: We'll take it, thanks, Maria.

Let's take a look at the Futures now, they have been in the green across the board all morning and DOW Futures are now up triple digits, gaining 104 points.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. IMUS: All right, 25 till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.
Jay Mohr, who is out in Indianapolis, and why is he there Bernard, do we know?

BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: Yes, he's promoting some, some function he's going to talk about what you do on Super Bowl Day. What you eat. Hints how to hold a party. What not to do, that type of thing.
IMUS: His career is really in the toilet getting a gig like this.
All right, please welcome now to the-- I mean, come on here.
Please welcome now to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, the BLONDE ON BLONDE babes, Lis Wiehl and
Deirdre Imus.
DEIRDRE IMUS, IMUS CATTLE RANCH FOR KIDS WITH CANCER: Good morning. IMUS: How are you?
LIS WIEHL, FOX LEGAL ANALYST: Great.

IMUS: Before we get going here, you were on food stamps when you were at Villa Nova, is that what I heard you say on Hannity.
D IMUS: I was never on food stamps, my family was never on food stamps. That's what you got out of it when I
was on Hannity. No.

I do remember-you know what I was remembering and Hannity was trying to help me out and he couldn't think of the name either. Those S and H green stamps.
WIEHL: Sure.
IMUS: Those are food stamps. And we used to get them and get them-- WIEHL: It's not the same thing.
D IMUS: And Hannity said he remembered those, too, growing up. Everybody had those and go to the supermarket or the gas station.
IMUS: Hey, Carley, we're going to get-- I told you Big Foot I was going to talk to her, didn't I? Big foot? CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR: Oh, no.
IMUS: Where is Big Foot? SHIMKUS: I'm right here.
D IMUS: Carley is right there. IMUS: Where is Big Foot?
D IMUS: I saw him in the hallway. Eating a donut.
WIEHL: Oh, man, Deirdre, really?

LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: What's this, a family deal.
IMUS: I want my own switch, which Trevor is going to give me tomorrow.

RUFINO: We're working on getting you your own switch. You'll control everyone's microphone in the whole building.
IMUS: Carley?
SHIMKUS: I'm right here.
IMUS: Carley, write down the Super Bowl predictions from the two Blondes. Lis, what's yours?
WIEHL: Giants are going to win. IMUS: But what's the score?
WIEHL: Oh, I have to give an actual score, 21-18, can that happen? IMUS: It could happen, it won't, but it could. And you Mrs Imus--
D IMUS: Madonna is not going to bring it. IMUS: Who?
D IMUS; Madonna, I don't think she's going to get it done at half time. IMUS: Who is going to win the game?
WIEHL: What are you talking about. IMUS: Madonna is my age by the way.
D IMUS: No, she's not much older than me, only a few years older than me, isn't she. She's like 51 or something. IMUS: How old are you?
D IMUS: Forty seven. IMUS: Forty seven?
D IMUS: Yeah, I'll be 48 in August. IMUS: Forty seven?
D IMUS: Forty seven.
IMUS: Did you hear this, Bernie?
MCGUIRK: They grow up so fast, don't they, boss? D IMUS: I'm 50, 50 years old.
IMUS: What's your Super Bowl prediction?
D IMUS: I have always liked Tom Brady and still do and growing up I liked the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New
England Patriots, but being in New York, I don't know, I have to go with the Giants.
IMUS: What score?
D IMUS: I want the Giants to win.
WIEHL: What score? I had to come up with a score.


Page 180 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
D IMUS: Up by ten points.
IMUS: Give us a score. How hard is it?
D IMUS: I'm pulling a Warner Wolf, they'll win by ten, don't have to give a score. IMUS: You have to give a score.
D IMUS: That's my prediction, WIEHL: Ten to zero. MCGUIRK: Take 30-20. MCSHANE: Take 27-17.
D IMUS: By ten.
IMUS: Write that down, Carley.
D IMUS: I feel like it's going to be a-- MCSHANE: That didn't take long. IMUS: God almighty. You know.
D IMUS: I don't know why you can't accept that. That's my angle on it, my take on it. Actual score. What's your actual score, what do you think? I want to know.

IMUS: Don't worry about it. You're here to answer questions, sweetheart. Here is the problem as I said off the air to both Connell and Lis Wiehl, I love you to death.
D IMUS: Yes, I love you to too, beyond death.

IMUS: But you are really -- and Wyatt will testify to this, I'll get him on the phone if you want, you're really insane. You are insane.
D IMUS: No, I'm not. IMUS: You are.
D IMUS: Why, because I'm not going to participate in the people that eat the chicken wings on Super Bowl
Sunday.
IMUS: You know what she tells us last night. D IMUS: Oh, no.
IMUS: Here is what she says last night. This is so f-ing crazy. If you say anything. WIEHL: Want to hear now.
IMUS: She says the first thing when you get up in the morning, the first-- D IMUS: Oh, stop it, it's true though.
WIEHL: The first thing what.
IMUS: The first thing you have to say is rabbit. D IMUS: Rabbits.
WIEHL: Rabbit? Like a little furry creature?

D IMUS: No, it's about the first of every month and this is the new Chinese New Year with Year of the Dragon too and by the way --

Page 181 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WIEHL: What does it have to do with rabbit?
D IMUS: You say rabbits, it's just a thing. IMUS: Why do you say rabbit?
D IMUS: Something like good fortunate, rabbit, good health, honey, it really helped you, didn't it, you feel miserable today.
MCSHANE: I think the I-Man won this one. WIEHL: I don't understand that.
D IMUS: Yeah, exactly, let's move on.
IMUS: Would either of you drink donkey semen? WIEHL: No.
D IMUS: No, but you know what I'd like to know where they did they get the semen. WIEHL: Where do they get the people-- more importantly where do they get the donkey. D IMUS: How did they acquire that. How did NBC get that?
IMUS: Bernie, how did they get the donkey semen?
MCGUIRK: Somebody went over and manually took care of business. D IMUS: Somebody at NBC did that?
WIEHL: I think some of these animal rights --
D IMUS: There's something weird about that, how did-- that disturbs me more they would acquire it.

IMUS: Wyatt would know. How did they get, because most horses are impregnated artificially so they use -- not a turkey baser on a horse, but whatever they use.

WIEHL: All forms of artificial insemination, all of that. So, somehow, I don't know, with the donkeys, but what about the people, who in their right mind would-- because they didn't air it.
D IMUS: They've got the women on, horse urine, that's what that's from. IMUS: What now?
D IMUS: Medically, women that are on these synthetic hormones for menopause, a lot of its extracted from the horse.
WIEHL: It's inhumane, disgusting.
D IMUS: Would you want to drink horse urine? IMUS: No.
D IMUS: That's my point. WIEHL: Who would--
D IMUS: Or horse semen.

WIEHL: Who would volunteer to go on a show and drink that stuff, whether it's from the horse or the donkey or whatever, and knowingly go there and do it and knowing you'd be on television.
IMUS: Here is the thing, they drank the donkey semen --



Page 182 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
D IMUS: When you're committed to saying I'm going to be on Fear Factor and you've been accepted and you sign whatever, they're not liable if something happens to you.
WIEHL: Just say no.

D IMUS: People won't and look at the show, doing it for years, and there are people willing to do that just to get on TV and do crazy stuff.
IMUS: Here is what happened, right Lou, they drank the donkey semen and didn't get on. RUFINO: No, they didn't air the episode.
MCSHANE: All for naught.

IMUS: What occurred to me, is we reached a point in this unfortunate society we're all living in where we're, where it's almost acceptable to sit here and talk about donkey semen which seems beneath even me.

WIEHL: Who is the person on NBC, who had the brilliant idea that this would sell, that people would like to see people--
MCGUIRK: Some jackass, no doubt. D IMUS: Exactly.
IMUS: That's just not funny Bernie. WIEHL: Who comes up with these ideas? IMUS: Are you on Facebook.
WIEHL: I do a little bit of Facebook. IMUS: How often do you use it?
WIEHL: I go on occasionally, like once a week and say hi to people and what do you think about this or this story.

D IMUS: You didn't answer me on Facebook the other day, I Facebooked you two or three days ago and never heard a word back.
WIEHL: You did.
IMUS: How do you use Facebook?
D IMUS: Really, just for my Environmental Center and the Ranch and studies that we do and put up, and, but I
don't use it personally, to you know, that whole social networking that way at all.
WIEHL: Right.
D IMUS: I'm just not interested in that.
WIEHL: My kids do but you have to monitor that. D IMUS: You absolutely do.
IMUS: You have no idea what your kids are doing. WIEHL: They show me their Facebook.
D IMUS: No, you don't, you don't have time for that. You're not sitting there while you're making dinner and checking homework and making sure she's not texting her boyfriend and saying things.
IMUS: And 17 till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.
Anna Kimble, a seven-year-old girl there in Allen Texas plays on the same Pre-Little League Baseball Team as
her younger brother Carson and that was until Kimbell's mother got a call from the team's coach, notifying her that
Anna would not be allowed to play on the team this year simply because she's a girl.
Page 183 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The coach said they'd like to move the team into a more competitive league and they can't allow girls to play with boys. Your take on that, start with you, Lis.

WIEHL: I think it's absolutely stupid. She was obviously good enough to play. You're talking seven year olds and six year olds and she was obviously good enough to play on the boys team. It was a benefit to her and the team and to kick her off because she's a girl is wrong.
D IMUS: I agree 100 percent and I went through this and I wouldn't have been able to run track even in High
School. There was no girl's teams when I ran. And I always ran with the boys.

There was girls softball in Middle School and then girls basketball and swimming in High School, but that was it and I wanted to run track. Initially they didn't like it, but I was on the boys team and I had to compete in the boys events to qualify and Open Meets.
WIEHL: If you're good enough.
D IMUS: I don't see anything wrong with that and a girl should be able to do that. WIEHL: I ran with the Boys Cross Country Team all the way through High School.
D IMUS: So did I and now, again, there's plenty of women and young girls out there just as good or better. I beat a lot of these boys, so--
WIEHL: It should be about your ability.
D IMUS: You can hang with them and you can do it.

WIEHL: If you're bring down the team then that's a different matter, but if you can do it you should absolutely be allowed.
D IMUS: I was racing against boys in High School at these Meets. WIEHL: The coach should be ashamed.
D IMUS: They should be ashamed. MCSHANE: Very much so.
IMUS: Okay, a quarter till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Talking with Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus.
The other night I was watching -- I just, for the hell of it, watching Entertainment Tonight or Insider, whatever it is, they devoted the first -- and these are enormously popular programs, do you ever watch them. Lis.
WIEHL: No.
D IMUS: I do.
WIEHL: Some of the Fox women are good and raise the level of the show when they're on. IMUS: Enormously popular. Spent the first, the woman, Nancy O'Dell and some guy.
I like her. They devoted the first 15 minutes to Demi, the way you pronounce it.

D IMUS: Demi Moore, yeah, it was, it was -- I found that to be really creepy, that they would run that whole 911 tape and roll it and you're right, that's what they did. They ran, they got a hold of the tape and ran that whole 911. Even divulging where she lives and a map of it and everything was shown on the TV.

WIEHL: That's not right, but talking about this, you know, this addiction she has and what she's going through. There can be a public service to it. Hey, don't be doing that kind of stuff.
D IMUS: Well, why--
IMUS: Don't mean to call you an idiot, but you're an idiot.

Page 184 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
D IMUS: Why run the 911, that's sleazy to do, sleazy.
IMUS: There's not public service, it was a car wreck.
D IMUS: You're not going to be watching the semen drinking are you?
You don't have the facts and not like Demi is coming out and saying I have this problem and helping others now. WIEHL: She is having to now. I'd never heard of this. Never even heard of this before.
IMUS: Of what?
D IMUS: Of what?
WIEHL: Whipped cream and-- IMUS: Not in that context for sure. MCSHANE: Oh, please.
WIEHL: Okay. Something you put on strawberries, but it actually did get me into a conversation with my teenage daughter about, you know, have you heard of this? Is it something that kids do and then we started talking about glue and markers and all this stuff and I wouldn't have had that conversation with her, except for the Demi Moore thing.
D IMUS: Yeah, well, then they compounded it, with apparently other things she's been on.

IMUS: I mentioned to Dagen that she looked simply horrible, ravaged, and Dagen said, and she's pretty smart. She said you can't say that because that's the way that women in Hollywood want to look, and--
D IMUS: Not all of them. WIEHL: No, no, no.
D IMUS: That's true for a lot of women, and it's sad because then they hit their 30's even and then into their 40's. IMUS: Forty seven.
D IMUS: And 47, which Demi Moore I think is 49. And it's a shame because she's a beautiful woman. WIEHL: Beautiful.
D IMUS: But they're trapped in the beautification they think they have to live up to and there's all of these drugs. There's apparently a lot of these women are taking these A.D.H.D. drugs like Ataral to lose weight and smoking the other stuff they said, possibly. And again, these are, I don't think they really have facts on all this, but speculating she was smoking something, Salvia.
IMUS: We wasted five minutes talking about it.
D IMUS: Exactly. I just want her to be okay, but I don't have an interest-- IMUS: And hope I feel better, thank you.
Eleven minutes now till the hour, Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACEDO: Good morning, everyone.

Keep an eye on shares of Amazon.com today. The stock is plunging in the pre-market after the on-line retailer reported mixed fourth quarter results and issued a disappointing first quarter outlook. Amazon beat expectations on the bottom line but revenue of 17.4 billion dollars, was nearly a billion dollars below the Street's forecast. Kindle sales nearly tripled compared to the year before.



Page 185 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
AOL's first quarter profit dropped but it still managed to beat expectations and a rise in display advertising, and an ongoing decline in the company's dial up business. Operating earnings fell to 23 cents a share and revenue of
576.8 billion dollars and also beat the forecast there.

Hershey's earnings are right in the sweet spot. The company's reporting a fourth quarter adjusted profit of 70 cents a share just what analysts expected and sales rose six percent, just topping expectations of one point five seven billion dollars and that increase was fuelled almost entirely by increases taken to offset higher ingredient costs like cocoa and sugar.

More help could be on the way for struggling home owners. President Obama is expected to announce details of the plan to help millions of home owners refinance their mortgages which he promised in his State of the Union. All home owners would be allowed to refinance, even if they owe more than their homes are worth, but the plan could face opposition from Republicans in Congress, because it would be paid for by a fee on large banks.

Here is a look at Futures now, they've been up across the board all morning and DOW Futures are now up 102 and S&P is up by ten and the NASDAQ is up by 16.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.

IMUS: Coming up on five minutes till the hour, the BLONDE ON BLONDE babes still here. And Donald Trump is going to endorse somebody.
WIEHL: Finally.
D IMUS: Who cares, who cares.
WIEHL: You know, everybody will care.
D IMUS: Why do they care? How is it relevant? IMUS: Well, and I think it might be.
WIEHL: That's Donald Trump. Absolutely, that's a big get for either of them. Narrowed it down to Romney or
Gingrich at least.
D IMUS: He says he likes them both, it's ridiculous, not going to change anything. IMUS: You're wrong. Five minutes now till the hour.
D IMUS: Talk about the show and that's all he's doing and still like, he's still out there, oh, and I still might announce.
WIEHL: That's not going to happen.
D IMUS: It's ridiculous, it's like give it up. You know?
WIEHL: Look, we're talking about it and he's hyping the show and brilliant marketing on his--
D IMUS: Hey, you know, again, all of these statistics in the New York Post with the food and -- WIEHL: Chicken wings, yeah.
D IMUS: That seven million people will call in sick the next day. If that's not the testimony to how disgusting and gluttonous and--
WIEHL: Lighten up.

D IMUS: What do you mean lighten up? People are going to gorge themselves with the wrong food and alcohol and domestic violence and that's okay.
IMUS: Some people want a good time. D IMUS: And that's okay?
WIEHL: The big game, it's a big party, enjoy the food and that's seven million--

Page 186 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
D IMUS: Enjoy the food? You know, at the expense of all of these animals? People don't care how inhumane it's been. The fact that chicken wings are sitting on the table in a bucket or whatever.
IMUS: What do you want with to do with the chickens? At some point, you've got to kill them and eat them.

D IMUS: The factory farm, just like the fish and factory farm it and produce it artificially and not like they have the chicken on the plates.
WIEHL: Look forward to the Super Bowl party and the quintessential Super Bowl foods and --

D IMUS: You know what they all are, part of the herd, like cattle. They just follow behind the other ones. It's a tradition.
WIEHL: I'll do what everybody else is doing, I'll eat my greasy chicken wings and -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network. And now here's
Diane Macedo.
DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everyone.

Mitt Romney scored a convincing victory over his rivals last night, but the race for the GOP presidential nomination is far from over. For more on this, let's go over to Fox business' Rich Edson, who's live in Tampa, Florida.
Hey, Rich.
RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Diane.

You know, Mitt Romney has fewer than 100 delegates here. He'll need more than 1,100 to secure this thing. So we've got a long way to go. But still, a key victory for Mitt Romney last night. He reverses Newt Gingrich's momentum. And he has a lot of momentum going into some western states here.

Look at this, Mitt Romney with 46 percent of the vote last night of nearly 1.7 million cast. Newt Gingrich in second with 32 percent. Rick Santorum at 13 percent. And Ron Paul at 7 percent.

That's important because Newt Gingrich had been saying that he and Rick Santorum were splitting the conservative vote. If you added them up together, he said they would beat Mitt Romney. That didn't happen. That would be 46 percent to 45 percent.
After this was all over last night, Newt Gingrich addressed his crowd in Orlando. And instead of hitting Mitt
Romney, which he'd been basically doing for two weeks, he decided to turn it on the current president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

NEWT GINGRICH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If Barack Obama gets reelected, it will be a disaster for the United States of America. Make no bones about it. If he can have a record this bad, unemployment this bad, deficits this bad, policies this bad, gasoline prices this high, and still get re- elected, you can't imagine how radical he'll be in his second term.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: Fox News exit polling says those who voted for Newt Gingrich did so because he was, quote, "very conservative." And a Tea Party voter and those who identified themselves as very conservative and Tea Party voters tended to vote for Newt Gingrich.
Back to you.
MACEDO: All right, Rich, thanks.

European Union regulators have blocked the proposed merger of the Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. As Fox Business' Charlie Gasparino first reported, the NYSE has confirmed the news, saying the two companies are in talks to terminate the merger agreement. NYSE Euronext says it will focus on a standalone strategy and will aim to grow its derivatives business. It will also resume its $550 million stock repurchase plan.

And checking the markets now. Here in the U.S., futures are up across the board. Dow futures are up by 92, the S&P's up by nine, and the Nasdaq's up by 13. In Europe, manufacturing reports in the U.K. showed improvement in January over December. And there's still optimism that that Greek debt deal will soon be reached. Stocks are up across the board. London's up by 74, Paris is up about 50, and Frankfurt's up almost 150.
Now with more on what's moving those markets, let's go over to Dow Jones senior correspondent Nick Hastings. NICK HASTINGS, DOW JONES SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Hi.
MACEDO: Nick, an IMF official came out today saying talks over new loan programs for Greece should be done within days. So what do you make of that. And what, if anything, does it tell us about these ongoing negotiations with private creditors?
HASTINGS: Well, certainly, I mean, there was a great deal of optimism going on here. And they slowly are
feeding out little tidbits. But, I mean, you know, I think really a lot of people are still being very cautious here about
getting over excited and over optimistic. Yes, stocks are up and we've seen the euro come up this morning. But
again, I think a lot of people just feel that this is a market that's, OK, waiting, trying to be optimistic, but essentially
could have their hopes dashed very quickly if there's not something solid.

Because even -- once they get into -- Greece gets this agreement, there are so many other problems that are going to have to be -- immediately start to play in here. Also, it's not only Greece. The problems in Portugal are starting to become a rapidly more obvious (INAUDIBLE) in the market. And we're seeing this as a possible threat to the euro further on. So, I mean, as soon as you solve (ph) (INAUDIBLE) one problem, it's another, another, another, another, another.
MACEDO: That seems to be the trend as of late. All right, thanks, Nick.

Let's go over to FaceBook now, which is expected to file for a $5 billion initial public offering as early as this morning. Robert Gray is following this story for us in the news room.
Hey, Robert.
ROBERT GRAY, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Diane.

And the SEC's EDGAR site may get as many hits as FaceBook this morning as we all are awaiting that filing to find out if it will be $5 billion. That is what media reports are saying right now it's expected to be. That would just put a floor in and they could always raise the value on that at a later time. Reports have said it could be as much as $10 billion, valuing the company anywhere from $75 billion to $100 billion.

Of course, analysts and investors waiting to get a look at their financials to see just exactly how much revenue they're generating, what the growth rate's looking like, where are they generating the most profits from. Also we'll be looking to see who is going to be selling their share. Some of the early investors will be cashing out. Are any of the insiders, like Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO, is he selling any of his stocks in there as well. And, of course, to see whether or not Morgan Stanley lands that prime location of the lead underwriter, trumping
Goldman Sachs. And that is what we are -- what we'll be looking to see. We should be finding that out today.
Diane, back over to you.
MACEDO: All right, Robert, thanks. We'll keep checking in with you.
Now let's take a look at commodities. Oil and gold are both up. Oil is up by about 50 cents. Gold's up by $9. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.
IMUS: It is -- Jay Mohr is coming up. He's in Indianapolis for some reason. Why is he out there, Bernard?

BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: He's teaming up with DiGiorno's pizza to feed hungry people and to give you tips on what to do on Super Bowl Sunday. How to eat, how to act, how to throw a party, how to behave.
IMUS: OK.
MCGUIRK: And he's a funny guy.

Page 188 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: He's hilarious, but, I mean --
MCGUIRK: Yes. IMUS: I don't know.
MCGUIRK: Couldn't be more timely.
CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely.

IMUS: And it's like Peyton Manning who's doing a Gatorade promotion and so he agreed to sit down with one of the guys from ESPN, Trey Wingo, who interviewed him and tried to get out of Peyton for, I don't know how long he talked to him, 15, 20 minutes, of what Peyton was going to do, when they were going to make a decision, yadda, yadda, yadda. And it was a -- it was a skillful interview. He did a good job. But even more impressive was Peyton Manning who didn't get irritable or lose his temper or act like a dork. He was terrific. Charming and -- wouldn't you agree, Warner?
WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Yes, I would.
MCGUIRK: For a lot of people, that's not a herculean effort, just to act like a jerk. MCSHANE: I was just -- I was just thinking that you're just amazed by this. MCGUIRK: To be irritable about this. But -- but then we --
MCSHANE: You can't understand --

IMUS: Well, because I've seen all of these people who -- we see it all the time. Like all of these people get asked these questions. Like they're no bigger dork on the planet, no jerk, than Rex Ryan or people like that.
MCSHANE: Or you just imagine yourself --

IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) -- a lot of these coaches and players and -- they all cop an attitude. Two questions in, they have an attitude, don't they, Warner?
WOLF: Yes, they do. In fact, we have an example of Chad Ochocinco. MCGUIRK: There you go, Connell McShane. So leave the I-man alone. MCSHANE: Oh, so, you're right.
IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: Right off the bat.
MCSHANE: All right, let me drop at that. You're right. IMUS: There you go.
MCGUIRK: Taking cheap shots at the boss. MCSHANE: That's not right.
WOLF: And we also have Peyton Manning, you talked about, the interview. And it was interesting because Trey
Wingo asked him about the doctors.
IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: So, here was that answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PEYTON MANNING, INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (voice-over): Everything they're saying though is everything's right on point, everything looks good. That I'll be cleared and ready to go. So that's encouraging to me.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
Page 189 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Oh, man.
IMUS: Yes, that was a good interview. WOLF: Yes.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: And then I watched the Fox News Channel last night, their election coverage. And I watched Cavuto. MCSHANE: Fox Business.
IMUS: Fox Business deal. MCSHANE: Uh-huh.
IMUS: The Fox News Channel, well, because he's on Fox News (INAUDIBLE). If I didn't like him, I just wouldn't say anything. So, I mean I wouldn't -- no point in hammering him. So, but they are really good, that whole --
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: That whole crew. MCSHANE: Really are.
IMUS: Megyn Kelly and Bret, what's his name? MCSHANE: Bret Baier.
IMUS: And Martha MacCallum and -- MCSHANE: Bill Hemmer was there last night. IMUS: Who?
MCSHANE: Bill Hemmer was on the wall thing. IMUS: He's great.
MCSHANE: Yes. Very good. IMUS: And cute. And he's great. MCGUIRK: Solid.
IMUS: And then the guy with the goatee. What's he from, National Review, or wherever he's from. Do you know who he is, Dagen?
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: I don't know who you're -- IMUS: He's good. And Brit Hume. I mean, there's just so better, is there? MCSHANE: No, he's terrific.
MCGUIRK: No.
MCSHANE: He was on the panel. Yes. MCGUIRK: Him and Krauthammer. Brilliant guys.
MCDOWELL: Oh, man, Krauthammer just knocks it out of the park every time. MCGUIRK: Right. Absolutely.
MCDOWELL: He is genius.


Page 190 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCGUIRK: He's hot. He's so smart, he's hot.
IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) -- no. But over at CNN they have a room full of ugly people. And, I mean, what's the point? MCGUIRK: Ugly, bitter people.
MCSHANE: It is a room full also. IMUS: Yes, I mean, why?
MCSHANE: It's like 80 people on set.
MCDOWELL: As my mama always said, they all look like they're smelling something. MCSHANE: What?
IMUS: That's just -- and I'm sure your mama was and probably is, but whatever.

So, anyway, so it was great (INAUDIBLE) election coverage. No, Romney -- and Romney proved he's mean enough and -- to win this thing. And Gingrich was just -- what a classless skunk vomit loser he is.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Anyway, it's nine minutes after the hour. So, Governor Chris Christie's here and so is Reverend Jesse
Jackson. Chances are they'll be coming up, or perhaps they won't. it's just -- it's just -- it's unclear.
MCGUIRK: We're going to see what happens. MCSHANE: We're going to listen.
IMUS: And Warner will do sports. Lou Rufino's here, of course. Diane Macedo and Maria Molina with the weather, which is fairly accurate.
MCSHANE: Very accurate.
IMUS: Time for a little news now, though. Let's start with that. What's the matter? ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: What is this, roll call?
IMUS: Well, no.

BARTLETT: You have to tell -- have to remind everybody -- remind yourself of everybody's name? Is that what this is about? And Veto (ph) is on a camera. I mean, we know who's here.
IMUS: Pat's here and Trevor and Frank and Action (ph) and all of -- yes. MCSHANE: Yes, he's on the camera. They're all here.
IMUS: Carley. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: All right, time for the news at nearly 10 minutes after the hour. With that, Connell McShane. Good morning, Connell.
MCSHANE: Good morning, I-man.

And we'll go through the Florida primary results in a moment. But first, the -- from Florida. The authorities say they've discovered a 11th victim from that deadly interstate crash over the weekend south of Gainesville. The medical examiner's office determining there were actually three bodies, not two, in a pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer. That was a terrible crash on Interstate 75.
IMUS: Was it fog or what was it?


Page 191 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Yes, it was just -- yes, there was a brush fire nearby and they had closed down the whole interstate earlier in the day, but then, you know, they --
IMUS: So it was smoke. It wasn't fog. MCGUIRK: A combination. MCSHANE: Right, from a brush fire. IMUS: Oh, OK.
MCSHANE: You could barely see anything in front of you. And they decided to reopen the road. And -- IMUS: Not a good idea.
MCSHANE: Apparently not. It's a terrible crash. And now 11 people dead as a result of that after this victim's been identified today.

Convincing win, though, in the state of Florida for Mitt Romney last night. Now doubt about it. Nearly half the vote. I mean if you look at it percentage-wise, it was Romney 46, Gingrich -- Newt Gingrich 32, Rick Santorum 13. So with that, Romney going after President Obama in last night's victory speech.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In another era of American crisis, Thomas Payne is reported to have said, lead, follow or get out of the way. Well, Mr. President, you were elected to lead. You chose to follow. And now it's time for you to get out of the way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCSHANE: You know, the guy not getting out of way.
IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) guys that got paid to write that lame line. MCSHANE: Right. I was thinking that as I --
IMUS: Honest to God. (CROSS TALK)
MCSHANE: You've always got that.
IMUS: They've got to do better than that. Come on. MCSHANE: Yes.
Well, Newt Gingrich is still in the way for Mitt Romney. Had all these signs about 46 more states and all that last night as he was making his speech. But the month of February is going to be fairly quiet. They have caucuses this weekend in both Nevada and Maine. Then Arizona and Michigan are really the next big primaries at the end of
the month. March 6th is Super Tuesday. Ten states that day. So we have a ways to go before we get there.
IMUS: Can't wait.

MCSHANE: Top U.S. intelligence officials now saying Iran does have the means to build a nuclear weapon, but it has not yet decided to follow through. So that's in contrast to the insistence from Israel that time is running out to stop Iran from developing such a weapon.

And the Obama administration, today, is going to make a play to fix the housing mess. The president will speak later this morning, outlining plans to allow homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates --
IMUS: That's great.
MCSHANE: Even if they're underwater, owing more than their homes are worth. IMUS: How does that make any sense?

Page 192 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Well, there's a lot of -- a lot of people would refinance and you think maybe that would help the economy a little bit, if they could, but they're not eligible to do it because they owe more than their homes are worth.
IMUS: That's fine. I just have a pain in my chest, but don't worry about it. MCSHANE: I wasn't really.
IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour. Time for a little business news. And here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.
MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. At 8:15 --
(CROSS TALK)
LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: Relax, Connell. Relax, Connell. MCSHANE: No, I got this.
RUFINO: It's going to be right. MCSHANE: Don't worry about it. MCGUIRK: All right.
MCDOWELL: Yes, are you both done? RUFINO: Yes, cause I got something to say. IMUS: Come on.
MCDOWELL: I know.

Well, in -- at 8:15, we're going to get an ADP report from -- this is the payroll processing company -- on how many private sector jobs were created last month. The number you were waiting for, 185,000. This is ahead of the
Friday jobs report that we get from the government. So, get back to me in a few minutes. I'll give you the number. If it's better than expected, then, yee-haw, off to the races.

IMUS: The Imus Book of the Week, sponsored by Lindamood-Bell Center, celebrating 25 years of helping students to learn to their potential. Call Lindamood-Bell this morning at 800-300-1818 or online at lindamoodbell.com. The book of the week is Tim Tebow's and Nathan Whitaker's book "Through My Eyes." Over the last five years, Tebow's made -- well, he's won the Heisman trophy, and was a big deal in college, and, of course, we had this remarkable season, or at least a few games of it. Now he's written a book about it and it's apparently inspiring. And I selected it as an Imus Book of the Week for whatever reason.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: They probably -- Megyn (ph) came in and I was under a lot of pressure. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: She said, do you have any books of the week. And I looked at the best seller list and picked those. And it was on it.
MCSHANE: Fine. IMUS: So, read it.
Thirteen after the hour. Please welcome now, just ahead of Warner Wolf and sports, the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie.
Good morning, Governor Christie.

BARTLETT: Good morning.
So I got a lot of flak for some comments I made the other day calling Reed Gusciora, an openly gay
assemblyman, numb-nuts. What can I say, I'm right. The nuts are where the reproductive material is created. He's
a homosexual. She's not going to use them to impregnate anybody. Hence the term numb- nuts.

But to be fair, he started it, equating me with Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Come on, is that the best you could do, pudding pants? Yes, that's what I called you, pudding pants. What are you going to do about it?

I got a whole list of nicknames for people. Like Rick Santorum, monkey dick. His name is Richard. Dick is a time honored nickname for Richard. And when he talks, it's like watching Cornelius in "Planet of the Apes." Michele Bachmann, sugar teets (ph). I know it's sexist and demeaning, but I also got one for her old man. In fact, if it wasn't already taken, I'd call Marcus Bachmann numb-nuts. But instead I gave him honey shorts, because he's sweet and probably already uses that handle when he's cruising the tranny (ph) websites.
MCSHANE: Oh, wow. RUFINO: Oh.
BARTLETT: Ron Paul, I call him midget stack, for obvious reasons. Mitt Romney, ass hat. I don't know why. It just fits. Newt Gingrich, not that easy. I mean you're already working with Newt. So where do you go from there. Imus calls him skunk vomit, which is damn near perfection. Although pig load would be a good one. Or chimp lips. I'm actually kind of fond of the turd. It's almost armona (ph) poetic, don't you think so, jerky cheeks?
IMUS: It's a quarter after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.
It is time for sports. Sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers. And here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning, Warner.
WOLF: Good morning, I-man, broadcasting from the Small Business Authority Studio.

NBA. The two late games. The Lakers beat the woeful (ph) Bobcats by 33. And Warriors beat the Kings 93-90. Knicks, Celtics, Grizzlies, Hawks, Pacers all win.
College ball. Number one Kentucky goes 22-1, beats Tennessee by 25. Number six North Carolina, 19-3, beats
Wake Forest by 15.

Well, perhaps the greatest comeback story of the Super Bowl is number 58, Giants line backers, specialty teams player, Mark Herzlich, who had bone cancer of the femur bone in his junior year at Boston College and came back to play in his senior year, and, of course, was drafted by the Giants.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MARK HERZLICH, NEW YORK GIANTS (voice-over): And after my dream was shattered so many times saying, you're sick, you're never going to play football again, you're never going to run again, you're never going to walk again, I took that as a challenge. And to walk off that plane in Indianapolis to the Super Bowl, a dream come true.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: That's great. That's a good story.
Meanwhile, the annual stupid media day questions took place yesterday. And the first one, this one for Tom
Brady.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Will you have the power of the divine beast (ph) to drag in on Sunday?

TOM BRADY, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS (voice-over): Will I have the power of the divine beast? Whatever the hell that means, I hope so.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: And then the pronunciation of Tom Coughlin's name.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Thomas Cocklin (ph) is the way the nuns got it. (END VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: And then they asked a question for Eli about his mother. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ELI MANNING, NEW YORK GIANTS (voice-over): Sometimes you do need a little hug from your mom. (END VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: Oh, man. MCSHANE: Oh.
WOLF: Come on. Get out.

And according to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, court documents, this Friday, prosecutors will present Jerry Sandusky with the names of those 10 men who have accused him of sexual abuse. The 10 men who claim the abuses occurred over a 15-year period from 1994 to 2009 have been previously referred to as numbers one through 10. So that's the situation in the Sandusky case.
IMUS: What does that mean?
WOLF: Well, it means his defense now has the names -- or they'll have the names. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: Before, you know, as I said, it was just numbers. And now they can say, hey, this guy, this guy and -- IMUS: Oh, I see.
WOLF: It's more specific. You know, I mean, that's it. Here are the 10 guys who have accused you of sexual abuse.
IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: What's going to happen here? Right. Rather than numbers. You know, it's anonymous. MCGUIRK: Yes, it's abstract. This personalizes it.
WOLF: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Absolutely. Let's lock him up already. Come on. Execute this guy. IMUS: Yes, this -- whatever -- a hideous story, the whole thing, obviously. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Eighteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. What's coming up in the "Bernie Briefing," Bernie?
MCGUIRK: Shepard Smith, Brian Williams, Bill O'Reilly and Michelle Obama, if you keep it where it is. IMUS: Oh, wow.
MCGUIRK: All right.
IMUS: Information about all of them, obviously? MCGUIRK: Absolutely.


Page 195 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Good lineup.
IMUS: What could it be about Shep Smith?
MCGUIRK: The -- I peaked your interest, so it's got to be something here. IMUS: Wow. OK. Feigning interest here, I am.
MCSHANE: Yes. RUFINO: Yes, really. MCSHANE: Oh. MCGUIRK: Oh, really.
IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) likes this record. MCSHANE: Had us fooled.
IMUS: Disturbing. I like it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
IMUS: Well, guys, if you listened to me before and you ordered a jug of that Heart Factors Plus, then your blood is pumping and your love life is humming, here's what you need to do. You need to pick up that phone this morning and get some T-Gen because this new product will naturally boost your own testosterone levels. That's right. That's what you need for great stamina, a positive mood, libido and a better sex life. Uh-oh.

Heart Factors Plus gets your circulation pumping and now T-Gen will get your testosterone levels where they should be and that completes the package for your package. That's what I'm saying.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Call now. Try T-Gen risk-free. It works for you or they give you your money back. Now you can't beat that.
800-754-6980, 800-754-6980. Call them. Order T-Gen. Or go to tgenradio.com. 800-754-6980. Call them. If it
doesn't work, get your money back. Come on here.

MACEDO: Just got the latest data on employment. And according to payroll processing firm ADP, 170,000 jobs were added in the private sector last month. That's below the estimate of 185,000. The December number was also revised lower to 292,000. That's down from the initial reading of 325,000. Remember, we'll get the big monthly employment report from the government on Friday. Economists expect the private sector to have added
170,000 jobs in January. Non-farm payroll are forecast to rise by 150,000. The Challenger report, which measures mass layoffs, will be released tomorrow.

Taking a look at futures now, they're up across the board. Have been all morning. Dow futures are up by 83. The S&P's up by eight. And the Nasdaq up by 12. Commodities are also in the green. Oil is currently up by about 26 cents. It's at $98 a barrel. Gold's up by $8 at $1,748 an ounce.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after this on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

Time now for a "Bernie Briefing," and that's sponsored by Planet Fitness, here at 26 after the hour. Good morning, Bernard.
MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss, from the Small Business Authority Studios.

And I know you hate these stories, but it was a little embarrassing for your friend, Brian Williams. His show "Rock Center with Brian Williams" on Monday night pulled in less viewers than Bill O'Reilly's show, which is on cable. Brian Williams on broadcast TV. Williams --
IMUS: I just hate hear it.

MCGUIRK: I know you do. I know. And I'm sorry to bring it to you. Williams almost 3.3 million. O'Reilly over 3.4 million.
IMUS: I'll be darned.
MCGUIRK: And that all -- despite all the heavy hitters NBC can come up with, Bob Costas, Jimmy Fallon, Jon
Stewart and O'Reilly pulling in bigger numbers. But I apologize for bringing that to your attention, chief.
IMUS: O'Reilly's show is good. Are you aware of that? MCGUIRK: Yes. Oh, absolutely. The whole Fox --
IMUS: Dennis Miller's great. That guy, Bernie Goldberg. MCGUIRK: Yes, indeed.
IMUS: That show's good.
MCGUIRK: The whole prime time lineup there at Fox. IMUS: O'Reilly's tedious, but, man, the show is terrific. MCGUIRK: Right. Getting it done. Getting it done. IMUS: Well --
MCGUIRK: And your friend Shepard Smith, boss -- IMUS: I be loving me some Shep Smith.
MCGUIRK: No doubt. "The Daily News," "New York Daily News," did a piece about Fox's ratings recently, but in it people were observing apparently that, as you had before, that Shep Smith was losing some weight.
IMUS: Too much weight.

MCGUIRK: Too much weight. And he says that he was eating too many cheeseburgers, Snickers bars, had a horrible diet and the doctor told him he had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, according to "The Daily News," and he's since cut out the junk. He plays tennis three times a week. But he says, I've lost too much.
IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: So acknowledging the fact that maybe he has slimmed down a little too much. He did the Deirdre
Imus, Michelle Obama thing and what does he get for it? You don't look good is what he gets.

IMUS: His energy level is great, though, because I watch him nearly every day. So his energy level is good, indicating he's not -- well --
MCGUIRK: Yes, he's --

Page 197 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: He's terrific.
MCGUIRK: Best in the business right there. IMUS: He needs to put some weight on. MCGUIRK: Superstar.
IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: And the aforementioned Michelle Obama -- IMUS: Sure.
MCGUIRK: First Lady Michelle Obama was on with Jay Leno last night. He asked her about the president singing and then Mitt Romney singing. And we have it here. Take a listen, chief.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JAY LENO, "THE TONIGHT SHOW": Did you ever think, at this point in your lives together, he would become a singing sensation? Have you ever -- did you ever think that would happen?
MICHELLE OBAMA, FIRST LADY: Who -- no, no, not at all. Not at all.
LENO: Did you know he was going to -- did he say to you, honey, at the Apollo tonight, I'm going to sing? OBAMA: No.
LENO: Or was that a spontaneous thing? OBAMA: That was completely spontaneous. LENO: Yes.
OBAMA: I didn't even hear about it until it got on YouTube, but -- LENO: Right.
OBAMA: But he does have a beautiful voice. And he singes to me all the time. LENO: Really?
OBAMA: Yes.
LENO: Like (INAUDIBLE)?
OBAMA: He sings that song. That's why I knew when people said he sang -- LENO: Yes.
OBAMA: I said, I bet he sang Al Green. And that I -- he does that all the time. I can't sing, but -- LENO: I think you would say he has a better singing voice than you, is that fair?
OBAMA: Yes, he does. Absolutely does. But, yes, he doesn't hesitate to show off his lungs to his wife. LENO: Now, did you hear Mitt Romney sing? What did you think?
OBAMA: I saw it in the green room. LENO: Right.
OBAMA: Beautiful.
LENO: Beautiful.

IMUS: That is really charming. MCGUIRK: There you go.
IMUS: I mean, enough -- people who don't like her, I don't get that. I mean she's charming. MCGUIRK: Yes, she hit it out of the park last night.
IMUS: And Ann Romney, well, last night introducing her husband, oh, man, that's a home run, that woman. MCGUIRK: Right.
IMUS: Great. She's -- she's just as charming as well. MCGUIRK: Two class acts.
IMUS: Really, terrific. A lot of love here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. That will end shortly. It's 30 minutes after the hour, Jay Mohr is coming up. Here is one of Jay's five favorite songs. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business Network, and now, here is Diane
Macedo.

DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, everyone. We're getting earnings in from Marathon Oil. The company is reporting a profit of 78 cents, short of the 82-cent estimate. But revenue came at $3.81 billion and that beat the estimate of $2.91 billion.

Chrysler's hourly and salaried employees will get bonuses. That's according to an e-mail from the company's CEO, Sergio Marchionne who reportedly says the company's transformation is done and it's finally financially sound.

Earlier this morning, Chrysler reported a fourth quarter operating profit of $508 million, up sharply from a year ago. Chrysler made its first annual net profit since 1997, thanks to higher sales of jeeps and other revamped vehicles. The automaker is now privately held and majority owned by Fiat.

Sony is naming a new CEO and president. The company says come April, (inaudible) will run Sony's consumer products. (Inaudible) currently will take over both posts from Howard Stringer who will stay on as chairman.

Sony once the driving force in the consumer electronics sector has been struggling to regain its standing. The company says its straight year of net losses for the year ending on March 31st due to the struggling TV unit and has also been losing grounds to South Korean rival, Samsung Electronics.

Now, let's get the latest on weather from meteorologist, Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.

MARIA MOLINA, METEOROLOGIST, FOX BUSINESS: Hi. Good morning, Diane. We do have some weather to talk about today. There's a north western storm that's going to be the next big weather maker we're tracking over the next several days as it dumps some snow over the (inaudible) into Friday.

But further off to the east, we have a large cold front already bringing in some snow across Northern Maine and some showers from the northeast, all the way do you know through portions of Mississippi and Louisiana.

We're going to stay unsettled for most of the first half of today across the north east. Meanwhile, the southeast will continue to endure the showers and snowstorms and of course, some possible delays -- Diane.

MACEDO: All right, Maria. Thanks. Let's take a look at futures now. They're up across the board, have been all morning. Dow futures are up by 80. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now.

IMUS: And a little Black Sabbath today. It's 24 until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Before we go to Jay Mohr in Indianapolis, what were the jobs numbers I forgot to go to Dagen about it, whatever they are.

Page 199 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Private sector job growth, 170,000 jobs added last month, but that was not as much as we expected. Supposed to be 185,000, so it looks like small and medium-sized businesses are doing all right, adding workers, but the big businesses not so much last month.
IMUS: So when Hannity and he and Gingrich do their Charlie McCarthy-Bergen routine. BERNARD MCGUIRK: What does that mean?
IMUS: Gingrich is Ingrid Bergen and Sean has him on his lap and hand up his butt. MCGUIRK: He's a news maker, and top guests.
CONNELL MCSHANE: You're just unbelievable.
MCGUIRK: You're supposed to be a friend of Sean Hannity's. IMUS: I am a friend of his.
MCGUIRK: No, Gingrich is a friend of Sean. Sean's very loyal.

IMUS: Gingrich is skunk vomit. All right, it is 23 until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome now, live from Indianapolis, site of the Super Bowl, the comedian Jay Mohr. Good morning, Mr. Mohr.
JAY MOHR, ACTOR/COMEDIAN: How you doing, handsome. Did you say Newt Gingrich was skunk vomit? IMUS: Yes.
MOHR: That is amazingly fantastically funny and true, by the way.
IMUS: Yes. What are you doing in Indianapolis? Are you going to the Super Bowl, I guess, first of all?

MOHR: No, I'll be up in Foxwoods the night before the Super Bowl. You know, you should come, man, you should come to one of my shows for once, Don. I come to your show all the time.
IMUS: I'm not coming to Foxwoods because I hate them. I'm loyal to Mohegan Sun, so -- MOHR: Why?
IMUS: Because I like them.
MOHR: All right, fair enough. I'm at the Super Bowl for -- IMUS: Go ahead.
MOHR: I'm working with the folks at Dejourno because they're doing a great promo, they're going to give away
500,000 meals from my personal favorite charity, feeding America, during the big game and it's going to be great
and I'm going down to radio row and everybody I sit with and talk to.

Each person that interviews me, Dejourno will give another thousand dollars towards feeding America. So it will be like speed dating, but feeding hungry people as an end result.
IMUS: There's a slight delay in our communications. MOHR: Yes.
IMUS: The best way to do that is just not to hesitate and if you start talking just to keep talking, so. It's nice to see you again, so.

MOHR: I will and plus, you're deaf as a door nail, anyway so the last thing we need is an old deaf guy with a five second delay. And your face, could you hold a five day rain, stay out of the sun.
IMUS: Why this hate toward the I-man? I don't get this. What did do I? SANTORUM: You told me not to hesitate so swung for the fences.

Page 200 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: So you're a big sports guy. And Radio Row, by the way is a great experience. You know, Lupica, you know
Mike Lupica, right?
MOHR: Yes, he's in my pocket.
IMUS: Well, he is going to be there today, I believe. Yes, that's fine.
MOHR: All right, I'll tell him you said hi. You want me to give him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. IMUS: Why go on the show and do the pizza thing. That's a good idea.
MOHR: Yes, we're going to feed America and all about feeding the people.

IMUS: Give me your analysis, you're a sports guy, didn't you use today do a sports thing on like, that was pretty good, as I remember as much as I can remember, of course. Break the game down for me.

MOHR: I like whenever Don says, as far as I can remember, when we all know, you don't remember the last segment.
MCGUIRK: That's so true. IMUS: Anyway, tell me about --
MOHR: You know, I remember once in 1983, I once sat next to a young Ronald Reagan and we were at a -- you don't remember anything, don, be honest, just say did you a sports thing. I feel like Don Rickles, you did a sports thing. It was a big deal the German guy has a boil on his head, anyway.
IMUS: Tell me about the game. Give me your analysis, Jay.

MOHR: Who cares about the game? I miss you and I miss being in your studio and miss looking at Dagen's bangs.
IMUS: OK and Miss Carley, too, probably, all that. So-- MOHR: Dagen's bangs.
IMUS: You have no thoughts about the game?

MOHR: The Patriots are going to be up by 17 at half time. The Giants are going to concede the game in the second half. After they see Madonna's half time show, by the way, is it me, Madonna is looking more and more like Wilhelm Defoe, as the years go on. I swear to God she was in platoon.

IMUS: Well, the demographics that they're trying to appeal to with the half time entertainment as always something. I mean, either the stones are as old as I am.
MOHR: Old gay, old gay men like Don.
IMUS: Once I was on a list of men who like old lesbians. LOU RUFINO: Did not delay that.
IMUS: I was on --
MOHR: What? Wait, stop, how do you get off that list?
IMUS: I don't know. I was on there with Bruce -- I was on it with Bruce - - MOHR: There's you and Justin Bieber.
IMUS: Me and Bruce Jenner and Mick Jagger and Kim Jong-Il. What else going on? MOHR: He does not look like a lesbian at all.
IMUS: No, he doesn't. What else is going on?


Page 201 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MOHR: Newt Gingrich looks like the stay puff marshmallow man and it's too bad Herman Cain dropped out because he looked like McGruff the crime dog. And just Obama's to lose at this point, isn't that true.

IMUS: Probably. I mean, if you can sing like Al Green, I mean, you can appeal to most people, and note and half the people don't know what's going on I, half the people --
MOHR: I love you, I can't wait it get back in the studio.
IMUS: maybe when you're back in the studio, you'll have a bunch of funny stuff for us. MOHR: You son of a bitch.
IMUS: Maybe you're saving it.
MOHR: I'm going to create a new list of guys that looks like lesbians. You're going to be number one. IMUS: Maybe saving the material for Foxwood, that's got to be it, right?
MOHR: No, just the delay is killing me. I'm not use today it because I know that Bartlett went in and did Chris
Christie, that's tough to follow, you know.
IMUS: Well, good luck with the pizza thing. Good luck at Foxboro.

MOHR: I don't have to be funny because Dijourno is feeding 500,000 meals go to feeding America and I get a free pass as far as the funny goes, your listeners got to hear the Beatles "Don't Let Me Down" going into break. I did a lot of favors for you tonight. Sean, let me along.
IMUS: Nice outfit you ever on, looks like the walk on from MASH, what is that?
MOHR: Don, as Colin Quinn said coming from the guy that looks like the poster from the "Lion King." IMUS: Jay Mohr in Indianapolis for what's the name of the pizza outfit?
MOHR: Dijourno. IMUS: OK, well, fine.
MOHR: It's all over the place.
IMUS: Feeding America, it's delicious. IMUS: When are you at Foxwoods? MOHR: The 4th, Saturday night.
IMUS: We'll take up a collection and get some gas money and drive up for it. Jay Mohr is in Indianapolis. Thank you, Jay.
MOHR: Send Dagen's, send Dagen's-- I don't want Dagen to go, I just want her bangs to drive up by themselves. IMUS: She'll be there. It's 16 until the hour now.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the markets here in the U.S. the futures are in the green across the board and Dow futures are up by 84. The S&P is up by 8 and the Nasdaq almost 11 points, over in Europe, manufacturing reports in the U.K. showed improvement in January over December.

And there's still optimism that a Greek debt will be reached and London is up almost 73. Paris is up about 47 and Frankfurt is up 127. European Union regulators have blocked the proposed merger of the Deutsche Boerse and (inaudible).

Fox Business' Charlie Gasparino first reported the story. Now, she's confirming the news saying the two companies to terminate the merger agreement. It will focus on a standalone strategy and will aim resume the
$550 million stock repurchase plan.

And more help could be on the way for struggling home owners. President Obama expected to announce details on plans to help millions of home owners refinance their mortgages, which he promised in his "State of the Union" address.

All homeowners would be allowed to refinance even if they owe more than their homes are worth, but the plan could face opposition from Republicans in Congress because it would be paid for by a fee on large banks.

Here's a look at commodities now, oil and gold are both up. Oil almost at the $100 a barrel mark gold at $1749 an ounce.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. IMUS: That's pretty good, Jay Mohr.
MCSHANE: Even on delay.
IMUS: So, coming up on 9 minutes until the hour, so Bernard. MCGUIRK: Yo, chief.
IMUS: Why do you have gloves on?

MCGUIRK: The studio is like a meat locker and my hands are on the chilly side. It's all good. Lou has on like five layers of clothes.
LOU RUFINO: I'm cold. It's cold. MCSHANE: Not over here.
IMUS: So, Romney wins last night and Gingrich says, a big line, 46 more states and it's pretty much over for him, isn't it really?
MCGUIRK: I would say, I think the writings on the wall, you need 1,144 delegates. Romney has 70 and Gingrich
23 or something like that. So there is a long way to go, but it is essentially, you know, the writing is on the wall.
Nobody wants Newt Gingrich. I mean, we have Tom Brady. Why do we want Ben Roethlisberger when we have
Tom Brady and going to --
IMUS: I didn't quite understand that analogy. MCGUIRK: Well, he's a winner, a winner, bottom line. IMUS: I see.
MCGUIRK: Newt Gingrich is going to hang on like the Japanese soldier in the Pacific in the island in the 50's thinking the war is still on.
IMUS: Do you think he thinks, legitimately, that he can win, Gingrich?
MCGUIRK: No, I really don't. Unless there's somebody unearths something about Mitt Romney, that's not going
to happen. He's hoping and praying and bitter, angry and he's on a vendetta and it's not going to make it easy for
Mitt Romney.

It's all about him. He's a selfish opportunist in my humble opinion. It's all about him, he was hurt, slighted, offended by the attacks and now he's going to go after Romney and he's not going to make it easy.
IMUS: What does he do after this when it doesn't work out then? Has a Fox show or what?

MCGUIRK: I guess he goes back to pimping his books like he's been doing for years. I don't think he ever thought he would reach this level, the top tier level. I believe he's stunned by it.

He wasn't prepared for it and he goes back to that, you know, that - - he has that fame and notoriety and a lot of people love him he's throwing red meat to them. He likes that he's punching Obama in the teeth despite the fact he's hurting the party in general.
IMUS: He's legitimately though, not trying to be amusing or anything, he legitimately is a repulsive figure.

Page 203 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCGUIRK: Absolutely.
IMUS: All of these women want to have sex with him. Is it sex they want to have with him, Dagen? DAGEN MCDOWELL: Don't ask me, he looks like my dead great aunt.
MCGUIRK: Yes, there's a few women had sex with him.

IMUS: Well, he had them, when he gets sick, he dumps them. Of course, Mary Matalin, the first one didn't have cancer, but she was in the hospital for some reason. Why was she in the hospital?
MCGUIRK: From what we understand it was cancer related.
IMUS: She was there for some reason and he dumped her there and then the other one, of course. MCGUIRK: Right, MS, multiple sclerosis.
IMUS: Whatever and so this fat load would have an affair with the current one, right? MCGUIRK: Exactly.
MCSHANE: That's right.

MCGUIRK: One of the best lines about it. It's a good thing Gabby Giffords wasn't married to Newt Gingrich because she'd be on her own right now. It's telling and true and Mitt Romney sticks by his wife, multiple sclerosis.
IMUS: Dagen, I forgot to ask you about the numbers, I guess Connell told me, but -- MCDOWELL: Yes, but I've got more sizzle than that.
IMUS: Your interpretation of the numbers. What were the numbers first of all?

MCDOWELL: ADP, that's payroll processing company, 170,000 private sector jobs were created last month. That was shy of expectations, but, you did not see much reaction in the futures. You still see small businesses,
medium sized businesses adding jobs, it's a big companies are not really hiring.
IMUS: It's five until the hour. Good morning, Godfather.
GODFATHER: Good morning, Don Imus.

So this Trump says he may still consider throwing his hat in the ring, but it's difficult to give respect to a man who chooses to appear in public with a piece of arugula on his head. I understand it's his real hair, but I know people who have what looks like dead forest animals. And a man who could buy a human being for the purpose of harvesting hair and instead, he chooses to walk around with a dead hedgehog on his head.

And how are we to take someone like this seriously? I've always believed that a man should be judged by the company he keeps, but when i look at the list of people with whom don trump chosen to associated with On the Apprentice, Arsenio Hall -- what happened? Skully Mitchell wasn't available? Nipsy Russell, otherwise engaged at some poetry slam. That oriental "Star Trek," George Takei.

I understand you're not going to get a-list celebrities for some reality program, but the alphabet only has 26 letters, where were the likes of Dee Snyder and Debby Gibson find themselves. And although I'm a fan of Penn Jillette, the greatest magic trick of all, made his career disappear.
MCDOWELL: Come on, we've all shoved stuff in our mouths worse than worms. Wait a minute. MCSHANE: Be careful what you ask for, I-man.
IMUS: Should we have - [laughter]
MCSHANE: Share some personal stories? I mean.

Page 204 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: No, but you might.
MCGUIRK: how do you think we got these jobs? MCSHANE: It was a worm, all right.
[laughter]
SHIMKUS: Bring somebody else back here. Oh, my god. [laughter]
MCDOWELL: Oh, that's just sickening. MCGUIRK: We keep these jobs.
IMUS: Come on, Dagen. MCDOWELL: You asked for it.
Connell, you understand what has to happen here, Connell? MCSHANE: Oh, come on.
MCDOWELL: and trying to get the yucks in before I give you the lousy news on oil prices. IMUS: Tony.
MCGUIRK: I'm the not going back there, no, I'm not going back there Carley, where is Carley. Where in the hell did Carley go.
MCDOWELL: She went to get the tape measure. IMUS: Carley, what the hell are you doing? Measure. MCSHANE: Don't let this distract you.
SHIMKUS: I had to find a tape measure.
IMUS: You didn't just talk back to the old cowboy, did you, Wyatt? MCSHANE: How do you like me now?
MCDOWELL: This is more important than the news of course. IMUS: Let's see how tall she is.
MCSHANE: Carley is about three feet taller than, Maria. SHIMKUS: She is oh, about 5 feet 1/2 inches tall.
We're going five feet tall exactly. MCSHANE: we're going five. SHIMKUS: With the bump.
IMUS: Because she's got the hair. MCSHANE: somebody's got to verify. MCGUIRK: Can Maria measure Carley? MOLINA: I don't think i could reach.
SHIMKUS: Five feet tall, exactly. Five feet tall.

Page 205 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: There you go.
IMUS: That's acceptable.
MOLINA: Do you believe me now? I'm not--
IMUS: Yes, I do and plus, you're a good sport. Thank you very much. MCSHANE: The Oompaloompa song.
IMUS: Thank you, Maria, thank you, Carley. END

The European Commission has blocked a merger between the  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext based on
European Union merger regulation.
The merger was based over concerns it would have created a quasi-monopoly in global trading of  European
financial derivatives.
According to the Commission, the two exchanges control more than 90% of global trade in the products.

An investigation by the Commission revealed new competitors would be unlikely to enter the market “to pose a credible threat to the merged company”.

It also found that an offer to sell certain asset and provide access to their clearing house were “inadequate” to solve competition concerns.

Joaquín Almunia, Commission vice president in charge of competition policy, says: “The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. (article continues below)

“These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive.
“We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns.”

ANNOUNCES RESUMPTION OF $550 MILLION STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF  MERGER AGREEMENT

NEW YORK, NY – February 1, 2012 –  NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with  Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their  merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders.

In that regard, NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext Chairman said, “Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets, and we proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission’s concerns with the transaction.

But as we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination.

“While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy – a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year.

“The strong underlying fundamentals of our core business, the strength and depth of our management team, and our diversified global footprint give us unique competitive advantages to exploit in the rapidly evolving global landscape as we continue to grow our successful franchises and return capital to shareholders.”
Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer said: “I’m extremely proud of the efforts of the entire
NYSE Euronext team over the last year.

While effectively advancing our proposed merger on to the final step, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver the commitments we made to our shareholders.

“While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy. Our business had a strong year, giving us the opportunity to return more capital to our shareholders, as evidenced by today’s buy-back announcement.

“We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services.

And, as always, we will continue the success we have had in optimizing the business through continued cost discipline and operational efficiency.

“In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing with our investors, employees, customers and partners, the exciting plans we have to continue our growth strategy, build on our reputation as the leading global operator of financial markets and create value for shareholders.
Page 209 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
“On behalf of our company, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the regulators in our various markets, who worked very hard to accommodate the approval process for our transaction under very tight deadlines.”

Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues at Deutsche Boerse for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made to see the deal through to approval.”

Following termination of the merger agreement with DB, share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors.
The $550 million buy-back is being executed under a $1.0 billion Board authorization established in March of
2008.

Exchanges  Deal Failure to Open Up Futures Market
Reuters
1,102 words
1 February 2012
HedgeWorld News
HDGWR
English
(c) 2012
LONDON (Reuters)—The failed  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext has highlighted their grip on Europe's futures and options trade, raising the prospect of reform to open the market to new entrants.

European futures and options trading, estimated at some $62 trillion in 2011 by the World Federation of
Exchanges, is systemically important to the  European financial system. Largely traded on exchanges, futures
and options allow institutional investors, such as pension funds, to hedge bets on shares and limit any losses on a
stock or index.
The European futures market has long been tied up by the two largest derivatives exchanges in the region,
owned by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, competing for futures liquidity. The planned $9 billion merger of
the two exchanges, announced a year ago, immediately raised concerns among their customers who said the
combined group would have over 90 percent of European stock options and single stock futures trading.

Trading firms typically don't like one exchange to get a monopoly in a single asset class because this allows that trading venue to hike fees. It was such antitrust concerns that were behind the European Commission's decision to block the planned merger, leaving the exchanges' effective duopoly in place.

But this status quo looks set to change as Europe's regulators, issues raised by the merger ringing in their ears, look to break down the virtual monopolies held by incumbents.

"The attempted merger ... brought competitiveness in European futures to the fore. Regulators now believe the industry needs to become more competitive and they are now determined to drive that through," said Steve Grob, director of group strategy at trading system specialist Fidessa.
Technical Barriers

Europe's top futures markets have been able to see off competition until now for two technical reasons: the proprietary nature of the underlying futures contracts and the closed nature of the exchanges' futures clearing houses.

Futures contracts are based on legally binding licenses which tend to be owned by the exchanges that trade those contracts. Any new entrant looking to challenge an incumbent needs access to the underlying license to launch a rival contract, so that entrant effectively finds itself having to ask an exchange for permission to go into competition with it.
Clearing is the other problem.

Clearing houses, which tend to be owned by the exchanges which they support, sit between exchange trading clients and demand from them collateral to be used to refund any members left out of pocket if one trading firms defaults. These collateral deposits, known as default contributions and margin calls, are a huge drain on exchange members' scarce collateral reserves, so they are largely reluctant to use more clearing houses than they need.

New entrants are faced with having to convince trading firms to double their collateral allocation to support a new, rival clearing house that effectively allows the client only to trade a product they already trade.

Alternatively, a new entrant has to convince the exchange to open up its clearing house and allow trades to settle there irrespective of where they are made, in a legal arrangement known as fungibility.

Page 211 of 215 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Naturally there has been resistance to fungibility from the main exchanges. Without the regulators stepping in and compelling them to open up their clearing houses, it's not going to happen" Mr. Grob said.
Regulators Strike Back

These licensing and clearing issues were at the heart of the debate over whether the Boerse/NYSE merger would hurt competition.

"The exchanges themselves offered to open up to win regulatory support for their merger so ... they can't now turn round and claim it can't be done," said Simmy Grewal, an analyst at research house Aite Group.

European regulators are already on the offensive, passing drafts to force all exchanges to make available their licenses and open up their clearing houses.

"Regulation ... is going a long way towards removing the vertical silos that dominate the European futures market and pave the way for the emergence of new European futures trading venues," Ms. Grewal said.

One firm awaiting these new rules is the London Stock Exchange, which has experienced first hand the problems of setting up a new futures market since its Turquoise platform challenged Liffe with a FTSE 100 future in June last year.

"We've always said getting into the European futures space would take a while, given there are large incumbents in Europe," said Doug Webb, the LSE's chief financial officer.

"We said we needed access to the intellectual property and there are still key products where we don't yet have this access and we've always said we needed access to a good clearing system and we have been lobbying for improvements in clearing to make the market more competitive," Mr. Webb said. "There are positive signs from the legislators and we look forward to the relevant changes coming through."
Large Opportunities

Richard Perrott, an exchange analyst at Berenberg bank, believes the LSE's planned €1 billion ($1.3 billion) acquisition of Anglo-French clearing house LCH.Clearnet, one of the largest clearers in the over-the-counter markets, presents an opportunity.

"In a stroke, a merger would position LSE as the leading OTC derivatives clearing house and provide large cross-margining opportunities for Turquoise derivatives," Mr. Perrott said.

Cross-margining is where the margin required from clients trading an asset and its natural hedge, such as a stock and its future, are netted off so an investor only pays margin on the outstanding exposure. This would
dramatically cut collateral requirements, which is attractive to banks and brokers who are struggling for high-grade collateral at a time when it is increasingly in demand.

As well as overhauling Europe's listed futures business, international regulators are looking to force the vast $600 trillion OTC market to use exchanges and clearing, further raising the stakes in Europe.

"Regulation is forcing a whole raft of products on to exchanges and this is crucial because the collateral required as margin increases dramatically in a cleared OTC market, which is potentially lucrative for clearing houses and futures brokers," said Fred Ponzo, managing partner at consultancy GreySpark Partners.

Ms. Grewal said the collapse of the Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Euronext deal, coupled with planned regulatory reforms, should be good for competition in European futures.
"Potential new entrants like the LSE or Nasdaq would have been wary of taking on a giant like a merged
Deutsche Boerse/NYSE Euronext but will feel more confident about taking them on separately," she said.

EU blocks  $10b Deutsche Boerse, NYSE merger

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the  Deutsche Boerse’s planned merger with NYSE
Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world’s largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU’s executive body, said it was ruling against the  merger because the combined exchange would have controlled 90 percent of the trading in  European derivatives - complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on areas like interest rates or the price of oil. It said that dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," the EU’s Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
"These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The Commission’s decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, who hoped combining their businesses would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.
"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets," said Deutsche Boerse Chief
Executive Reto Francioni.

Francioni added that the decision will prevent the creation of a "globally competitive" European exchange group that would have helped strengthen the Commission’s push for transparent and stable financial markets across Europe and the world.

NYSE said in a statement that the two companies are now discussing terminating the merger agreement - an indication that they are not optimistic an appeal at the European Court of Justice would overturn the Commission’s decision.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on," NYSE Euronext Chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels said.

The Commission’s decision did not come as a surprise as last month a case team recommended the merger should be blocked, citing the combined exchange’s dominance in the trading of key derivatives.

But the two companies argued that the vast majority of derivatives are traded directly between banks and other investors, or over the counter, rather than on exchanges and the Commission should have taken that into account in its decision.
The Commission asked the two exchanges to sell one of their successful derivatives trading platforms - Deutsche
Boerse’s Eurex or NYSE’s Liffe - to make the merger acceptable, but the companies refused.

The German exchange announced nearly a year ago that it was looking to buy NYSE Euronext for $10 billion. NYSE Euronext owns bourses in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, in addition to New York.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 -- The  European Commission said Wednesday it has rejected a  merger plan between stock exchange operators NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse AG as the move would violate the  European Union's competition law.

The rejection is expected to force the partners to drastically revise or scrap their plan to merge into the world's largest exchange group or to take legal action against the decision.

They agreed on the merger in February last year and later obtained approval of their shareholders for the deal. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the plan last month.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 -- The  European Commission said Wednesday it has rejected a  merger plan between stock exchange operators NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse AG as the move would violate the  European Union's competition law.

Following the decision, NYSE Euronext said it began talks with the German exchange to end their  merger plan, while Deutsche Boerse announced it will break off the  merger agreement with  NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange.

They agreed on the merger in February last year and later obtained approval of their shareholders for the deal. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the plan last month.
