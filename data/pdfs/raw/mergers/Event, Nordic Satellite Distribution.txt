Commission set to block Nordic satellite  venture.

BRUSSELS, July 10 (Reuter) - The European Commission is expected to block later this month a joint venture between telecoms operator Tele Danmark A/S, Norsk Telekom AS, which is controlled by Norwegian telecoms company Telenor AS, and Sweden's Kinnevik.
"The draft decision says that the deal should be blocked," a  Commission competition official told Reuters.

He said that the European Union's advisory committee on concentrations agreed by an "overwhelming majority" with the opinion of the Commission's competition directorate-general (DGIV) that the operation ought to be rejected on the grounds it will harm competition.

The final ruling is now in the hands of the 20-member Commission which will decide, if necessary by a majority vote. The deadline for it to rule is the end of July or beginning of August, the official said.

The joint venture called Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD) wants to distribute television channels to cable operators, operators of major aerials and to individuals with small satellite dishes.

The Commission said in March, when it opened a full inquiry into the deal, that the NSD could get a permanent dominant position in the Nordic market. It also noted that NSD partners already controlled a major share of the region's cable network.

Changes offered by the partners to make the deal compatible with EU competition rules were not enough, the source said, but he did not rule out a last-minute settlement.
If the Commission goes along with the advice of DGIV it will be only the third time it has blocked a merger since
September 1990, when it became the clearing house for major deals affecting the EU market.
Under recent internal provisions, companies involved in a deal falling within the EU's jurisdiction cannot make
last- minute changes to gain Commission approval. In practice this means they have three months after the start
of the four-month full-stage investigation to come up with any remedies to competition problems.

But Commission officials said that legally it was difficult to deny companies the right to defend themselves until the final decision was taken.

NSD confident it will win over Brussels

Nordic Satellite Distribution, the joint venture between two Scandinavian telephone companies and the  Kinnevik
broadcasting group, is confident that it will get the all-clear from the  European Commission next week.

The consortium's confidence comes despite the recommendation from the competition directorate, DG IV, that the joint venture should be banned on anti-competition grounds.
According to DG IV's preliminary ruling, the joint venture breaches European Union merger regulations passed in
1989.

NSD is deemed to have fallen foul of the requirement that its formation would not "create or strengthen a permanent dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded." DG IV believes that the creation of NSD will lead to its grabbing such a position in the Nordic markets for both satellite broadcasting and programme distribution.

If the full European Commission backs DG IV's recommendation, the NSD partners -- Danish telephone company Tele Danmark, Norwegian telephone company Telenor and Swedish broadcaster Kinnevik -- would be forced to find ways to re-structure the venture to satisfy the commission.
This could involve bringing in new shareholders or some of the present shareholders dropping out.

A rejection of NSD would prevent the group from launching its first major pan-European marketing exercise in the autumn. This is designed to boost penetration of dishes to receive the 13-channel package broadcast from one degree West via the Thor and Intelsat 702 satellites.

NSD's belief that it can escape without sanction from Brussels is based on the view that other commissioners will overrule DG IV. The company has been lobbying other commissioners and their cabinets hard, particularly the audiovisual commissioner Marcelino Oreja (DG X) and the technology commissioner Martin Bangemann (DG XIII).
The full 17-member commission is due to rule on NSD on July 19.

NSD argues that DG IV's definition of a market -- the geographical market of Scandinavia -- is too narrow. It points out that, when looked at on a pan-European basis, the satellite and programming markets are very competitive with rival satellite systems provided by both Societe Europeenne des Satellites and Eutelsat.

It argues that the Scandinavian satellite market is the most competitive in Europe, and that the alliance of its shareholders will not lead to a monopoly.

At present, there are 1.54 million Astra dishes in the Nordic region, compared with 200,000 for Eutelsat, 120,000 for Sirius/Tele-X and 80,000 for Thor/Intelsat 702.

Indeed, the market would seem set to become more competitive in the wake of the decision by the Swedish PTT Telia to take four transponders on Eutelsat's Hot Bird 2 and Hot Bird 3. Telia believes that the best prospects for satellite television in Scandinavia are at Eutelsat's 13 degrees East and Astra's 19.2 degrees East rather than NSD's one degree west or five degrees East.

PTT Telia had been set to join NSD, but pulled out because it thought that the venture was being overly tailored to the desires of Kinnevik at the expense of other Scandinavian programmers.

According to John Enser, a lawyer at Simon Olswang specialising in European law, it is the involvement of two telecommunications companies in NSD which is problematic in the eyes of DG IV, which would assume that this would give the joint venture preferential access to consumers.
Page 4 of 29 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Enser points out that the individual partners in NSD are by no means dominant players in their respective markets. "TeleDanmark and Telenor don't dominate the cable networks. And Kinnevik, although a powerful player, is by no means dominant. So I'm not convinced the deal will get blocked on the grounds of market domination."

Only two proposed mergers have been banned under the 1989 regulations. One was the proposed Media Services pay-television company set up by Deutsche Telekom, Bertelsmann and the Kirch Group (NMM passim). The other was an attempt by Italian aircraft manufacturers Alenia and Aerospatialle to purchase Canadian aeroplane maker de Havilland.

NSD's aim is to drive satellite dish penetration in the Nordic region via the four satellites dedicated to thearea: Thor and Intelsat 702 at one degree west and Sirius and Tele-X at five degrees East.
Telenor owns the Thor satellite and Kinnevik and TeleDanmark have four transponders on each of Sirius and
Tele-X, which are both owned by the Swedish Space Corporation.

In the longer term, NSD wants to branch out from the north and serve a wider European market. According to NSD chairman Per Bendix, "we will start in the region where we are strong. It is not impossible to imagine our market area would be enlarged past the Nordic countries."

EU set to block Nordic Satellite deal next week.

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Reuter) - The European Commission is expected to block at its next weekly meeting a planned joint venture between Sweden's Kinnevik and Danish and Norwegian telecoms operators to distribute television channels.

"The case is on the agenda for next Wednesday," one  Commission official said, adding that the  Commission's competition department was still giving the thumbs down to the deal.

If the EU executive goes along with the advice of its competition department it will be the third time it has blocked a merger since September 1990, when it became the clearing house for major deals affecting the Union's market.

Other Commission officials said earlier this week that the EU's advisory committee on concentrations agreed by an "overwhelming majority" with the opinion of the department that the deal would harm competition in the Nordic market.

The venture called Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD) involves Tele Danmark A/S, Norsk Telekom AS, which is controlled by Norwegian telecoms company Telenor AS, and the forestry, packaging and media group Kinnevik.

With headquarters in Oslo, NSD wants to distribute television channels to cable operators, operators of major aerials and to individuals with small satellite dishes.

NSD chairman Per Bendix told Reuters in Copenhagen this week the parent companies would investigate what more concessions they could make in order to secure approval of the deal.

He argued that it was in the interest of creating a strong European audiovisual industry to allow European distributors to develop.
But the deal could be dropped altogether if the Commission maintained its opposition, he said.

The Commission said in March, when it opened a full inquiry into the deal, that the NSD could get a permanent dominant position in the Nordic market. It also noted that NSD partners already controlled a major share of the region's cable network.
The 20-member Commission may rule on the deal by a majority vote if needed.
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is expected to hold a news conference on Wednesday to justify the
Commission's decision.

EU objects  to Nordic TV plan

(Copyright 1995)
COPENHAGEN, July 19 (AFP) - The  EU Commission has blocked a Nordic satellite television scheme on the grounds that it would have dominated the market but wants talks to continue, one of the participants said here on Wednesday.

The scheme had been proposed by Tele Danmark AS, Kinnevik AB and Norwegian telecom operator TeleNor which wanted to estabalaish a joint Nordic satellite  television distribution network,  Tele Danmark said.

The plan also covered radio and data distribution but the Commission had blocked it on the grounds that the proposed Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD) joint venture would have had a dominant market position in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Tele Danmark said.

But the commission wanted negotiations to be pursued, and the objection could be regarded as a step towards a solution which would meet both the EU's competition rules and the proposed joint-venture's need for a commercially viable structure, it said.
Tele Danmark said that NSD might obtain approval approval for operations this autumn. hd

EU Executive  Blocks  Scandinavian Television Venture

(Copyright 1995. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive  Commission said Wednesday it has blocked the planned Scandinavian television venture Nordic Satellite Distribution.

The venture by Swedish media group Industrifoervaltnings AB  Kinnevik, Norway's Telenor AS and Denmark's Teledenmark AS would "effectively keep everybody out of the market" for pay- and  satellite-TV  in the region, said EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.

But Van Miert said he invited the partner companies to revise their plans and resubmit them to the EU. Any future proposal, he said, would have to show "serious structural changes" before the EU could approve it.
The Commission is the EU's watchdog to ensure free competition in all business sectors.

Under the current proposal, Van Miert said the three companies would have dominated the provision of satellite TV transmission capacity in Scandinavia. It also would have an dominant position in Denmark's cable TV networks, and would have had an unfair advantage over competitors in distributing satellite pay-TV and other encrypted channels to households.

The partners "would achieve such strong positions that they would be able to foreclose the Nordic market for satellite TV," Van Miert said.
He also said the venture would inhibit foreign operators from entering the market. Document asp0000020011024dr7j00vjp

COPENHAGEN, July 19 (Reuter) - The  European Commission has rejected preliminary plans for a joint Nordic satellite  project but has urged continued talks with good prospects of eventual approval, Danish telecoms group Tele Danmark said in a statement on Wednesday.

The Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD) project involves  Tele Danmark, Norway's  Norsk Telekom AS which is controlled by Telenor AS, and Sweden's  Kinnevik.
The Tele Danmark statement, released ahead of the EU Commission's announcement of its decision, said NSD
would now revise the structure of the co-operation in order to satisfy EU competition rules.
It said it was realistic to expect the EU to give its permission for the project this autumn.

With headquarters in Oslo, NSD wants to distribute television channels to cable operators, operators of major aerials and to individuals with small satellite dishes.

A planned Scandinavian  television venture, Nordic  Satellite Distribution, was blocked yesterday by the European Commission in Brussels. The venture by the Swedish media group Industrifoervaltnings A.B. Kinnevik, Telenor of Norway and Teledenmark of Denmark would "effectively keep everybody out of the market" for pay-TV and satellite-TV  in the region, said the  European Union's competition commissioner, Karel van Miert. He said the partners could revise their plans and resubmit them.

Tele Danmark managed to close one kroner higher to 285 kroner in a late afternoon spurt, recovering from a bearish session where the stock touched a day low of 280 kroner a share.

Dealers say sentiment towards the telecommunications operator is negatively biased at the moment on the back of bad news about the  European Union commission blocking a satellite  distribution joint venture  Tele Danmark is involved in, and broad worries about the national operator losing market share now that the liberalization of the Danish telecommunications sector is picking up.

Sophus Berendsen couldn't shake off its four day losing streak, although dealers said there was no obvious reason for the stock's decline. 'There just seem to be more sellers than buyers for Sophus,' said one dealer Thursday. But he added the market's low volumes was also partly to blame.

On the upside, FLS ended higher Thursday, lifted by news of new orders from Chile and Peru for its cement making machinery division.
FLS ended 1.07 kroner up at 535 kroner a share. (END) AP-DOW JONES NEWS 20-07-95

Commission blocks  NSD satellite  alliance

The European Commission this week blocked the formation of Nordic  Satellite Distribution, the joint venture between two Scandinavian telephone companies and the  Kinnevik broadcasting group.
The commission ruled that the venture would be anti-competitive in the Scandinavian  satellite television
market place.

NSD, which last week expressed confidence that it could sway the commission in its favour after the DGIV competition directorate recommended rejection (NMM 13:25), said that it would propose a revised structure to the commission in the autumn.

This could involve splitting up NSD into separate companies to handle subscription management, satellite capacity provision and programming. It could also involve bringing in new partners.

The commission said that NSD's present form "was incompatible with the Common Market and the European Economic Area Agreement." It would dominate several markets: the provision of satellite television transponders in Scandinavia, cable television networks in Denmark and the distribution of satellite pay-television and other encrypted channels to direct-to-home satellite households.

NSD is owned equally by Kinnevik, the Danish telephone company TeleDanmark and the Norwegian telephone company Telenor.

The commission compared NSD's rejection to its rejection last year of the German pay-television joint-venture Media Service, proposed by Bertelsman, the Kirch Group and Deutsche Telekom. However, the commission accepted that the NSD partners faced greater competition than the German project.

NSD had hoped to integrate vertically subscription, satellite and programming services to drive satellite dish penetration in the Nordic region via the four satellites dedicated to the area: Thor and Intelsat 702 at one degree West and Sirius and Tele-X at five degrees East.

NSD chairman Per Bendix said: "The European Union's procedure rules are somewhat inflexible in certain areas. This can make it difficult to adjust the decision-making process to the dynamics of the market place."

Willie Helin, spokesman for competition commissioner Karl Van Miert, retorted: "My arse the rules are inflexible! We are not the Ayatollah. We are not sitting in Brussels on our fat butts. Everyone knows how the rules are. There was no way as it was structured that we would clear it, and they knew that."

The European Commission has duly rejected the proposed joint venture to operate and distribute  satellite        television in the Nordic countries, only the third time it has banned a proposed merger, but said it was willing to consider new proposals from the companies involved: the deal involves Norwegian and Danish telecommunications operators Telenor A/S and  TeleDanmark A/S, and Sweden's  Kinnevik AB, which is active in television as well as packaging and telecommunications; Nordic  Satellite Distribution told Reuters the group was determined to make a new proposal to satisfy the  Commission's requirements, and said that it may add partners adding that a Finnish company was the most likely choice, because it is interested in the Finnish market; broadened ownership would tackle the  Commission's criticism by changing the structure of the joint venture and the definition of its market.

He said companies could block satellite  TV competition in Scandinavian countries. NSD planned to use Intelsat satellites to distribute programming to cable systems, direct-to-home, pay-per view. Project still may be approved if structural changes are made. Companies said they will resubmit modified proposal for  Commission's review.

Nordic Satellite Distribution (NSD), a joint venture between  Kinnevik of Sweden, Telenor of Norway and  Tele     Danmark, looks set to bring in a Finnish partner after failing to secure  European Commission approval.
It is almost certain that the venture will broaden its ownership base by inviting Helsinki Media to become a
partner. "We expect to be the first to receive an invitation," said Helsinki Media's managing director Tapio Kallioja.

Helsinki Media was involved in the original talks to set up NSD but withdrew because it felt that the project was too big.
NSD's chairman Per Bendix thinks it highly likely that the Finnish company will participate in the project. Helsinki Media is the largest cable television company in the Nordic region. It owns Helsinki Television, a cable
network in Oslo and the Finnish television channel PTV.

Troubled  NSD looks for new partners

P. 10

(Copyright The Financial Times Limited 1995)
The shareholders of Nordic Satellite Distribution, the Scandinavian  satellite television joint venture that was ruled anti-competitive by the European Commission in June, are in talks with several potential new partners.

The shareholders -- media and telecommunications company  Kinnevik, Norwegian telephone company Telenor and Danish telephone company  TeleDanmark -- believe that bringing in other parties will help to alleviate the Commission's concern that the consortium could dominate  satellite television in Scandinavia (NMM 11:26).

But one of the companies being courted, the Finnish television production company Helsinki Media, said this week that a radical restructuring of the consortium would be required if it were to join.

Helsinki Media wants the joint venture to be split into separate companies -- one handling satellite operations, and one handling programming, subscriber management and marketing.

It would be prepared to invest in the company for programming, subscriber management and marketing, but not in the satellite operation.

The company's president, Tabio Kallioja, said: "We are a publishing house and are not interested in taking risks with satellite delivery systems."

He added that he would prefer a further split in the programming-subscriber management company. This would involve the creation of a pan-Nordic company to handle the overall subscriber management and marketing business and carry the bulk of the financial risk, supplemented by separate programming companies in each of the individual target countries which would have different ownerships.
Helsinki Media would then be interested in investing in the Finnish programming company, and possibly the
Norwegian one as well. It would want to restrict its investment in the pan-Nordic company to the minimum
required to secure access to satellite capacity at the orbital position at one degree West, which Telenor is seeking
to develop as the main location for the Scandinavian market, and to the Viasat subscription management system
which is controlled by Kinnevik and the other existing NSD shareholders.

The company is thus sticking to the line it took at the end of 1994 when it quit the fledgling NSD, along with Swedish cable operator Swenska Kabel TV, because it was unhappy with what it saw as Kinnevik's dominant position which gave it a strangle hold on competing programming. Its argument at that time was also that NSD should be split into two.

The concern of Helsinki Media and other Scandinavian programmers is that Kinnevik could use its involvement in satellite services to freeze out all potential competitors, thus creating a monopoly in Scandinavian satellite television equivalent to the one established by BSkyB in the UK.

So Helsinki Media wants a structure in which the Finnish programming company excludes Kinnevik but is guaranteed fair access to satellite capacity and the subscriber management system.

Kallioja said that Helsinki Media is interested in NSD because it wants access for a new Finnish satellite channel it is planning, probably to be called PTV, onto one of the three satellites at one degree West: Thor, Intelsat 702 and TV Sat 2. But Kallioja added that his company is likely to go ahead with the channel regardless of whether or not it does come into NSD in the end.

Such a move would strengthen the appeal of the satellites in Finland. At present there are no Finnish channels on the satellites, although Kinnevik is planning later this year to launch a Finnish version of TV3, which is currently available in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish.

Not all the NSD shareholders share chairman Per Bendix's belief that widening the shareholder base will be enough to see off the threat from Brussels.

Pele Tornberg, deputy managing director of Kinnevik, said that this tactic could increase the commission's fears over a Scandinavian monopoly rather than reduce them. But he was unable or unwilling to offer an alternative arrangement that would quash the Commission's fears of a monopoly.
