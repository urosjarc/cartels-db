Bush enters GE deal row in Europe.

EU officials suggested Bush's remarks indicated support for the huge  merger

GEORGE W Bush, the US president, yesterday made a dramatic intervention in the row over  European              Commission opposition on competition grounds to General Electric's  massive $41.7 billion takeover of Honeywell  International.
To the surprise of EU leaders, the president expressed his concern at the EU stance that it should be blocked. Bush, speaking in Warsaw on the fourth stop of his European tour covering five countries, said he had raised the
issue of the General Electric-Honeywell deal with his European counterparts.

In what is thought to be the first public intervention by a US president involving a commercial takeover bid, Bush said: "I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it." EU officials suggested that the president's remarks indicated the Bush administration's support for the huge merger.

General Electric, the manufacturing, media and financial services giant, made a final offer of concessions on Thursday to try and meet European Commission concerns, including the disposal of assets generating $2.2 billion in annual sales.

Some observers suspect it has given up on obtaining approval on terms acceptable to it, as the remedies, submitted just before the deadline on Thursday night, appeared to fall well short of requirements set by the EC to clear the deal with Honeywell, a defence contractor. But others say General Electric appears to be clinging to the hope the purchase will go through and has not abandoned hopes of reaching a compromise with the EC.
The deal has already won approval from the US Justice Department.

But the EC's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, is arguing that it could effectively shut competitors out of certain markets in Europe and violates EU competition rules unless major concessions are made.
However, there may still be some room for negotiations between the two sides.

EC spokeswoman Amelia Torres said yesterday that companies had "a limited opportunity to submit modified proposals" after last Thursday's deadline for proposals for remedies. The final deadline by which the EC must now act on the deal is 12 July.

But she said for the EC to now approve the deal, it would have to be satisfied the revised proposals removed all competition concerns.

Alec Burnside, a lawyer with Linklaters & Alliance, commented: "They're still in the game so long as they don't withdraw."

Others noted that a deal permitting aircraft giant Boeing to acquire rival McDonnell Douglas came on the eve of the final deadline in 1997, long after the remedies deadline.

Bush acts over GE merger - Honeywell.

PRESIDENT BUSH yesterday weighed into the spat over  General Electric's  $41 billion ( #29 billion)  merger with
Honeywell,  threatening the already fragile relations between Washington and Brussels.
The President, in the middle of his first  European visit since his election, said he had raised the proposed  merger
"at the appropriate level" and expressed concern that  European regulators appeared to have rejected the deal.

In Paris, Don Evans, the US Commerce Secretary, urged the European Commission, which is reviewing the merger, to consider the positive implications of the deal.

"I want to encourage them to continue to think seriously about how constructive a merger like this could be," he told reporters. "This merger in my view is a very positive kind of a step for free trade as well as being positive for people in this region of the world as well as other regions of the world."

GE, however, yesterday ruled out making further concessions to allay EU concerns over the competitive impact of the merger.

GE has proposed divesting Honeywell aerospace assets generating $2.2 billion worth of revenue. But the company admits that its concessions fall far short of the "extraordinary demands" requested by the EU in return for its blessing.

The Commission said GE and Honeywell still had a "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals". GE said yesterday it would not alter its final offer, handed over to the EU on Thursday.

GE Not Ready To Abandon  Honeywell Merger - GE Pres

PARIS (AP)--General Electric  Co. (GE) isn't ready to abandon its planned $41 billion  merger with Honeywell
International (HON), even though European approval  for the deal looks unlikely.

GE President Jeffrey Immelt, speaking to reporters in the French capital ahead of visiting the Paris Air Show, said
GE will let the  European Commission regulatory process play out.

"We are part of a formal process," Immelt said. "We have not necessarily given up on the deal, but what we have done is submit our final offer."

The deal needs Europe's approval, but E.U. regulators Friday said more negotiations were needed because the proposal wasn't acceptable. The merger would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"There will be no more negotiation on the side of GE," said Immelt. "We are very far apart as we sit here today, and fundamentally, we are planning our future without Honeywell."

Immelt said GE made its final offer Thursday. E.U. regulators will now pass along details of the offer to its competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission. It must decide by July 12.

GE announced the deal in October in the midst of merger talks between Honeywell and rival United Technologies. United Technologies executives on Thursday held informal meetings about the possibility of making a bid for Honeywell, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified sources.
Immelt declined to comment on what competitors might do.

"Honeywell has been supportive of everything we have done," he said. "We will do whatever we can possibly do to be totally fair to Honeywell."

The proposal submitted by GE and Honeywell to the E.U. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti included $2.2 billion in divestitures, and GE said it won't go further than that.

GE said regulators were demanding billions more in divestitures of nearly all of Honeywell's aviation electronics unit and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground.

U.S. antitrust regulators, who asked for about $200 million in divestitures from the companies, have conditionally approved the merger. If the deal falls apart because of E.U. misgivings, it would mark the first time the 15-nation body had halted a deal between two U.S. companies that had already won the go-ahead in the United States.

Jack Welch, GE's chairman and chief executive, delayed his retirement to see through the merger. A rejection would kill his vision of combining GE's dominant aircraft engine and servicing business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics for commercial jets and air traffic control systems.
"But Jack and I always agreed it wasn't a deal that we would do at any price," Immelt said. Document dji0000020010711dx6h02tmg

PARIS AIR SHOW: Boeing, Airbus  Renew Transatlantic Jibes
By David Gauthier-Villars, Robb M. Stewart and Emma Blake

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Finger-pointing about who's to blame for trying to kill  General Electric  Co's (GE) $41 billion merger with Honeywell  Inc. (HON) soured the opening weekend of the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, France, as Airbus Industrie (F.AIB) angrily  rejected claims it lobbied to kill the deal.

Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's vice-Chairman and a former  GE executive, opened a rift Saturday when he told French newspaper Le Monde that it's  European aircraft-maker and Boeing's rival Airbus, not airlines, that opposes the merger. Also, in questioning the stance of French President Jacques Chirac against the U.S.'s National Missile Defense initiative, Stonecipher drew a parallel with the failure of  European governments to realize the threat of German expansion ahead of World War II.

But Airbus Chief Executive Noel Forgeard said Airbus didn't oppose the GE-Honeywell deal and questioned whether Stonecipher's comments reflected Boeing's stance.

"Under serious safeguards that were accepted by GE, Airbus has no objections to the deal and has let (this be) known to the European Union", he said, adding that given his discussions with GE Chairman Jack Welch and U.S. officials, Stonecipher's comments were "out of the picture."
He said he was also shocked by Stonecipher's comments on other issues.

"I do not feel it belongs to an industrialist, even more so a foreign one, to question the responsibilities of the president of the country, even less so to compare it with some of the painful memories of this continent," he said.

The European Commission is considering fresh concessions from GE, but the company is saying publicly it's planning its future without Honeywell. It has already offered product disposals of about $2.2 billion -including some Honeywell engine and avionics businesses - and the ring-fencing of its aircraft-leasing arm GECAS to appease the EU.

But GE's president Jeffrey Immelt, the man who will replace outgoing Chairman Jack Welch, said over the weekend that GE and the EU remain far apart on the deal and it's unlikely to be approved. GE won't make further concessions, he said.

Still, unlike Stonecipher's interview with Le Monde, which was conducted Thursday, Immelt was reluctant to lay blame on European aerospace companies when asked at a press conference in Paris Saturday about who was opposing the deal. Immelt said both U.S. and European groups had addressed the EU about the tie-up.
Stonecipher told Dow Jones Newswires an EU rejection of the GE-Honeywell deal would be a "terrible mistake." "I fear that some bureaucrat will make a mistake that will cause collateral damage that will hurt us all,"
Stonecipher said on the first day of the Paris Air Show.

A Boeing spokeswoman said Sunday Stonecipher will address a press conference early Monday in which he's expected to say he favors transatlantic cooperation.

Some industry observers fear that chilled relations between the U.S. and EU could derail projects to build up transatlantic ties for future defense programs.

The rift livened up an otherwise quiet air show, which has so far been dominated by business jet orders. In years gone by, Airbus and Boeing have used the Paris Air Show as a platform to unveil large passenger aircraft orders. Airbus has also used the show to highlight its closing gap on Boeing, the larger of the two.

Saturday, UAL Corp.'s (UAL) newly-formed corporate jet wing United BizJet Holdings unveiled a memorandum of understanding with France's Dassault Aviation (F.DAV) for the purchase of up to 100 business jets worth about
$2.5 billion.
Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp (GD) followed this Sunday with a firm order from United BizJet for
35 business jets, including 23 options - a deal worth $1.25 billion.

Airbus' defense arm Airbus Military, is expected Tuesday to secure commitment from nine European countries to buy more than 200 A400M military transport aircraft, worth EUR17 billion.
Separately, Airbus' Forgeard suggested the aircraft maker could unveil large orders in coming days.

Airbus  Chief Denies Lobbying EU to Reject GE's Acquisition of Honeywell

A WSJ.COM News Roundup
Airbus Industrie Chief Executive Noel Forgeard denied the European aircraft maker had lobbied European
Commission competition authorities to reject General Electric  Co.'s $42 billion  merger with Honeywell  Inc.

Mr. Forgeard told reporters at the Paris Air Show on Sunday that he had "personal and extensive" discussions with GE Chairman Jack Welch and EU representatives about the deal.
"Under serious safeguards that were accepted by GE, Airbus has no objections to the deal and has let [this be]
known to the European Union", Mr. Forgeard said.

GE has offered to make product divestitures of about $2.2 billion and ring-fence its GECAS aircraft leasing business to appease the EU, but it still said it doesn't expect the EU to approve the deal.

Mr. Foergeard hit back at comments by Boeing Vice-Chairman Harry Stonecipher, which appeared in Saturday's edition of French newspaper Le Monde. In the article, Mr. Stonecipher blamed Airbus for trying to get the
GE-Honeywell deal blocked.

"When I read a title saying we blocked the deal, it's just wrong," he said, adding that he was surprised to see a foreign executive threatening a competition authority.
U.S. President George W. Bush and Commerce Secretary Don Evans Friday also expressed concern about the
EU blocking a deal that has already received clearance in the U.S.

Mr. Foergeard said his meetings with U.S. officials, whom he described as professional and objective, led him to believe that Mr. Stonecipher's comments were "out of the picture."

On Friday, Mr. Evans said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, should consider the boost a successful deal would give to free trade.

"I would encourage [the European Commission] to think how constructive a merger like this would be," Mr. Evans said, speaking to reporters at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
in Paris. "I must be an eternal optimist. I'm still hoping they will work out their differences," he said.

President Bush, meanwhile, said he was "concerned that the Europeans have rejected" the $41 billion deal after both U.S. and Canadian regulators approved it. The president spoke at a news conference in Poland, as he continues to swing through Europe.

How the European Commission deals with merger and acquisition activity of U.S. companies is particularly important for Boeing, which aims to expand its presence in Europe, Japan, China, Mexico and Canada though a mixture of independent operations, joint ventures and acquisitions.

And, Snecma Moteurs said Saturday at the Paris Air Show that it would be interested in some of the assets Honeywell may be forced to sell if the deal with GE is completed. The French engine maker didn't specify which assets it would consider. Snecma is part of engine-making joint venture CFM International with GE.

Meanwhile, the official deadline for reaching an agreement passed Thursday with GE refusing to meet demands that it shed major Honeywell operations whose acquisition regulators believe would hamper competition. Nonetheless, a spokeswoman for the European Commission said Friday that both companies still have "limited opportunity to submit modified proposals."

Page 10 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A GE spokesman said, however, the companies won't make changes to the divestiture plan they have already submitted. "We will not make another proposal," said GE's Gary Sheffer. "Negotiations are over."

GE's most recent proposal included $2.2 billion in divestitures, but the company said regulators were demanding billions more. The European Commission wants GE to dispose of virtually all of Honeywell's aviation-electronics business and its production of generating systems that provide power to planes while they are on the ground, GE said.

GE has "always said there is a point at which we wouldn't do the deal," Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Welch Jr. said during the negotiations.

Honeywell, for its part, said it still wants to merge with GE, but said it is considering its future as a stand-alone entity.

"We have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company," said Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive.
On Friday, the European Commission denied earlier reports that it had asked GE to spin off its GE Capital
Aviation Services financing operation, which is known as Gecas.

EU antitrust chief Mario Monti had expressed concern about the effects on competition of "bundling" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and Gecas financing. The EU is worried GE could use the financial clout of Gecas to sway airlines and aircraft manufacturers to choose GE engines over competing brands.
But Mr. Monti said in a statement that the EU never demanded an outright divestiture of the operation, but rather
"a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior of Gecas."
"We regret that this avenue has not been pursued," Mr. Monti said.
GE had offered to set up Gecas as a separate "ring-fenced" entity to deal at arms length with Honeywell, but GE
said that offer didn't satisfy the European Commission.

EU regulators will now pass along details of the GE offer to competitors and national antitrust authorities for comment, assess the responses and make a final recommendation to the European Commission, which is widely expected to turn down the proposal.

Mr. Monti said his office would continue to review the deal "unless the merger notification is formally withdrawn." GE said it has no plans to withdraw the proposal.

Last Week

The stock market was dragged down by earnings warnings and  GE's difficulty in winning  European approval  for its Honeywell merger. The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 8.4%, its worst week so far this year, leaving it up
24% since April 4 but still off 18% year-to-date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 3.2%, leaving it up 12% since April 4 but down 1.5% for the year.
Big Profit Warnings

Nortel Networks said it expects a $19.2 billion quarterly loss, partly due to restructuring costs. Two other tech bellwethers, JDS Uniphase and Nokia, also said results would be worse than expected. McDonald's lowered estimates for its latest quarter, as did Delta Air Lines, Varian Semiconductor Equipment, United Microelectronics, Maytag and Bausch & Lomb. Procter & Gamble expects a quarterly loss due to a $1.2 billion restructuring charge.
Economy Slows Further

The economy is weak or slowing nationwide as consumers hold off on buying and some businesses lose hope for a quick rebound, a Federal Reserve survey says. Inflation remains relatively tame, however. Consumer prices rose 0.4% in May, mainly due to higher energy prices. Industrial output fell 0.8% last month, while retail sales inched up 0.1%.
Layoffs Continue

Nortel said it will slash 10,000 jobs on top of the 20,000 layoffs announced in April, reducing the payroll at the world's largest telecom-equipment supplier by a third. Polaroid plans to cut an additional 2,000 jobs, reducing its work force by 35% since the start of the year.
Kraft Stock Offering
Kraft's initial public stock offering raised $8.7 billion for its parent, Philip Morris, making it the second-largest IPO
ever in the U.S. Kraft's stock ended the week below its $31 offering price, however.
Briefly

Warnaco and Reliance Group both filed for bankruptcy-court protection...Wall Street firms adopted guidelines to make their stock analysts more independent.
This Week
Economy Watch

Last month's housing starts will be released Tuesday. The May index of leading economic indicators will be reported Wednesday, followed by April's trade figures Thursday.

LE BOURGET, France (AP) - Airbus Industrie denied a report that it objects to a proposed multibillion-dollar
merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International.

The denial Sunday came days after European regulators expressed serious reservations about  GE's planned purchase of Honeywell  in a merger that would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the European Commission," Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard told reporters at the Paris Air Show on Sunday.

His remarks were in response to comments by the head of Seattle-based Boeing Co. - Airbus' only commercial jet competitor.

Boeing rival Harry Stonecipher was quoted by the French daily Le Monde on Saturday as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.
"I'm particularly concerned by the line taken by the European authorities," Stonecipher said. "Why should the
European Commission be worried when I, as an aircraft maker, am not."

The deal has all but been called off after GE and Honeywell refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company. The merger has already been conditionally cleared in the United States and Canada.

European Union regulators have expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing, engine servicing and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade ties between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Airbus  chief hits back at Boeing amid acrimony at Paris Air Show
504 words
17 June 2001

ATTENTION - RECASTS, ADDS details, new quotes

LE BOURGET, France, June 17 (AFP) - Tension between two transatlantic aircraft rivals deepened on Sunday, as Europe's Airbus lashed out at US Boeing for accusing it of working behind the scenes to halt a mega-merger between US conglomerates  General Electric  and Honeywell.
Airbus Chief Executive Officer Noel Forgeard said he was puzzled and shocked by comments from Boeing
vice-chairman Harry Stonecipher, who said in an interview in Le Monde newspaper that Airbus had leant on the
European Union's competition authorities in Brussels to block the 45-billion dollar (52 billion  euro) deal.

"I have been quite puzzled by this interview," Forgeard told a news conference on the second day of the Paris Air Showin Le Bourget. "All of this is very surprising, I was extremely shocked to see Mr Stonecipher venturing into political comments."

The strongly-worded comments added to acrimony on the second day of the prestigeous air show, where Airbus and Boeing are already fiercely competing for multi-billion dollar orders in a market overshadowed by an economic slowdown.

In the interview Stonecipher said it was Airbus' jealousy of seeing Boeing's US allies come together, and not fears that yet another merger could limit competition and push up prices, that had convinced the European Commission to oppose the deal.

The Commission -- the EU's competition watchdog -- is expected officially to announce its rejection of the merger on July 12.

Forgeard said the interview was "out of the picture" and its tone and content brought back memories of bitter competition between Boeing and its ertswhile US rival McDonnell Douglas.

On Saturday, as the air show started, General Electric signalled that it had lost hope of winning European approval for the planned merger with Honeywell, as the deal clearly failed to meet the Commission's competition concerns.

The prospect of an EU veto over the deal, which has already gained clearance in the United States, raised the prospect of a new transatlantic trade war after US President George W. Bush voiced concern about the affair on a European tour.
Forgeard insisted Airbus had told the Commission it backed the tie-up.

"I have had personally extensive discussions with the European Commission... Airbus has no objection to the deal and it's let it be known very formally to the European Commission," he said.

Airbus told the news conference that despite the current economic slowdown it maintained its forecasts for deliveries of 330 aircraft for this year and orders of between 350 and 400.

"All the objectives in terms of profit and cash will be met," Forgeard said, adding that the pan-European aircraft manufacturer was having a "soft landing" in the slowdown.

Airbus admitted that it would lose 45 options, which had been taken up by bankrupt Trans World Airlines, and that additional options could be lost from the ailing partners of SwissAir, notably Sabena, Air Liberte and AOM.

LE BOURGET, France, June 17 (Reuters) -  European plane maker Airbus on Sunday said it had told the European Commission that it had no objection to proposed  merger between General Electric  Corp and Honeywell  International Inc .

The vice chairman of Airbus rival Boeing Co , Harry Stonecipher, had been quoted on Saturday as saying Airbus was opposed to the $42 billion acquisition.
"Airbus has no objection to the deal and has let that be known to the European Commission," Airbus CEO Noel
Forgeard told a news conference at the Paris air show.

General Electric's planned purchase of Honeywell appears near to collapse after General Electric said it would not make any more concessions to satisfy European anti-trust authorities.

General Electric  still intent on Honeywell.
by Joe Lauria in New York.

GENERAL Electric  may yet carry off its ambitious plan to buy  Honeywell  International despite last week's rebuff from the European Commission, US analysts say, citing  GE chief executive Jack Welch's considerable clout in Washington.
"We strongly disagree with the notion that  GE is ready to abandon its effort to complete the  merger with
Honeywell,"  said CSFB analyst Michael Regan.
"I can't see Welch and GE standing idly by waiting for a negative decision to come out," added Rob Plaza, a GE
analyst at Morningstar Inc. "If Welch really wants to get it done, I can see him doing things to get it done."

Industry reaction yesterday also indicated that GE-Honeywell could still be alive. Aerospace executives pointed out that United Technologies, the underbidder in the race to acquire Honeywell, had made no move to resume its pursuit of the aero-engine manufacturer.

"It is obvious they think that GE is playing a very clever game - United Technologies obviously think the deal is still a go," said one aerospace executive.

The failure so far of the GE-Honeywell merger has unleashed a round of Europe-bashing in the United States equal in pitch to some criticism being levelled against the US in Europe.
One American commentator asked whether EU competition commissioner Mario Monti had gone from being
"Super Mario Monti to Stupid Mario Monti".

If the deal collapses, it would be the first time a proposed merger between two American firms approved by US officials was blocked by European regulators. And that has raised the ire of many in Washington, especially in Congress.
With mounting US-Europe tension, there is revived trade war talk, too. Welch has allies in Washington, especially
Republicans, to whom GE donates considerably more campaign money than to Democrats.
Before Welch arrived in Brussels, attorney general John Ashcroft had dispatched a deputy there to pave the way. US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said America had "a strong interest in fair treatment" of GE and
Honeywell. Welch asked White House chief of staff Andrew Card for help. And Bush said he was "concerned" the
deal had not yet gone through.
Monti said the sticking point was not the dollar amount of divestitures of Honeywell's business.

"We have explored with the parties commitments which would not have entailed further divestments in the aerospace industry but rather a structural commitment to modify the commercial behaviour of GECAS," he said.

Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, is GE's aircraft financing arm that the EU believes has unfairly doled out financing to companies that first agree to buy GE aircraft engines. Welch said he made an offer to put GECAS under separate management and outside auditors, but it was rejected by the EU.
"We believe there is a slightly better than 50/50 shot that the deal receives approval from the EU," Regan said. Welch postponed his retirement until the Honeywell deal was done. When he announced it in October he said it
was the "most exciting day in the 118-year history of GE".

General Electric  and Honeywell  - Merger.

GE's merger with Honeywell  is still alive, according to some interested parties. The European member states, customers of GE and Honeywell  and competitors will tomorrow receive firm details of GE's proposed divestments for the first time. Third parties believe  GE will use this to convince others of the validity of the deal.

One adviser said: "The issue will be whether GE and Honeywell  will be able to persuade people that the undertakings they have given to the commission are good enough."

New York -(Dow Jones)- The board of Honeywell  International Inc. (HON) will meet Monday to review contingency plans should the company's pending merger with General Electric  Co. (GE) fall apart,  Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said.

The $41 billion deal, announced in October, is in peril because of  European regulatory opposition. Though  GE and the European Commission remain divided on the substance of the case, a last-minute compromise is possible.
Crane declined to comment further on the meeting.

EU's Lamy Criticizes Political Input In Merger -Report

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy criticized political interference in the merger of General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell  (HON) in an interview published Monday in French daily newspaper Le Monde.

"This is not a political issue," Lamy said. "The European Commission is responsible for establishing and maintaining competition. And my colleague Mario Monti applies the laws precisely."

Lamy said he would not comment directly on comments by Boeing Co. (BA) vice chairman Harry Stonecipher, who was quoted in the weekend edition of Le Monde accusing Airbus (F.ABI) of opposing the GE-Honeywell merger.
But Lamy said Airbus needs the E.U. Commission as its "legal shield" in the face of American pressure.
Lamy also said the EU will hold its ground against U.S. attempts at "stealth protectionism' in the steel industry. "I don't have the impression that the United States is an island of steel prosperity in a sea of global dumping,"
Lamy said.
Lamy also said the EU will "closely watch" Japanese legislation on deregulation in the telecoms industry. "And if necessary, we will take our case to the World Trade Organization," Lamy said.

USTR: Disappointed By EU Blocking GE-Honeywell Merger

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said Monday he was disappointed by European Union opposition to the  merger of U.S. industrial giants  General Electric  Co. (GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON).

The $41 billion  merger proposed in November is in peril because  European Commission officials have raised concerns about its potential anticompetitive results.

"Obviously we're disappointed," Zoellick said in response to an off-topic question during a press briefing on trade and agriculture. "The U.S. antitrust authorities approved the deal. We certainly respect the sovereign E.U. process in terms of its review."

Zoellick said he understood there may be some ongoing negotiations to save the merger but added he wasn't privy to details of the talks.

Asked if President George W. Bush's administration would raise the issue with E.U. officials, Zoellick said, "time will tell."

GE merger raising  concerns, EU says

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Denying a trans-Atlantic trade rift was developing, the European Union's top antitrust regulator said Monday that Europeans  were not the only ones with reservations about General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference the proposed deal "has raised strong concerns" among airlines on both side of the Atlantic.

Without naming names, he said several U.S. firms complained and took an "active role" at the EU Commission hearing held last month on the proposed deal.

"This is not a trans-Atlantic dispute," he said. "There have been concerns expressed both by customers and competitors on both sides."
Although it won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU
regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions more than GE has offered.

GE said the EU had rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient. GE said it was not optimistic about winning EU approval.

Stressing that the case has not been decided yet -- the deadline for an EU decision is July 12 -- Monti expressed anger over what he termed "attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention.

"This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has no impact on the commission whatsoever," he said. "This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

He added that for 10 years, the EU office has had a "very close and constructive cooperation" with U.S. regulators. He said he was recently in touch with the new Bush administration appointees and "expressed my willingness to work with them and intensify cooperation."

The EU has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing, engine servicing and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

Monti also dismissed criticisms by U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing that the Commission plans to block the merger in an attempt to defend French rival Airbus Industrie.

"Contrary to some statements reported in the media, the large aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have not been particularly active in the proceedings," he said.

Boeing president Harry Stonecipher was quoted by the French daily Le Monde on Saturday as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.

At the Paris Air Show on Sunday, Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard insisted "Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the European Commission."

The Commission said Monday it had no meetings with representatives or lawyers of the companies over the weekend.

<DATELINE> LE BOURGET, France </DATELINE> <SERIES> </SERIES> <COLUMN> </COLUMN> Airbus Industrie yesterday denied a report it objects to a proposed multibillion-dollar  merger between General Electric Co. and Honeywell  International.

The denial came days after  European regulators expressed serious reservations about  GE's planned purchase of Honeywell  in a merger that would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the European Commission," Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard said at the Paris Air Show.

His remarks were in response to comments by the head of Seattle-based Boeing Co., Airbus's only commercial jet competitor.

Boeing president Harry Stonecipher was quoted by the French daily Le Monde on Saturday as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.
"I'm particularly concerned by the line taken by the European authorities," Stonecipher said. "Why should the
European Commission be worried when I, as an aircraft maker, am not."

The deal has all but been called off after GE and Honeywell refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company. The merger has already been conditionally cleared in the United States and Canada.

European Union regulators have expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing, engine servicing and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

LE BOURGET, France (AP) - Airbus Industrie denied a report that it objects to a proposed multibillion-dollar
merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International.

The denial Sunday came days after European regulators expressed serious reservations about  GE's planned purchase of Honeywell  in a merger that would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the European Commission," Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard told reporters at the Paris Air Show on Sunday.

His remarks were in response to comments by the head of Seattle-based Boeing Co. - Airbus' only commercial jet competitor.

Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's president and chief operating officer, was quoted by the French daily Le Monde on Saturday as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade ties between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Within a day of Mario  Monti's EU Merge Task Force flattening the  GE-Honeywell merger, both Airbus and Boeing, two rivals, have come forth to make it clear they do not oppose the deal. "Why should the EuropeanCommission be worried when I, as an aircraft maker, am not?" said Boeing's president. Good question. Airbus said it formally told the Commission as much. Maybe Mr.  Monti's minions should offer a more formal explanation of their theory of competition in a modern economy.

EU law requires companies, no matter where they're based, to notify the commission about planned mergers if their combined worldwide sales exceed roughly $4.3 billion a year and at least $216 million of that business is done in the EU.
U.S. companies are required to follow EU law to do business in Europe, just as European companies must follow
U.S. law in the United States.
GE alone has some 85,000 employees in Europe. Its worldwide revenues last year were nearly $130 billion.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -  Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with General Electric  Co. Monday, despite objections by  European Union regulators with competition concerns about the $41 billion  merger.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The board was reviewing "a broad range of contingency" plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronics and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from GE
competitor United Technologies Inc. and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., which pursued Honeywell until GE swooped in with a better offer, declined to comment Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell, formed in December 1999 by the merger of Honeywell and Morris Township-based AlliedSignal, had already begun to streamline, announcing 6,500 job cuts earlier this year and making plans last year to merge its polymers and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

Shares of Honeywell rose $1.30, or 3 percent, to $40 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of GE rose 19 cents to $49.

GE-Honeywell  Fallout Rains Pain on Traders --- Arbitragers Rack Up Losses as Merger Stalls --- `There's a
Lot of Blood Out There'

Ouch.

Already hurt by a big slowdown in merger-and-acquisition activity, traders who invest in takeover stocks have been battered by the standoff between General Electric  Chairman John F. Welch Jr. and Mario  Monti, Europe's chief antitrust regulator.

Takeover experts estimate that the takeover-trading, or risk-arbitrage, community has lost more than $1 billion in the past two weeks due to the growing expectations that GE's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International will fall apart. That is a far cry from an average 30% annualized rate of return that had been anticipated when they purchased the shares.

It is the latest blow in a year that has fallen far short of the stellar results seen in previous years when the stock market was booming and the pace of mergers was rapid. Takeover experts estimate arbitragers own between 80 million and 100 million shares of Honeywell. Takeover arbitragers make their money by betting on the likelihood that a proposed merger will be completed. In this deal, the "arbs" snapped up Honeywell shares on the hope that the deal would be completed on the terms announced in October.
"Obviously, this has been very painful. The losses are going to be very big," said Tom Burnett, president of
Merger Insight, an institutional research service.

The growing concerns about the future of the $41 billion GE deal reached new heights when Mr. Welch acknowledged for the first time that he wasn't optimistic that the company's $2.2 billion divestiture proposal would satisfy European antitrust regulators.

In late trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down 12% $5.16 at $37.10, while General Electric was up 2.1%, or $1.01, at $48.86. Some traders held on to their Honeywell shares, hoping that another bidder will emerge.

Mr. Monti, the European competition commissioner, has until July 12 to make a decision on the deal, but many takeover experts consider the transaction nearly dead.

The development sent the deal's so-called spread -- the difference between Honeywell's stock price and the implied value of the GE stock that Honeywell shareholders would receive -- soaring to $14.45, from a spread of about $2.80 just last month. Arbitragers make money when the spread narrows to zero.

The widening differential between the nominal price shareholders would receive and where Honeywell shares are trading signals that there is a growing belief that the transaction has an increased risk of unraveling.

The GE-Honeywell deal is the latest transaction that has disappointed takeover traders this year. In March, Tyson Foods canceled a planned $3.2 billion acquisition of IBP. And traders fretted for months over the outcome of Deutsche Telekom's purchase of VoiceStream Wireless, although that deal has been completed.

As of May 31, the average fund managed by takeover traders rose 4.8% this year compared with an 8.9% gain a the year earlier, according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc., Nashville, Tennessee.

Page 67 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But traders said the potential fallout from a collapse of the GE-Honeywell deal would eclipse previous losses. "There's a lot of blood out there. People had it among their larger positions because they thought there was a large probability the deal would get done," one takeover trader said.

Indeed, it was the very words of Mr. Welch that gave many arbitragers comfort when the deal was unveiled in October -- even though some experts predicted antitrust problems. Mr. Welch, who delayed his retirement to oversee the integration of Honeywell, said he didn't expect any antitrust issues.

Takeover traders also were optimistic about the likely outcome of the deal because it had already received approval from the U.S. Justice Department, which ordered only minor concessions from GE. But the European regulatory agency has become increasingly tough in recent months, even on transactions such as this one involving two companies based in the U.S.

Traders were reluctant to discuss their own losses or rumored losses at rival firms. Some of the damage, however, may have been minimized because the spread had been widening over the past week and that would provide an opportunity for traders to protect their vulnerable positions.

Indeed, arbitragers said that is exactly what happened with San Francisco hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, which held 4.7 million Honeywell shares in the first quarter, according to a Honeywell shareholder list filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These arbs said Farallon minimized its risk before the spread widened to current levels. Farallon general counsel Mark Wehrly declined to comment.

Although most takeover traders experienced some pain from the GE-Honeywell situation, Bear Stearns Cos.' arbitrage department has emerged unscathed. The investment bank advised Honeywell in the GE negotiations and its takeover traders have been prohibited from playing the deal.

MARKET WEEK -- Stocks
Telecom Woes Send Stocks Through  the Wringer

Wall Street's hopes for an imminent revival in technology spending were dealt a sharp blow last week after profit warnings from Nokia, Nortel Networks and JDS Uniphase suggested that the important telecommunications sector will be under pressure well into 2002.

The Nasdaq fell 186 points, or 8.4%, in the week to 2028, reversing part of its large recent gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 353 points, or 3.2%, to 10623.  Honeywell  was the Dow's biggest loser as  General    Electric  and European antitrust regulators unexpectedly failed to resolve their differences over  GE's bid to acquire Honeywell,  imperiling the prospects for the $40 billion  merger. The S&P 500 Index was off 4% to 1214.

"We're seeing a second wave of technology disappointments," says Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan Stanley. "The market had been hoping the worst was over." Wien is also worried that consumer spending, which so far has held up well despite corporate cutbacks, could soon slow. The Honeywell situation is notable because it marks the first time that a merger that has gained approval from U.S. antitrust regulators may be blocked by European objections.

Wall Street arbitrageurs lost an estimated $1 billion last week as the GE-Honeywell deal appeared to unravel. Honeywell was off 7.80 to 38.70, ending 13 points below the value of the GE bid. GE was up 0.67 to 48.14 in the week, partly on arbitrage-related buying. United Technologies, whose original bid for Honeywell last October was trumped by GE, declined 6.66 to 74.75 amid fears that it will try to buy Honeywell if GE's bid fails. Honeywell is a less attractive target now than in October because its earnings prospects have eroded and its management has been distracted by the prospect of enormous layoffs if GE succeeds in gaining control.

The betting is that if United Technologies does act, it's prepared to pay around $45 a share for Honeywell, which is expected to earn around $2.75 a share this year. Some investors have been attracted to Honeywell, figuring that it trades for a modest 14 times projected 2001 profits, and that either GE or United Technologies could succeed in buying it. An independent Honeywell might trade in the 33 to 35 range. Honeywell bulls argue the risk/reward tradeoff looks favorable.

The widely anticipated initial public offering from Kraft Foods proved a disappointment as the underwriting group priced the $9 billion deal at $31 a share, above the expected range of $27 to $30. Kraft finished the week at
30.60. One institutional investor said that if Kraft had been priced at $30, the stock likely would be trading above
31 now because institutional buyers of the IPO would have continued to purchase stock in the open market. Philip
Morris' apparent strategy of trying to get the highest possible price for Kraft backfired and ended up hurting its
own stock, which was down nearly two points to 46.32 in the week. Philip Morris owns over 80% of Kraft following
the IPO.

-- Nortel said Friday that it will report a monstrous $19.2 billion loss in the second quarter, probably the largest in corporate history, largely due to goodwill charges and other writedowns. But the company also said it expects a wider-than-expected operating loss in the period. Nortel, a former tech darling because of its leading position in optical networking equipment and other telecommunications gear, now has fallen nearly 90% from its September high of 89 to a close Friday of 9.86. Nortel's market value, now $32 billion, has plunged by $250 billion from its peak. Its shares were off 2.67 last week, including a 74-cent drop Friday. Nortel Chief Executive John Roth said the equipment "market is contracting at an alarming rate" and that a "meaningful growth in spending is not expected to occur before the second half of 2002."

Nortel's woes reflect reduced capital spending by established telecom players like Verizon Communications, the collapse of upstart telecom providers like Winstar Communications and Teligent and the increasingly precarious position of a group of data-oriented providers like Level 3 Communications, XO Communications and Williams Communications. All the upstart carriers came under pressure last week, hurt by news Friday that 360Networks, a Canadian outfit headed by former Microsoft chief financial officer Greg Maffei, would miss a bond interest payment. The table on the next page shows the steep losses in the sector this year.

One of Nortel's chief competitors, Lucent Technologies, continued its decline last week, falling 2.09 to 6.31, cutting its market value to $20 billion. At its peak, Lucent traded at 78, giving it a market cap of $265 billion.

Nokia, the world's top maker of cell phones, dropped 7.37 to 22.46 after warning of weaker-than-expected results in the current quarter amid a slowdown in handset sales.

The telecom troubles affected key Nasdaq stocks such as Cisco Systems, which fell 3.84 to 16.65 because Cisco is a major equipment supplier to the industry.
Among the data-oriented bandwidth providers, Level 3 dropped 1.67 to 7.62; XO Communications fell 0.52 to
2.44 and McLeodUSA was off 1.47 to 3.53. Global Crossing, the leader in the group because of its global fiber
network, got hit hard Friday, falling 1.84 to 8.66, leaving it way below its 2000 high of 60, after Credit Suisse First
Boston analyst Dan Reingold cut his 2001 and 2002 revenue and cash-flow estimates.

He said Global Crossing and other bandwidth providers are finding it harder to make up-front sales of capacity and instead are having to rely more on leasing. This reduces near-term cash flow. He also cited
"slower-than-expected data traffic growth, a slowing economy and an abundance of new competitors in the longhaul bandwidth market."

The telecom bond market probably suffered its worst decline ever last week with many issues down 10 to 15 points. Global Crossing and Nextel Comnunications, the nationwide wireless provider, are widely viewed as industry survivors and command sizable equity market values. But their bonds now yield over 14%.

NTL, a little-known British cable TV outfit with a huge $15 billion debt load, saw its bond yields rise to 24% last week and its stock fall 5.19 to 14.81 -- way below its high last year of over 100. A big client of Wall Street, thanks to its heavy junk-bond sales, NTL issued $1 billion of convertible debt just last month. But those bonds have since fallen 30%.

Bonds from Level 3, the big domestic fiber-optic company, now yield over 20%, as does the debt from Exodus Communications, the leading provider of Internet Web-hosting services. Exodus' stock plunged 1.72 to 4.61 last week. Exodus, which has never been profitable, peaked at 86 and was valued at over $40 billion in early 2000 when the firm was deemed the Cisco of the now-glutted sector because of its first-mover advantage and supposedly enormous growth opportunities

XO Communications' debt, meanwhile, trades for around 30 cents on the dollar despite a recent $250 million equity infusion. Some investors are accumulating depressed telecom debt, arguing that some of the companies are apt to be survivors and that the bonds can provide equity-like returns. XO, for instance, has enough cash on hand to meet its capital expenditures and interest expense for the next 18 months, meaning bond investors may get back half their original investment in the next year and a half. Lucent's bonds yield nearly 13%, and Nortel debt, still rated a high single-A, yields over 8%. The stocks of many of the upstarts are so low that they're equivalent to options on the companies' prospects.

-- Among the few internet companies that are still thriving is eBay, which has consistently delivered solid revenue and profit gains from its auction service while Yahoo! and Amazon.com have faltered.

Wall Street has rewarded eBay by annointing it as the safe, dependable Internet stock, much like Microsoft in the software area. EBay is up almost 100% this year to 65, and it commands a hefty 166 times projected 2001 profits of 39 cents and 100 times estimated 2002 earnings of 64 cents. EBay's market value has risen to $18 billion, making it larger than Amazon.com ($5 billion market value) and Yahoo ($10 billion) combined.

"This is one Internet company that likely will be around and thriving in 10 years," says Faye Landes, Internet analyst at Sanford Bernstein. "The issue comes down to valuation." Landes is neutral on eBay because she can't stomach its high P/E.

EBay's chief executive, Meg Whitman, has said that the company aims to generate $3 billion in revenues by 2005 with an operating margin of 30% to 35%. Those goals, however, are pretty ambitious because they imply

compounded annual revenue growth of 50% from this year's projected $700 million. EBay has had success diversifying away from collectibles to such categories as computers and used cars, but it will have to grow enormously to hit its targets. Assuming eBay hits its 2005 goals, it may earn around $1.65 a share, meaning it now trades for 40 times an ambitious 2005 profit estimate.

-- Presidential Life, an obscure New York insurer controlled by its 81-year-old chief executive, could be sold in the next few years at a sizable premium to its current price.

At Presidential's annual meeting in late May, Herbert Kurz, the company's CEO and top shareholder, with a 26% stake, reportedly said that he expects that the company eventually will be sold. Reached last week, Presidential's treasurer, Charles Snyder, confirmed Kurz's comments but added that "nothing is in the works" now and that there's no guarantee that anything will happen. Kurz wouldn't comment.

Presidential's shares are up to 19.63 from around 18 since the meeting, although the stock has moved little in recent years because of the company's stagnant profits. Presidential now trades for just 1.3 times its book value of $15.50, while the average life insurer commands nearly twice book.

Based on recent sales of life insurers, Presidential might get $30 a share or more in a takeover. Presidential isn't expensive based on earnings, trading for 13 times projected 2001 profits of $1.50 a share. Last year the company earned $1.35 a share. Presidential has a strong balance sheet with little debt and it pays a 2% dividend.

-- When Promethean Asset Management puts money into a company, other investors often bail out. That's because New York-based Promethean has a reputation of being a lender of last resort for troubled technology companies.

Just last week, Excite@Home fell 1.12 to 2.80 after the company announced a private sale of $100 million in convertible bonds to Promethean. The view on the Street is that if Excite@Home has to turn to Promethean, the company's strategic investors, including Comcast, Cox Communications and AT&T, aren't interested in putting any new money into the provider of high-speed Internet connections over cable lines.

Promethean has been a buyer of so-called death-spiral convertibles issued by companies like eToys that have no floor on the conversion price. This can result in enormous dilution when a company's stock falls. The Excite@Home convert wasn't a death-spiral issue, but it does allow Promethean to redeem the issue annually. Excite@Home can pay off the debt with cash or stock, but the fear is that in 2002, the company may not have the cash and will have to issue stock.

Bill Miller, the manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust, has been rightly celebrated for beating the S&P 500 index in each of the past 10 years. But an unsung group of money managers at the $20 billion Harvard University endowment have managed a similar feat.

Now that group, led by Robert Atchinson and Phil Gross, is forming its own firm, Adage Capital Management, which will attempt to continue that impressive record. The Harvard group, consisting of seven managers, ran about $5 billion of the university's endowment and beat the S&P by an average of 4.5 percentage points annually since 1991. The Harvard group's strategy is to beat the S&P by stock selections within industries, not by overweighting or underweighting any group in the index. Adage will manage about $1.8 billion in Harvard money and is expected to raise additional funds from other investors.

AIRBUS CHIEF SAYS COMPANY DOESN'T OPPOSE GE-HONEYWELL MERGER; DENIAL COMES DAYS
AFTER EU SCRUTINY

LE BOURGET, France --- Airbus Industrie denied a report that it objects to a proposed multibillion-dollar  merger
between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International.

The denial Sunday came days after European regulators expressed serious reservations about  GE's planned purchase of Honeywell  in a merger that would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

"Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the European Commission," Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard told reporters at the Paris Air Show on Sunday.

His remarks were in response to comments by the head of Seattle-based Boeing Co. --- Airbus' only commercial jet competitor.

Boeing President and Chief Operating Officer Harry Stonecipher was quoted by the French daily Le Monde on Saturday as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.
"I'm particularly concerned by the line taken by the European authorities," Stonecipher said. "Why should the
European Commission be worried when I, as an aircraft maker, am not."

The deal has all but been called off after GE and Honeywell refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company. The merger already has been conditionally cleared in the United States and Canada.

European Union regulators have expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing, engine servicing and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade ties between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Honeywell  reaffirms commitment to GE deal

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) _  Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to a troubled merger bid with General Electric  Co. on Monday, despite objections by  European Union regulators with competition concerns about the $41 billion US deal.

Honeywell's  board of directors ``expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction,'' the technology company said after a directors' meeting at its Morris Township headquarters.

The board met to review ``a broad range of contingency'' plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by General Electric faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Document cpr0000020010711dx6i019nn

REGULATORS AT CENTER OF POWER CRISIS

WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators will meet today to discuss how they might tweak rules on the beleaguered California wholesale electricity market, possibly moving to limit prices across the entire West in a compromise with lawmakers who are demanding tougher measures. The Republican-led Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be the focus of increasingly bitter California officials in Sacramento and the state's elected officials in Congress. California officials are demanding more be done to curb alleged price gouging and prevent
blackouts this summer. FERC-watchersthink the commission will approve a plan to expand its existing price-relief plan for California.
BAHAMASAIR LOSES $25 MILLION

NASSAU, Bahamas -- Government-owned airline Bahamasair lost $25 million last year because of declining revenues and investment in a new reservations system, Tourism Minister Tommy Turnquest said. Turnquest, speaking to the House of Assembly recently, attributed part of the losses to a new reservations and ticketing system, but he did not specify the cost. His ministry is responsible for the airline. The airline dropped a leased jet and three "ill-suited" smaller propeller airplanes from its fleet, and the airline lost $1.7 million despite its best efforts to improve its load factor on the limited seating, he said.
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TO RESUME TALKS

DALLAS -- Contract talks to avert a potentially crippling July 1 strike by American Airlines's 23,000 flight attendants resume this week under a cloud of speculation over whether the White House will intervene to bar the union from walking out. American and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants need to bridge a gap the union puts at about $200 million, mainly in pay raises and related benefits, when they sit down again Wednesday.

"Fundamentally, we are planning our future without  Honeywell,"  General Electric  president Jeffrey Immelt told a news conference over the weekend, indicating he does not expect an OK from the  European Union for his company's $42 billion megamerger with the electronics and aircraft systems giant. Immelt said  GE would not negotiate further with the  EU's competition commission, which is due to issue its decision by July 12. The merger has won conditional approval  from regulators in the US. GE proposed to the EU commission to divest itself of $2.2 billion in holdings, $2 billion more than asked for by US regulators. But the EU reportedly wants a selloff of $6 billion. Immelt did not say which rivals had expressed concern to the  EU over the merger, but indicated they were both  European and American.
For the fourth time this year, Nortel Networks announced a heavy new round of layoffs, this time numbering
10,000. The Canadian telecommunications equipment giant also said Friday it would post a massive $19.2 billion
loss for the second quarter. The job cuts bring to 30,000 the number of employees cut from the payroll, or almost
one-third of its international workforce. (c) Copyright 2001. The Christian Science Monitor

Boeing boss plays down row with Airbus  over GE-Honeywell merger
317 words
18 June 2001
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
LE BOURGET, France, June 18 (AFP) - The vice president of aviation giant Boeing, Harry Stonecipher, attempted on Monday to defuse a row with his  European rival Airbus sparked by his remarks in a newspaper interview.

Stonecipher had claimed in the French daily Le Monde that Airbus had lobbied against the proposed merger of two major Boeing suppliers,  General Electric  and Honeywell,  which is being investigated by regulators.

"I did make the statement that I thought Airbus was against the merger of General Electric and GE Honeywell, and (Airbus chairman) Noel Forgeard said yesterday that that's absolutely not the case and that they're in favour of it, and I can applaud that," Stonecipher told reporters at the Paris Air Show.

"If Mr Forgeard is offended by my statement then I apologise to him because he's a great friend, I consider him a friend, but the good news is that both Boeing and Airbus want the merger between GE and Honeywell to go forward."
Stonecipher did implicitly criticise Airbus, however.

"By the way, this was the first time, I think, that they've said that publically, and if they'd said that before I don't think this would have been such an issue this morning, would it?" he added.

Forgeard had said on Sunday that he was "shocked" and "puzzled" by Stonecipher's allegation that Airbus' hand was behind opposition to the merger, which could be rejected by the European Commission on July 12.
If the proposed 45-billion-dollar (52-billion-euro) deal is blocked by European regulators it would be the first time
Brussels has stepped in to stop a merger already approved in Washington.

The row has raised tensions at a time when the United States and Europe are already in dispute over a number of other trade disagreements.

Questions of protectionism dog EU deals

LE BOURGET, France -- Senior executives at rival aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing traded rhetorical jabs this weekend, as global aerospace leaders assessed the consequences of the apparent collapse of the $41 billion GE-Honeywell merger.

Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard said Sunday he was "shocked" by Boeing Vice Chairman Harry Stonecipher's charge that Airbus' opposition to the  merger had caused the European Commission to demand the stiff concessions from GE that effectively killed the deal.

Forgeard, who said he had discussed the deal with GE chief Jack Welch, insisted that Airbus told European regulators it supported the merger.
Stonecipher's comments came in an interview in weekend editions of Le Monde, the French newspaper. Stonecipher's interview did nothing to cool emotions as thousands of executives, gathering for the biannual Paris
Air Show, considered whether trans-Atlantic trade ties will suffer following Europe's refusal to bless a merger that
the U.S. government already had approved.
"On many different levels, tension is building," says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation industry analyst with Teal
Group of Fairfax, Va. "Right now, there's an unusual number of flash points."

Some U.S. corporations have complained that Mario Monti, the European Commission official responsible for antitrust enforcement, has been overly aggressive in scrutinizing their deals. And analysts say political opponents of free trade in the U.S. likely will attempt to paint the commission's stance as protectionism masquerading as antitrust policy.

But Monti has approved an overwhelming percentage of proposed mergers. U.S. defense electronics giant Raytheon, which needed EC approval for a defense joint venture with French electronics firm Thales, had no complaints about its treatment by the commission, according to Norman Ray, president of Raytheon Europe. (The deal was OK'd in March.)
And Monti has blocked several corporate marriages involving European companies, including Volvo's proposed
$7 billion acquisition of truck manufacturer Scania, which he nixed last year.
"If he doesn't like a deal, he doesn't like a deal," says Matthew Heim, a Brussels-based senior associate with
APCO, an international public affairs consultancy. "It doesn't matter what the nationalities of the parties are."

Still, despite the verbal jousting, most executives say the GE- Honeywell affair will not cause a major rupture. Just about every major U.S. aerospace company represented here is cooperating in commercial or military programs with a European counterpart. Raytheon, for example, is teaming with EADS, the European aerospace conglomerate that owns 80% of Airbus, to pursue a Turkish military contract.
Even Airbus, widely regarded as Europe's commercial aircraft builder, employs more than 1,500 people in the
USA.
"Neither the U.S. nor Europe, no side, is really interested in escalating and having a trade war," says Rainer
Hertrich, CEO of EADS.

The deal has all but been called off after GE and Honeywell refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company. The merger has already been conditionally cleared in the United States and Canada.

Airbus  stays out of merger fight;  Aircraft manufacturer denies opposition to GE-Honeywell  talks

Le Bourget; France -- "Airbus has no objection to the deal and has made it known very formally to the  European
Commission," Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard said at the Paris Air Show yesterday.

His remarks were in response to comments by the head of Seattle-based Boeing Co. -- Airbus's only commercial jet competitor.

Boeing president Harry Stonecipher was quoted by the French daily Le Monde as saying Airbus opposed the deal because it would unite GE's aircraft engine business with Honeywell, a key supplier of aircraft electronics.
"I'm particularly concerned by the line taken by the European authorities," Stonecipher said. "Why should the European Commission be worried when I, as an aircraft maker, am not."
The deal has all but been called off after GE and Honeywell refused Europe's demands to cut the size of the combined company.
The merger has already been conditionally cleared in the United States and Canada.

European Union regulators have expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing, engine servicing and aerospace electronics, also known as avionics.

A decision to block the deal could damage trade ties between the United States and Europe, which were threatened in 1997 when the EU raised major objections to Boeing's impending merger with McDonnell Douglas.

Honeywell  Pledges Commitment to GE

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -  Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with General Electric  Co. Monday, despite objections by  European Union regulators with competition concerns about the $41 billion  merger.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The board was reviewing "a broad range of contingency" plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronics and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from GE
competitor United Technologies Inc. and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., which pursued Honeywell until GE swooped in with a better offer, declined to comment Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell, formed in December 1999 by the merger of Honeywell and Morris Township-based AlliedSignal, had already begun to streamline, announcing 6,500 job cuts earlier this year and making plans last year to merge its polymers and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

Shares of Honeywell rose $1.30, or 3 percent, to $40 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of GE rose 19 cents to $49.

Newscast:  Honeywell  remains committed to merger with GE

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Honeywell  held a board meeting today, and the company says its remains fully committed to its megamerger with General Electric.  The optimistic words from Honeywell  come despite mounting European regulatory opposition to the deal.  Honeywell  also said it expects GE to do everything possible to secure regulatory approval  for the transaction. But since the end of last week, GE officials have expressed skepticism that the merger would gain EU approval.  And today European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti fired back at a barrage of US political criticism at the commission saying, and we quote, "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and trigger political intervention. This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has no impact on the  commission whatsoever." Now the  GE-Honeywell  situation was also the main buzz at the Paris Air Show.
GUY JOHNSON reporting:

With pilots screaming overhead, it may have seemed that all the action was in the air at the Paris Air Show. But as ever, the real dogfight was between Airbus and Boeing. This time it was started by president of Boeing Harry Stonecipher, who in an interview with Le Monde, appeared to accuse Airbus of wrecking the GE-Honeywell deal. Noel Forgeard, CEO of Airbus, though, was quick to respond.

Mr. NOEL FORGEARD (Airbus CEO): It's just--just wrong. ...(Unintelligible). What--what can I say? It happens to be wrong because after discussion with the board--the commission and GE, of some guarantees, investor guarantees, we are taking a formal position to the commission that we do not object to this operation?'

JOHNSON: And that view seemed to be backed up by the EU. And Monday morning, Harry Stonecipher toned it down a little bit, but he still had questions about why the EU was blocking the deal.

Mr. HARRY STONECIPHER (Boeing President): I am absolutely mystified at what's going on because Boeing has taken the position right from the get-go in the US and in the EU that says, `We think the merger is a wonderful idea.' And I can tell you I'm absolutely pleased that Airbus seemed to have the same view. So you normally don't find us with the same view on many things, but on this we agree.
JOHNSON: Guy Johnson, La Bourget, the Paris Air Show, CNBC.

INSANA: Meantime, on this side of the pond, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas says the US has legitimate concerns about the power of the EU.

Senator PHIL GRAMM (Republican, Texas): I think this is something that's troubling. I think it's something that we need to look at. And I think it's a very real question as to what power the EU should have in dealing with two companies that are fundamentally American companies. Now I know that nationalism, in terms of corporate ownership, is not what it used to be. But whether Europe should have this power or not, I've got very real questions about it.

INSANA: Checking the stocks of the three Dow components involved: Honeywell finished the day up $1.50, General Electric up 38 cents and United Technologies, a potential suitor again for Honeywell, finished up more than $3, to 77.81.

RON INSANA, co-anchor: Despite serious opposition from EU regulators, Honeywell  is still optimistic that its
$41 billion merger with General Electric  will happen. Honeywell,  reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and
expects, quote, "GE will do everything possible to secure regulatoryapproval for the transaction." Earlier in the
show, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt weighed in on that issue.

Representative RICHARD GEPHARDT (Democrat, Minority Leader): I think we all need to respect each other's antitrust laws. And in trade, we now look at questions like intellectual property, and we hope we look at labor and environment as well. So clearly  Europe has to make decisions about how we're enforcing our  antitrust laws, but
I don't think other countries or groups of countries ought to be able to pass judgment on whether or not we're passing the muster here on our  antitrust laws.

Senator PHIL GRAMM (Republican, Texas): Well I'm not sure what kind of recourse there could be, but I think it's something we need to look at very closely. Europe has done many things in terms of its environmental policy, its tax policy, that have disadvantaged i--its privacy policies, that have disadvantaged it in competing on the world market.

INSANA: Well, while Honeywell expressed some optimism that GE would, in fact, push forward with the deal, there were plenty of media reports, including one we delivered on Friday night that suggest that General Electric, at the moment, thinks this deal is all but dead.

Aerospace  chiefs rebut US accusations.

European aerospace chiefs hit back yesterday at accusations from US rivals that they had engineered the
European commission's block on General Electric's  $41bn takeover of  Honeywell,  writes David Gow in Paris.

Seizing on hostile comments by President George Bush last week, Boeing vice-chairman Harry Stonecipher accused Airbus, the US group's arch-rival, of forcing the hand of the Brussels  competition authorities by opposing the merger of the two US groups.

Amid fears the dispute between Europe and the US over the world's biggest in dustrial merger could escalate into a full-scale trade war, Noel Forgeard, Airbus chief executive, angrily rebutted the Boeing charges.

He said he had had extensive talks with the commission and Jack Welch, GE's executive chairman, and had raised no formal objections to the merger, especially as GE had accepted `serious safeguards'.

Privately, US executives say, in the words of one, that the Brussels moves are `disgusting', but aerospace and defence groups are anxious to prevent the row getting out of control because they have or are plan ning a series of alliances in Europe and the US.

Mr Stonecipher warned - in an interview with Le Monde, the French daily - that the dispute could spread into the commercial arena. `The US approved this merger and if Europe rejects it, what will happen? You don't exactly become friends," he said.

Boeing's vice-chairman went further by calling Europe's plans to procure more than 200 new transporters made by Airbus, the A400M, `absurd" economically when US planes could be built in Europe for far less money.

Mr Forgeard accused Mr Stonecipher of threatening the Brussels competition authorities and of making `highly inappropriate political comments" against the French president and France's national security.

Other US and European executives, mindful of their extensive cross-border interests, tried to play the dispute down. Mr Stonecipher's strictures on the A400M come amid mounting European concern that Germany - which cut its defence budget again last week - will be unable to fund the 73 transporters it is committed to buying.

Reverse Spin: Here's one deal GE can't bring to life

Will they merge or not? That is the multibillion-dollar question.

General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Corp. said Thursday they just aren't getting that loving feeling from European regulators about their proposed $42.3 billion  merger - despite a last-ditch bid to save the deal by offering to sell $2.2 billion in assets. While  GE chief executive Jack Welch maintains the companies' divestiture offer is final, European antitrust officials want additional concessions totaling more than double those being proposed by GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., and  Honeywell  in Morristown, N.J.

On Friday, President Bush stepped into the trans-Atlantic catfight by saying he is concerned about Europe's opposition to the deal. Mr. Bush, on the fourth stop of a five-country European tour, said he had raised the deal with European counterparts at the appropriate level.

"We're in a poker game here, and the game is far from over," said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with SG Cowen Securities Corp. in New York. "I don't know whether Europe is going to want to be seen as submarining a big U.S. deal, but it has looked over time that the EU was going to take a hard look at this."
And the cuts keep coming
And you thought Freddy Kruger did a lot of slashing?

On Wednesday, companies running the gamut from film and camera maker Polaroid Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., to dessert queen Sara Lee Corp. in Chicago to semiconductor manufacturer Integrated Device Technology Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif., announced they were slashing jobs.

Also on Wednesday, paper and wood products giant Georgia-Pacific Corp. of Atlanta said it will cut jobs as it closes three plants and curtails production at others. The latest round of layoffs ends a recent lull in job shrinkage.
On Friday, Nortel Networks Inc., which in April announced plans to cut 20,000 jobs, said it is cutting an additional
10,000, and predicted a $19.2 billion second-quarter loss amid slowing demand for its equipment that moves
Internet traffic.

"The second round of layoffs may put downward pressure on consumer confidence," says Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc., an economic advisory firm based in Walnut Creek, Calif. "I think consumers will be a little harder pressed to be as optimistic about the economy."
SEC squeezes firm on margin loans

All-Tech Direct Inc., one of the nation's biggest day trading firms, and some of its executives agreed to shell out more than $600,000 in fines to settle charges of improper loans to customers and false advertising, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday.

Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, which did not admit or deny the allegations, also agreed to hire an independent consultant to review its margin lending, the SEC said.

In a case filed in February, the SEC alleged that All-Tech had made about 100 margin loans over eight months totaling $3.6 million in violation of federal margin lending rules.

Magellan raises stake in tech

Fidelity Investments' $88.7 billion Magellan Fund raised its stake in technology for the first time in eight months and cut its cash holdings in half, according to Boston-based Fidelity's Mutual Fund Guide, released Tuesday.
The world's biggest mutual fund, managed by Robert Stansky, raised its investments in information technology to
13.8% of assets in April, from 11.6% in March. Cash fell to 2.5% of assets in April, from 5.1% in March.

If you want to know what a tough game takeovers are, just ask  GE investors.

The week before the $41 billion  merger with Honeywell  was announced last October,  GE traded up to $55.63. Then comes news of the deal and the stock falls to $49.75. Now, seven months later, after the deal has run into a regulatory wall at the  European Union, the stock is trading for $48.81.
There has to be an easier way to lose 94 cents.

Individual investors could have had it worse. They could have bought Honeywell shares. Those went from $49.94 at the announcement to $38.80 at the standstill.

Even in the arena of smaller mergers, picking a takeover target and making money on it is a very difficult game. Ordinary investors might be tempted to play, because there certainly are plenty of deals on the horizon this year. In South Florida, Catalina Lighting, Sound Advice, Sunglass Hut, the Florida Panthers, Laundromax and Security Technologies have each been bought or sold since February. Mayor's Jewelers is looking for an acquirer, too.

These are middle- and lower-middle market deals, not the kind to make Wall Street stand up and salute. They tend not to be in high-profile industries. That's part of their attraction, considering what the stock market has done to its former glamour boys in telecom and tech. When overall market returns are dull, these companies look interesting and affordable. If initial public offerings have slowed to a trickle, selling becomes one way for a company's owners to raise money.

As a result, interest in middle-market and smaller mergers appears to be strong. Boca Raton's Sun Capital partners, which took a controlling interest in Catalina Lighting of Miami in April, just closed a $200 million
leveraged buyout fund, according to Venture Economics. Even though fund-raising is supposed to be difficult right now, too many investors reportedly wanted into this deal.
This market segment, in fact, seems to have held up during the first half of this year, compared to the
almost-collapse of billion-dollar deals. For smaller buyouts, "I don't know if it's heating up, because it's still a pretty
good market," says Brian Schwartz, managing director of HIG Capital in Miami.

The firm made three deals in the first quarter and the same number so far in the second quarter. It arranged the buyout of such nonglamour companies as an oil recycling firm, a publisher that focuses on the construction trade and a firm that provides outsourced services to semiconductor manufacturers. HIG has $500 million available for leveraged buyouts.

In Florida, nine deals in the $50 to $250 million range have been announced, according to statistics from Securities Data Publishing. That would put the state's pace a bit off last year, when there were on average 10 such announcements every quarter.

Carl Rosten, an attorney at Akerman Senterfitt & Eidson in Miami who handles mergers and acquisitions, says the usual strategic reasons -- big companies want to grow quickly in a niche that a smaller company owns, for example -- are behind the deals now. But there's one more thing -- value. "The market has been so beaten up for small caps, they are so out of favor," he said.

The important players in leveraged buyouts are institutions and very high net worth individuals who are willing to commit money for at least five years to a leveraged buyout fund. They also have to have a big tolerance for risk. They're not your basic mutual-fund types saving for retirement -- and for good reason.

"Most of the time individuals who are trying to play the game are playing based on something Uncle Joe said or what they saw on CNBC," says certified financial planner Ben Tobias of Tobias Financial in Plantation.

Page 94 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Sometimes you might be able to see a company that is going to be a good target down the line, but individuals generally don't have the training to see what that is."

About the only way an individual can get involved with a reasonable amount of risk would be through a small-cap value mutual fund, which would specialize in the type of companies that tend to become takeover targets -- underpriced companies that could be bought for a reasonable sum. One that has done well at this is the Third Avenue Value Fund.

But there's always the question of how patient one must be. "By the time investors get ahold of the rumors, arbitrageurs are getting into it and it may be trading close to where it will be for quite a while," says William Welch, managing director of Fiduciary Asset Management in Boca Raton.
And the question of whether you can win, even if the takeover you expected happens.

Let's say you were an investor in Sunglass Hut and you noticed that the parent company of LensCrafters became interested in sunglasses. It moved into the market mildly at first, then bought a rival manufacturer and, finally, bought Sunglass Hut.

That was a five-year process. If you bought Sunglass Hut at the start hoping for that takeover premium, it wasn't a good experience. The stock was down 69 percent in the first of those five years and down another 54 percent last year.
If you'd bought at the peak last year, you would still have lost 94 cents a share on the buyout offer announced in
February.

It's not always what you pick or why you picked it. Even when you get the right company, if you picked it at the wrong time, you lose.

The rift between Europe and the US over the merger plans of Honeywell  and General Electric  worsened today as EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti pledged to ignore criticism from President Bush, writes Jim Armitage.

Monti has put stringent provisions on  GE's $42 billion (UKpound 30 billion) takeover plans and Bush weighed into the affair last week, saying he was "concerned" that  Europe seemed set to block them.

However, Monti today struck back against what he described as "political interference" and gave a straight "no" when asked whether Bush's intervention would be taken into consideration.

The US President's words were spurred by the timing of GE's announcement that European regulators were putting the deal in peril, which came on Friday, shortly before he arrived in Gothenburg to meet European leaders.
Monti said today: "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention." Document krtbn00020010712dx6i00tz5

NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - Honeywell  International Inc.said on Monday its board of directors remained committed to completing a $41.8 billion merger with General Electric  Co., despite mounting  European               regulatory opposition to the deal.

The Morris Township, New Jersey-based transportation and aviation products company said in a prepared statement that it expects  GE will "do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction."
The comments followed a meeting of the company's board Monday, when directors discussed GE and
Honeywell's decision last week to submit a "final" offer of concessions to the European Union that fell well short of
divestitures sought by officials there.

Since that time, GE officials have expressed skepticism that the merger, already approved by U.S. regulatory officials, would gain EU approval. But they have refused to close the door entirely on a possible resolution. The EU has until July 12 to make a ruling on the merger.

European Commission's Action  to Block  GE-Honeywell Merger Spells Bad News For Consumers, According to Investment Manager William Rutherford

E.C. Seeks to Limit U.S. Competitiveness and Export 'European Malaise'

PORTLAND, Ore., June 18 /PRNewswire/ -- The  European Commission's attempt to block the merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  aims to impose and preserve the competitiveness of European corporations at the expense of consumers, according to William D. Rutherford, head of Rutherford Investment Management.

"The E.C.'s effort to quash another merger among American companies -- the second in a year after the Worldcom-Sprint -- is clear evidence that the E.C. is exercising excessive influence over the U.S. economy," Rutherford said. "The E.C.'s actions strongly suggest that it is trying to help moribund European companies stay competitive by curtailing U.S. economic expansion."

Rutherford added, "With Europe burdened by a torpid economy, low productivity and a chronically high unemployment rate, the E.C. seems bent on exporting its malaise to the rest of the world."

He noted that U.S. companies are expected to focus on price containment and quality improvement as efficient ways to deliver products to consumers. "The E.C. should look for ways to be more efficient, not more protective, if benefiting consumers is truly their goal," he said.

Rutherford also remarked that "E.C. Commissioner Monti wants to impose the will of the state, although state-run economies have repeatedly failed to deliver meaningful economic growth." He pointed out that the advantages of
a market-run economy are easily demonstrated by the fact that the state of California has a greater economy than
France, although France's population is nearly twice as large.

Funds face $3bn loss in GE and Honeywell  share sell-off  - General Electric.

SHARES in General Electric  and Honeywell,  whose $42 billion ( #30 billion)  merger is being blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds, are set to come under further pressure this week as hedge funds start to unwind positions in the two companies.
Hedge funds and investment banks face losses of at least $3 billion after it became clear last week that Mario
Monti, the EU Competition Commissioner, is likely to block the  merger.

Risk arbitrageurs, or arbs, make money by exploiting the difference in share prices between two companies involved in a merger or acquisition. The most commonly used investment technique is to buy the shares of the target company, and sell short the shares of the acquirer in the expectation of buying them back more cheaply later.

But that strategy can lead to substantial losses if a takeover is blocked or abandoned, or if the terms are revised suddenly. Analysts estimate that between one quarter and one third of the outstanding stock in Honeywell, some
200 million to 300 million shares, was in the hands of arbs as recently as a week ago. Faced with the prospect of the deal failing, many hedge funds scrambled to unwind their positions last week, selling Honeywell and buying back shares in GE to cover their short positions. With the EU's move sending shares in GE higher, and those in Honeywell down by more than 12 per cent, arbs who closed the trade were left facing huge losses.

One London-based hedge fund manager, who admitted to losing money on the transaction, said that he knew of three institutions alone that had lost a combined $1 billion after closing their positions on Thursday. Based on the scale of the arbitrage trade among the international hedge fund community, the losses are expected to reach $3 billion.

Global mergers and acquisitions activity has slowed to a trickle this year amid the worldwide downturn in stock markets. This meant that the GE/Honeywell deal - the world's biggest industrial takeover to date - had been eagerly played by hedge funds as one of the few surefire arbitrage opportunities.

The biggest arb players in the London investment banking community include Goldman Sachs, UBS Warburg and Credit Suisse First Boston, all of which are thought to have suffered last week. BNP Paribas, the French investment bank with a large proprietary trading desk, is said to be among the casualties.

Losses of $3 billion would put GE/Honeywell second only behind Ciena/Tellabs in the league of the world's costliest failed arbitrage trades. That deal, the proposed 1998 merger between two US technology companies, is understood to have lost hedge funds between $4 billion and $5 billion. It would also eclipse the losses sustained on the aborted 1997 takeover of MCI by British Telecom. The unravelling of that deal - the hit from which is put at between $1 billion and $2 billion - led to the eventual demise of some hedge funds, and was seen as instrumental in propelling a severely weakened Salomon Brothers into the arms of Citigroup.

More recently arbs were stung by the surprise 1999 bid by Bank of Scotland for NatWest, which scuppered the latter's proposed takeover of Legal & General. Hedge funds were forced to cover short positions in NatWest and sell L&G, at an estimated cost of #600 million.

Honeywell  Still Committed to GE Merger Despite European Objections

NEWARK, N.J. -- Honeywell  International Corp. on Monday reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with General Electric  Co., despite objections by  European Union regulators with competition concerns about the $41-billion merger.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township, N.J., headquarters.

The board was reviewing "a broad range of contingency" plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronics and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from GE
competitor United Technologies Corp., and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies, which pursued Honeywell until GE swooped in with a better offer, declined to comment Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.
Shares of Honeywell rose $1.30, or 3%, to close at $40 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where GE
rose 19 cents to close at $49.

WSJ: EU Recommends Formal Block Of GE-Honeywell  Deal
By Philip Shishkin and Laurie Cohen
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- -European antitrust enforcers have recommended formally blocking  General            Electric Co.'s (GE) bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc. (HON), moving closer to officially ending the companies' embattled quest for regulatory approval,  people familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal.

In a draft decision prepared earlier this week, the EuropeanCommission's Merger Task Force deemed  GE's latest proposals to win  antitrust approval  as insufficient and confirmed that the company's proposed $41 billion acquisition will not be allowed to go through in its current form. If the two sides are unable to bridge their differences, the Merger Task Force's draft decision would proceed to the  European Commission's College of Commissioners for final  approval.
(This report and related background will be available at the Journal's Web site, WSJ.com.)

The draft decision means that the number of scenarios under which the deal could still survive is rapidly diminishing. It also signals that the commission is unlikely to suddenly change its mind about a deal that it fears could create an aerospace juggernaut capable of undercutting competition in the industry.

Last Thursday, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti asked GE officials and lawyers in a phone conversation to withdraw the application for antitrust approval so that the EU wouldn't have to reject it, according to several people familiar with the situation. GE was open to that, but deferred to Honeywell, these people said.

Honeywell's general counsel Peter Krindlin, who is being advised by attorney James Venit of Skadden Arps in Brussels, told GE that Honeywell opposed pulling the deal, because it believed it might still pressure Monti to soften his stance, these people said. GE went along. Under the terms of the merger agreement, should GE unilaterally terminate the agreement, Honeywell could sue to enforce the merger pact.

A GE spokeswoman said Tuesday there was no tension between GE and Honeywell as the two companies forge ahead with the merger process, even though people close to Honeywell have said some executives and board members are disgruntled that GE isn't pushing harder for approval.

"We're on the same page," said the GE spokeswoman, Louise Binns. "The final undertakings were submitted by GE and Honeywell. We remain fully committed to the final proposal we have submitted." She said GE "will be continuing to communicate with [European Union] member states to outline the merits of our proposal and the reasons we believe our final offer is sufficient."

A Honeywell spokesman, Tom Crane, said: "We're still committed to the merger and we expect GE to continue working with the EU over the next three weeks to complete the transaction."

GE and Honeywell could still come back to the negotiating table and offer more divestitures of businesses to the European antitrust enforcers. If those offers were clear-cut enough and satisfied all competition concerns, the commission could accept them and reconsider its determination to kill the merger, which has already been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice.

But GE's top executives have said repeatedly that it is through negotiating and they are not going to raise the company's offer, officially submitted to the commission last Thursday. In that proposal, GE offered to sell several Honeywell units with combined annual sales of $2.2 billion and offered to introduce separate management for GE

Page 103 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Capital Aviation Services, known as Gecas, the company's powerful aircraft financing and leasing arm. (The commission charges that Gecas promotes GE's equipment to the detriment of competitors. Commission officials continue to seek a remedy that would render such promotion more difficult.)

But the commission deemed GE's offer insufficient and asked the company either to sell more of Honeywell's core businesses or to come up with a more far-reaching remedy to separate Gecas. GE balked at demands for greater divestitures and also rejected any measures that would leave it with less than 100% ownership of Gecas.

GE's negotiators argue that the commission's analysis of the deal has been based on shaky economic theories which have led it to conclude, erroneously, GE says, that the combined company would be able to push its weaker rivals out of the market.

The apparent divergence of opinion between U.S. authorities, which have already approved the deal, and their more demanding European counterparts has triggered a litany of statements from U.S. government officials and business executives accusing the commission of unfair interference with American business. Faced with this criticism, Monti said on Monday that the commission's investigation "is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Earlier this week, the commission circulated some of GE's proposed antitrust remedies to rivals of GE and Honeywell to get some feedback on their validity. However, this consultation doesn't constitute an official market test, which the commission would typically do to confirm with competitors that certain antitrust remedies would be sufficient.

"It's more of a procedural step," one person familiar with the situation said about the consultation. In fact, the commission isn't even mentioning in its industry consultation Gecas as one of the antitrust remedies, because it has already decided that GE's proposal to "ring-fence" the management and administrative functions of the leasing unit doesn't go far enough. Instead, industry feedback is being sought on the commercial viability of several of Honeywell's units that GE has offered to sell. The commission still thinks that these units have little chance of surviving on their own because they would be "carved out" from a larger chunk of Honeywell business.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The European Commission appeared to narrow the distance today between what General Electric  (GE) has offered and what the commission demanded for its  approval  of a $45 billion  merger with Honeywell  International (HON), the New York Times reports in its Tuesday edition.

In a statement, the  commission said it would accept an offer short of a sale of the aircraft leasing unit, G.E. Capital Aviation Services, the Times reported.

The statement repeated the commission's demand for a structural commitment to change the way the unit operates, but added "without putting in question the control by G.E.," the Times said.

EU rejects U.S. call to approve GE deal: 'A matter of law and economics, not politics,' official says

BRUSSELS - Mario Monti, European competition commissioner, yesterday rebuffed U.S. political pressure to
approve General Electric  Corp.'s US$45-billion bid for Honeywell  International Inc.

George W. Bush, the U.S. President, said last week he is "concerned" the European Commission will reject the merger after General Electric  said its offer to scale back its aerospace business stopped short of regulators' demands.

Political interference will have "no impact on the commission whatsoever," Mr. Monti said. "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention. This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

He urged General Electric last week to return to the negotiating table. The stronger language used yesterday suggests he is prepared to act alone to block an all-U.S. merger for the first time.

General Electric proposed selling businesses with US$2.2- billion in sales and separating accounts at its aircraft-leasing unit to ease concern it would dominate the aerospace products market.
The commission, the 15-nation European Union's regulatory agency, has until July 12 to rule on the merger. Rejection would mark the first time the EU has acted on its own to kill a U.S. transaction. U.S. regulators last year
blocked an all-European takeover that had obtained EU clearance when they ruled against Air Liquide SA's
purchase of BOC Group PLC.

Mr. Bush said he was concerned the EU would overrule the transaction after it was approved by U.S. regulators. Don Evans, U.S. Commerce Secretary, said approval of the takeover would be a positive sign for world trade. Both stopped short of threatening sanctions or retribution.

Engine makers United Technologies Corp. and Rolls-Royce PLC and avionics maker Rockwell International Corp. lobbied against the acquisition.

The companies said their earnings would be hurt by General Electric's ability to cut prices by combining sales of aerospace engines, cockpit controls and the credit often needed to finance purchases.

The merger has raised "strong concerns" among suppliers and customers on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Monti said in a statement. Several U.S. firms complained and took an active role at a hearing organized by the commission at the end of May, he said.

The commission said GE could have made smaller divestments in the aerospace industry than originally offered as long as it made "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behaviour" of the plane-leasing unit known as Gecas.

Analysts say there is still a chance to get the merger approved, although it would require concessions from both sides. Although the deadline has passed for formal remedies to be submitted by the companies, they can still fine-tune their existing offer.

Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman-elect, who all but declared the purchase dead and said the company is planning its future without Honeywell, ruled out further concessions on Saturday.

The commission dismissed suggestions Airbus Industrie, the European plane-making rival to Boeing Co., had sought to block General Electric's purchase.

The commission's competition department is circulating a confidential report detailing General Electric's concessions to customers and competitors. Once it has completed that, it will meet with an advisory committee of representatives of antitrust offices of the 15 EU member states. A final decision on the takeover will be sent to commissioners on July 4 for ruling. U.S. and Canadian authorities have given their tentative approval to the takeover.

EU official denies merger rift

LJUBLJANA, Slovenia - Denying a trans-Atlantic trade rift was developing, the European Union's top antitrust regulator said Monday that Europeans  were not the only ones with reservations about General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference the proposed deal "has raised strong concerns" among airlines on both side of the Atlantic.

Without naming names, he said several U.S. firms complained and took an "active role" at the EU Commission hearing held last month on the proposed deal.
"This is not a trans-Atlantic dispute," he said.
Although it won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU
regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions more than GE has offered.

GE said the EU had rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient. GE said it was not optimistic about winning EU approval.

Honeywell is willing to stick with GE, however. In a statement late Monday, Honeywell's board reaffirmed its commitment to the deal.

Stressing that the case has not been decided yet - the deadline for an EU decision is July 12 - Monti expressed anger about what he termed "attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention.

"This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has no impact on the commission whatsoever," he said. "This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

He added that for 10 years, the EU office has had a "very close and constructive cooperation" with U.S. regulators. He said he was recently in touch with the new Bush administration appointees and "expressed my willingness to work with them and intensify cooperation."
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a briefing Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the
EU's opposition.

JAN HOPKINS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: General Electric  (URL: http://www.ge.com/) seems to be throwing in the towel on its planned  merger with Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) . GE`s president, Jeffrey Immelt tells a French newspaper, there is, quote, "zero" chance the $41 billion merger will be approved by European regulators.

Joining me now with more is Andrew Hill, he`s New York bureau chief at the Financial Times. Welcome, Andrew, and-- what`s new this afternoon?

ANDREW HILL, FINANCIAL TIMES: Well, the news is not good for the GE- Honeywell deal. As you say, they opened the day with Le Monde, the French newspaper, saying Jeffrey Immelt said there was nil a chance of this deal being approved. And the news from Brussels is that the European Commission has actually already sent out its proposal to block this merger to the member states. The procedure is that it has to run this by all the members of the European Union, and that makes it very difficult to claw this back and salvage something from it.

Officially, GE is saying it is still committed to it. They have until July 12 officially in Brussels to look at this. And Honeywell obviously, which has far more to lose, as we`ve seen from the share price movements today, if the deal doesn`t come off, is also saying that it`s committed, and it`s urging GE, saying it expects GE to press for regulatory approval. That`s all the official side.
On the unofficial side, as you say, things are looking pretty dim.

HOPKINS: Now, it`s interesting. We`re having a quote from Jeffrey Immelt, not from Jack Welch. I mean, has he really backed away?

HILL: Well, Welch is the one who stayed on, as you know, to push this deal through-- and he was talking for the first time on Friday about this, and suggesting-- really talking about this deal in the past tense, as though that it was something he`d have liked to have done, but he wasn`t going to do-- it wasn`t going to be able to do it on
his terms.

I wouldn`t have said he`s backed away, in the sense that he`s still there, he`s still the chairman and chief executive. Immelt is the one who still in Europe, of course. Everybody else -- all the negotiators, and Welch, himself -- have come back to the U.S. Immelt is there for the Paris Air Show striking various deals. There`s no suggestion that he`s doing any negotiating. He just happens to be the public face of GE at the moment in Europe.

HOPKINS: What about Honeywell? It- clearly- is the loser in this. What are the options for the company at this point -- United Technologies (URL:  http://www.utc.com/) ?

HILL: Well, clearly, Honeywell-- nobody has any reason to withdraw this bid at the moment. They might as well stay till the end and hope that there may be some change of heart in Brussels. It also gives time another two or three weeks for Honeywell to think to itself, what can it do next if the deal doesn`t work out. And they say they have contingency plans.

The basic options are potentially being taken over by somebody else. United Technologies was the original bidder that was trumped by the GE bid. They could come back in. They also have -- although they haven`t explicitly said this -- a number of businesses that they were planning to sell off, before the GE bid. They could obviously put those on the block, and push through a bit more restructuring.



Page 110 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But clearly, the share price is indicating that people think the deal isn`t going to go through, and they`ll have to find some way of exciting investors with an alternative.

STEPHEN LEEB: Andrew, this is Stephen Leeb. Is it possible --GE, after all, made this bid for Honeywell very quickly, to snatch Honeywell away from UTX .
HILL: That`s right.

LEEB: .who was trying to buy Honeywell. Is it possible, as GE went along, they found out that they were getting a little bit less than they originally bargained for? And Jack Welch wanted a graceful way out-- and therefore, struck a very, very tough bargaining position with the EU, and sort of got them to say, no, you can`t merge-- instead of Jack Welch saying, no, I don`t want to merge -
HILL: Right.

LEEB: Which is a much more graceful way of leaving. And also, as Dan was saying with you, it might say something bad about Honeywell--maybe Honeywell is not worth very much.

HILL: Well, I mean, clearly, that`s a possibility-- but it`s a pretty faint one-- because up until relatively recently, GE was adding to the number of savings that it thought it could get. It says it could get $3 billion of synergies from this deal. They`ve been very bullish, in public and private, about the benefits of the deal, even saying that they discovered a sort of hidden jewel in the industrial controls` business of Honeywell-- to add to the main reason for doing the deal, which was the aerospace business.
So I think it would be strange now to be using this as a particular way of getting out of the deal. Having said that, clearly, Honeywell has had its share of problems, many
of which have emerged since the deal was launched. And they`ve had to push through cost savings of their own. So there is clearly a problem for Honeywell. I don`t think necessarily that the GE move here is just an attempt to get out of the deal. I think really, Jack Welch has committed a lot to this. They`d obviously made a lot of strides towards integrating and getting ready for integration. He`s disappointed not to be doing the deal, and I don`t think he`s just using the EU as an excuse.
HOPKINS: Thanks very much. Andrew Hill. HILL: Thank you.
HOPKINS: New York bureau chief of the Financial Times.

Europeans  back off demands on GE deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Commission appeared on Monday to narrow the distance between what General Electric  has offered and what the commission has demanded for approval  of GE's $45 billion aerospace merger with Honeywell  International.

In a statement, the  commission said it would accept an offer short of a sale of its aircraft leasing unit,  GE Capital Aviation Services. Some people close to the  commission have said that the  European regulators wanted General Electric  to sell or spin off the unit outright.

The statement on Monday repeated the commission's demand for a commitment to change the way the unit operates, but added "without putting in question the control by GE."
Some people close to the commission interpreted the statement as a conciliatory move.

"It is a fig leaf; Mr. Monti is backing down," said one lawyer who has acted on behalf the commission's competition authority in the past.

Far from shrugging off the political noise of recent days, Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, "has woken up to the unavoidable political fallout that his tough stance is provoking," he said.
Monti, meanwhile, responded sharply to recent comments on the deal by President Bush and others, saying on
Monday, "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention."

Monti said criticism of the commission was "not only unjustified but hard to understand, since the case has not been decided yet."

GE DEAL REMAINS FOCUS OF COMPANY

NEWARK, N.J. --  Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with  General   Electric  Co. Monday, despite objections by  European Union regulators with competition concerns about the
$41 billion merger.

Honeywell's  board of directors ``expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction,'' the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The board was reviewing ``a broad range of contingency'' plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronics and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from GE
competitor United Technologies Inc. and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers.
``Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares,'' said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, ``Honeywell would face significant challenges,'' including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., which pursued Honeywell until GE swooped in with a better offer, did not return a telephone message on Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell, formed in December 1999 by the merger of Honeywell and Morris Township-based AlliedSignal, already had begun to streamline. It announced 6,500 job cuts earlier this year and made plans last year to merge its polymers and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

Shares of Honeywell rose $1.30, or 3 percent, to $40 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of GE rose 19 cents to $49.

Also Monday, the European Union's top antitrust regulator said that Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about General Electric Co.'s proposed $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said at a news conference the proposed deal ``has raised strong concerns'' among airlines on both side of the Atlantic.

Without naming names, he said several U.S. firms complained and took an active role at the EU Commission hearing held last month on the proposed deal.

``This is not a trans-Atlantic dispute,'' he said. ``There have been concerns expressed both by customers and competitors on both sides.''

SMARTMONEY.COM: Let's Just Call It What It Is

MEMO TO GEORGE BUSH: Forget missile defense and Kyoto for the time being. If you really want to pick a fight with the  Europeans,  take up the  European Commission's Merger Task Force, which has anointed itself the
final arbiter of proposed mergers between American companies and is now threatening to derail  General             Electric's (GE) acquisition of  Honeywell  International (HON).

No matter that the U.S. Justice Department and Canadian regulators approved the deal with only minor concessions. This wasn't simply a new laissez-faire approach from a Republican administration, either. Many of the Justice Department lawyers reviewing the case were Clinton-era holdovers. Now Attorney General John Ashcroft has made a direct plea to the EC to salvage the deal, a move immediately rebuffed by the EC on grounds that it doesn't consider "political" influence.

But what about simple economics? The Justice Department concluded that GE and Honeywell were direct competitors in surprisingly few businesses. The Europeans appear to have raised the most strenuous objections over GE's powerful aircraft-financing and -leasing division and Honeywell's high-tech avionics segment, which makes safety devices such as ground-warning systems. But in neither of these areas do GE and Honeywell compete. This isn't the kind of "horizontal" merger and elimination of a competitor that the antitrust laws were meant to prevent.

The Europeans, however, have purportedly expressed fears that once GE owned Honeywell, its leasing and financing arm would buy only Honeywell products, to the exclusion of European competitors such as Rolls-Royce of Britain and Thales of France, a distant rival to Honeywell's avionics unit. But this is "vertical" integration, and both economics and experience have shown that if companies favor their own suppliers, they soon succumb to other competitors who seek the highest quality goods and services at the best price.

The only exception is existing monopolies that seek to extend their dominance, as Microsoft (MSFT) was accused of doing in the browser market. GE is a huge company, but unlike Microsoft, no one has yet claimed that it's a monopoly.

What's really going on here? Remember the European opposition to the WorldCom (WCOM)-Sprint (FON) merger, which effectively scuttled that deal? European companies like Deutsche Telekom (DT) and France Telecom (FTE) didn't want more competition from a rival strong in both Internet data transmission (WorldCom) and wireless (Sprint) even though neither was a serious competitor to the other in either business. The Europeans seem to be especially touchy about telecommunications and aerospace - witness the billions they've poured into Airbus Industrie over the years.

The EC barely approved the Boeing (BA)-McDonald-Douglas merger a few years ago, and you can bet that was because the merger eliminated one of Airbus's competitiors. This is old-fashioned nationalistic protectionism, pure and simple.

Readers of this column know that I'm something of a hawk on the subject of antitrust enforcement, having raised concerns about Microsoft's behavior and such combinations as JDS Uniphase (JDSU) and SDL (see story). But the EC's opposition to GE's acquisition of Honeywell is an affront to economics, fair play, free trade and the global economy.

Ironically, as I've noted before, the immediate stock-market reaction to a failed merger may be positive. GE shares rose on news the deal was in trouble because there will be a short-term boost to earnings. The worst scenario for GE investors would be for GE to complete the merger, but on terms that eliminate all the long-term advantages of the deal. (I recommended GE in this column after the deal was first announced.) Honeywell shares plunged, but may recover on further takeover speculation. (I never recommend investing on such speculation.) I seriously doubt that the EC will have any reservations should a European bidder emerge.

EC 'will not bow to pressure' on 32bn pound bid

(Copyright 2001)
THE European Commission said it will not be swayed by political pressure to  approve General Electric's pounds 32 billion bid for Honeywell  International, and is assessing the case on the economic merits.
US President George W Bush last week said he was "concerned" that the  commission would reject the merger
- the biggest industrial  merger ever - after General Electric  disclosed that its offer of concessions stopped short
of regulators' demands.

General Electric proposed selling businesses worth GBP 1.57bn and separating accounts at its aircraft-leasing unit to ease concern it would dominate the aerospace products market. The commission has until July 12 to rule on the merger.

Political interference would have "no impact on the commission whatsoever", commissioner Mario Monti said. "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention. This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Both Mr Bush and US commerce secretary Don Evans commented on the case last week. Mr Bush said he was concerned the EU would overrule the transaction after it was approved by US regulators, while Mr Evans said approval of the takeover would be a positive sign for world trade. Both stopped short of threatening sanctions or retribution.
US and Canadian authorities already have given their tentative approval to the General Electric takeover.

The merger has raised "strong concerns" among suppliers and customers on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr Monti said.

GE's Immelt sees no chance of Honeywell  deal going ahead

PARIS (AP) -  General Electric  Co. president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's dlrs 41 billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from  European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians," he said.

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

Immelt, who was in Paris this weekend to visit the Paris Air Show, told Le Monde that GE's position "is so far removed from the European Commission's that we don't think it's wise to make a political matter out of it."

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

On Monday, the EU's top antitrust regulator said the Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about the merger.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines on both sides of the Atlantic.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a briefing Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the
EU's opposition.

"Obviously we're disappointed," Zoellick said. "The U.S. antitrust authorities approved the deal. We certainly respect the sovereign EU process in terms of its review."
"If it ends up this way, it's an unfortunate result," he said.

PARIS (AP) - European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General

The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win  antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The head of a committee investigating tire safety said Tuesday that he has data that shows Ford Motor Co. is replacing Firestone tires with other brands that fail more often, but refused to make the information public.
House Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., said he wanted to give federal highway safety
experts time to review the confidential information that the committee collected before revealing which companies
had the higher failure rates.

Tauzin said congressional investigators analyzed the failure rates of replacement tires Ford is using and found that some fail more often than the Firestone Wilderness AT tires Ford recalled last month. The replacement tires are made by Michelin, Continental, Goodyear, General, BF Goodrich and Uniroyal.

LISLE, Ill. (AP) - Troubled telecommunications giant Tellabs Inc. warned Tuesday that second-quarter sales will fall 35 percent to 40 percent below expectations as demand for equipment continues to plummet.

The statement, which came after markets closed, was the latest evidence of major struggles in the once high-flying telecoms industry.

Tellabs now projects sales for the quarter of $500 million, down from previous estimates of $780 million to $820 million, and says earnings per share will just break even, excluding restructuring and other charges.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had estimated earnings of 29 cents a share, down from 39 cents a year ago.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department wants to settle its drawn-out civil lawsuit seeking damages from tobacco companies, government officials said Tuesday, in a move that appeared to take the industry by surprise.

Page 120 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Two Bush administration sources said there has been concern about the government's case. These officials, discussing the matter only on grounds of anonymity, said the department would prefer to go for a settlement now rather than risk losing.

The department suffered a major setback last year when the judge hearing the case - U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler - dismissed two counts which would have allowed the government to recover some expenses related to sick smokers.
The suit was filed in September 1999. Under the leadership of then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Justice
Department said at the time that federal health care plans spend more than $20 billion a year treating
smoking-related illnesses. It said those costs should be recovered.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing construction dipped in May but remains at a healthy level, further evidence of the industry's resilience in the face of a faltering national economy.

The number of new housing units builders began work on last month dipped by 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.62 million, following a strong 2.3 percent increase in April, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.

Even with May's decline, which was smaller than many analysts were expecting, the level of housing starts remained solid, economists said.

Even as the rest of the economy has slowed markedly since the second half of last year, housing activity has remained stable, thanks to low mortgage rates and falling interest rates in general.

NEW YORK (AP) - A steep drop in its investment banking business depressed second-quarter earnings at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., but the brokerage giant's profits still managed to meet analysts' expectations.

Rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. fared better, topping Wall Street's profit estimates thanks in part to a rise in its debt underwriting and capital markets businesses.
Goldman Sachs earned $577 million, or $1.06 a share in the quarter ended May 25, compared with earnings of
$755 million, or $1.48 a share, in the same period a year ago.

Lehman earned $430 million, or $1.38 a share, in the quarter ended May 31, compared with earnings of $378 million, or $1.39 a share, in the same period a year ago.

BOSTON (AP) - The Boston Globe said that 193 employees had accepted the paper's voluntary buyout offers, enough "to put aside the possibility of layoffs."
The buyouts were offered as part of cost-cutting program announced in April by the Globe's parent company, The
New York Times Co. The Globe had allowed for layoffs if it failed to reach staffing goals after the buyouts, but
they won't be necessary, according to publisher Richard H. Gilman.

The news came as The New York Times Co. said it would be cutting up to 9 percent of its work force of 14,000 this year as it contends with declining advertising revenue. Nevertheless, the New York-based company said Monday it still expects to meet Wall Street earnings expectations for both the coming quarter and the year.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Accounting titan Arthur Andersen LLP has agreed to pay a $7 million civil fine to settle federal regulators' allegations it issued false and misleading audit reports that inflated a company's earnings by more than $1 billion.

In a civil lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Andersen "knowingly or recklessly" issued false and misleading audit reports for Waste Management Inc. for the years 1993 through 1996.


Page 121 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Andersen neither admitted to nor denied the allegations in its settlement with the SEC regarding audits of Waste Management, which also was announced Tuesday. The SEC said the fine was the largest ever paid by a Big Five accounting firm in an enforcement action brought by the market watchdog agency.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate plunged into debate Tuesday on long-delayed legislation to combat HMO horror stories and squared off instantly in a partisan struggle. Republicans sought to slow action, and Majority Leader Tom Daschle vowed to "stay on this bill for whatever length it takes."

The maneuvering unfolded as House Republicans, struggling to gain control over a politically popular issue, weighed a concession in the critical area of patient lawsuits. GOP officials said discussions were under way on a proposal that would include a limited new right to sue in state court.

Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., called key lawmakers to his office for an evening meeting on the subject. Rep. Ernest Fletcher, R-Ky., said that under the proposal, HMOs would be open to state court suits - and punitive damages - if they refused to honor pro-patient decisions made by outside experts.

EU regulators reportedly ready to block GE-Honeywell  deal; GE's Immelt sees no chance of deal approval

PARIS (AP) - European regulators have reportedly recommended that the $41 billion  merger between General
Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc. be blocked.

The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Tuesday that the  European Commission's Merger Task Force said GE's efforts to win  antitrust approval  were "insufficient."

Citing unnamed people familiar with the deal, the newspaper said the task force will forward its draft decision to the EC's College of Commissioners for final approval unless the companies can come up with a different merger plan.

The EU must decide by July 12 whether or not to approve the deal. It has expressed concern that a combined GE-Honeywell will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

GE president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published earlier Tuesday there was "zero" chance his company's $41 billion merger with U.S. technology firm Honeywell International Inc. would go ahead.

"The indications we have from the European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted," Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from European regulators.

"The percentage is zero," he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $1.50 a share, or 3.8 percent, and closed at $38.50, while GE shares fell 13 cents to close at $48.87.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political maneuver, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.

"General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem," Immelt said. "This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to politicians."

"We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally," he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

In midday trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Honeywell shares were down $2.05 a share, or 5.1 percent, to $37.95 while GE shares rose 17 cents to $49.17.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines and aircraft equipment makers on both sides of the Atlantic.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said in a briefing Monday in Washington he was disappointed by the
EU's opposition.

"Obviously we're disappointed," Zoellick said. "The U.S. antitrust authorities approved the deal. We certainly respect the sovereign EU process in terms of its review."

STOCK TO WATCH: HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL

The ballyhooed $45 billion  merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International seemed to be dying a slow death last week. Although the deal ran into no antitrust problems at the U.S. Justice Department or its Canadian equivalent, the  Commission of the European Union is setting tough conditions for its  approval. General Electric  last week made significant concessions to the Europeans,  but on Thursday the two companies said they were not optimistic that the  European Commission will approve their merger. The Commission has until July 12 to announce its decision.

Meanwhile the CEOs of both Honeywell and General Electric last week were whistling past the graveyard of a failed merger. Honeywell CEO Michael Bonsignore said, "While continuing to support the merger, we have a comprehensive contingency plan in place if we must move forward as an independent company." General Electric's Jack Welch, who postponed his retirement to wrap up GE's biggest merger, said that despite the global economic slowdown, "GE remains confident that 2001, with or without Honeywell, will be another record year of double digit operating earnings growth."

If the merger falls through, the damage will be greater for Morris Township-based Honeywell than for General Electric. As expectations of a deal have faded, Honeywell shares have been sliding for several weeks, and that fall accelerated last week. Honeywell's stock opened the week at $45.25, but closed at $38.80. If the merger collapses, analysts say Honeywell's shares are headed for a steeper fall, toward the low-30s and high 20s in the short term. Honeywell shares touched a high of $55.18 last December.

The European Union's antitrust department is worried about GE's economic power in the aviation business after a merger. One area of particular concern is the combined power of the two companies in aircraft leasing. General Electric's Capital Aviation Services is already the biggest aircraft leasing company in the world. GE's offer to
divest assets with as much as $3 billion in annual revenues was not enough for the Europeans.

Welch flew to Brussels at midweek to take part personally in the negotiations, but said after the stalemate developed, "The European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined."

Last October, General Electric outbid United Technologies, a Hartford, Connecticut maker of hightech products and support services for the building systems and the aerospace industries, in the race to get Honeywell. GE's
$45 billion offer was about $5 billion higher than the United Technologies bid. The stockswap deal had been expected to close by early this year until it became obvious that it was running into antitrust hurdles in Europe.

If the GE deal dies, market watchers expect United Technologies to revisit its offer. Matthew Collins, an analyst at Edward Jones who follows Honeywell, says Honeywell is vulnerable position since United Technologies could lower its original offer. Collins says if GE walks away from the merger, there is further downside risk for Honeywell shareholders.

On the other hand, Farukh Farooqi, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities, says United Technologies may find Honeywell more attractive today. He points out that Honeywell's management has been preparing for a merger for the last eight months, making it a better run company today.
Few people see Honeywell surviving as a stand-alone company. "It would be tough going for Honeywell," says
Farooqi, despite the company's still strong core businesses-aerospace and automation and control systems.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said after a directors' meeting at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by General Electric faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.

BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE N.E.W. SHOW: Even the president of GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) believes there`s "zero" chance of the deal to buy  Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) will get the green light from  European regulators.

PATRICIA SABGA, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE N.E.W. SHOW: Joining us now with the latest, is Robert Thomson of the "Financial Times." Robert, we understand you scored quite an important interview in this ongoing  merger saga.

ROBERT THOMSON, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES: That`s right. We had an interview today with Mike Bonsignore, the chief executive and chairman of Honeywell. Now, he is still confident that there is enough of a concession on the table to the Commission that the deal will ultimately be approved. Now-- however, we hear that the Commission has already circulated to member governments in Europe, a draft decision that it intends to formally reject the agreed merger between GE and Honeywell. So that`s a big setback for Mr. Bonsignore and Honeywell.
FRANCIS: Why is it-- do we see this disconnect between what Bonsignore says, and Immelt of GE says? THOMSON: Well, certainly it`s in Honeywell`s interest to believe, if not to trust --
FRANCIS: Well, after all, it was in GE`s interest until last week-- Jack Welch was sweating bullets over this one, licking his chops--over $3 billion in savings, right?

THOMSON: Oh, absolutely, Bruce. Now, clearly, there are all sorts of strategies in play here-- strategies in the interests of Honeywell, of GE, of the Commission, of opponents to the deal. But it certainly does seem that there is a bit of a disconnect between GE and Honeywell. Honeywell`s statement yesterday was a definite encouragement to GE to push on. But as I say, this draft decision from the Commission is a definite setback. It`s not the formal final decision, but they`re already alerting other European governments that this is not going to get approval, unless something dramatic happens in the meantime.
And the contradiction there for Mr. Bonsignore is that, he says that if the Commission exams closely the
already-made concessions, that there is enough there for them to give the green light. Now, the Commission is
saying, definitely, no, to that.

SABGA: Robert, once the European Commission actually circulates a draft, how likely is it that they`re going to change their mind between now and the due date in July?

THOMSON: Well, it would have to be something material that it hasn`t yet considered. Maybe they-- you know, maybe they could reinterpret the concessions already made-- but it would be pretty unusual for them to go back and say, well, actually we`ve made a mistake. We approve this deal. It would have to be a further concession or something out of the blue, to be honest.

Now, one other thing to watch here is that-- we hear that there was a meeting of aerospace companies, both U.S. and European, on May 14, before the formal hearings by the Commission, and that`s pretty unusual-- that there was collaboration between. among those companies about how to present evidence, so that their statements did not contradict each other. I think that meeting is going to become the subject of some controversy.

FRANCIS: Yes-- unusual or, perhaps, illegal-- does that constitute collusion, if we`re just talking about not necessarily setting prices or policies, but just getting the story straight to present to regulators-- is that illegal collusion in Europe?

Page 136 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
THOMSON: Not unprecedented-- probably not illegal-- but definitely a little bit unusual, and it will be interesting when the names of those companies are formally release-- and obviously we`re checking on them now-- to see who was in the line-up-- because one of the perceptions here is that this is basically Europe against the U.S. deal--that European aerospace companies have been colluding. Now I think we`ll find that there are at least a couple of U.S. companies at the meeting.
FRANCIS: We will remain glued to our FT, Robert. Thank you so much. Robert Thomson of the Financial Times. TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE

PARIS (AP) _  General Electric  Co. president Jeffrey Immelt said in an interview published Tuesday there was
``zero'' chance his company's $41-billion  merger with U.S. technology firm  Honeywell  International Inc. would go
ahead.

``The indications we have from the  European Commission lead us to think the offer won't be accepted,'' Immelt told the French daily Le Monde, referring to the executive arm of the 15-country  European Union. The deal has so far failed to win clearance from  European regulators.

``The percentage is zero,'' he said when asked to estimate the chances of a successful conclusion to the proposed acquisition, which would create one of the world's largest industrial companies.

Immelt is due to take over as chairman of General Electric when Jack Welch, who delayed his retirement to see through the Honeywell deal, steps down later this year.

Although the deal won conditional clearance in Washington last month, the merger has run into serious trouble with EU regulators, who are reportedly demanding GE sell off billions worth of assets. GE has said the EU rejected its final offer for divestitures as insufficient.
In the Le Monde interview, Immelt rejected suggestions that GE's hints that it is preparing for life without
Honeywell were a political manoeuvre, designed to increase pressure on European authorities.
``General Electric doesn't want to transform this competition issue into a U.S.-Europe problem,'' Immelt said.
``This matter is based on economic facts. We don't agree with the commission but we don't intend to run crying to
politicians.''

``We haven't withdrawn the offer because we haven't reached agreement with Honeywell and we don't want to do it unilaterally,'' he added. On Monday, Honeywell's board of directors reaffirmed its full commitment to the deal.

Immelt, who was in Paris this weekend to visit the Paris Air Show, told Le Monde that GE's position ``is so far removed from the European Commission's that we don't think it's wise to make a political matter out of it.''

Honeywell  committed to merger with GE

Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to a troubled merger bid with General Electric  Co. yesterday, despite objections by  European Union regulators over competition issues.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said after a directors meeting at the company's Morris Township headquarters.

The board met to review contingency plans related to the merger, a spokesman said. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested the high-tech manufacturer might position itself to be bought by another suitor.

Meanwhile, Europe's top antitrust regulator denied a trans-Atlantic trade rift was developing and said yesterday that Europeans were not the only ones with reservations about GE's proposed $41 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc.

Competition Commissioner Mario Monti told a news conference the proposed deal had raised strong concerns among airlines on both sides of the Atlantic.

Without naming names, he said several U.S. firms complained and took an active role at the EU Commission hearing held last month on the proposed deal.

"This is not a trans-Atlantic dispute," he said. "There have been concerns expressed both by customers and competitors on both sides."

The proposed $41 billion merger of GE and Honeywell faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who expressed concern that a combined company would be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances.
Honeywell, which makes aerospace, electronics and automotive products, was courting a bid from GE competitor
United Technologies Inc last fall. Analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other offers.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its managers to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE. The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials for United Technologies, which pursued Honeywell until it learned GE was interested, did not return a telephone message yesterday. A spokeswoman for Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell, formed in December 1999 by the merger of Honeywell and Morris Township-based AlliedSignal, already had begun to streamline, announcing 6,500 job cuts earlier this year and making plans last year to merge its polymers and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

"There's a lot of potential at Honeywell, but obviously there's a lot of reassessment they have to do at this point," Baldwin said.
Honeywell stock closed up $1.30 yesterday, to $40.

Europe Officials Appear to Bend Some on G.E. Deal

BRUSSELS, June 18 -- The European Commission appeared to narrow the distance today between what General Electric  has offered and what the commission has demanded for approval  of G.E.'s $45 billion aerospace merger with Honeywell  International.

In a statement, the  commission said it would accept an offer short of a sale of the aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services. Some people close to the  commission have said that the European regulators want General Electric  to sell or spin off the unit outright.

The statement today repeated the commission's demand for a structural commitment to change the way the unit operates, but added ''without putting in question the control by G.E.''

Some people close to the commission interpreted the statement as a conciliatory move. ''It is a fig leaf; Mr. Monti is backing down,'' said one lawyer who has acted on behalf the commission's competition authority in the past. Far from shrugging off the political noise of recent days, Mr. Monti ''has woken up to the unavoidable political fallout that his tough stance is provoking,'' he said. Mario Monti is the European competition commissioner.

Mr. Monti, meanwhile, responded sharply to recent comments on the deal by President Bush and others, saying today, ''I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention.''

Mr. Monti said that criticism of the commission was ''not only unjustified but hard to understand since the case has not been decided yet.''

Mr. Monti also accused General Electric of ''misinforming the public'' after Harry C. Stonecipher, the vice chairman of Boeing, told the French newspaper Le Monde that opposition from Airbus Industrie was the reason European antitrust regulators at the European Commission were opposing the Honeywell deal.
At the Paris Air Show today, Mr. Stonecipher led off the company's official news conference, by apologizing to
Airbus, which is Boeing's archrival

On Sunday, Noel Forgeard, the chief executive of Airbus, strongly denounced Mr. Stonecipher and said that the airplane maker was in favor of the deal between General Electric and Honeywell.

''Mr. Forgeard is offended by my statements, and I apologize to him because he is a great friend,'' Mr. Stonecipher said.

Mr. Stonecipher spent 27 years at G.E. rising to become the head of its jet engine division. He said it was good news that Airbus supported the deal. ''People say, 'Do you stand by your statement?' '' he added. ''Well, it would
be kind of ridiculous for me to stand by the statement when the C.E.O. of Airbus says they are in favor of it. I have to accept that at face value and say, 'Wonderful. We are on the same side of this issue,' and go forward from there.''

Honeywell said today that its board had met and that its directors remained committed to the acquisition by General Electric. ''The Honeywell board said it expects that G.E. will do everything possible to secure regulatory approval for the transaction,'' the company said in a statement.

In his statement today, Mr. Monti said that in addition to the ''powerful combine'' created by pooling G.E, and Honeywell products, ''one must also add G.E.'s leasing and financial arms'' and its direct parent, GE Capital, which finances airlines' own aircraft acquisitions.

The European Commission shares the concerns of some rival aerospace manufacturers that as the world's largest single purchaser of aircraft, the leasing unit, known as Gecas, will fit only G.E. and Honeywell avionics and other aircraft equipment, just as its aircraft chiefly use GE's engines.

General Electric offered to ''ring-fence'' Gecas as a separate operation from GE Capital and keep it at arms length from Honeywell products in what it called its final offer of concessions submitted last Thursday. The commission said this offer did not go far enough.

HONEYWELL BOARD REAFFIRMS DESIRE FOR GE DEAL VOICES HOPE EUROPEAN REGULATORS

Honeywell  International Corp. reaffirmed its full commitment to its troubled deal with General Electric  Co. on Monday, despite objections by  European Union regulators concerned about competition if the $41 billion merger goes through.

Honeywell's  board of directors "expects that  GE will do everything possible to secure  regulatory approval  for the transaction," the company said in a statement after the board of directors met at the company's Morris Township headquarters.
The board was reviewing "a broad range of contingency" plans related to the merger, spokesman Tom Crane
said earlier Monday. Analysts looking at the company's options suggested that the high- tech manufacturer might
position itself to be bought by another suitor.

The proposed acquisition of Honeywell by GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., faces serious opposition from EU regulators, who have expressed concern that the combined company will be able to exploit its dominance in aircraft engines to win advantages in other areas of its business, such as aircraft leasing and avionics.
The EU has until July 12 to rule on the merger, but GE has said it is not optimistic about its chances. Honeywell, a maker of aerospace, electronic, and automotive products, last fall was courting a bid from a GE
competitor, United Technologies Inc., and analysts said the company would benefit by entertaining that or other
offers. GE then made a better offer.
"Looking to a merger is probably the best way to get value for Honeywell shares," said Harriet C. Baldwin of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown Inc.

David Bleustein of UBS Warburg said that if the merger deal with GE fails and no other suitor emerges, "Honeywell would face significant challenges," including restructuring its management to oversee an independent company after spending three quarters preparing to turn the reins over to GE.

The company also has a large base of shareholders who are expected to sell their holdings if Honeywell remains independent, he said.

Officials of United Technologies Corp., based in Hartford, Conn., did not respond to a telephone message Monday. Meanwhile, Tyco International Ltd., another company mentioned by analysts as a possible suitor, said it had no interest in Honeywell.

Honeywell, formed in December 1999 by the merger of Honeywell and Morris Township-based AlliedSignal, had begun to streamline, announcing 6,500 job cuts this year and making plans last year to merge its polymer and specialty chemical businesses and close a semiconductor chip packaging plant in California.

Shares of Honeywell rose $1.30, or 3 percent, to $40 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, where shares of GE rose 19 cents to $49.

GE-Honeywell  deal stands no chance: future GE chief

PARIS, June 19 (AFP) - The proposed merger of GE and Honeywell  stands no chance in view of opposition by the EU Commission, the future president of GE, Jeffrey Immelt, said here on Tuesday.

Immelt, who is to succeed Jack Welch, told the newspaper Le Monde in an interview that the chances of the deal going ahead were "zero".

He said: "The offer is on the table, but all the signs we have received from the EU Commission lead us to think that this offer will not be accepted."

On Thursday GE offered concessions to meet competition objections from the EU but said that these were unlikely to be enough to satisfy the EU authorities.
The commission has said it will give its decision by July 12.

European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti reacted angrily Monday to remarks suggesting that the EU had already decided to reject the plan, and he condemned political pressure.

On Friday US President George Bush had said in Warsaw that his team had made contacts in Brussels over the deal and had the impression that the commission had taken a decision to reject the takeover.

MONTI DENIES ALL "POLITICISATION" OF  GE/HONEYWELL CASE AND DEPLORES CRITICISM FROM SOME MEDIA.
Brussels, 18/06/2001 (Agence  Europe) - Competition Commissioner Mario Monti deplored the criticism and
the hasty conclusions made by the media on the subject of the European attitude regarding the  merger between
General Electric  (GE) and Honeywell.  He categorically denied allegations that reasons of a more political kind
lay behind the veto from his services. "This criticism is not only unjustified but also hard to understand since the
case has not been decided yet", he said.

I deplore the attempts that have had as aim to misinform the public and to caused a political intervention. It is completely out of context in an antitrust procedure and has no impact on the Commission. It is an issue of law and economics, not politics, he stated in short. The Commissioner, moreover, underlined that the Commission has applied for the last ten years the same basic principals in all cases of competition and this without exception, in the fundamental aim of guaranteeing consumers a wide rang of products at competitive prices. The nationality of companies and political consideration have not played and will never play any role in the investigation of a merger, nor in the present case nor in others, he put forward. The Commission recalled its fears of seeing the
reduction of competition in the sectors for engines and aerospace in the case of GE and Honeywell merging (see EUROPE of 15 and 16 June, p.9 and 12). It indicated that it was closely studying the concerns of several companies "on both sides of the Atlantic", among which several American companies, while underlining that Boeing and Airbus have not been especially active during the hearings, as certain media had insinuated. The French daily "Le Monde" thus published in its weekend edition an interview with Harry Stonecipher, Boeing Vice - President, in which the latter considers the GE proposals completely "reasonable", letting it be inferred that Airbus was trying to influence the Commission in its decision: It is not the airlines that oppose the merger, it is Airbus. If the Commission blocks this plan, it could be that there are difficulties in the area of trade. The United States has approved this merger. If Europe refuses it, what will happen? You don't really make friends?, he stated. For its part, the Commission states its surprise over the difficulty of reaching a compromise over this dossier, underlining that there exist paths that could have been exploited in order to avoid any additional sell-off in the aeronautic sector.

EU Official  Decries Bush Effort on GE-Honeywell; Top AntitrustCommissioner Cites Political Interference
by U.S. in Troubled  Talks on $45 Billion Deal

BRUSSELS, June 18 -- The  European Union's top  antitrust official today denounced what he described as political pressure by President Bush and other members of his administration to influence the  EU's review of General Electric's  $45 billion bid for  Honeywell  International.

Mario Monti, the EU's commissioner for competition affairs, condemned any political intrusion in the case and insisted the merger will be judged strictly on legal and economic merits.  GE and Honeywell  broke off negotiations with Monti's staff last week, saying the  merger would not be worth pursuing if they had to meet the EU executive commission's demands.

After two fruitless meetings with Monti, GE's chairman and chief executive, Jack Welch, called White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. last week to express his disappointment and inform him that prospects for the deal looked bleak. A day later, just before giving a major foreign policy speech in the Polish capital of Warsaw, Bush told reporters, "I am concerned that the Europeans have rejected it."

Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, speaking to reporters at the Paris air show last week, also publicly pleaded for a more positive assessment by EU regulators. "I would like to encourage them to think seriously about how constructive a merger like this could be," he said.

The Americans' remarks appeared to infuriate the normally mild-mannered Monti. "I deplore attempts to misinform the public and to trigger political intervention," he said after giving a speech today in Ljubljana, Slovenia. "This is entirely out of place in an antitrust case and has had no impact on the commission whatsoever. This is a matter of law and economics, not politics."

Only hours after Monti's criticism, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick told reporters that although the Bush administration did not wish to question the EU commission's sovereign powers, it was troubled by the apparent impasse between Monti's staff and the companies. "If it ends up this way, it's an unfortunate result," Zoellick said.

If the commission decides to block the deal, it will mark the first time European regulators have rejected a merger between American companies that has already been approved by the U.S. Justice Department. Although Monti says the case should not be perceived as a transatlantic dispute, many analysts say that a negative decision could reinforce protectionist sentiments in the U.S. Congress.

The top two members of the U.S. Senate's antitrust subcommittee said Friday that they plan to examine why U.S. and EU antitrust officials reached such divergent conclusions on the deal. Subcommittee Chairman Herb Kohl
(D-Wis.) and ranking minority member Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) said in a statement that "we intend to make further inquiries" into whether the difference in outcomes reflects "a rift in coordination and legal standards or is the product of a legitimate difference in opinion."

The senators expressed concern about the effect of the EU's stance on other U.S. businesses, saying that "uncertainty about either coordination or the legal ground rules will hinder the development of free and open markets and will impede efforts by American companies to expand into the global marketplace."

European Union law requires that all companies, regardless of where they are based, notify the EU commission about planned mergers if their combined worldwide annual sales exceed 5 billion euros (about $4.3 billion) and at least 250 million euros (about $215 million) worth of their business is done among the 15 EU nations.

Monti said he and his staff have worked closely over the past decade with their counterparts in the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. He denied that any anti-American prejudice had tainted his staff's assessment of the GE-Honeywell deal and stressed that "the merger had raised strong concerns among suppliers and customers, particularly the airlines, on both sides of the Atlantic."

Monti said the Bush administration's comments were all the more regrettable because unless GE and Honeywell formally withdraw their proposal, the case is still alive and will not be decided until the EU executive commission rules by July 12.

Honeywell's board of directors met today in New York City and issued a statement afterward reaffirming its commitment to the deal and saying that Honeywell "expects that GE will do everything possible to secure regulatory approval for the transaction."

The board, however, did meet "to review contingency plans to ensure the company is fully prepared for any outcome," said Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane. The company declined to comment specifically on the plans.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Honeywell must pay GE $1.35 billion if the deal falls through because either Honeywell's shareholders or board disapproves it, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and posted on Honeywell's Web site. But the documents do not outline any penalty if GE walks away.

Welch and other GE executives called off negotiations in Brussels last Thursday after saying they had made a final offer but were no longer optimistic that the deal would be approved. They said GE had proposed selling assets with $2.2 billion in annual sales, but the commission was seeking divestments worth more than $6 billion a year.

GE said that it was willing to dispose of its regional jet business and parts of Honeywell's avionics systems but that it drew the line at the EU's request to spin off GE Capital Aviation Services, or GECAS, the company's highly profitable financial and airplane leasing arm.

Monti said the commission would be willing to accept smaller divestments in the aerospace industry by the two companies if they would entertain "a structural commitment to modify the commercial behavior" of GECAS without putting into question its control by GE.

Takeover Traders Get Pummeled By GE-Honeywell  --- Big Losses Are Expected If Proposed  Merger Dies

Ouch.

Already hurt by a big slowdown in merger-and-acquisition activity, traders who invest in takeover stocks have been battered by the standoff between General Electric  Chairman John F. Welch Jr. and Mario  Monti, Europe's chief antitrust regulator.

Takeover experts estimate that the takeover-trading, or risk-arbitrage, community has lost more than $1 billion (1.16 billion euros) in the past two weeks due to the growing expectations that GE's proposed acquisition of Honeywell International will fall apart. That is a far cry from an average 30% annualized rate of return that had been anticipated when they purchased the shares.

It is the latest blow in a year that has fallen far short of the stellar results seen in recent years when the U.S. stock market was booming and the pace of mergers was blistering. Takeover experts estimate arbitragers own between
80 million and 100 million shares of Honeywell. Takeover arbitragers make their money by betting on the likelihood that a proposed merger will be completed. In this deal, they snapped up Honeywell shares on the hopes that the deal would be completed on terms announced in October.
"Obviously, this has been very painful. The losses are going to be very big," said Tom Burnett, president of
Merger Insight, an institutional research service.
The growing concerns about the future of the $41 billion deal reached new heights when Mr. Welch
acknowledged for the first time that he wasn't optimistic that the company's $2.2 billion divestiture proposal would
pass European regulatory muster.

At 4 p.m. Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Honeywell was down $5.16 at $37.10, while General Electric was up $1.01 at $48.86. Some traders held on to their Honeywell shares on the hopes that another bidder will step in. In midafternoon trading Monday, Honeywell was up to $40, while GE was up to
$49.25.

Mr. Monti, the European competition commissioner, has until July 12 to make a decision on the deal, but many takeover experts viewed the transaction as nearly dead.

The development sent the deal's so-called spread -- the difference between Honeywell's stock price and the implied value of the GE stock that Honeywell shareholders would receive -- soaring to $14.45, from a spread of about $2.80 just last month. Arbitragers make money when the spread narrows to zero.

The widening differential between the nominal price shareholders would receive and where Honeywell shares are trading signals that there is a growing belief that the transaction has an increased risk of unraveling.

The GE-Honeywell deal is the latest transaction that has disappointed takeover traders this year. In March, for example, Tyson Foods canceled a planned $3.2 billion acquisition of IBP. And traders fretted for months over the outcome of Deutsche Telekom's purchase of VoiceStream Wireless, although that deal has been completed.

As of May 31, the average fund managed by takeover traders was up 4.83% this year, compared with an 8.98% gain for the year-earlier period, according to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc., of Nashville, Tennessee.
Page 151 of 152 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But traders said the potential fallout from a collapse of the GE-Honeywell deal would eclipse previous losses. "There's a lot of blood out there. People had it among their larger positions because they thought there was a large probability the deal would get done," one takeover trader said.

Indeed, it was the very words of Mr. Welch that gave many arbitragers comfort when the deal was unveiled in October -- even though some experts predicted antitrust problems. Mr. Welch, who delayed his retirement to oversee the integration of Honeywell, said he didn't anticipate any antitrust issues.

Takeover traders also were optimistic about the likely outcome of the deal because it had already received approval from the U.S. Justice Department, which ordered only minor concessions. But the European regulatory agency has increasingly played hardball in recent months, even on transactions such as this one involving two U.S.-based firms.

Traders were reluctant to discuss their own losses or rumored losses at rival firms. Some of the damage, however, may have been minimized because the spread had been widening over the past week and that would provide an opportunity for traders to protect their vulnerable positions.

Indeed, arbitragers said that is exactly what happened with San Francisco hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, which held 4.7 million Honeywell shares in the first quarter, according to a Honeywell shareholder list filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These arbitragers said Farallon minimized its risk before the spread widened to current levels. Farallon general counsel Mark Wehrly declined to comment.

Although most arbitragers experienced some pain from the GE-Honeywell situation, Bear Stearns' arbitrage department has emerged unscathed. The investment bank advised Honeywell in the deal and its takeover traders have been prohibited from playing the deal.
