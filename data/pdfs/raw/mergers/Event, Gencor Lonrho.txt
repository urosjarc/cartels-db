EU officials against platinum deal - Lonrho  source.
By Fredrik Dahl

10 April 1996

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, April 10 (Reuter) - European Union competition officials have been hostile from the start towards the proposed merger of Lonrho's  platinum interests with those of South Africa's  Gencor Ltd, a Lonrho  source said on Wednesday.

The source said his feeling was that the European Commission's merger task force, which investigates deals to see whether they may harm competition in the EU, was against approving the  merger into the world's biggest platinum producer.

"...it is my understanding that the merger task force have turned it down and I think the advisory committee did as well," he said. "I think the signs are not very hopeful."
The secretive advisory committee, which consists of national competition policy officials, met in Brussels on
Tuesday to discuss the case and the view of the merger task force.

The Commission usually follows the opinion of the merger task force but there have been a few cases where it ended up deciding differently.
The deadline for a Commission decision, to be taken by simple majority in the 20-member executive, is in early
May but one source said it may rule on the merger already by the end of this month.

"The merger task force, as distinct from the Commission, have been very hostile towards it...because they believe it to be of anti-competitive nature as far as the European consumer is concerned," the Lonrho source said.

He stressed he did not know what the final decision of the Commission would be. "Of course we hope the merger will go ahead."

One Brussels source said the Commission had told the companies earlier in the inquiry that it had considerable problems with the deal and that it could still have those concerns.

Asked whether he believed the firms would need to make concessions in order to win EU approval this source said: "That could well be the case."

Since 1990, the Commission has only blocked four mergers but many more have been approved only after the companies involved agreed on changes such as the sale of assets to allay the Commission's competition concerns.

But the Lonrho source appeared to rule this out, saying there was nothing which could be done to make the deal more acceptable for the Commission.
Under the merger deal, Gencor and British-based conglomerate Lonrho plan to acquire joint control of Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd through a share purchase.

The merger has already been approved by the shareholders of Lonrho and of Impala, which is 46.5 percent owned by Gencor, and by the Competition Board in South Africa.
The management of Gencor/Impala is said to be positive towards the merger whereas the management of
Lonrho's platinum operations is generally more negative.

The Commission announced in December that it had started a detailed investigation of the deal following a routine one-month inquiry, citing concerns the merged company "may have an adverse effect on competition".

LONDON, April 11 (Reuter) - The  European Commission is set to block or demand changes to the planned merger of Lonrho's  platinum interests with those of South Africa's  Gencor Ltd, the Guardian newspaper reported here on Thursday.

The Commission's competition officials have until May 7 to vet the proposed 430 million stg  deal, but were advised by a merger "task force" to oppose it, the paper said, quoting unnamed sources in Brussels.

The merger plan, already approved by South Africa's competition board, was first announced in June last year and is under investigation by the European Commission since December.

A merger of Gencor's platinum operations with those of British conglomerate Lonrho would create the world's biggest platinum firm.
The Guardian did not say why the European Commision might block the deal.

THE merger between Lonrho's  and Gencor's platinum mining interests is meeting a hostile reception from European Union competition officials, according to a Lonrho  source. The officials have until May to make public a decision on their inquiry, announced in December. Both Gencor and Lonrho  have substantial interests in the EU and want to acquire joint control of Impala Platinum.  A committee of European officials investigating the impact of the merger on consumers in Europe met on Tuesday evening.

EC COULD BLOCK #430M LONRHO MERGER DEAL.
By Ian King in London and Julie Wolf in Brussels.

EU COMPETITION authorities are set to block or demand changes to the proposed #430m  merger of Lonrho's
platinum interests with those of South African mining group  Gencor, according to sources in Brussels.

The Commission's competition officials, which have until May 7 to wave through or block the  merger, are understood to have been advised by a  merger "task force" to oppose the  deal.

Last night, a Lonrho spokesman in London said it was "absolute hooey" to suggest the Commission would oppose the merger. He said: "Like the Monopolies Commission, the EU doesn't give interim reports, and so we won't know until the day it decides."

Under the terms of the merger, which would create the world's biggest platinum producer, Gencor and Lonrho would obtain joint control of Impala platinum, in which both groups already hold a substantial stake.

But although the merger has been approved by the shareholders of both companies, and by South Africa's competition authorities, the Brussels competition authorities have taken a tougher line.

In taking evidence, the Commission has heard representations from various groups, including the native Mafeking tribe in South Africa, which opposes the deal. It is rumoured that President Nelson Mandela is personally opposed to the deal, along with certain Lonrho staff based in South Africa who, it is claimed, have been prevented from speaking to the Commission by Lonrho's head office in London.

Another leading opponent of the proposed merger is Lonrho's founder and former chairman Tiny Rowland, who has campaigned vigorously against the merger since it was announced in November.

Speaking from the south of France, he said last night: "I am not surprised at this news - I cannot believe the Commission would allow the merger to go ahead. If it has been blocked, it is very good news for Lonrho shareholders."

Although the Commission has only rarely blocked mergers, in-depth investigations often lead the Commission to demand changes in the terms.

Meanwhile, rumours were circulating in South Africa yesterday that Anglo-American, the world's biggest gold miner, was looking to increase its stake in Lonrho.

Last month, Anglo snapped up a 5.9% stake in Lonrho previously owned by Mr Rowland. Anglo's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, ruled out a bid for the whole of Lonrho, but last week Anglo lifted its stake to almost
10%.
The rumours sent Lonrho shares to record levels in Johannesburg and left them 2p firmer at 216p in London. Document grdn000020011017ds4b00pip

BRUSSELS LOOKS SET TO BLOCK LONRHO-GENCOR MERGER.
By MICHAEL HARRISON.

Speculation is mounting that Brussels will block the planned link up between  Lonrho  and South African group
Gencor to create the world's second biggest  platinum producer.

It is thought that the  European Commission's mergers task force has come down against the  merger and that its decision was backed by a meeting on Tuesday of an advisory committee consisting of competition policy officials from member states.

Lonrho sources indicated yesterday that both bodies had blocked the merger, which would create a grouping with production of about 1.6 million ounces of platinum a year.

However, that may not be entirely bad news for Lonrho as it could ease the way for the world's biggest platinum producer to increase its stake in Lonrho's mining operations when the planned demerger from the group's trading and hotels business takes place this summer.

Anglo-American already owns 10 per cent of Lonrho and is thought to want to raise its stake to just under 30 per cent.

Last month Anglo snapped up Tiny Rowland's 5.9 per cent stake in Lonrho for #91m and secured first right of refusal to buy chief executive Dieter Bock's 18.5 per cent stake should he decide to sell.

Lonrho refused to comment on suggestions that the South African group was now seeking to secure a fixed price option on the Bock stake though analysts believe he would sell out if offered #2.50 a share.

But analysts said it was clear that Anglo was intent on emerging as a significant minority shareholder in Lonrho's platinum, gold and coal mining operations when they are demerged from its trading and hotel businesses this summer.
"It would be very happy, when the break-up occurs, to own about 30 per cent of the mining companies," said one
Johannesburg-based analyst.

The main attraction for Anglo is Lonrho's 41 per cent stake in Ashanti Goldfields but it also has a majority stake in coal producer Duiker Exploration and is merging its platinum interests with those of Gencor of South Africa.

EU refuses comment  on Lonrho/Gencor platinium deal.

(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, April 11 (Reuter) - The European Commission declined to comment on Thursday on reports that a
merger of the platinum operations of Lonrho  and Gencor may be blocked.

"The case is still under consideration by the Commission's services...we can't comment on any proposal," Commission spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said, quoting  European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.

A Lonrho source told Reuters on Wednesday that it was his "understanding" that the Commission's merger task force, which has responsibility of drafting merger decisions, was against approving the deal. He also thought the EU's advisory committee on concentrations, which met on Tuesday to discuss the case, agreed with this view.

The final decision must be taken by a majority of the 20-member Commission on Van Miert's proposal by May 7. The Commission has only blocked four mergers since it became the clearing house for big corporate deals affecting the 15-nation market in 1990.

EU Panels Weigh Rejection  Of Lonrho-Gencor Merger
By Shailagh Murray

A plan by Lonrho  PLC of the U.K. and South Africa's  Gencor Ltd. to  merge their platinum operations has run into trouble with European Union antitrust authorities.

Two EU committees that review competition cases have recommended the rejection of the proposed  merger, which would create a leading global  platinum producer jointly controlled by  Lonrho  and Gencor, says a European antitrust official familiar with the proceedings. This official said both committees concluded the  merger would lead to "an oligopolistic dominance of the world-wide  platinum market" and added that members didn't see any way to alter the  deal to resolve their concerns.

"Structural changes . . . are no solution in this case," says the official. "The only possibilities are behavioral, and those don't go far enough."
Stocks of the firms moved in opposite directions on the news. In Johannesburg, Gencor was trading at 15.85 rand
($3.79), up 0.15 rand, while Lonrho was quoted at 213 pence ($3.23), down three pence, or 1.4%, in London.

The European Commission has until May 7 to vote on the deal. While commissioners can decide as they please, they typically follow the recommendations of these committees.
A Lonrho spokesman says the company has not been informed of the committees' findings. "We're waiting for
May 7," the spokesman said.

The spokesman described the review so far as "a straightforward process," and says Lonrho and Gencor are ready to address the commission's concerns. If necessary, "you can change the deal," he said.

Lonrho, the London-based hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor in November to merge the two companies' platinum operations under South African-based Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., or Implats. The new company would have a market value of about #1.3 billion ($1.97 billion).

Anne Dunn, a spokeswoman for Implats, said Wednesday that the commission "has shown a lot of concern about competition" and that investigators "have asked for a lot of information over a period of time." But she said Implats also hasn't received formal word from the committees.

The merger is a complex one and has proven controversial from the start. The transaction was first announced last June by Dieter Bock, the German businessman and major Lonrho shareholder who took control of the company after the ouster of Lonrho founder R.W. "Tiny" Rowland.

Mr. Rowland has protested the merger for undervaluing Lonrho's mining assets and for ceding too much control to rival Gencor, a metal and mineral producer that now owns 46.5% of Implats. Lonrho and Gencor will hold
31.8% each of the new operation after a series of stock transactions involving Implats and other platinum mines in which Lonrho or Implats, or both, own shares.

Analysts say Implats is set to become the world's leading platinum producer, but Lonrho contends that title will be retained by Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd., also of South Africa.

Commission officials opened an in-depth investigation into the merger in December, saying they were especially worried about the deal's effect on world platinum prices. Competition -- from Russian producers, for instance -- may not prove sufficient to ensure fair rates, EU investigators suggested then.

The deal falls under Brussels' jurisdiction because Lonrho and Gencor do significant business in Europe. The vast majority of mergers are cleared after an initial one-month review. The Lonrho-Gencor deal entered a second,
four-month stage in December.

LONRHO - TEMPUS.

THE long arm of the  European Competition Commissioner now appears to extend to Johannesburg, with rumours that he is about to stop  Lonrho  from snuggling up to  Gencor in the platinum market. Why  European bureaucrats should be able to prevent a  merger of mining interests in Africa is an interesting question. How they could prevent it is an even bigger puzzle.

Platinum is important because it is used to make catalytic convertors for automobiles and, therefore, European car manufacturers have a vested interest in keeping the price low. Most of the shiny metal comes from South Africa, where three companies, Rustenberg, part of the Anglo American conglomerate, Lonrho and Gencor dominate the market. Lonrho and Gencor are merging their respective interests into Impala Platinum, which will produce about a third of the world supply of the metal.

Meanwhile, Anglo American is complicating the picture by building a stake in Lonrho with clear designs on Lonrho's mining interests, including Ashanti, the successful Ghanaian gold mining associate. Anglo is the logical buyer of the demerged Lonrho mining interest, but would have little desire to inherit an association with Gencor. Anglo, therefore, may have every reason to see the Impala venture scuppered.

Ironically, the platinum price has been weak of late for different reasons. The Russians are exporting large stockpiles in search of hard currency, but their actual production of the metal is thought to be half of capacity. If that is the case, Europeans have not much reason to fear a South African cartel.

EU Panel May Reject Lonrho-Gencor Deal

A plan by Lonrho  PLC of the U.K. and South Africa's  Gencor Ltd. to  merge their platinum operations has run into trouble with European Union antitrust authorities.

Two EU committees that review competition cases have recommended the rejection of the proposed  merger, which would create a leading global  platinum producer jointly controlled by  Lonrho  and Gencor, says a European antitrust official familiar with the proceedings. This official said both committees concluded the  merger would lead to "an oligopolistic dominance of the world-wide  platinum market" and added that members didn't see any way to alter the  deal to resolve their concerns.
Stocks of the firms moved in opposite directions on the news. In Johannesburg, Gencor was trading at 15.85 rand
($3.79), up 0.15 rand, while Lonrho was quoted at 213 pence ($3.23), down three pence, or 1.4%, in London.

The European Commission has until May 7 to vote on the deal. While commissioners can decide as they please, they typically follow the recommendations of these committees.
A Lonrho spokesman says the company has not been informed of the committees' findings. "We're waiting for
May 7," the spokesman said.

Lonrho, the London-based hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor in November to merge the two companies' platinum operations under South African-based Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., or Implats. The new company would have a market value of about b1.3 billion ($1.97 billion).

LONRHO OFFSHOOT STRIKES #192M GOLD DEAL.
By Julie Wolf in Brussels and Ian King.

ASHANTI Goldfields, the Ghanaian gold mining group part-owned by  Lonrho,  yesterday announced an agreed
#192m bid for Australian miner Golden Shamrock.
The deal came as details emerged as to why the European Commission is planning to block the #430m  merger
of Lonrho's  platinum interests with those of Gencor, its South African rival.
Ashanti, in which Lonrho holds a 40% stake, said the deal would provide access to further gold production in
West Africa, confirming its position as one of Africa's leading gold miners.

The purchase of Golden Shamrock, reportedly under the noses of several Australian bidders, is the latest in a string of deals by Ashanti.
Last week, the group snapped up International Gold Resources of Canada for #65m and last December it bought
Britain's Cluff Resources for #80m.

Those deals gave Ashanti a significant mining presence in Ghana, extra mining rights in Zimbabwe and exploration rights in Tanzania.
Ashanti's main gold-mine, Obuasi in Ghana, has been in production for well over 100 years, and is near to
Bibiani, a mine it bought in the Canadian deal, and Golden Shamrock's Iduapriem mine.

Meanwhile, sources say Brussels competition officials have recommended that the EU block the planned merger by Lonrho and Gencor because the deal, forming the world's biggest platinum producer, would create two big players - the other being Anglo-American - unlikely to compete effectively with each other.

The 20-member commission is expected to agree with the recommendation at a meeting later this month unless last-minute negotiations produce a solution.

Given the extent of the objections raised by the EU officials, there was little scope for the deal to be salvaged, the sources said.
Rumours continued to circulate yesterday that Anglo-American is preparing to increase its stake in Lonrho. Document grdn000020011017ds4c00oyo

Anglo seen harming  Lonrho/Gencor EU review.
By Amelia Torres
583 words
12 April 1996
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, April 12 (Reuter) - The European Commission stayed silent this week on the reasons that might lead it to block the  merger of the platinum interests of South African mining giants  Gencor and Lonrho.

But market analysts predicted Anglo American Corp's recent interest in  Lonrho  may have made EU clearance of the deal even more difficult. Anglo American is another South African company which controls the world's largest producer of platinum, Rustenburg.
Together, the three giants account for almost 70 percent of the world's platinum supply.

"I suspect that if there is a problem it probably relates to the sudden development when Anglo American bought a stake in Lonrho," said a mining analyst who asked not to be named.

A Lonrho source told Reuters on Wednesday that it was his "understanding" that the Commission's merger task force, which has responsibility of drafting merger decisions, was against approving the deal.

He also thought the EU's secretive advisory committee on concentrations, a body composed of national competition officials which met on Tuesday to discuss the case, agreed with this view.
The Commission declined to comment.

"The case is still under consideration by the Commission's services...we can't comment on any proposal," Commission spokeswoman Sarah Lambert said on Thursday, quoting European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert. The Commission has until May 7 to decide on the case, Lambert said.

The Commission started a detailed investigation into the proposed merger of the platinum group metals interests of Gencor and Lonrho in December 1995. The decision to start a four-month full probe after a routine one-month inquiry usually means that a deal is unlikely to go through unscathed.

The plan involves Lonrho taking a 32-percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, currently the world's second largest producer of platinum. Gencor would hold a similar stake and the remaining shares would be held by the public.
Platinum is used in jewellery as well as exhaust catalysts for the car industry, a Commission industry official said. Total world supply of platinum in 1995 was 4.9 million ounces (165 tonnes). Rustenburg, Impala and three mines
controlled by Lonrho accounted for 3.4 million ounces.

Russia is another big supplier of platinum which it produces from nickel, analysts and the Commission official said. Belgium's Union Miniere also produces recycled platinum.

Anglo American was granted the right on Friday to acquire an 18.4-percent-stake in Lonhro from Lonrho's chief executive Dieter Bock, the two companies said in a statement. It also said Anglo and associates or subsidiaries already owned 10.1 percent in Lonrho.

Were the Gencor/Lonhro deal to go ahead and Anglo American to take control of Lonhro, the number of platinum suppliers would broadly be reduced to two, analysts said.

Although Lonrho and Gencor are South African, they also operate in the EU which prompted the Commission's involvement under the merger regulation 4064/89.

Anglo American said in March it had bought a 5.9 percent shareholding in Lonrho and mining analysts had been speculating that it was setting its eyes on a much bigger stake.

The Commission's final decision must be taken by a majority of the 20-member Commission on Van Miert's proposal.
It has only blocked four mergers since it became the clearing house for big corporate deals affecting the EU in
1990.

The planned merger of Gencor's Impala  Platinum  with Lonrho's  platinum operations is expected to face stiff opposition from the EU. Sources say that the union is being disputed by EU's mergers task force, as well as an advisory group of competition policy officials from UK and South Africa. The proposed merger combines Impala's operations in 3 Bophutatswana mines, as well its its 54% stake in Messina Ltd., with the 3 contiguous mines of Western Platinum,  Eastern  Platinum  and Karee which are owned by  Lonrho Platinum  Division. The resulting company would be the world's second largest  platinum producer that would directly compete against Rustenburg Platinum.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Union (E.U.) Commission is likely next week to block the  merger of the
platinum operations of U.K.'s Lonrho  PLC and South Africa's  Gencor Ltd., an E.U. source said.

The source said the case is probably going to show up on the agenda of the Commission meeting April 24, and the proposed merger as it stands ''doesn't meet our concerns.''

The E.U. competition watchdog opened a second-phase, four month investigation into the merger in December. under which Gencor and Lonrho would combine their global platinum activities. because of fears that the companies would control a dominant position on E.U. markets.

The source said the Commission still harbours those concerns despite the fact that companies ''have proposed certain commitments.''
Under the terms of the merger, the companies would combine their platinum activities in South African-based
Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., or Implats.
When the Commission opened its detailed inquiry, it said there were clear concerns that the partners would - with
Russian platinum producers - effectively hold a ''duopoly position'' on the world platinum market.
As the E.U. investigation nears its conclusion, the source said the Commission is still concerned about a
''quasi-cartel'' situation existing between the partners.

The E.U. competition authority has only blocked four alliances since it became the clearing house for corporate mergers in 1990.

If it has competition concerns, it generally prefers to request modifications and then clear the venture. With this case however, the source said there was ''nothing to modify.''

Lonrho,  Gencor to Press On Despite Row Over Merger

The proposed merger of Lonrho  PLC and Gencor Ltd.'s platinum operations faces almost certain death before the European Commission, but a spokeswoman for the deal said the companies have no plans to retreat.

"We'll wait for the final decision and will act according to that," said Anne Dunn, corporate communications manager for Impala  Platinum  Holdings Ltd., or Implats.

Lonrho, the London-based hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor of South Africa in November to merge the two companies' platinum operations under Implats. European Union antitrust investigators opened an in-depth probe of the deal in December.

An EU source said Monday that investigators have serious concerns that the venture will control too much of the European platinum market. Two merger review committees have already ruled it anticompetitive, and will recommend that the commission turn it down.

The commission is expected to take up the matter during its April 24 meeting. "I can't see it going through," said one EU source familiar with the investigation.
Ms. Dunn said Implats will take its chances. "We're totally committed to the merger," she said, by telephone from
South Africa. "I can't see us withdrawing at all."

EU to block Lonrho-Gencor platinum deal
274 words

BRUSSELS, April 16 (AFP) - British conglomerate Lonrho's  planned merger of its platinum interests with those of Gencor of South Africa will be blocked by the European Commission, officials said on Tuesday.

The merger will not be on the  EU executive's agenda before next week at the earliest. But even if the two companies present substantial modifications to the proposed  merger by then, the answer is still expected to be no.
Lonrho and Gencor agreed in November to merge their platinum operations under South Africa's Impala Platinum
Holdings.

The new company, valued at nearly two billion dollars, will rival South Africa's Rustenburg Platinum Holdings as the world's leading producer of the metal.

The commission fears however that the two companies will opt not to compete with each other and that other suppliers are incapable of ensuring real competition on prices. Russian output has fallen sharply and become unreliable since the collapse of the Soviet Union because of technological and financial problems.

As a result the commission fears allowing the Lonrho-Glencor merger could lead to price increases for European car and jewellery industries which are major consumers of platinum.

"There is a general view that the merger is difficult to justify," one official said. "The commission could allow it subject to agreed remedies. But it is difficult in an esoteric market like platinum to come up with structural remedies that carry credibility."

An advisory committee of competition officials from the 15 EU states last week gave the deal the thumbs down, but the final decision lies with the commission.

The proposed merger of Lonrho  PLC and Gencor Ltd.'s platinum operations faces almost certain death before the European Commission, but a spokeswoman for the deal said the companies have no plans to retreat.

"We'll wait for the final decision and will act according to that," said Anne Dunn, corporate communications manager for Impala  Platinum  Holdings Ltd., or Implats.

Lonrho, the London-based hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor of South Africa in November to merge the two companies' platinum operations under Implats. European Union antitrust investigators opened an in-depth probe of the deal in December.
An EU source said Monday that investigators have serious concerns that the venture will control too much of the
European platinum market.

BRUSSELS -- U.K. conglomerate Lonrho's  planned merger of platinum interests with those of Gencore of South Africa will be blocked by the European Union, Knight-Ridder reported yesterday. "There is a general view that the  merger is difficult to justify," an EU official told the news agency. The  merger will not be on the  EU's executive agenda before next week, but the answer is expected to be "no" regardless of any modifications the company may propose.

EU to rule on Lonrho/Gencor deal by end April.

BRUSSELS, April 17 (Reuter) - The European Commission is to rule either next week or the week after on the
merger of British-based  Lonrho's  and Gencor's South-African  platinum interests, Commission officials said.

"I believe the decision will fall on April 30," one senior official said. Another one said there was a slight possibility it could happen on April 24.

A decision to disallow the merger is in little doubt after the Commission's merger task force and the European advisory committee on concentrations agreed that it would seriously endanger competition in the European Union's market.

According to anti-trust sources and mining analysts the Gencor/Lonrho deal would result in the market for platinum -- a silver-white metal used in the making of jewels and catalysts for cars -- becoming a duopoly.

The other player is Anglo American Corp of South Africa which is the world's largest supplier through its subsidiary Rustenburg.

The Commission's worries were recently aggravated by the fact that Anglo American has been building up a substantial stake in Lonrho.

Russia is also a competitor with about a fifth of the market, but the Commission's merger task force apparently took the view that it could not seriously oppose the South African's position. This is due partly to the fact that platinum produced in Russia is obtained from nickel and its supply is therefore dependent of the evolution of the nickel market.

In December, the Commission started a so-called second-stage four-month investigation into the deal, which involves Lonrho taking a 32 percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, currently the world's second largest producer of platinum.

Negotiations are still going one between the companies and the Commission and the official deadline for ruling on the operation is May 7, but there were no signs that a last ditch deal would be possible.

Under internal rules adopted by the Commission last year following difficult negotiations with Procter and Gamble, any changes proposed to a deal already in the second stage must be submitted during the first three months.

This alone rules out the possibility of rescuing the Lonrho/Gencor merger, but lawyers well versed in EU anti-trust law doubt whether the Commission would turn out remedies truly aimed at solving competition concerns.

The liklihood that the platinum deal will be blocked by the Commission has increased since a Lonrho source last week told Reuters that it was his "understanding" that the Commission's merger task force and the secretive advisory committee was opposed to the deal.
The final decision must be taken by a majority of the 20-member EU executive on a proposal by European
Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.

The Commission has only blocked four mergers since it became the clearing house for major corporate deals affecting the 15-nation bloc in September 1990.

EU may block Gencor/Lonrho deal next week.

BRUSSELS, April 19 (Reuter) - The European Commission is expected to block next week the  merger of the
platinum operations of British-based Lonrho  and South African mining giant  Gencor, EU sources said on Friday.

The heart of the problem, anti-trust sources say, is that the  deal would turn the  platinum market into a duopoly between the  merged company and rival South African giant Anglo-American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
Platinum is a silver-white metal used to make jewellery and exhaust catalysts for cars.

If there is a decision to block the deal, it would be only the fifth case since 1990, when the Commission became the clearing house for mergers affecting the 15-nation EU.

The Commission's merger task force, which prepares and drafts decisions, concluded recently that the operation should be banned and this view was endorsed at a meeting this month of the EU's advisory committee on mergers.

The 20-member Commission usually follows the opinion of the task force, which consists of Commission competition experts.

The Commission's worries have been aggravated by the fact that Anglo-American, which controls the world's largest platinum supplier Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd, has been building up a large Lonrho stake.

Russia is also a competitor with about a fifth of the market, but the merger task force apparently took the view that it could not seriously threaten the South Africans' position.

Under the deal, Lonrho plans to take a 32 percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, currently the world's second largest producer of platinum.

In December, the Commission signalled it was worried about the merger's effects on competition by announcing it was starting a detailed investigation into it.
Although their platinum operations are located in South Africa, both Gencor and Lonrho have large EU
operations.

In the past, several mergers have been approved by the Commission only after the parties involved agreed to scale down their plans by selling operations.

The source said there were some ideas what Gencor and Lonrho could do in terms of commitments, "but it is not certain that that would lead to a better situation."

BRUSSELS (AP-Dow Jones)--Senior competition officials of the European Union (E.U.) Commission meeting Friday are expected to rubberstamp a proposal to block the planned merger of the platinum interests of the U.K.'s  Lonrho  PLC with South Africa's  Gencor Ltd., an E.U. source said.

The source also said that the involvement of South African mining giant Anglo American Corp. in  Lonrho  doesn't increase the chances of the  merger being cleared. 'In fact it has the opposite effect,' he said.

Anglo American already owns, either directly or indirectly, between 10% and 11% of Lonrho's shares. Coupled with this, it has an option arrangement with Dieter Bock, Lonrho's chief executive, to buy a further 18.4% by September 1997.

Along with Anglo American's own platinum interests, analysts say an indirect stake in the Gencor/Lonrho alliance would leave the mining conglomerate with a large, if not controlling stake in roughly 67% of world platinum output, or virtually all of South Africa's production.

However, another Commission source said that the 'Anglo-American aspect' of the merger hasn't been focussed on in the E.U. investigation.

EU plan to block Gencor/Lonrho raises problems.
By Amelia Torres

BRUSSELS, April 22 (Reuter) - Some of the 20  European Commissioners are unhappy with a draft decision to block the merger of the platinum interests of British-based  Lonrho  and Gencor of South Africa, Commission sources said on Monday.

But unless the companies change the  deal to solve competition problems, there is little doubt that the operation will be blocked on Wednesday, the sources said.

"There is no formal opposition (to the proposal to block the deal)...but four or five commissioners' aides have doubts about it," one said.

The Commission's merger task-force, which prepares decisions on major corporate agreements that come under the EU's scrutiny, have proposed banning the merger because it would create a duopoly in the platinum market -- Anglo American Corp of South Africa and the merged company.

The advisory committee on mergers made up of national anti-trust officials, which met recently in Brussels, agreed.

But the commissioners' chefs de cabinet argued in a meeting late on Friday against the EU blocking an operation which had not raised any particular concerns in the U.S. and Japan, which are bigger consumers of platinum than the EU.
The European Union absorbs 15 to 20 percent of the world's platinum supply.

"Why should Europe be policing competition worldwide when the United States and Japan did not voice any opposition to the deal?" one source said.

The opposing commissioners -- among the most liberal and influential members of the Commission -- also stressed that the European automobile industry had not advised against approving the deal which affects them because platinum is used in exhaust catalysts for cars.
Gencor's subsidiary Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd is the world's second largest supplier of platinum after
Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd which belongs to Anglo American.

Were the merger of Impala with Lonrho's mining interests in South Africa to be allowed, it would control about 30 percent of total world output. Rustenburg also accounts for about 30 to 35 percent of total supply.

The Commission has only blocked four mergers since it became the clearing house for major corporate agreements affecting the EU's market. Although the present deal involves mainly South Africa, it falls within the Commission's ambit because both companies have substantial operations in Europe.

In December the Commission started a detailed four-month investigation into the operation due to fears it would have an adverse effect on competition. The recent building by Anglo American of a substantial stake in Lonrho has aggravated such fears.

ZURICH, April 23 (Reuter) - Gencor may reach a compromise with the European Union, which is said to be ready to block the proposed merger of the platinum interests of Lonrho  plc and Gencor Ltd, Gengold's Managing Director Tom Dale said.

"I would be surprised if there wasn't some kind of compromise," Dale, who is from the gold division of the firm, told Reuters during a gold conference in Zurich.

Some of the 20 European commissioners are unhappy with the decision, but unless the firms change the deal to solve competition problems, there was little doubt that the operation would be blocked on Wednesday, sources said on Monday.
"I wouldn't get disappointed until I hear what the news is," Dale added.

Under the proposed deal, Lonrho plans to take a 32 percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, the world's second largest producer of platinum.

Impala had shown a lot of tenacity in the past in consumating difficult deals, said Dale. --Eric Onstad, Zurich newsroom

BRUSSELS, April 23 (Reuter) - European Commission sources said on Tuesday they saw no way of rescuing the merger of the platinum interests of Gencor and Lonrho  and it would be blocked on Wednesday.
"They have proposed changes but they were behavioural not structural, and that we could not accept," one
Commission source said.

The source played down opposition from some influential European Commissioners in recent meetings on the case saying that it had either faded away or the commissioners would not be present at Wednesday's meeting when the Commission will take a decision by a simple majority.

Research Commissioner Edith Cresson and Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, two commissioners known to have expressed doubts about blocking the deal, are among those not expected to attend.

The sources also said that there had been several complaints from car manufacturers regarding the deal under which Lonrho plans to take a 32 percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, which will create one of the world's biggest platinum suppliers.
The source declined to say who had complained.

Other senior commission officials had said on Monday that the car industry, which uses platinum in exhaust catalysts, had not expressed any concern about the deal.

BRUSSELS, April 23 (Reuter) - European Commission sources said on Tuesday they saw no way of rescuing the merger of the platinum interests of Gencor and Lonrho  and it was expected to be blocked on Wednesday.
"They have proposed changes but they were behavioural not structural, and that we could not accept," one
Commission source said. The source did not elaborate on the changes offered.

The Commission's merger task-force, which prepares decisions on large corporate deals, has concluded that the operation would result in the platinum market being controlled by two players -- the merged company and Rustenburg Platinum Holdings, a subsidiary of Anglo American of South Africa.

The draft proposal was overwhelmingly supported by national government anti-thrust officials at a recent meeting in Brussels.

Lonrho and Gencor may decide to withdraw the notification of the deal, which they submitted to the Commission for clearance in November, if they feel that a compromise is not possible.

This was apparently not the view of an official at Gencor's mining arm who said earlier on Tuesday in Zurich, Switzerland, he believed a last-ditch deal could be found.
"I would be surprised if there wasn't some kind of compromise," Gengold's Managing Director Tom Dale told
Reuters during a gold conference.

Dale may have been encouraged by the fact that five influential members of the Commission were unhappy with the plan to block the deal.

But the Commission sources played down the opposition, saying that it had either faded away or the commissioners would not be present at Wednesday's meeting when the Commission is to take a decision.

Research Commissioner Edith Cresson and Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, two commissioners known to have expressed doubts about blocking the deal, are among those not expected to attend. The decision requires a simple majority.

The sources also said that there had been several complaints from car manufacturers regarding the deal under which Lonrho would acquire a 32-percent stake in Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings. They declined to say who had complained.

Other senior Commission officials had said on Monday that the car industry, which uses platinum in exhaust catalysts, had not expressed any concern about the deal. This and other reasons meant the five commissioners were reluctant to prohibit the merger.

The Commission has only blocked four mergers since it became the clearing house for major corporate agreements affecting the EU's market in 1990.

But other corporate giants like Procter and Gamble and Kimberly-Clark have been forced to sell off some of their holdings to get EU approval for merger plans.

Although the Lonrho/Gencor deal involves mainly South African firms, it falls within the Commission's ambit because both companies have substantial operations in Europe.

EU platinum veto would hit Gencor most.

LBA

(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
LONDON, April 23 (Reuter) - Any  European Commission veto of the planned  merger to create one of the world's largest platinum firms would be a blow to South Africa's  Gencor, while it would leave  Lonrho  fairly unscathed, analysts said on Tuesday.
Their comments came shortly after Commission sources told Reuters in Brussels that there is little chance the  EU
will give the green light to the link-up of  Gencor's and Lonrho's  platinum operations.

An EU blockage, expected on Wednesday, would thwart Gencor's plans to become a leading player in the platinum market which is currently dominated by arch rival Anglo American Corp.

For Lonrho, however, the merger, which was first announced in the summer of 1995, is just one of several options to streamline its widely diversified businesses.

Analysts believe the British conglomerate should have no problems finding another buyer for its platinum interests if a merger with Gencor is blocked. "It would be more of a problem for Gencor," said Roger Chaplin, analyst at broker Hoare & Co.

A European veto would be extra hard to swallow for Gencor as Anglo American has recently manoeuvered into position to swoop on Lonrho's coal and gold mining interests once they are demreged.
A Gencor-Lonrho platinum merger would lead to a firm about as big as Anglo-American's Rustenburg Platinum
Holdings Ltd, which accounts for about 30 to 35 percent of world output.

Sources at the European Commission said the car industry, which uses platinum in exhaust catalysts, objected to a new combination.

Anglo American, which recently acquired an option to raise its Lonrho stake to over 30 percent, can safely be ruled out as a potential buyer for Lonrho's platinum business because such an acquisition would lead to even greater objections within the European Commission.

But a company such as Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd would probably make an acceptable buyer, said analysts.

"Lonrho will have to try and sell the platinum interests before striking any closer tie-up with Anglo-American. That shouldn't be aproblem: there are potential purchasers out there," said Paribas' Charles Kernot.

LONRHO FACES BLOCK ON DEAL.
By Jon Ashworth.

The European Commission is expected today to block a proposed multimillion-pound link-up between  Lonrho, the hotels to mining group, and Gencor, the South African mining company. The  deal would create one of the world's biggest suppliers of platinum, raising monopoly fears in the  European motor industry, which uses platinum in catalytic converters.

The intended  merger of Impala  Platinum,  Gencor's subsidiary, with Lonrho's  platinum interests has been stalled since November pending the outcome of an  EC inquiry. The deal has been approved by shareholders and cleared by South African competition authorities. In spite of that, commissioners are expected to bow to the motor lobby and block the  merger.

A negative move by Brussels would complicate life for Lonrho, which plans to divest its mining interests. Gencor has a 27% stake in Lonrho's platinum division. Developments will be watched closely by Anglo American, Gencor's rival, which has first pick of the bulk of Lonrho's mining portfolio. Anglo American last month took an option over 18.4% of Lonrho shares, lifting effective control to 28.5%.
Opponents of the link-up include tribal chiefs in South Africa and Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's founder. Not Available for Re-dissemination.

(ADDS quotes, details, warning  to Anglo-American)
Angus MacKinnon

(Copyright 1996)
BRUSSELS, April 24 (AFP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked a  platinum merger between British conglomerate  Lonrho  and South Africa's  Gencor because of fears the new company and its only rival, Anglo American, would use their stranglehold on the world market to fix prices.

"If we had allowed this  merger a duopoly would have been created that would have allowed these companies to dominate the world markets for  platinum and rhodium," Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said.

Van Miert also issued a warning that an Anglo-American takeover bid for Lonrho would be opposed on similar grounds by his powerful anti-trust directorate.

Earlier this month Anglo-American acquired rights to buy a 18.4 percent stake in Lonrho owned by its chief executive Dieter Block. If exercised by the September deadline, the acquisition of this stake would make the South African mining giant Lonrho's biggest shareholder with a 25.9 holding.

Van Miert said the possibility of Anglo-American exercising control of Lonrho had been a factor in the decision to block the Lonrho-Gencor tie-up and reject arguments that it would create a powerful pole of competition for Anglo American.

"If we had accepted the merger there was a risk that Anglo American could have gained complete control of platinum production in South Africa, which represents 90 percent of the world's platinum potential."

Lonrho and Gencor agreed in November to merge their platinum operations under South African Impala Platinum Holdings. The new company, valued at two billion dollars, would have had 28 percent of the world market for the metal, against 35 percent held by Anglo American.

Russian suppliers account for most of the rest -- currently about 23 percent -- but about half of the metal currently coming on to the world market is from stocks which are expected to be exhausted in two to three years.

New Russian output has fallen sharply and become unreliable because of technological and financial problems since the collapse of the Soviet Union, making it unlikely that it will remain a significant alternative source of metal for the forseeable future, the commission judged.

In deciding to block the merger the commission also took the very rigid structure of the platinum market into account.

Metal futures markets in London, New York and Tokyo account for less than 20 percent of trade in platinum, the remainder being determined by long term contracts.

In addition, demand from the main users of platinum -- the jewellery and automobile industries -- is relatively stable, giving buyers little room for negotiation.

The highly concentrated nature of the market made it difficult to envisage how the two companies could amend their proposed merger to make it acceptable, Van Miert admitted. Neither group however had shown any willingness to cooperate in seeking solutions. "Time and again we were told 'That's the deal, take it or leave it,'" he said.

Gencor's solitary concession had been to offer guarantees that it would not reduce production or investment levels to boost prices but the commission rejected these as it would have no legal means of enforcing such an agreement, Van Miert said.

Although the proposed merged group would have been based in South Africa, it came under the commission's jurisdication because the two parents companies have a combined turnover of more than 6.5 billion dollars per year and more than 325 million dollars each within the EU.
Van Miert said the decision had been fully cleared with the South African authorities.

"Our contacts revealed a sympathy for what the commission is doing. There is a clear concern in South Africa about the extent to which the big conglomerates dominate the economy."

BRUSSELS, April 24 (AFP) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked a  platinum merger between British conglomerate  Lonrho  and Gencor of South Africa because of fears the new company and its only rival, Anglo American, would use their stranglehold on the world market to fix prices.

"If we had allowed this  merger a duopoly would have been created that has allowed these companies to dominate the world markets for  platinum and rhodium," Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said.

Van Miert also issued a warning that an Anglo-American takeover bid for Lonrho would be opposed on similar grounds by his powerful anti-trust directorate.

Earlier this month Anglo-American acquired rights to buy a 18.4-percent stake in Lonrho owned by its chief executive Dieter Block. If exercised by the September deadline, the acquisition of this stake would make the South African mining giant Lonrho's biggest shareholder with a 25.9 holding.

Van Miert said the possibility of Anglo-American exercising control of Lonrho had been a factor in the decision to block the Lonrho-Gencor tie-up and reject arguments that it would create a powerful pole of competition for Anglo American.

"If we had accepted the merger there was a risk that Anglo American could have gained complete control of platinum production in South Africa, which represents 90 percent of the world's platinum potential."

Lonrho and Gencor agreed in November to merge their platinum operations under South African Impala Platinum Holdings. The new company, valued at two billion dollars, would have had 28 percent of the world market for the metal, against 35 percent held by Anglo American.

BRUSSELS, April 16 (AFP) - The  EU Commission has blocked a proposed two-billion-dollar  merger of the platinum interests of British conglomerate  Lonrho  and South African  Gencor, the EU executive announced on Wednesday.

The merger would have created one of the two biggest  platinum producers in the world. It was blocked because of fears that further concentration would aggravate a lack of real price competition in the sector, leading to
higher prices for European car and jewellery producers, the Commission said.

Earlier this month Anglo-American acquired rights to buy an 18.4 percent stake in Lonrho owned by its chief executive Dieter Bock (eds: correct). If exercised by the September 1997 deadline, the acquisition of this stake would make the South African mining giant Lonrho's biggest shareholder with a 25.9 percent holding.

Van Miert said the possibility of Anglo-American exercising control of Lonrho had been a factor in the decision to block the Lonrho-Gencor tie-up and reject arguments that it would create a powerful pole of competition for Anglo American.

"If we had accepted the merger there was a risk that Anglo American could have gained complete control of platinum production in South Africa, which represents 90 percent of the world's platinum potential."
The commission said three large platinum consumers had opposed the deal, including two Japanese companies. Lonrho and Gencor agreed in November to merge their platinum operations under South African Impala Platinum
Holdings. The new company, valued at two billion dollars, would have had 28 percent of the world market for the
metal, against 35 percent held by Anglo American.

Russian suppliers account for most of the rest -- currently about 23 percent -- but about half of the metal currently coming on to the world market is from stocks which are expected to be exhausted in two to three years.

New Russian output has fallen sharply and become unreliable because of technological and financial problems since the collapse of the Soviet Union, making it unlikely that it will remain a significant alternative source of metal in the longer term, the commission judged.

Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, slammed the decision to block the deal. "The commission has ignored compelling evidence that this merger is based on the soundest pro-competitive rationale," he said in a statement in Johannesburg.

Lonrho's Bock said he was "puzzled" that the commission had chosen to prevent a transaction to which European consumers had very little exposure and over which "few, if any, had expressed reservations."

In deciding to block the merger the commission also took the very rigid structure of the platinum market into account.

Metal futures markets in London, New York and Tokyo account for less than 20 percent of trade in platinum, the remainder being determined by long-term contracts.

EU/COMPETITION - TOWARDS A BAN ON THE GENCOR-LONRHO MERGER (PLATINUM SECTOR)?

Brussels, 23/04/1996 (Agence Europe) - The European Commission is expected on Wednesday to take a stand on the merger of certain activities of Gencor and Lonrho,  a very controversial operation which would result in one of the largest platinum suppliers in the world. According to Community sources, several car manufacturers (which use platinum in catalytic converters) object to some anti-competitive aspects of this operation. The amendments proposed by the parties during the talks with the Commission would be limited to behavioural rather than structural commitments, which the Commission feels would not eliminate all risk of excessive dominance.
Therefore, a "veto" will probably be seriously considered in Brussels, against the advice of certain members of the
Commission, the same source indicated.

EU Blocks  Lonrho-Gencor Platinum Merger; Cites Dominant  Market Share

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked the  merger of the platinum
interests of  Gencor Ltd. of South Africa and Britain's  Lonrho  PLC.

EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said "this alliance would lead to the creation of a dominant duopoly on the global  platinum market."

The Lonrho-Gencor merger would have given each company a 28 percent share of the world market, he said in a statement said.

South Africa's other large platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum Corp., would control 35 percent of the market, the statement said.

Between them, Van Miert said, the two South African groups would thus control 90 percent of world platinum reserves.

The European Commission said South African authorities had been kept informed on the progress of its investigation since the end of last year.
Gencor's platinum business, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., said on Wednesday it planned to appeal the decision. Under EU rules the Commission can block mergers of both European and non-European companies if it feels
these impedes fair trade within the 15-nation EU.

BRUSSELS, April 24 (Reuter) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked a proposed  merger of the
platinum interests of South Africa's Gencor and Britain's  Lonrho.

It said in a statement the  deal would have created a duopoly in the  platinum and rhodium market that was against European Union competition interests.

"The merger between Gencor and Lonhro would have enabled these two companies to be equal in the platinum market with... South African group Amplats (Anglo American Platinum Corporation)," the Commission said in a statement.
It said the merged company would hold 28 percent of the market with Amplats holding 35 percent. In Johannesburg, Gencor's owner Impala Platinum holdings said it would appeal.
The Commission emphasised its concern about the potential dominance in platinum supply of the two groups, which it said would control 90 percent of the world's reserves.

There was an absence of a real alternative, the Commission said, noting that Russia only had 10 percent of world reserves.

"The reduction in their stock levels which they have started in 1990 should reduce their stocks to almost zero by the end of the century," its said.
Platinum is used mainly in jewellery, car catalytic converters and industry.
It was only the fifth time the EU executive had blocked a merger under European Union monopoly law. (c) Reuters Limited 1996

LONDON, April 24 (Reuter) - A Europeam Commission decision to block the proposed  merger of the platinum interests of  Gencor and Lonrho  is in Lonrho  shareholders' best interests, its former chief Tiny Rowland said on Wednesday.

"It is very good for shareholders because it was a bad deal. Now the board can try again and enhance shareholder value," a spokesman for the former Lonrho  head told Reuters.
The spokesman added he thought the best option would be a flotation of Lonrho's platinum interests. "We want to see a float," he said.
But industry sources close to Lonrho, which is now managed by chief executive Dieter Bock, expressed surprise at the move.

"It is surprising the EU has decided to block a transaction that had little exposure to European consumers," one source said, adding that Lonrho remained confident about its platinum interests and was exploring other options.

The planned merger of Gencor and Lonrho's platinum interests would have created one of the world's largest platinum firms.

EU blocks  Gencor/Lonrho platinum merger.
By Amelia Torres

LBA
English
(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Reuter) - The  European Commission, fearful of handing the world's lucrative  platinum market to just two producers, blocked South Africa's  Gencor and British-based  Lonrho  on Wednesday from merging  their platinum businesses.

In unusually blunt terms, it also warned  platinum giant Anglo Americanit would face the same fate were it to try to take control of  Lonrho.

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said there was no alternative to banning the deal, as it would have left the platinum market in the hands of two big players and possibly one if Anglo American -- currently the world's largest supplier -- increased its Lonrho stake.

It was only the fifth time the Commission had blocked a merger since it was given the right, in 1990, to vet all major corporate mergers or takeovers that affect the 15-nation market.
In Johannesburg, Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings said it would appeal.

But Lonrho's former chief Tiny Rowland, who left the company in March 1995 after a bitter fight with new chief executive Dieter Bock, was all applause.
"It is very good for shareholders because it was a bad deal," Rowland's spokesman said in London. Bock struck a deal in April to give Anglo American an option to buy his 18.4 percent stake in Lonrho. The Commission said that allowing the Gencor-Lonhro merger would have created a duopoly.
"The merger between Gencor and Lonhro would have enabled these two companies to be equal in the platinum market with... South African group Anglo American Platinum Corporation," the Commission said in a statement.

Gencor and Lonrho together would have controlled 28 percent of the platinum market, the Commission said. Anglo American has a 35 percent share of the world's production through its subsidiary Rustenburg Platinum Holdings. The three South African mining giants control 90 percent of the world reserves in the highly priced metal.
Russia is also a major supplier with 23 percent of the total world output, but about half comes from stocks.

"The Russians have only 10 percent of the world reserves, and the reduction in their stock levels which they have started in 1990 should reduce their stocks to almost zero by the end of the century," it said.
At a news conference, Van Miert issued the warning to Anglo American.

"If ever, and this is a warning, Anglo-American should acquire control of Lonrho, we would have the same problem," he said in a reference to Anglo's stake in Lonrho and its moves to increase it.

If this was to happen the Commission would have to assess whether Anglo American would gain effective control of Lonrho, or whether the increased stake could give rise to coordinated anti-competitive behaviour.

Van Miert implied that the Commission could not find a way of making changes to the deal that would have allowed it to be approved because of a lack of cooperation between the two merging companies.

"We never had a chance to discuss remedies," he said. "A rendez-vous fixed with Gencor's chief executive officer had to be put off because the shareholders of Lonrho did not want him to see me."

JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Reuter) -  Gencor Ltd's Impala  Platinum  Holdings (Implats) said on Wednesday it would appeal against a  European Commission ruling which blocked its  merger with the  platinum interests of Lonrho.

"Michael McMahon, chairman of Implats, indicated his disappointment with the verdict, which he said would be appealed," a spokeswoman said.

"He said the Commission has ignored compelling evidence that this merger was based on the soundest pro-competitive rationale," she said.
"The parties will study the EC's decision and reconsider their options before making further comments." She said a further statement would probably be released on Friday.
The European Commission earlier said it had blocked the proposed merger, because it would have created a duopoly in the platinum market that was against European Union interests.

EU platinum merger block blow to Implats.
By Melanie Cheary
735 words
24 April 1996

LBA
English
(c) 1996 Reuters Limited
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Reuter) - Impala  Platinum  Holdings' appeal against the  EU's decision to block the proposed merger with Lonrho's  platinum interests could delay any development by at least a year, analysts said on Wednesday.
This, with no promise of a go-ahead after appeal, could throw  Gencor's Implats into dire straits, they added. The EU said on Wednesday it would block the merger on grounds it would create a duopoly that was against
European Union interests. Gencor Ltd's Implats responded by saying it would appeal against the decision.

Commenting on Implats' statement it would reshape its proposal so that the merger did not fall under EU jurisdiction, an analyst, who asked not to be identified, said: "It is most definitely not inevitable the merger will go ahead."

Analysts said the EU's decision to block the merger painted an intriguing landscape of future possibilities and uncertainties - which could include a guest appearance by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.

"The merger between Gencor and Lonrho would have enabled these two companies to be equal in the platinum market with...South African group Amplats (Anglo American Platinum Corp)," the EU said in a statement.

The merged company would have held 28 percent of the world's platinum market, with Amplats holding 35 percent.
Analysts said the decision would be a blow to Implats.

"The merger cannot proceed for possibly up to a year, while the European court hears about it. If the appeal fails then accessing low cost reserves is their (Implats) problem," said George Topping, analyst at Irish Menell Rosenberg Inc.

"If they can't get Lonrho then they have to access the reserves down dip, probably via decline shafts at a substantial capital cost. This would cap platinum production at a maximum of between 1.1 to 1.2 million ounces of platinum per year."

In announcing the merger block, the EU seized the chance to wave a stick at Anglo about any plans it may have to take control of Lonrho.

"If ever, and this is a warning, Anglo American should acquire control of Lonrho, we would have the same problem," European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said.
Anglo has recently built up its stake in Lonrho. It directly holds 5.9 percent and has a purchase right on a further
18.4 percent of Lonrho. Analysts believe it is aiming for 30 percent.

"Anglo are moving on to Lonrho and are interested in the mining interests, but if the EU has said that Impala can't have those assets then Anglo can't have them either because they're the biggest platinum producer," said an analyst, who asked not to be identified.

With neither Anglo nor Gencor likely to welcome the anti-trust penalties likely to descend on them if they swallowed Lonrho without the EU's blessing, analysts said Lonrho's platinum interests could go to a third party.



Page 62 of 105 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Impala, already holding 27 percent of Lonrho's platinum interests, has the first right of refusal on the remaining shares should they come up for sale. Anglo's Lonrho stake enables it to spoil the re-registration of the company outside Europe.

"By virtue of the fact that both Impala and Anglo can block each other the only real solution is that they sell it to a third party," Topping said, suggesting Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd or RTZ Corp Plc as possible buyers.

"They could float off Lonrho as Lonrho South Africa with just the platinum mines... or they could sell it lock, stock and barrel to a third party which is more likely because Lonrho has already said they wish to dispose of their mining assets."

But whatever happens, analysts agreed that Lonrho would walk away from the scene unscathed, while Implats will take a fall.
"They (Implats) are indeed in a precarious position. It's not looking good for the company at all," said an analyst. The key reason behind the planned merger was the availability of Lonrho's low cost, easy access reserves at
Western Platinum and Eastern Platinum, analysts said.

Implats needs to access low cost reserves to be productive as their Deeps area may not be profitable enough to warrant the large investment in mining infrastructure required to mine it.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union Commission blocked the  merger of the platinum interests of
Gencor Ltd. of South Africa and the U.K.'s  Lonrho  PLC. (LNROY).

The E.U.'s competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said in a statement that ''this alliance would lead to the creation of a dominant duopoly on the global  platinum market.''

The Gencor-Lonrho merger would have given each company a 28% share of the world market, the commission statement said. The other large South African platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum Corp., would control
35% of the market, the statement said. Between them, the commission noted, the two South African groups would thus control roughly 90% of the world's platinum reserves.

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Lonrho  PLC (LNROY) Chief Executive Dieter Bock said he was ''puzzled'' by the European Union (E.U.) Commission's decision to block the  merger of its platinum interests with those of South Africa's Gencor Ltd.
He also said in the prepared statement that ''new and exciting alternatives'' would emerge for  Lonrho.  He said
Lonrho's  platinum operations ''remain in good shape'' and will produce more than 1 million ounces this year.

The comments follow the E.U.'s decision announced earlier today to prevent the alliance. The commission said it would create a dominant duopoly on the global platinum market.

The Gencor-Lonrho merger would have given each company a 28% share of the world market, the commission statement said. The other large South African platinum producer, Anglo American Platinum Corp., would control
35% of the market, the statement said. Between them, the commission noted, the two South African groups would thus control roughly 90% of the world's platinum reserves.

The two companies will meet ''to determine the best long-term strategy,'' but operations will remain independent and unaffected in the short term, the statement said.

Bock said he was puzzled that the commission prevented the transaction ''to which European consumers had very little exposure, and over which few, if any, had expressed reservations.''

JOHANNESBURG (AP-Dow Jones)--Impala Platinum  Holdings Ltd. (Implats) said Wednesday that it will appeal if the European Commission, as expected, rejects its platinum merger proposal with Lonrho  PLC.

The commission is expected to hold a media briefing around 1015 GMT Wednesday, in which it will detail its opposition to the  merger of South Africa's second- and third-largest  platinum producers.

A spokesperson at Implats said the company will issue a press release later Wednesday reacting to the commission's decision. She said the release will likely announce Implats' intention to appeal the verdict.

Earlier Wednesday, the E.U. rejected the coupling of Implats' and Lonrho's  platinum interests citing concerns that it would lead 'to the creation of a dominant duopoly' in world platinum supply, as reported.

In a statement, Implats chairman Michael McMahon expressed 'disappointment with the verdict, which he said would be appealed.' No timetable was given as to when the appeal will be launched, but it is understood Implats has a two-month window of opportunity.

South Africa's  Gencor Ltd. is a global mining group whose subsidiaries are major producers and exporters of a wide range of metals, alloys, and other mineral products including alumina, aluminum, bauxite, coal, gold, ferro alloys, mineral sands, nickel,  platinum, and stainless steel. Address: P.O. Box 61820, Marshalltown 2107, South Africa.

Significant developments: In July 1994, Gencor bought Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Billiton mining assets for $1.20 billion. In October 1994, Gencor merged coal mining unit its Trans-Natal Coal Corp. Ltd. with local rival Randcoal Ltd. to create Ingwe Coal Corp. Ltd., the world's third-biggest coal company.  Gencor and U.K.-based  Lonrho,  in July 1995, announced the  merger of their platinum mines, a deal that was blocked by the  European Union Commission in April 1996. The ruling is likely to be appealed to the  European Court.

In Aug. 1995, Gencor bought an extra 7.7% stake in its ferro-alloy unit Samancor and refinanced Billiton's bank debt. Gencor has changed its year-end to June from August.

Lonrho-Gencor Asset Merger Rebuffed by EU Commission
By Shailagh Murray and Matthew Rose
Special to The Wall Street Journal Europe

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission has rejected a plan to merge the platinum interests of the U.K.'s Lonrho  PLC and Gencor Ltd. of South Africa, and is warning new Lonrho  suitor Anglo American  Platinum  Corp. that its pursuit raises serious antitrust concerns as well.

"We're sounding a warning note to Anglo American here," said competition commissioner Karel Van Miert, in announcing the commission's verdict.

The European Union's antitrust chief is referring to the South African mining giant's recent purchase of 10.1% of Lonrho stock and an option to own a total of 28.5% of the company. Anglo American control of Lonrho would be "absolutely unthinkable from the point of view of competition policy," Mr. Van Miert declared.

In London, Lonrho shares closed at 197.12 pence ($2.99), down less than a penny following the late morning announcement.

Analysts in London expect the verdict may delay Lonrho's planned restructuring, scheduled for this summer. "The strategy is not quite in tatters, but it is in need of putting back together," said Charles Kernot of Paribas Capital Markets.
A spokesman for Lonrho in London declined to comment on whether the ruling would delay the company's plans. In its decision, the commission found that the Gencor-Lonrho deal, with an estimated market value of #1.30
billion, would have created a duopoly controlling 90% of the world's platinum reserves, with Anglo American
representing the other major force. The Russians control 10% of world reserves, but Lonrho, a London-based
hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor in November to merge the two companies' platinum
operations under South African-based Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., or Implats, which is now 46.5%-owned by
Gencor.
Implats Chairman Michael McMahon says his company will appeal the decision with the European Court of
Justice. "The commission has ignored compelling evidence that this merger is based on the soundest
pro-competitive rationale," Mr. McMahon said after the vote.

Implats officials argue that the deal would have given Anglo American its first major competitor. Of 4.5 million ounces of platinum produced globally in 1995, Anglo American accounted for 38%. The company also controls about 85% of mineable platinum reserves in South Africa, the world's leading repository for the metal.

Implats' share of platinum production was 22% in 1995. Lonrho's was 12%, and Russia produced 27% of stocks. The remaining South African reserves are held by Implats, Lonrho, and smaller players.

A commission statement said that Lonrho, which produces platinum cheaper than its main competitor's, has been an important force in lowering platinum prices over recent years. The merger could therefore have led to less competition, the statement stressed.

As the competition commissioner tells it, the Gencor-Lonrho deal was a study in how companies shouldn't react when they have a merger under the commission's microscope.



Page 73 of 105 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sources close to the deal say commission investigators have been doubtful of its legality all along. But Mr. Van Miert said little effort was made over the months to review the commission's concerns and discuss possible changes.

He added that he tried numerous times to meet with a top Gencor official to discuss the case, but that the meeting was scuttled by Lonrho shareholders.

Lonrho founder R.W. "Tiny" Rowland, who was ousted last year by German businessman Dieter Bock, has protested the merger for undervaluing Lonrho's mining assets and ceding too much control to Gencor. Mr. Rowland in March sold his 5.9% stake in Lonrho to Mr. Bock, who sold the shares to Anglo American.

Since then, Anglo American has purchased options on the rest of Mr. Bock's shares to eventually increase its holdings to 28.5%. Anglo American has stated it doesn't intend to make a bid for Lonrho, and analysts say the company is primarily interested in the Ashanti Goldfields Co. in Ghana, in which Lonrho has a 41% stake.

Europe Blocks  Platinum Deal

BRUSSELS, April 24 -- The European Commission rejected a $1.9 billion  merger of the platinum units of
Lonrho  P.L.C. of Britain and Gencor Ltd. of South Africa today and said that it would oppose any other move that
would lead to a loss of competition.

The commission, the European Union's executive agency, said the  merger would have left two groups dominant in platinum: Gencor-Lonrho, with 28 percent of the market, and the Anglo American  Platinum  Corporation of South Africa, with 35 percent.

''This merger clearly created a duopoly able to influence, in a very considerable way, market and prices,'' the union's Competition Commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said at a news conference.
Any attempt by Anglo American to take control of Lonrho would create ''a similar problem'' to the proposed
Gencor-Lonrho alliance and would therefore probably be blocked, Mr. Van Miert added.

Anglo American has taken an option to buy the shares of Lonrho's chief executive, Dieter Bock. Exercising the option would raise Anglo American's stake in Lonrho to 29.5 percent.

Gencor's platinum unit, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., denounced the decision and said it would appeal. Lonrho said it would consult with Gencor to ''determine the best long-term strategy.''

IF YOU felt secure in your knowledge of  Europe's borders, think again, because the  European Commission believes they extend as far as Johannesburg. The Competition Commissioner has decided to block the  platinum merger between Lonrho  and Gencor, arguing that it would create a dominant duopoly between Impala, the merged venture, with 28% of the market, and Anglo American, which accounts for 35% of the world's  platinum.

American regulators will be amused to watch the Commission's extraterritorial jurisdiction Europe has often objected to the long reach of the US Federal Trade Commission. More questionable is the likely effect of the ruling. The commissioner clearly fears that the platinum price is being fixed over lunch in Jo'burg. Were that the case, blocking the Lonrho/Gencor deal will solve little. Before the merger the two companies were already holding hands, with Impala owning 27% of Lonrho's platinum operation while Gencor had 46.5% of Impala.
Europe is a large consumer of platinum, but its consumption of 0.8m ounces pales beside Japan, which absorbs
2.2m ounces, mainly in jewellery, out of the 4.7m produced worldwide annually. But the main influence on the
price is Russia, which has about a quarter of the market and is selling off its stockpiles of the metal in search of
hard currency.
The Commission's desire to kill off another cosy South African cartel may be welcomed, even in that country, but
it has probably achieved only a propaganda victory. Even now, Anglo American is amassing shares in Lonrho and
the prospect of a merger of the platinum interests of those two companies would doubtless be even less tolerable.
In the end, this little problem will probably be solved over lunch in Jo'burg, just as the Competition Commissioner
feared.

EU BLOCKS LONRHO-GENCOR LINK OVER PLATINUM PRICE-FIXING FEAR.

THE European Commission has blocked Lonrho  and Gencor from creating a new  platinum giant because of fears that the company and its only rival, Anglo American, would use their stranglehold to fix prices.

Karel Van Miert,  European Competition Commissioner, said the proposed link-up would have created a duopoly dominating the world markets for  platinum and rhodium. He also gave a warning that any  takeover bid for Lonrho  by Anglo American would be opposed on similar grounds by his powerful anti-trust directorship.

Although the newly merged entity would have been based in South Africa, it came under the Commission's jurisdiction because the two parent companies have a combined turnover of more than $6.5bn a year and more than $325m each within the European Union.

Dieter Bock, chief executive of Lonrho, expressed surprise at the decision, but said Lonrho's platinum operations were unaffected. He was puzzled that the Commission had chosen to prevent a transaction to which European consumers had very little exposure and over which few, if any, had reservations.

Gencor, South Africa's second biggest mining house, said that it would appeal. Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, Gencor's platinum arm, said: "The Commission has ignored evidence that this merger is based on the soundest pro-competitive rationale."
Anglo American recently took an option over 18.4% of Lonrho shares, effectively lifting its stake in the
hotels-to-mining conglomerate to 28.5%. The company is expected to inherit a similar stake in Lonrho's mining
portfolio when Lonrho separates its mining and non-mining interests. Anglo American has said that it is not
interested inrtfolio.

Mr Van Miert said the possibility of Anglo American exercising control of Lonrho had been a factor, and rejected arguments that it would create a powerful pole of competition for Anglo American. "There was a risk that Anglo American could have gained complete control of platinum production in South Africa, which represents 90% of the world's platinum potential."
Lonrho and Gencor agreed in November to merge platinum operations. Impala Platinum Holdings, valued at
$2bn, would have had 28% of the world market, against 35% held by Anglo American Platinum Corporation
(Amplats).

LA COMMISSION A INTERDIT LA FUSION ENTRE LES PRODUCTEURS DE PLATINE GENCOR ET LONRHO.

Bruxelles, 24/04/1996 (Agence  Europe) - La Commission europÃ©enne  a rejetÃ© le projet de  concentration des activitÃ©s relatives au platine du producteur sud-africain Gencor Ltd. Impala  Platinum  Holdings (Implats) et de son concurrent britannique  Lonrho Platinum  Division. Cette opÃ©ration prÃ©sentait en effet un trÃ¨s sÃ©rieux risque de conduire Ã  l'Ã©mergence d'un "duopole dominant les marchÃ©s mondiaux du platine et du rhodium", a indiquÃ© le responsable de la politique communautaire de concurrence en commentant la dÃ©cision prise, ce mercredi, par le CollÃ¨ge.

Un tel duopole, exercÃ© par Gencor-Lonrho et Amplats, l'autre producteur sud-africain, aurait dominÃ© le marchÃ© mondial du platine, avec une part de 70%, et dÃ©tenu l'ensemble des ressources sud-africaines de ce mÃ©tal, a expliquÃ© Karel van Miert, lors d'une confÃ©rence de presse. Ce duopole, a-t-il insistÃ©, "aurait Ã©tÃ© capable d'influencer, dans une mesure tout Ã  fait considÃ©rable, les dÃ©veloppements sur le marchÃ© et, en particulier, l'Ã©volution des prix". "Le comitÃ© consultatif a appuyÃ© l'analyse de mes services et de la Commission", a-t-il soulignÃ©, en signalant Ã©galement que "les autoritÃ©s sud-africaines ont, depuis le dÃ©but, Ã©tÃ© informÃ©es de l'Ã©volution du dossier et ont assistÃ© aux auditions organisÃ©es Ã  Bruxelles". J'admets, a-t-il dit, que le marchÃ© est trÃ¨s spÃ©cifique et complexe mais la Commission n'a pas eu l'opportunitÃ© de discuter avec les parties d'Ã©ventuelles solutions aux problÃ¨mes de concurrence que posait leur projet. M. van Miert a laissÃ© entendre Ã  ce propos que les actionnaires de Lonrho ont Ã©tÃ© particuliÃ¨rement rÃ©ticents Ã  modifier l'accord notifiÃ© et il a indiquÃ© que les remÃ¨des proposÃ©s par Gencor se limitaient Ã  des engagements d'ordre comportemental, de ce fait, "inacceptables pour la Commission" qui ne dispose pas d'instruments juridiques pour en garantir l'application.
D'autant plus que ce projet est Ã  situer dans le contexte de la "bataille entre les deux grands producteurs (Gencor et Amplats) pour le contrÃ´le de Lonrho", une firme prospÃ¨re qui a doublÃ© sa part de marchÃ© au cours de la derniÃ¨re dÃ©cennie, a-t-il ajoutÃ©.

En fusionnant leurs activitÃ©s, les parties seraient devenues l'Ã©gal de Anglo American Platinum Corporation (Amplats) sur ce marchÃ©, avec des parts respectives s'Ã©levant Ã  28% et 35%. Ensemble, les deux producteurs sud-africains contrÃ´lent en outre non moins de 90% des rÃ©serves mondiales de platine. Or, a soulignÃ© M. Van Miert, "du cÃ´tÃ© de l'offre, on note l'absence de rÃ©elles alternatives": ce mÃ©tal est en effet produit dans le monde par les trois grandes compagnies citÃ©es, par une autre en Russie et, pour le restant, par des petits producteurs aux Etats-Unis, au Canada et, depuis peu, au Zimbabwe. La Russie est encore un fournisseur important (23%) mais la moitiÃ© de ses offres provient de stocks et elle ne dispose que de 10% des rÃ©serves mondiales de platine. Selon la Commission, "le mouvement de dÃ©stockage que les Russes ont amorcÃ© depuis 1990 devrait rÃ©duire quasiment Ã  zÃ©ro leurs stocks d'ici la fin du siÃ¨cle", ce qui rÃ©duirait Ã  nÃ©ant la concurrence qu'ils pourraient opposer aux autres grands producteurs mondiaux.

Outre ces Ã©lÃ©ments, la Commission a relevÃ©, au cours de la phase approfondie de son analyse, plusieurs autres facteurs qui confortent l'existence potentielle d'un duopole, en particulier:

1. les Bourses de Londres, New York et Tokyo touchent moins de 20% du commerce du platine, 80% des Ã©changes Ã©tant dÃ©terminÃ©s par des contrats Ã  long terme;

2. pour les trois domaines d'utilisation du platine, la demande est "inÃ©lastique" aux prix, puisqu'il n'existe pratiquement pas de substitut Ã  ce mÃ©tal. Il est principalement utilisÃ© dans la bijouterie (38%), la fabrication de pots catalytiques pour automobiles (32%) et l'application de catalyse dans d'autres secteurs industriels (20%), notamment la chimie, le verre, la production de cristaux liquides pour Ã©crans de tÃ©lÃ©visions et d'ordinateurs);
3. Les acheteurs ont une marge de nÃ©gociation trÃ¨s rÃ©duite;


Page 81 of 105 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
4. Lonrho, dont les coÃ»ts de production sont relativement faibles, avait Ã©tÃ© ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es - mis Ã  part les cessions de stocks russes-un Ã©lÃ©ment de la baisse relative des prix du platine. Son absorption dans la fusion envisagÃ©e signifierait dÃ¨s lors "moins de concurrence sur le marchÃ©".

Il s'agit de la cinquiÃ¨me dÃ©cision nÃ©gative de la Commission au titre du rÃ¨glement sur le contrÃ´le prÃ©alable des fusions; les cas prÃ©cÃ©dents concernaient De Havilland (aÃ©ronautique) et des projets dans le secteur des mÃ©dias. Avant de se prononcer, la Commission a tenu compte des objections qui avaient Ã©tÃ© soulevÃ©es Ã  l'Ã©gard de la dÃ©cision nÃ©gative, concernant notamment: -

l'absence de rÃ©actions nÃ©gatives des industries utilisatrices de platine. En rÃ©alitÃ©, deux gros utilisateurs finaux ont rÃ©agi nÃ©gativement au projet de fusion; -

la disponibilitÃ© de solutions alternatives pour les constructeurs automobiles. La platine ne pourra Ãªtre remplacÃ©e qu'Ã  long terme et moyennant des efforts importants de recherche; -

la possibilitÃ©, Ã  la place de l'interdiction, d'imposer des conditions Ã  la concentration. Les dirigeants des entreprises concernÃ©es n'ont pas voulu prendre en considÃ©ration des solutions alternatives, en
affirmant qu'elles entendaient ne rien changer Ã  leur projet; -

l'influence du prix d'autres mÃ©taux prÃ©cieux (comme l'or) sur le prix de la platine. Le parallÃ©lisme des deux prix ne joue que marginalement et dans un pays particulier.

EU/COMPETITION - COMMISSION OPPOSES MERGER OF PLATINUM OPERATIONS OF GENCOR AND LONRHO.

AS THE JOINT UNDERTAKING WOULD HAVE DOMINATED THE WORLD MARKET IN DUOPOLY WITH AMPLATS.

Brussels, 24/04/1996 (Agence Europe) - The Commission has rejected the proposed  merger of the platinum operations of South African Gencor Ltd Impala  Platinum  Holdings (Implats) and its British rival, Lonrho Platinum  Division. The merger presented a very serious risk of leading to the "creation of a duopoly dominating the world markets for platinum and for rhodium", said the Commissioner responsible for competition policy who commented on this decision taken on Wednesday by the Commission.

Such a duopoly, between Gencor-Lonrho and Amplats, the other South African producer, would have dominated the world platinum market with a 70% market share. It would also have owned all the South African resources of this metal, explained Karel van Miert during a press conference. The duopoly, he insisted, would have been able to influence market developments to quite a considerable extent and mainly price developments. "The advisory committee has given its support to the analysis of my services and those of the Commission", he stressed. He went on to point out that "the South African authorities have, since the beginning of the procedure, been kept informed by the Commission of developments (...) and attended the hearings organised in Brussels in this case". He admitted, however, that the market is very specific and highly complex but the Commission has not had the opportunity to discuss with the parties on possible solutions to the problems of competition posed by their project. Mr van Miert hinted in this connection that Lonrho shareholders have been particularly reticent to modify the agreement notified and pointed out that the remedies proposed by Gencor were restricted to commitments of a behavioural kind and hence "unacceptable for the Commission" which does not have the legal instruments available for guaranteeing their application. All the more as this project must be situated in the context of the
battle between the two major producers (Gencor and Amplats) for control of Lonrho, a prosperous firm that has doubled its market share over the past ten years, he added.

By merging their activities, the parties would have become equal in size to Anglo American Platinum Corporation (Amplats) on this market, with respective shares of 28% and 35%. Together, the two South-African producers control no less than 90% of world platinum reserves. Mr van Miert noted that "on the supply side, the absence of real alternative is relevant": the metal is in fact produced worldwide by the three main above-mentioned companies, by another in Russia and, for the remainder, by small producers in the United States, Canada and, recently, by Zimbabwe. Russia is still a major supplier (23%) but half of its supplies come from stocks and it only has 10% of world platinum reserves. According to the Commission, "the reduction in their stock levels which they started in 1990 should reduce their stocks to almost zero by the end of the century", which would reduce to nothing the competition that they could represent for the other large world producers.

In addition to these factors, during the indepth phase of its analysis, the Commission raised several other factors that confirm the potential existence of duopoly, notably: 1. The London, New York and Tokyo exchanges transact less than 20% of the trade in platinum, 80% of the trade being determined by long-term contracts.
2. The three major uses for platinum are jewellery (38%), the manufacture of motor car catalytic converters (32%)
and catalysis applications in industry (20% - specifically in chemicals, glass manufacturing, the production of
liquid crystals for TV and computer screens). However, for these three fields of application the demand for
platinum is "inelastic", at current prices, since there are practically no substitutes for platinum. 3. Purchasers have
a very small margin for negotiation.

4. Lonrho, whose production costs are relatively low, has, in recent years, been - in addition to the Russian stock liquidation - an element of the relative fall in the platinum price. Its absorption in the planned merger would therefore mean less competition in the market.

This is the fifth negative Commission decision under the regulation on prior control of mergers. The previous cases concerned De Havilland (aeronautics) and projects in the media sector. Before taking its decision, the Commission took into account the objections raised to a negative decision. They concern in particular:

- the lack of negative reaction from platinum user industries. In reality, two large endusers reacted negatively to the merger project;

- the availability of alternative solutions for motor vehicle manufacturers. Platinum can only be replaced at long term after major research efforts;

- the possibility, instead of a ban, of imposing merger conditions. Company directors concerned have not wished to take alternative solutions into consideration, affirming that they intended changing nothing to their project;

- influence of the price of other metals (like gold) on the price of platinum. The parallelism between the two prices only has a marginal role and in a particular country.

Lonrho,  Gencor unfazed by EC.(European Commission rejects plan to mergeplatinum operations of

LONDON -- The European Commission's rejection Wednesday of a plan to  merge the platinum operations of
Lonrho  Plc and the Gencor Group surprised executives, but they expressed determination to pursue the  merger.

Dieter Bock, chief executive of  Lonrho  in London, said the two companies would consult with each other "to determine the best long-term strategy from the available options."

In South Africa, Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, Gencor's platinum unit, said the verdict would be appealed. "The commission has ignored compelling evidence that this merger is based on the soundest
pro-competitive rationale."

In finding against the merger, the EC said it would create a "duopoly dominating the world markets for platinum and for rhodium."

The ruling goes on to note that the combined companies would have a 28-percent platinum market share, on par with Amplats, another South African group owned by Anglo American Corp. that has a 35-percent share. The Russians, while holding a 23-percent market share, are using stockpiled metal to supply half of metal sold.
Furthermore, it said that the two South African groups control 90 percent of the world reserves.

The EC noted that while 20 percent of the metal is sold on exchanges, 80 percent is sold by long-term contracts. Demand from the three major uses for platinum--jewelry, auto catalysts and industrial catalysts--is price inelastic and purchasers have little margin for negotiation, it said.
Implats said Wednesday it would make a further statement on the EC decision on Friday.

"While the transaction was designed to improve the long-term future of both companies, our platinum operations remain in good shape and will produce over 1 million ounces of platinum group metals this year," Lonrho's Bock said.
Lonrho has stated that it plans to separate itself into two companies, one mining and one non-mining. Document amm0000020011013ds4p000yj

Lonrho-Gencor Platinum Merger Is Rebuffed by EU Commission

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission has rejected a plan to merge the platinum interests of the U.K.'s Lonrho  PLC and Gencor Ltd. of South Africa, and is warning new Lonrho  suitor Anglo American  Platinum  Corp. that its pursuit raises serious antitrust concerns as well.

"We're sounding a warning note to Anglo American here," said competition commissioner Karel Van Miert, in announcing the commission's verdict.

The European Union's antitrust chief is referring to the South African mining giant's recent purchase of 10.1% of Lonrho stock and an option to own a total of 28.5% of the company. Anglo American control of Lonrho would be "absolutely unthinkable from the point of view of competition policy," Mr. Van Miert declared.
In London, Lonrho shares closed at 197.12 pence ($2.99), down less than a penny.

Analysts in London expect the verdict may delay Lonrho's planned restructuring, scheduled for this summer. But, a spokesman for Lonrho declined to comment on whether the ruling would delay the company's plans.

In its decision, the commission found that the Gencor-Lonrho deal, with an estimated market value of #1.30 billion, would have created a duopoly controlling 90% of the world's platinum reserves, with Anglo American representing the other major force. The Russians control 10% of world reserves, but Lonrho, a London-based hotel, trading, and mining conglomerate, agreed with Gencor in November to merge the two companies' platinum operations under South African-based Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., or Implats, which is now 46.5%-owned by Gencor.
Implats Chairman Michael McMahon says his company will appeal the decision with the European Court of
Justice.

Implats officials argue that the deal would have given Anglo American its first major competitor. Of 4.5 million ounces of platinum produced globally in 1995, Anglo American accounted for 38%. The company also controls about 85% of mineable platinum reserves in South Africa, the world's leading repository for the metal.

Implats' share of platinum production was 22% in 1995. Lonrho's was 12%, and Russia produced 27% of stocks. The remaining South African reserves are held by Implats, Lonrho, and smaller players.

A commission statement said that Lonrho, which produces platinum cheaper than its main competitor's, has been an important force in lowering platinum prices over recent years. The merger could thus have led to less competition, it stressed.

Sources close to the deal say commission investigators have been doubtful of its legality all along. But Mr. Van Miert said little effort was made over the months to review the commission's concerns and discuss possible changes.

Lonrho founder R.W. "Tiny" Rowland, who was ousted last year by German businessman Dieter Bock, has protested the merger for undervaluing Lonrho's mining assets and ceding too much control to Gencor. Mr. Rowland in March sold his 5.9% stake in Lonrho to Mr. Bock, who sold the shares to Anglo American.

Since then, Anglo American has purchased options on the rest of Mr. Bock's shares to eventually increase its holdings to 28.5%. Anglo American has stated it doesn't intend to make a bid for Lonrho.

COMMISSION VETOES LONRHO METAL MERGER.
By Julie Wolf in Brussels.

THE European Commission yesterday blocked  Lonrho  and Gencor from merging  their platinum operations and warned that Anglo American will run into similar difficulties if it takes control of Lonrho.  Between them the three companies control 90% of the world's  platinum reserves.

Exercising its power to veto mergers on competition grounds for only the fifth time, the commission said the  deal would have allowed the world's platinum market to be dominated by two big players - Anglo American and the merged Lonrho-Gencor. This could have led to price-fixing or other anti-competitive practices, the competition commissioner, Karel Van Miert, said.

He added that the commission would look unfavourably on any move by Anglo American to increase its share of Lonrho to a controlling stake. "If ever, and this is a warning, Anglo American should acquire control of Lonrho, we would have the same problem," Mr Van Miert said.

Lonrho chief executive Dieter Bock said he was puzzled that the commission had chosen to block a deal to which European consumers had very little exposure. He said: "In the light of this decision, the parties will consult with each other ... to determine the best long-term strategy".

In South Africa, Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings, known as Implats, said it would appeal against the commission's decision. Under EU law, the company can appeal to the European Court of Justice, but a ruling will take more than a year.

Alternatively, Gencor and Lonrho could try to revamp the merger to satisfy the EU, although Mr Van Miert said such a move would be difficult given the extent of the commission's objections.

Mr Van Miert indicated that the two companies had been unwilling to consider any substantial changes to the deal. "We never had a chance to discuss remedies. A rendezvous fixed with Gencor's chief executive officer was put off because the shareholders of Lonrho did not want him to see me."

The commission's move was good news for Tiny Rowland, the Lonrho founder who left the company last year and failed to get Lonrho shareholders to reject the platinum deal. Mr Rowland contends the merger undervalued Lonrho's mining assets and could presage greater control by Gencor.

EUROPE VETOS LONRHO PLATINUM MERGER.

The European Commission has emphatically rejected the proposed $1.9bn (#1.26bn)  merger of the platinum interests of Britain's  Lonrho  and Gencor of South Africa, and warned that it would block any further move to restrict competition in the industry.

The EU's competition directorate said the combination would have left two groups dominating the  platinum market, controlling 28 per cent of the market, with Anglo American  Platinum,  part of the eponymous South African mining giant, holding 35 per cent.

Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's ousted chief executive, welcomed the decision. A spokesman said: "It is very good for shareholders because it was a bad deal. Now the board can try again and enhance shareholder value."

But the European veto is a blow to the current management of both companies. The blocked deal involved folding cross-shareholdings in South Africa's Eastern and Western Platinum groups into Gencor's Impala Platinum to create a group to rival Anglo American's Rustenberg Platinum operation. It comes just ahead of the proposed demerger later this year of Lonrho's mining interests, which Anglo is expected to dominate. Earlier this month it took an option over the 18.4 per cent held by chief executive Dieter Bock, which could give it just under 30 per cent of the group. That was seen as giving Anglo effective control over Lonrho's mining side after the demerger.
But the EU indicated that any move by Anglo on Lonrho's platinum interests would also meet a frosty reception. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the Lonrho-Gencor merger "clearly created a duopoly able to
influence, in a very considerable way, market and prices". The veto, only the fifth since the Commission assumed
its competition powers in 1990, sent "a clear signal" that the Commission wants to keep three companies in the
platinum market, Mr Van Miert said. Any attempt by Anglo American to take control of Lonrho would create "a
similar problem" to the proposed Gencor-Lonrho alliance and would therefore probably be blocked, he added.
Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, said they would appeal against the Commission's decision. "The
Commission has ignored compelling evidence that this merger is based on the soundest competitive rationale",
he said.

Mr Bock said he was "puzzled" by the decision, given that the merger would have had very little effect on European consumers. Lonrho shares fell a further 0.5 pence to 197.5p. Although Lonrho and Gencor are likely to look at ways of restructuring the deal to obtain approval, Mr Van Miert indicated he could see no way for any similar merger to go ahead.

About a fifth of all platinum sales take place in the EU, giving the Commission a say in what happens in the industry, Mr Van Miert said. The decision was taken with the "sympathy" of the South African government.

EU Blocks  Merger in Platinum  Ruling Is Warning To Anglo-American

The European Commission's decision Wednesday to block a proposed merger between the platinum divisions
of Gencor Ltd. and Lonrho  PLC reflected the high degree of concentration in the global platinum market rather
than a toughened European stance toward  mergers, officials and analysts said.

Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said the decision had been endorsed by South African authorities and should send a warning to Anglo-American Corp. against seeking to acquire market dominance. The South
African mining conglomerate owns nearly 10 percent of London-based Lonrho  and holds an option to  buy the
18.4 percent stake held by Dieter Bock,  Lonrho's  chief executive. Gencor is based in South Africa.

The possibility that Anglo might exercise its option after a Lonrho-Gencor deal "would eventually lead to a complete dominance by Anglo-American, which would be completely unthinkable," Mr. van Miert said. He blamed the rejection squarely on the unwillingness of the companies to discuss divestitures or other measures to limit market concentration.

Mr. Bock said he was "puzzled" by the decision, adding that the proposed merger had elicited few complaints and would have had little direct impact on European consumers.

Under the proposed $2 billion deal, a combination of Lonrho's platinum division and Gencor's Impala Platinum would have controlled 28 percent of the world platinum market, just behind Anglo-American Platinum Corp.'s 35 percent, the commission said.

Implats platinum merger appeal to buy time.

JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Reuter) - Impala Platinum  Holdings (Implats) was unlikely to win an appeal against a European Union decision to block a merger with Lonrho's  platinum interests and was trying to  buy time, analysts said on Thursday.

The European Commission rejected plans to  merge Gencor Ltd's Implats and  Lonrho's  platinum interests as anti-competitive, a decision which Implats said was a blow against which it would appeal.

"If they don't appeal, the agreement comes to an end. The route of appeal would obviously be one way of getting things back in motion...keep the thing alive. If they don't they're in real trouble," said an analyst who asked not to be identified.

"The process could take at least a year, more likely closer to two years...imagine the bureacracy involved," he added.

Analysts believe Implats needs Lonrho's low-cost platinum resources and an appeal would give them time to restructure the merger proposal.

But they are doubtful tinkering with the deal would get past the EC. The only alternative would be to remove it from EU jurisdiction and weather whatever anti-trust storm erupted.

"No matter what they (Implats) do it will still boil down to the same thing, anti-competition. They can't get around the EU. They (EU) are not stupid," an analyst said.

The merged company would have held 28 percent of the world's platinum market, with Anglo American Platinum Corp (Amplats) holding 35 percent. The two companies would have controlled 90 percent of the world's platinum reserves.

When announcing the rejection of the merger, the EU waved a stick at Anglo American Corp of South Africa, warning it against any plans it might have to take control of Lonrho.

"If ever, and this is a warning, Anglo American should acquire control of Lonrho, we would have the same problem," European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said.

Anglo has recently built up its stake in Lonrho and now holds 5.9 percent of the company, with a purchase right on a further 18.4 percent.

Analysts believe it wants 30 percent, but is highly unlikely to gain control of Lonrho's platinum interests. Without the blessing of the EU, such a deal would fall victim to anti-trust penalties.

"If, and when, Anglo gets Lonrho they'll then have a huge stake in their platinum assets besides holding Amplats already. It'll never go ahead...too bad politically," said an analyst.

"If they ever do decide to take Lonrho they would have to say they will relinquish the platinum interests," he added.

Most likely would be a restructured merger proposal to remove it from EU jurisdiction, suggesting that Lonrho's platinum interests could be listed outside Europe or sold to a third party outside the EU.

George Topping, analyst at Irish Menell Rosenberg Inc, said Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd or RTZ Corp Plc could be possible buyers.
But analysts said the situation was fraught because Implats, which already owns 27 percent of Lonrho's Western
Platinum mine, held a right of first refusal on Lonrho's remaining platinum shares if ever they changed hands.
"It's a real mess, if Lonrho wanted to pull out it would have to sell its shareholding to Impala," said an analyst. Analysts said that without the appeal, the Lonrho/Gencor agreement was finished, hurling Implats into dire straits. Implats needs access to low-cost reserves to be productive as their Deeps area may not be profitable enough to
warrant the large investment in mining infrastructure required to mine it.

"Terminating the agreement wouldn't really bother Lonrho that much, but would certainly bother Gencor. Without a doubt Impala's long-term future without this deal would not be as secure," said an analyst who asked not to be identified.

"If they can't get Lonrho they have to access the reserves down dip, probably via decline shafts at a substantial capital cost. This would cap platinum production at a maximum of between 1.1 to 1.2 million ounces of platinum per year," said Topping.

EC blocks  platinum merger

The European Commission, fearful of handing the world's lucrative  platinum market to just two producers, blocked South Africa's  Gencor Ltd. and British-based  Lonrho  PLC yesterday from  merging  their platinum businesses.

In unusually blunt terms, it also warned  platinum giant Anglo American Corp. that it would face the same fate were it to try to take control of  Lonrho.

Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, said there was no alternative to blocking the deal, as it would have left the platinum market in the hands of two big players, and possibly just one if Anglo American -- currently the world's largest supplier -- increased its Lonrho stake.

It was only the fifth time the EC had blocked a merger since it was given the right, in 1990, to vet major corporate mergers and takeovers that affect the 15-nation market.
The commission said that allowing the Gencor-Lonrho deal would have created a duopoly.

``The merger between Gencor and Lonrho would have enabled these two companies to be equal in the platinum market with . . . South African group Anglo American,'' the commission said in a statement.

Gencor and Lonrho together would have controlled 28% of the platinum market, the commission said. Anglo American has 35%, through subsidiary Rustenburg Platinum Holdings. The three South African mining giants control 90% of the world reserves in the highly priced metal.
In Johannesburg, Gencor's Impala Platinum Holdings unit said it would appeal.

But Lonrho's former chief, Tiny Rowland, who left the company in March 1995 after a bitter fight with new chief executive Dieter Bock, was all applause.
``It is very good for shareholders because it was a bad deal,'' Rowland's spokesman said in London. Bock struck a deal in April to give Anglo American an option to buy his 18.4% stake in Lonrho.
At a news conference, Van Miert issued a blunt warning to Anglo American.

``If ever -- and this is a warning -- Anglo-American should acquire control of Lonrho, we would have the same problem,'' he said, referring to Anglo's stake in Lonrho and its moves to increase it.

If this were to happen, the commission would have to assess whether Anglo American would gain effective control of Lonrho, or whether the increased stake could give rise to co-ordinated anti-competitive behavior.

JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Reuter) - Impala Platinum  Holdings said on Friday the  European Commision's decision to block the planned  merger with Lonrho  Plc's platinum interests was an "incorrect judgement".

"The opportunity which this transaction represents to leap down the cost curve in a soundly capitalised company cannot be abandoned because of an incorrect judgement," Implats chairman Michael McMahon said in a statement.

The EC rejected plans to merge Gencor Ltd's Implats' and Lonrho's platinum interests on the grounds that this would be anti-competitive.
McMahon said Implats would appeal the decision but the grounds of appeal would not be made public. Analysts believe Implats needs Lonrho's low-cost platinum resources and an appeal would give them time to
restructure the merger proposal.

McMahon said the EC's criticism of the companies' liaison with it and its claims that it tried to facilitate the transaction were false.

"The factual position is that the companies retained expert advisers to guide all their dealings with the (EC's) Merger Task Force," he said.

He said the EC had not looked into the evidence Implats had presented which showed that the deal promoted competition.

"The parties have presented compelling evidence that the industry is highly competitive and that this merger is based on the soundest pro-competitive rationale. It is clear they have not been heard," McMahon said.

Impala Platinum  Holdings Ltd. (Implats) is South Africa's and the world's second largest  platinum producer. The group owns platinum mines in South Africa's north-west province, as well as Messina Ltd. and Barplats Investments Ltd., two platinum mining companies whose operations were mothballed in 1991. It holds an investment in Western Platinum  Ltd. and Eastern  Platinum  Ltd., unlisted  platinum mining subsidiaries of
London-based Lonrho  PLC.

In late 1995, shareholders at  Lonrho  and Implats agreed to merge their platinum operations. But the amalgamation was blocked in April 1996 by the Brussels-based European Union Commission citing
anti-competition concerns. Implats has appealed the ruling to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

Implats is also re-negotiating royalty payments with the local Bafokeng tribe who contest the legality of the company's mining operations on its sovereign land. Headquarters: P.O. Box 61386 Marshalltown 2107 South Africa.

Impala won't halt platinum merger

Impala Platinum  Holdings Ltd. said Friday it disputes the  European Commission's reasons for rejecting its proposed merger with the  platinum interests of  Lonrho  PLC.
The $2.5-billion  deal was blocked April 24 on grounds it would create a duopoly and stifle competition.

Impala will not abandon the merger, chairman Michael McMahon said. The company declined to disclose details of its appeal, which will be decided by the European Court of Justice.

The Gencor Ltd. unit disputed the commission's suggestions that the companies did not co-operate with its merger task force.

McMahon said he has met senior commission officials four times since early March ``in an attempt to define acceptable remedies to meet the merger task force's concerns.''

Competition commissioner Karel Van Miert told reporters April 24 that, during the five-month European investigation, the companies gave no indication they would modify the alliance to make it less restrictive.

Van Miert added he was ``astonished'' not to be given an opportunity to meet senior Gencor executives. ``The companies said take it or leave it,'' he added.
McMahon disputed commission references to complaints from major customers.

``No major end user of platinum, worldwide, has objected to this transaction and some of the largest have been openly supportive,'' he said.
A ``very small'' European customer voiced concern about supply but withdrew those concerns, he said.

``One major fabricator and one metal trading company, neither based in Europe, and neither of whom is price sensitive, have expressed a regret that the transaction may change long-standing relationships.''

The commission said Wednesday that three companies, two in Japan, had filed complaints about the merger plans.
The commission said the merger would have left two groups dominating the platinum market -- Impala and
Lonrho with 28% and Anglo American Platinum Corp. with 35%.

The veto, only the fifth since the commission assumed its antitrust powers in 1990, sent ``a clear signal'' that the commission wants to keep three companies in the platinum market, Van Miert said.

EC blocks  Impala-Lonrho platinum merger

Impala Platinum,  the platinum arm of South African mining house  Gencor, may be forced re-shape its  merger with UK industrial house Lonrho's  platinum operations to prevent the venture falling under the jurisdiction of the European Commission, following the EC's decision last week to block the current  merger plans. However, the company first plans to contest the decision.

The EC announced Apr 24 that the planned  merger--which would create a venture worth GBP 1.1-bil--will be rejected officially in the wake of a five-month investigation. Implats's senior management, led by chairman Mike McMahon, had spent several days prior to the announcement in  Europe, trying to win approval for the  deal.

The merger would have created one of the two biggest platinum producers in the world. Explaining its decision to veto the proposal, the EC argued that the merger would create a duopoly dominating the world markets for platinum and rhodium. An analysis of the proposed merger conducted by Karel van Miert, commissioner responsible for competition policy, concluded that the merger ``would have enabled these two companies to be equal in the platinum market (28%), with the other South African group Amplats (Anglo American Platinum Corp) (35%).'' This would create a duopoly between the two South African companies in the world market.

The Commission concluded that ``Lonrho's absorption in the planned merger would therefore mean less competition in the market.'' The EC considered the platinum market, noting that although Russia supplied 23% of the market ``half comes from stock.'' It also noted that 80% of platinum trade is determined by long-term contracts, the major consumers of platinum--the jewelry, auto-catalysts and industrial catalysts sectors--had demand that ``is `inelastic' at current prices since there are practically no substitutes for platinum,'' and that purchasers have ``a very little margin for negotiation.'' The EC further cited ``the absence of real alternative'' on the supply side, noting that Lonrho's low production costs have contributed to a relative fall in the platinum price.

A further factor in the decision was Anglo American's recently acquired effective 29.5% stake in Lonrho. Anglo began building its control in Lonrho in March, and confirmed earlier this month that it held 10.5% and a call option over the remaining 18.5% stake held by Lonrho CEO Dieter Bock. Van Miert said Anglo's move destroyed arguments that the merger would create a powerful competitor to Anglo American Platinum. ``There was a risk that Anglo American could have gained complete control of platinum production in SA, which represents 90% of the world's platinum potential,'' he said.

Anglo said Van Miert's statement was ``rhetorical'' as it had no plans to bid for Lonrho. The corporation ducked the issue of its plans for Lonrho's mining operations, which could lead to it controlling the business when it is demerged from the Lonrho group. Analysts said Anglo could try to persuade Lonrho to sell the platinum business and named BHP as a possible buyer.

Implats, for its part, announced it will appeal the EC's decision. ``The parties (Implats and Lonrho) have presented compelling evidence that the industry is highly competitive and that this merger is based on the soundest
pro-competitive rationale. It is clear that they have not been heard,'' said Implats chairman McMahon, adding:
``The opportunity which this transaction represents to leap down the cost curve in a soundly capitalized company
cannot be abandoned because of an incorrect judgment.''

McMahon pointed out that informal discussions prior to the No 17 formal notification between the EC Merger Task Force (MTF) and Implats and Lonrho were ``rejected out of hand by the MTF.'' At the first meeting with the MTF it was stated by the MTF that the merger was ``undesirable'' and would ``result in oligopolistic dominance,'' McMahon said, adding that he has met with senior EC officials on four occasions since the Mar 12 hearing in an

Page 101 of 105 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
attempt to define acceptable ``remedies'' to meet the MTF's concerns. ``In response to a written statement on Mar
27 that remedies should address the main concern of restriction of supply, Impala and Lonrho made formal
undertakings that fully addressed this concern, and offered to make them a conditional part of the transaction
reversible on breach. These were rebuffed,'' McMahon said.

He further argued that no major platinum consumer has objected to the merger ``and some of the largest have been openly supportive.'' He conceded that one very small European customer expressed concerns, but has since withdrawn them, while a major fabricator and a metal trading company, neither based in Europe, have expressed a regret that the transaction may change long- standing relationships. However, ``no `oligopolistic' concerns were raised,'' McMahon said.

Lonrho's Bock said he was ``puzzled'' by the EC's decision, but would discuss the best strategy with Implats and Gencor. However, Lonrho SA chairman Terence Wilkinson, who would have headed the merged company, said it was unlikely Lonrho would join Impala's appeal: ``Litigation is no longer part of the core business of the Lonrho group.''
The decision is nevertheless likely to be welcomed by ousted Lonrho chief Tiny Rowland and the Bafokeng
tribe--currently in dispute with Implats over mining royalties--who have both lobbied the commission against the
plan. Rowland argued that Lonrho's low-cost young mines would be undervalued in a merger with Implats's more
expensive, maturer operations--an argument that found sympathy among some of Lonrho's SA management and
Johannesburg Stock Exchange Analysts.

Reports vary as to the attitude of the South African government towards the merger plan. While there were suggestions last week that the EC ignored last-minute appeals from the South African government to allow the merger to go through, Van Miert claimed the South African authorities had also opposed the merger, and would not be surprised by the decision: ``Our contacts revealed a sympathy for what the commission is doing. There is clear concern in South Africa about the extent to which the big conglomerates dominate the economy,'' he said. Anglo American, which hoped to play a greater role in Lonrho's mining activities after the acquisition of its stake, was unable to say whether it would oppose new merger plans. Analysts said Anglo might attempt to persuade Lonrho to find another buyer for the platinum business.

The European Commission has blocked Gencor and Lonrho's  plans

Recent events prove that companies and their advisers can never assume a  takeover or merger is in the bag until the relevant competition authorities have had their final say - the bid equivalent of the fat lady singing. They also indicate that a certain amount of sweet-talking of relevant parties, though not guaranteed to influence the outcome, is neglected at companies' peril.

Trade and Industry Minister Ian Lang's surprise volte-face last week on the proposed bids by electricity generators National Power and PowerGen for regional distributors turned into a competitions double whammy, when the European Commission revealed that it, too, was throwing out a proposed merger.

This second casualty was the #1.26bn merger of the platinum interests of Lonrho and Gencor. Although the proposition had been sanctioned by the competition authorities in South Africa (where most of the relevant assets are), it has now been thrown out under the European Community Merger Regulation after a rare full four month investigation. To date only 10% of proposed mergers considered by the Commission have needed more than the preliminary one-month inquiry.

Significantly, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has declared himself "astonished" not to have met any senior Gencor executives during the investigation. The companies "had a take it or leave it approach", he said.

Such an attitude, if true, has been described by lobbyists and those used to advising on competition issues as "very stupid". Whatever the faults in Lonrho and Gencor's strategy, they now have the dubious distinction of being behind only the fifth merger proposal ever to be thrown out since the European Commission's European Community Merger Regulation came into effect six years ago.

According to analysts, Gencor and Lonrho really need the merger to go ahead. The two are thought to be planning to appeal against the Commission's decision - which could take a year - and, if still unsuccessful, to attempt a restructuring of the merger to satisfy the Commission. However, Van Miert has already said that any other move resulting in loss of competition in the platinum industry is likely to be blocked.

Under the original terms envisaged by Lonrho and Gencor, almost two thirds of the platinum market would be in the hands of just two players - Anglo American Platinum Corporation with 35%, and the Gencor/Lonrho joint venture with 28%.

Such a potential duopoly in a market crucial to the auto industry, which uses platinum in its catalytic converters, earned the Commission's disapproval. Indeed, Van Miert volunteered that the decision was meant to be "a clear signal" that the Commission intends to keep the three companies operating independently in this market.

And that means that Anglo American, with its potential 28.5% stake in Lonrho, might also think twice about its assumed bid intentions. It, too, could encounter the Commission's resistance if any merger plans led to further consolidation in the European platinum industry.
