European Commission may ground  de Havilland  deal Regulators concerned about resulting clout from
takeover

The European Commission appears on the verge of blocking the long-awaited  purchase  by a French-Italian consortium of the de Havilland  aircraft business, government sources indicated yesterday.

The expected move could lead to a major confrontation between the EC and the federal government, which is anxious to find a buyer for the troubled aircraft maker. De Havilland is owned by Boeing Co. of Seattle and employs about 4,900 at a plant in Downsview, Ont.

The proposed deal has been making headway in Canada since Aerospatiale SA of France and Alenia SpA of Italy sweetened their formal offer for de Havilland last month. The federal government has warmed to the takeover and the Ontario government has removed one of the remaining roadblocks by offering to take an ownership stake in
de Havilland, thereby providing the European consortium with a Canadian partner.

But the takeover proposal seems to be encountering difficulties with EC competition regulators. They announced last spring that they were launching an investigation to determine if the combined clout of Aerospatiale, Alenia and de Havilland would give them a dominant position in the European commuter aircraft market.

Federal officials said yesterday that they think EC regulators are poised to turn down the deal or suggest substantial changes that could kill the takeover in any case. But they believe no formal decision has been made yet. The deadline set by the EC is mid-October.

"There is a real possibility for conflict here," said a federal official. "We have to be guided to some extent by Aerospatiale and Alenia. They presumably know how to work the system in Europe. They are looking at ways to resolve the problem."

EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, on a previously arranged visit to Toronto and Ottawa yesterday, got a hint of the bad feelings that could follow a rejection of the de Havilland bid.
At Queen's Park, Premier Bob Rae said he had a "very vigorous meeting" with Sir Leon, who is effectively the
European Community's minister for competition policy.
Mr. Rae said Ontario and the federal government believe EC rules should not apply to the sale of a company in
Canada.

"But (the EC's) argument is that these are two European companies, and that the activity by those companies . . . could have an impact on competition in Europe," Mr. Rae told reporters.

Sir Leon later confirmed that Mr. Rae had expressed his viewpoint very fully, "indicating that he strongly hoped the merger would go ahead."

Federal Industry Minister Michael Wilson was scheduled to meet Sir Leon last night to discuss the looming dispute. "It's a dinner meeting but you can be sure that they're going to be talking business; not golf or the weather," said an EC official. "The federal government is definitely concerned."


Page 5 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Aerospatiale and Alenia officials refused to comment yesterday. The two companies are major players in the turboprop market worldwide through their joint operation ATR, which builds planes that compete with the various models of de Havilland's Dash 8.

Even if EC competition regulators recommend the deal should be blocked, they do not have the final say. The regulators only make a recommendation to EC commissioners such as Sir Leon, a board composed of representatives from all member countries.

The competition concerns in Europe contrast with the conclusion of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Competition Policy. Sources say the competition bureau recommended earlier this month that the federal government approve the takeover.

Federal officials said yesterday that EC competition regulations, unlike Canada's, have no proviso in which a takeover is more likely to be approved if it involves the purchase of a financially stricken company.

Competition analysts said yesterday that the apparent differences between regulators in Canada and Europe point to the need to better co- ordinate such investigations as international mergers become more common.

Sir Leon and federal Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister Pierre Blais, who oversees federal competition policy, were scheduled to discuss that issue at the dinner meeting last night.

"De Havilland has become the operating example of where we might have problems in the future," said a federal official. "They will be looking at ways to work together in future cases."

EC takes hard look at De Havilland  purchase
201 words
23 September 1991
Agence France-Presse

(Copyright 1991)
BRUSSELS, Sept 23 (AFP) - The  European Community (EC) is taking a hard critical look at a proposed
French-Italian  purchase  of the Canadian aircraft maker De Havilland,  sources here said here Monday.
The EC's executive  commission must rule by mid-October on the bid by  Aerospatiale of France and  Alenia-Air
Italia of Italy to  buy the Canadian firm from the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing.

Informed sources said there were "serious concerns" within the commission that the purchase could stifle competition in the market for commuter aircraft capable of carring 40 to 70 passengers.
The EC started an anti-trust probe of the proposed deal in June following objections from European firms, notably
British Aerospace, that it could violate EC competition rules.
De Havilland makes turbo-prop commuter aircraft. Avions de Transport Regionale (ATR), a firm jointly owned by
Aerospatiale and Air Italia, has a large share of the world market for these aircraft.

Together, they account for about 40 per cent of the market. To safeguard competition, the commission could block the De Havilland purchase or modify the operations of the new venture.

PARIS, Sept 23, Reuter - France's state-controlled Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale hopes the European   Commission will approve its planned joint  acquisition of commuter aircraft maker De Havilland,  an Aerospatiale spokesman said.

"Our hope is that the response will be positive," the spokesman said. "The matter is still being studied and we are waiting for the response."
EC sources earlier said Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is proposing to veto the buyout of De Havilland, a Boeing
Co unit, by Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia SpA.

EC BRITTAN PLANS TO VETO SALE OF DE HAVILLAND.

BRUSSELS, Sept 23, Reuter -  European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan is proposing to veto the  buyout  of De Havilland,  the commuter aircraft division of the Boeing Company, by France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale and Italy's  Alenia SpA,  EC sources said.

Brittan is due to ask his colleagues in the Commission for backing to block the  deal on October 3 or 9 on the grounds that the  buyout  would hurt competition in the European Community's commuter aircraft manufacturing market, the sources said. He faces some opposition from others in the 17-member  Commission, which can veto mergers affecting  EC industry, they added.

The Commission announced a full inquiry into the bid for De Havilland last June, saying it was concerned by the high market share the Franco-Italian group would have in the market for short haul commuter aircraft. The deadline for a Commission decision is October 14.

The sources said Brittan argues that the inquiry has proved worries about the dominance of Aerospatiale and Alenia in the market for small aircraft. But other Commissioners believe the EC market is irrelevant given that competition takes place at global level in the aircraft industry. Brittan needs support from a majority of the 17
Commissioners to stop the deal.

A Commission spokesman declined all comment on the case. But the EC sources confirmed that a meeting would take place to clarify the position of Brittan's colleagues.

If he gets the backing he needs, it would be the first deal blocked by the Commission since it won sweeping powers a year ago to police corporate mergers and safeguard industrial competition within the Community.

British Aerospace and other rivals of the Franco-Italian group have been lobbying the Commission to oppose the buyout, the sources said.

The European Commission is considering barring two  European companies from buying  struggling Canadian aircraft maker De Havilland  from The Boeing Co.,  EC sources said today.

It would be the first deal blocked since the EC won sweeping powers a year ago to veto corporate alliances that could hurt free competition within Europe.

Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, in charge of enforcing EC merger policy, argues the buyout would allow France's Aerospatiale SA and Alenia SpA of Italy to corner the EC commuter aircraft market. The two are already the biggest manufacturers, the sources say.

But he needs backing for the move from his colleagues in the 17-member commission where he faces resistance from some who believe the EC market is irrelevant given that companies in the aircraft industry compete at the world level.

"It's going to be a battle," one source said, adding that the "solidarity test" was crucial for Commission credibility in the face of EC governments who stalled for 16 years before agreeing to give Brussels a major role in policing mergers.

European Commission to rule on de Havilland

The federal government will not make a final decision on a bid by a French-Italian consortium to  buy the Toronto aircraft manufacturer de  Havilland  until after the  European Commission rules on it, a spokesman for Investment Canada said yesterday.

The European Commission, the governing body of the European Community, is to decide by Oct. 14 whether the bid to buy de Havilland  by Aerospatiale SA of France and Alenia SpA of Italy would give the two companies too dominant a position in the commuter aircraft industry.
The commission announced the review during the summer. The federal government at first turned down the
European companies because they lacked a Canadian partner and wanted too much financial help from Ottawa.

The Ontario government has since offered to become a partner in the takeover and the Europeans have improved their offer.
Charles Byron of Investment Canada said in an interview that ''we expect a final decision from the European
Community before a final decision is made here.''

COMMISSION set to block TAKEOVER OF CANADA'S De Havilland  BY AEROSPATIALE AND ALENIA.
By MICHAEL HARRISON, Industrial Editor

In what would amount to a landmark ruling, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner for Competition, is poised to block the takeover of the Canadian aircraft maker De Havilland  by two of Europe's biggest aerospace companies, Aerospatiale of France and Italy's  Alenia.

Sir Leon will seek backing for his decision to veto the  deal from Commission colleagues early next month. If the full Commission supports him it would be the first time Brussels has overruled a  takeover since it was given sole power to vet large-scale Community  mergers a year ago.

The EC's mergers task force, which reports to Sir Leon, has concluded that a merger of De Havilland, a subsidiary of Boeing of the US, and the two state- owned European groups, would harm competition in the growing market for commuter aircraft. The three companies control 50-75 per cent of the market for 20 to
70-seater commuter aircraft. But according to industry estimates last year they accounted for nearly 90 per cent of the worldwide market for 40-to 70-seater turboprop aircraft valued at between $1.2bn and $1.8bn (#689m-
#1bn).
Sir Leon was swayed by complaints from rival European manufacturers British Aerospace and Fokker of The
Netherlands that the merger would severely distort competition.
His recommendation that the deal be blocked will be put to the 17-strong college of Commissioners on 2 or 9
October. The Commission must announce its decision by 14 October.

Sir Leon is certain to face opposition from some Commissioners, possibly including those from France and Italy, because of the sensitive political nature of his decision. However, his recommendation needs only to be approved by a majority vote. Brussels sources also say that soundings taken among member states indicate strong support for Sir Leon.

Last September, the Commission was given sole authority to vet takeovers where the combined turnover of the parties involved exceeds 5bn ecus (#3.5bn) and where the Community-wide turnover of each party exceeds
250m ecus. It has examined 50 mergers and blocked none.

In previous cases the Commission has agreed to approve mergers provided concessions were made by the parties involved. In this case, EC sources say there appear to be no concessions the three companies could make to gain approval.

The world market for commuter aircraft in the 40-70 seater range is dominated by De Havilland's Dash 8-300 and Aerospatiale/Alenia's ATR 47 and ATR 72. Aerospatiale/Alenia sold 85, giving it 71 per cent of the market and De Havilland took 17 per cent of the market with 20 aircraft sales.

The competing aircraft are BAe's Advanced Turbo Prop, of which 50 have been sold since its launch, and the Fokker 50, which has engines made by Rolls- Royce and wings built by Short Brothers of Belfast - a subsidiary of the Canadian group Bombardier.

Aerospatiale maintained yesterday that it was still hopeful of approval for the deal. "The matter is still being studied and we are waiting for the response," a spokesman added.

Deutsche Aerospace, part of Daimler Benz, which has an option to take a stake in De Havilland if the deal goes through, declined to comment.

CANADA STILL EXPECTS TO APPROVE DE HAVILLAND SALE TO EUROPEANS.

TORONTO, Sept 23, Reuter - Canada expects to approve a deal by France's  Aerospatiale SA and  Alenia SpA of Italy to  buy Toronto-based commuter aircraft maker de Havilland,  Canadian government officials said on Monday.

But the European Commission, facing its toughest test yet as an antitrust watchdog, is considering barring the French-Italian consortium from buying  the division from Boeing Co of Seattle, Washington,  commission sources said.

"A deal hasn't been done by the Europeans, but provided a certain number of requirements are met, things are looking very good," said Charles Byron, a spokesman for Investment Canada, the agency that vets all foreign investment in the country.

If Brussels acts to block the deal it would be the first ban since the Commission last year assumed extensive powers under the merger control regulation to review and veto corporate alliances that could hurt free competition in markets within the Community.
Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan argues the buyout would allow Aerospatiale and Alenia to corner the
EC commuter aircraft market where they are already the two biggest manufacturers, the sources say.

But Brittan needs backing for the move from a majority of his Commission colleagues and faces stiff resistance from some who believe the EC market is irrelevant since firms in the aircraft industry compete at the world level.
The Commission has until October 14 to make a decision on the purchase.

Byron said Michael Wilson, Canada's minister of international trade, met with Brittan in Canada late last week to make Canada's position clear.
"We are concerned about de Havilland. We want to see a strong Canadian company there," he said.

Canada turned down the consortium's initial offer in June on the grounds it did not benefit Canada and asked for too much government money -- up to one billion dollars (880 million dollars U.S.).

But on September 9 it announced the federal and Ontario governments were prepared to jointly provide the consortium with research and development grants of 303 million dollars (267 million dollars U.S.) over five years.
The Ontario government is also negotiating with the Europeans for an equity position in the company. Investment Canada said a final decision would not be made until all the negotiations were completed. He said the Canadian decision may not be made until the Commission rules on the deal.
De Havilland, which makes a 30/40-seater plane called the Dash 8, has been a problem for U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing since it bought the firm from the Canadian government for 136 million dollars in 1986.

The European Commission, facing its toughest test yet as an industry watchdog, is considering barring two European companies from buying  struggling Canadian aircraft maker de  Havilland  from The Boeing Co., commission sources said yesterday.

It would be the first  deal blocked since the commission won sweeping powers a year ago to veto corporate alliances that could hurt free competition in European Community industries.

Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, in charge of enforcing EC merger policy, argues the buyout would allow France's Aerospatiale SA and Italy's Alenia SpA to corner the EC commuter aircraft market. The two are already the two biggest manufacturers, the sources say.

But he needs backing from his colleagues on the 17-member commission, where he faces resistance from some who believe the EC market is irrelevant given that companies in the aircraft industry compete at the world level.
In Canada, meanwhile, officials said chances for the deal looked good.

``A deal hasn't been done by the Europeans, but provided a certain number of requirements are met, things are looking very good,'' said Charles Byron, a spokesman for Investment Canada, the agency that reviews all foreign investment in the country.

Canada turned down the consortium's initial offer in June on the grounds it did not benefit Canada and asked for too much government money - up to $1 billion Canadian ($880 million).

But on Sept. 9, it announced that the federal and Ontario governments were prepared to jointly provide the consortium with research and development grants of $303 million Canadian ($267 million) over five years.
Byron said Investment Canada doesn't expect to make its final decision until after the European Community rules. A commission spokesman declined all comment on the case. But the sources told Reuters that Brittan would ask
the commission to decide Oct. 3 or 9, the two last meeting dates before the Oct. 14 deadline for a decision.

British Aerospace and other EC rivals have been lobbying the commission over the past four months to try and get the deal blocked, sources said.

``It's going to be a battle,'' one source said, adding that the ``solidarity test'' was crucial for commission credibility in the face of EC governments that stalled for 16 years before agreeing to give Brussels a major role in policing mergers.
De Havilland, which makes the 30/40-seat Dash 8, has been a problem for Boeing since it bought the
Ontario-based firm from the Canadian government for $136 million in 1986.

Workers  hope sale is killed

OTTAWA - The  European Commission may do de Havilland  workers a favor by killing the proposed
acquisition of the Metro aircraft maker by a French-Italian consortium, a union spokesperson says.

The European Community's competition commissioner has recommended against the cross-Atlantic merger, arguing the combination would give  Aerospatiale and Alenia a virtual monopoly in commuter aircraft in Europe.

Sir Leon Brittan's proposal must now go to the powerful European competition commission, which is expected to rule on the deal by Oct. 14.

Federal Industry Minister Michael Wilson met last week with Brittan to convey Canada's position on the merger. Premier Bob Rae also met the European competition commissioner.

But a spokesperson for the Canadian Auto Workers said the competition commission may play the role of savior for the de Havilland workers.
The Ontario government is now negotiating with the A and A consortium to become a one-third partner in de
Havilland, with strict guarantees on the plant's continuing role in building complete aircraft.
"If I can't get iron-clad guarantees, I'm cheering for the European commission," said CAW local president Jerry
Diaz.

However, Diaz also said that a deal with the Ontario government could, in fact, scuttle the acquisition at the European commission. That's because A and A won't be able to point to the transfer of jobs to Europe in order to offset any competition concerns.

Investment Canada director Charles Byron said his agency wouldn't make a decision on the acquisition until after the European ruling.

In fact, the federal review agency has still not seen an updated proposal from the A and A consortium to include any Ontario government participation.

Brittan  Faces Fight Over Sale Of de Havilland

BRUSSELS -- Sir Leon Brittan likely faces an uphill struggle in his bid to have the European Community Commission block the acquisition of Boeing Co.'s de  Havilland  subsidiary by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia SpA of Italy.

Sir Leon, the  EC's competition commissioner is understood to be seeking an  EC order blocking the acquisition under the community's so-called  merger control regulation. But officials predicted that a majority of Sir Leon's 16 fellow commisioners will oppose the move.
"It's going to be tougher than he thinks," said one EC official.
The purchase of de Havilland could make the Aerospatiale-Alenia consortium the leading player in the
fast-growing world market for commuter aircraft. Sir Leon worries that this would give the Franco-Italian group an
unfair advantage over European competitors such as Fokker NV, British Aerospace PLC and Saab-Scania AB.

In past discussions of the de Havilland deal, however, several of Sir Leon's collegues have taken the opposite view. These officials -- among them Industrial Affairs Commissioner Martin Bangemann -- argued that it would be foolish to prevent a European company from gaining critical mass in such a fast-changing and promising sector
as aircraft manufacturing.

Moreover, Aerospatiale and Alenia are both state-owned. The French and Italian governments would likely strongly object to a negative decision by the EC Commission.

The deal's proponents say the acquisition of de Havilland would give Aerospatiale and Alenia an entry into the North American market, and allow them to widen their product range. The two companies' Avions de Transport Regional joint venture produces the ATR-42 and ATR-72 commuter plane models, while de Havilland makes two versions of its Dash-8 plane. With the acquisition of Toronto-based de Havilland, ATR would have roughly half of the world market for commuter aircraft in the 40-seat to 70-seat range.

The Commission opened an investigation of the de Havilland deal in June. Under EC rules, it must reach a final decision by Oct. 14.

Aerospatiale said Tuesday it had no reason to doubt it would be vindicated. "We're confident that the last decision of the commission will be in our favor," said a spokesman for the company.

Conclusion of the acquisition, however, still hinges on Aerospatiale and Alenia reaching a deal with the Canadian government. Not only does that country's law require government approval for the purchase of major Canadian firms by foreign investors, but the companies are also seek ing hefty Canadian subsidies for developing de Havilland.

Commission may block attempted  takeover of De Havilland  by ATR.

EC air clash with Canada.
By Tom Walker.
The European Commission may block the attempted takeover of De Havilland, the aircraft maker, by the
Franco-Italian ATR consortium, allaying British Aerospace's fears of being locked out of the 40-70 seat commuter
plane market.
Sir Leon Brittan, the Competition Commissioner, is worried that ATR, which is jointly owned by France's
Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia, could dominate the EC market in turbo-props if the deal goes through.

The Toronto-based De Havilland occupies second place behind ATR in the EC. "When you have number one taking over number two how strong are the others?" a spokesman for Sir Leon said. "However you look at it, this creates a considerable market share."

A British Aerospace spokesman said ATR and De Havilland had 88% of the EC market between them, while BAe's ATP turbo prop had had difficulty gaining a foothold. If the ATR bid went through, BAe, which has 24,000 jobs in its civil aircraft division, would be "severely damaged".

The Canadian government is known to be concerned about the bid, because it fears ATR may turn De Havilland, one of the most famous names in aircraft history, into little more than a spare-parts maker. Although De Havilland's Dash-8 series is well thought of in the aircraft industry, sources say it has been poorly marketed and consequently De Havilland needs a cash boost to expand into different market segments.

The Canadian government is apparently prepared to inject C$303m (#151m) into the company if ATR guarantees that it will go on making planes in Canada. Whether this would make much commercial sense for ATR, whose -
42 and - 72 series turbo props have already made considerable inroads in the American market, is not clear. It has until October 8 to make its bid acceptable to the Canadian government, and the commission's judgment on the case will follow a week later, on October 14.

No price for De Havilland, which is owned by Boeing, the American aircraft manufacturer, has yet been mentioned. Boeing took over De Havilland about two years ago, but could not turn the company's fortunes round and offered it to ATR earlier this year.

British Aerospace,  Fokker try to block De Havilland  sale

(Copyright 1991)
BRUSSELS, Sept 26 (AFP) - Aircraft manufacturers British Aerospace of Britain and Fokker of the Netherlands have asked the European Community (EC) to block a proposed French-Italian take-over of Canadian firm De Havilland.

In a letter this week to Jacques Delors, president of the  EC's executive  commission, the two firms said the take-over would constitute a near-monopoly which could force them out of the commuter aircraft market.

AFP obtained a copy of the letter on Thursday. It said that the loss of the commuter market would make the bigger aircraft of British Aerospace and Fokker more expensive, and less able to compete with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
The European Commission has been conducting an anti-trust probe of the proposed sale of De Havilland by
Boeing to ATR, a consortium jointly owned by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia-Air Italia of Italy.

The commission must rule on the deal by October 14. It acquired considerable anti-trust powers a year ago, but has never made use of them to block major mergers.

However, commission sources have said there is serious concern that the deal could stifle competition in the market for commuter aircraft carrying between 40 and 70 passengers.

De Havilland makes turbo-prop commuter aircraft. The ATR consortium has a large share of the world market for these aircraft.

A British Aerospace official said that ATR already had 70 percent of the European market for commuter planes, and that the De Havilland purchase would give it 88 percent.

The letter from British Aerospace and Fokker said that, if the deal went through, business and jobs would be maintained in Canada at the expense of business and jobs in Europe, and that the winners would be Ontario and Boeing.
In Canada, the deal is considered essential to save De Havilland from bankruptcy. bb/gb/hl AFP AFP SEQN-0340

Hands off de Havilland,  EC told

Canada has urged the  European Commission not to interfere in the decision over whether Boeing Co.'s de
Havilland  unit can be sold to a French-Italian consortium, an Investment Canada official said yesterday.

But Allan Nymark, executive vice-president of Investment Canada, would not comment on reports that Canada told the  EC de Havilland  would die if the  deal was blocked by Brussels.

Nymark confirmed yesterday a Canadian delegation visited Brussels last month to review with EC officials the sale of de Havilland to Aerospatiale SA of France and Alenia SpA of Italy.
While there, the Canadians made ''the case that the predominant impact of this merger will be in Canada and that
[Canada! is the appropriate place for a decision to be made,'' Nymark said.

Canada also has warned the EC that de Havilland would collapse if the EC blocks the deal. The warning was given by senior government officials during a visit to Canada by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, who opposes the takeover.
Brittan fears the deal would create a near monopoly of the EC market for small commuter aircraft.

Canadian officials say there is no alternative bidder for de Havilland, the largest industrial employer in the Toronto area, with 4,300 employees.

Ottawa turned down the Franco-Italian offer last June on grounds the partners wanted too much government aid and they were suspected of wanting to reduce de Havilland to a components supplier.
Since then, the European consortium has tabled new proposals, which the government is likely to accept, say
Canadian diplomats, and the Ontario government has joined the negotiations as a possible equity partner.

BRUSSELS -- Sir Leon Brittan likely faces an uphill struggle in his bid to have the European Community Commission block the acquisition of Boeing Co.'s de  Havilland  subsidiary by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia S.p.A. of Italy.

Ottawa May Say Yes; Brussels May Say No On DeHavilland  Deal

European Commission (EC) is raising anew the possibility that it may veto the  sale of Boeing subsidiary de Havilland  Aircraft to a European consortium, just as the Canadian government may be prepared to approve the deal. Charles Byron, a spokesman for Investment Canada, the agency that must approve the  acquisition, said this week that although a final  deal has not been struck, "provided a certain number of requirements are met, things are looking very good."

RAW was told, however, that Investment Canada was not likely to rule until after any EC decision. EC sources said this week that European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan plans to ask his colleagues to veto the deal because it would hurt competition in the EC commuter aircraft market. The commission must decide by October 14, but sources say the implications go well beyond Europe. "It is a global market. What we see is the inevitability of a global consolidation in that market," one analyst who declined to be identified told Reuters.

Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, which make up the Avions de Transport Regional consortium that produces the ATR 42/72 series of turboprop transports, have been seeking to buy de Havilland for more than a year. They already control about half of the world market through the ATR consortium. The addition of de Havilland would raise that percentage to about 65. Both Fokker of The Netherlands and British Aerospace - numbers three and four in the market - have lobbied hard against the deal at the EC.
Fears Of Monopoly

"Together with BAe, we have made objections because of the danger it could become a monopoly situation," said Fokker spokesman Bart van Veen. Industry sources say the EC's concerns about the market share are overblown because the market is fragmented and new entrants can get in easily to undermine any monopoly profits. They also say that de Havilland would bring hundreds of millions of dollars in Canadian and Ontario subsidies to maintain jobs in Canada. The federal and provincial governments have pledged $303 million (Canadian) for research and development. The Europeans, on the other hand, may worry that if Aerospatiale and Alenia are tied to keeping jobs at de Havilland, any jobs lost as a result of the consolidation would come from France and Italy.

The de Havilland question is said to be the EC's toughest test as an industry antitrust watchdog since receiving sweeping powers a year ago. It would be the first such deal blocked. First, however, Brittan requires the backing of other members of the 17-member commission, some of whom agree that the EC market is irrelevant since all of the companies compete on a world level. "It is going to be a battle," according to one source, noting that the
"solidarity test" was crucial for commission credibility in the face of EC governments that have stalled for 16 years before agreeing to give Brussels a major role in policing mergers.

BESIEGED BRITTAN SEEKS TO BAR BUY-OUT OF DE HAVILLAND.
By Brian Love

30 September 1991
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Sept 30, Reuter - Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan risks a major feud on Wednesday when he seeks to stop a Franco-Italian group from  buying  Boeing's De  Havilland  and becoming one of the world's leading commuter aircraft makers.

Commission sources say Brittan is under attack from members of the  Commission who approve the sale and reject his claim that it would strangle competition by leaving one group to dominate the industry at  EC and international level.

"He has a fight on his hands now and it's hard to see which way it could go," one official said. It was unclear whether Brittan could win the majority he would need to prevent the purchase, said the official, who asked not to be identified.

France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia, who together top the European league of commuter aircraft manufacturers, are on the verge of buying Canada's De Havilland but cannot take over the loss-making company without EC clearance.
The Commission has yet to block a merger and Brittan's veto plan is seen as the first real test of solidarity for the
17-member executive since it won sweeping powers a year ago to decide the fate of industrial alliances affecting
the EC.

The deadline for a verdict is October 14 but Brittan will seek a decision on Wednesday. He could try again at a later stage if he fails to get his way on the day, the sources said.

Brittan argues that Aerospatiale and Alenia would have an excessive 60 per cent of the world market if they bought De Havilland, which makes the Dash 8 turbo-prop plane, capable of carrying up to 50 people.

But, according to some officials, a near majority of other Commissioners believe Brittan's argument is flawed, saying the market he uses to measure the impact of the deal bears little relation to business reality.

They argue that the correct yardstick is the market for turbo-prop planes with anything from 20 up to 110 seats on the grounds that this is the range of aircraft which airlines buy for use on short or medium range flights.

The companies' share would drop to less than 50 per cent if the range was widened only to cover aircraft with up to 70 seats, according to Commission estimates, and would drop even further if extended to include 100-seaters or jets.

Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert reportedly leads the camp in favour of a wider vision of the relevant market.
Rivals of Aerospatiale and Alenia will nonetheless be happy if Brittan's veto goes through. British Aerospace and
Dutch firm Fokker both have very small market shares and have lobbied heavily to get the deal blocked.

One Commission official said British Aerospace had sent letters to commissioners warning that it would likely have to close its plant at Oldham, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs, if the De Havilland purchase were approved.

EC leans towards  green light for De Havilland  take-over
225 words
1 October 1991

AFPR
English
(Copyright 1991)
BRUSSELS, Oct 1 (AFP) - The  European Community (EC) is more likely than not to approve a French-Italian take-over of the Canadian aircraft manufacturer De Havilland,  reliable sources in the  EC's executive commission said here Tuesday.

On Wednesday the commission is due to discuss the purchase  of De Havilland  by its biggest competitor, a consortium comprising Aerospatiale of France and Alenia-Air Italia of Italy. De Havilland  is now owned by the U.S. firm Boeing.

The commission has until October 14 to rule whether the deal would flout EC anti-trust rules by creating a dominant position in the market for turbo-prop commuter planes.

The sources said the commission was broadly divided between a minority of liberals who were against monopolies, and a majority who generally supported the idea of helping major EC groups withstand international competition.

Most of the EC's 17 commissioners are expected to take the side of Aerospatiale-Air Italia, although EC Competitions Commissioner Leon Brittan has said he wants to bar the take-over on anti-trust grounds.

He has been publicly backed by free market-oriented commissioners Frans Andriessen of the Netherlands and Peter Schmidhuber of Germany. The sources say the three are also supported by Henning Christophersen, a Dane.

The commission has never used its year-old powers to block a major  acquisition, although it has imposed restrictions on some  mergers.

Aerospatiale and Alenia, grouped in the ATR consortium, would have nearly half the  EC market of regional commuter planes if they acquired  De Havilland.

British Aerospace, which is hostile to the take-over, has said the deal would give the new French-Italian-Canadian consortium an 88 percent share of the more specialised market for commuter planes carring 40-70 passengers.

British Aerospace and the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker wrote to the European Commission last week pleading for the take-over to be blocked.

They said it would create a near-monopoly which could squeeze them out of the commuter plane market, and make their bigger aircraft more expensive and so less able to compete with the U.S. firms Boeing and MacDonnell Douglas.

The British and Dutch firms said in their letter that, if the deal went through, jobs would be maintained in Canada at the expense of jobs in Europe.

The Aerospatiale-Alenia offer for De Havilland is considered essential to save the Canadian firm from bankruptcy. The deal is being strongly supported by the Canadian authorities.

The rumpus caused by the  EC Commission's first rejection of a planned  merger underlines the essential fragility of Community compromises at the political level (cf pp.2-3). The decision on 2 October to forbid the  takeover by Aerospatiale and Alenia of de Havilland  goes to the heart of the competition versus industrial policy divergence (see BLB September 1991, p.2), though this decision or something similar should have been foreseen when the ministers agreed to give ascendancy to competition criteria in the regulation.

Whether the  Commission as a body - not Sir Leon Brittan, who clearly thrives on controversy - will ever dare to issue another such ruling remains to be seen. The case makes rather a strong argument for an independent EC competition authority to assess the competitive impact of a  merger without political pressure. (The Commission might be given power to override its rejections.) This would provide a solid subject for the conference on political union.

Mr Martin Bangemann, Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, has suggested that the industry directorate (or whichever other directorate was involved in a particular merger plan) should take part in the decision whether to open an investigation or clear a merger within one month. Given the tight time constraints imposed by the regulation, it is hard to see how this could be achieved.
Other suggestions have been to give a power to override the Commission's decision to reject a merger to the
Council of Ministers or
- even less likely to be adopted - to the national governments.

The first practical move is likely to be a revised offer by Aerospatiale and Alenia. It is said that they may contemplate forming a consortium with other investors in which they are minority parties, though how this would significantly change the effect of the transaction on their market position is difficult to work out. After the Commission's decision, de Havilland decided to lay off a quarter of its work-force, although the company said that this was not because of the decision.
Market share
The de Havilland decision highlights the importance of identifying the relevant market in which the parties
operate. In the market for 30-70- seat turbo-prop aircraft, Aerospatiale, Alenia and de Havilland would have had a
market share within the EC of 67%, which Sir Leon Brittan called a `suffocation' of competition, but this would not
have been the case in the market for small passenger aircraft (up to 110 seats).

The different approaches adopted by the EC and the US to assessment of the anti-competitive effect of a merger is interesting, especially in view of the new co-operation agreement.
An analysis of the two approaches was made in June by Mr Paul T Denis, Counsellor to the Assistant Attorney
General in the Antitrust Division of the US Justice Department, to an ABA meeting.

The fundamental difference between the two, in Mr Denis's view, lies in their articulation of the bad effects on competition which merger enforcement is intended to prevent. This explains the smaller differences.

In the US, section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits acquisitions the effect of which may be `substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly'. The Justice Department intends that `mergers should not be permitted to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its exercise'. Market power is the ability `profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for a significant period of time'.

The EC merger regulation provides for the prohibition of a merger which creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded. In the Renault/Volvo decision,


Page 29 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
this was recast in terms of `the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors or to gain an appreciable influence on the determination of prices without losing market share'.

Neither system has defined the precise market dynamics through which competition may be adversely affected by a merger.

The Commission has identified certain factors as a possible means of unlawful strengthening of a dominant position which the US would regard as benign or pro-competitive. For example, the `flow of technical and marketing knowhow' between AT&T and NCR would enhance NCR's position in the work-station market; this was treated as a matter for concern whereas, in US terms, it would seem to be a pro-competitive efficiency.

US merger policy is concerned about both co-ordinated and unilateral exercise of market power, but Mr Denis considered that the focus of EC merger policy is unilateral conduct, not necessarily through the exercise of market power, and only through a dominant position (this last constraint is imposed by the regulation itself).

The US system uses the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to calculate a merger's impact on concentration in the relevant market. It is measured by adding the squared value of the market share of each firm in the market. The change in concentration resulting from the merger is twice the product of the market shares of the merging firms. (E.g. where two companies have a 25% market share each, each has a value of 625 and together (as independent competitors) they have a value of 1250; should they merge, the resulting company would have a value of 2500, and the change would be 1250.) A benefit of certainty for companies results from this method, since the Justice Department recognises `safe harbours' at three levels:
--a post-merger HHI below 1000, regardless of the change;
--a post-merger HHI of 1000-1800, where the change is under 100;
--a post-merger HHI over 1800, but a change of under 50.
Outside these safe harbours (which prove in fact to be quite low if one does some HHI calculations), the
Department's Merger Guidelines take into account other factors, such as ease of market entry.

The EC merger regulation does not, of course, adopt this methodology. It does, however, exclude market shares of less than 25% in the EC. Mr Denis notes, with some surprise, that this would imply a change in the HHI of over
300 points if two equal-sized firms were merging, and a change of over 100 points except in the most extreme case (23% + 2%).

The degree of concentration does not appear to play a critical part in the Commission's analysis, in Mr Denis's view. In Renault/Volvo, the Commission concentrated on the competitors to the merged operation. In Aerospatiale/MBB the transaction combined markets of 44% and 5%. The Commission focused on changes in the military helicopter market and the 31% of the market taken by US firms and the 17% taken by other EC
competitors. These figures would `raise eyebrows' in the US, where the authorities would focus on a post-merger
HHI of about 3000 and a change of over 700.

Moreover, in this second case, the Commission `took comfort from statements of the merged firm to the effect that it would remain open to co-operation with other European helicopter manufacturers ... Effective competition would not be reduced as a result of the merger because other European manufacturers would not be foreclosed from access to technical co-operation and European development programmes which are essential for their competitiveness.'
It was not yet clear to Mr Denis what direction the Commission might take on evaluating ease of market entry. On market definition, he detected some differences in the method of reaching the definition of the relevant
product and geographic markets.

In the US, the definition focuses on demand substitution in response to a given price increase (usually 5%). It takes into account the market in the next-best substitutes to which consumers would turn.

Narrower markets may be defined where price discrimination is possible but, according to the Justice Department's guidelines, this will occur only where producers can identify customers to whom it could charge higher prices and prevent other customers from profitably reselling to the targeted group.

This is described by Mr Denis as the `dynamic' approach, viz it looks to the future situation after the merger has taken place. He does not think that the Commission takes this approach, but that it looks rather at the pre-merger
Page 30 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
conditions. The notification form looks at pre- merger patterns of substitutability (by requiring the parties to identify anything `regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer, by reason of the products' characteristics, their prices and their intended use').

This focus on the pre-merger situation was confirmed in the Renault/Volvo decision, where the Commission concluded that consumers do not normally consider that lorries from the three groups (classified by size) are interchangeable. It did not, Mr Denis notes, consider whether they might begin to regard them as interchangeable in response to non-competitive conduct by the producer.
The dynamic approach would argue in such a case for a broader market definition.

In Digital/Kienzle, the Commission was content with the observation that the differences in characteristics, price and intended use between personal computers and work-stations of various sizes `indicate the existence of distinct product markets' for each system.

In Otto/Grattan the Commission defined the mail order market as distinguished from retail shops with particular reference to a segment of the population which depends on mail order. It did not apparently consider whether
mail order companies might not identify these customers and apply distinct prices to them. Mr Denis clearly found this rather surprising.

This contrast in methodology is illuminating. Perhaps some of the difference in approach can be explained by the need to foster a degree of industrial integration across the EC - whatever the merger regulation may say about applying exclusively competition criteria. The EC needs integration between the 12 national operators where
these are monopolies (as in the case of the utilities) to enhance cohesion of the internal market and possibly even to increase competition.

Editorial comment: France: going through a bad patch? (the De Havilland  affair)

The De Havilland  affair, as it will no doubt come to be known, was significant for two reasons, one of which - Sir Leon Brittan's firm stand on principle - needs to be remembered. The other - France's less than savoury reaction to it - will hopefully be forgotten.

The basis of the affair is that the  takeover bid for De Havilland,  the troubled Canadian aircraft company, by ATR, the consortium of Arospatiale of France and  Alenia of Italy, was blocked by the  European Commission at its meeting on 2nd October. The arch-villain in the saga - at least from the Franco-Italian point of view - was Sir Leon Brittan who, as  European Commissioner responsible for competition and merger control, stood firm against
many of his colleagues and successfully argued the case for blocking the takeover.

Were the takeover to go through, it would give the new combined company 50% of the world market and 67% of the EC market for commuter aircraft of 20 to 70 seats. Arospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy saw the takeover as an opportunity to become market leaders in the commuter and regional aircraft market and as a major step in creating a large European industrial entity in that field.

Arospatiale and Alenia, both state-owned firms, had the strong support of their national governments and a number of Commissioners. Both Italian Commissioners voted in support of the takeover. Of the two French Commissioners, Christiane Scrivener was absent, while Jacques Delors abstained - on the grounds that to oppose Sir Leon's recommendation to block the takeover would have been interpreted as a French-influenced decision.

Sir Leon's decision, taken against immense pressure, is a major landmark in establishing the credibility of Brussels' merger task-force. This was the 53rd case to be handled by the task-force and the first to be rejected. Twenty-three of these have involved French companies. It was also a significant personal and ideological victory for Sir Leon.

The Community's policy on mergers, signed and agreed by all Member States, is that takeovers should be judged on purely competitive grounds, and not by reason of any other special issues - whether they be social, regional,
or whatever. Sir Leon judged the De Havilland takeover to be anti-competitive.

The French, unfortunately, have seen it differently. In a manner which has, regrettably, become habitual for President Mitterrand's latest Prime Minister - Madame Edith Cresson - the matter was quickly reduced to the level of personal vilification. Having already characterised her premiership with enough nationalist and ethnic outbursts to keep the gutter press happy for a long time, Mme Cresson is reported to have described Sir Leon as 'a swine' and to have told fellow-countryman Jacques Delors to 'have him neutered' - an interesting comment in the light of her recent pronouncements on the sexual habits of British men. More nasty, but unfortunately quite in keeping
with France's long tradition, have been the whiffs of anti-Semitism.

One hopes that all this is merely because France is going through a bad patch. President Mitterrand's recent spate of diplomatic gaffes has led to the slipping of the mask of European socialism to reveal the tawdry colours of nationalism beneath. France's blockage of east European association agreements last month, in a pique of
petty nationalism over the small matter of a few hundred cows, made most Europeans cringe. France's inability to rein in her over-subsidised and thoroughly spoiled farmers, along with her general disregard of Brussels' state aid policies to further both statist and nationalist industrial purposes, have all made the 'little englander' look relatively communautaire by comparison.

Commissioners remain undecided on whether to block a Franco-Italian  takeover of Toronto-area aircraft maker de Havilland  at tomorrow's meeting of the  European Commission.

Neither side has yet gained enough support to win an outright majority, although the issue was debated for more than five hours on Friday by the 17 commissioners, and again yesterday by their cabinet chiefs.

Competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan will recommend that his colleagues reject the takeover by Aerospatiale SA of France and Alenia SpA of Italy from Seattle-based Boeing Co. on the grounds that the deal would give the merged group a near-monopoly of the EC market for small commuter aircraft.

The recommendation represents the first attempt to block a takeover under the EC's year-old merger regulations. Brittan may try to rally support by arguing that a vote against his proposal would undermine the commission's competition policy. A decision could be deferred until next week's commission meeting, but must be made by Oct.
14.

Brittan is likely to be opposed by Karel Van Miert, responsible for transport, and Martin Bangemann, who holds the industry portfolio. They believe European aerospace companies should be given every chance to build their strength in the world market.

EC'S BRITTAN, UNDER SIEGE, SEEKS TO BAR BUYOUT OF DE HAVILLAND.
By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Reuter -  European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan risks a major feud on Wednesday when he seeks to stop a Franco-Italian group from  buying  Boeing's De  Havilland  and becoming one of the world's leading commuter aircraft makers.

Commission sources say he is under attack from other members of the  European Community executive who approve the sale and reject his claim that it would strangle competition, leaving one group to dominate the industry at EC and international level.

"He has a fight on his hands now and it's hard to see which way it could go," one official said. It was unclear whether Brittan could win the majority he would need to prevent the purchase, said the official, who asked not to be identified.

France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia, who together top the European league of commuter aircraft manufacturers, are on the verge of buying Canada's De Havilland but cannot take over the loss-making company without EC clearance.
The Commission has yet to block a merger and Brittan's veto plan is seen as the first real test of solidarity for the
17-member executive since it won sweeping powers a year ago to intervene in industrial alliances affecting the
EC.

The deadline for a verdict is October 14 but Brittan will seek a decision on Wednesday. He could try again at a later stage if he fails to get his way on the day, the sources said.

Brittan argues that Aerospatiale and Alenia would have an excessive 60 per cent of the world market if they bought De Havilland, which makes the Dash 8 turbo-prop plane, capable of carrying up to 50 people.

But some officials say a near majority of his colleagues believe his argument is flawed, saying the market he uses to assess the deal bears little relation to business reality.

They argue that the correct yardstick is the market for turboprop planes with anything from 20 to 110 seats -- on the grounds that this is the range of aircraft which airlines buy for use on short- or medium-range flights.

Commuter aircraft are mostly turboprop-powered, carry between 30 and 60 passengers and retail for $10 million to $12 million each. Sales have halved in recent years, with orders for 200 in 1990 compared with 400 in 1989.

The companies' share would drop to less than 50 per cent if the range was widened to cover aircraft with up to 70 seats, according to Commission estimates, and would drop even further if extended to include 100-seaters or jets.

Rivals will be happy if Brittan's veto goes through. British Aerospace and Dutch firm Fokker both have very small market shares and have lobbied heavily to get the deal blocked.

One Commission official said British Aerospace had sent letters to commissioners warning that it would probably have to close its plant at Oldham, northwest England, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs, if the De Havilland purchase were approved.

Brittan  blocks  De Havilland  deal

THE European Commission has blocked France's  Aerospatiale and Alenia of Italy from  buying  De Havilland
of Canada from the Boeing company.

It the first time ever that a  deal has been blocked by the  European Commission, which only obtained powers to vet mergers last year.

It follows a complaint to Commission President Jacques Delors by British Aerospace and Fokker of Holland that the deal would have given the two companies a near monopoly over the commuter aircraft market.

Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said it would have created `a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop aircraft, with the world number one producer buying the world's number two'.

`This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European Community market,' he continued. `The Commission has demonstrated its determination to apply fully and fairly the new (merger control) regulation and to protect companies and consumers.'

Brittan said he feared that such a dominant position on the part one grouping would force other companies out of the commuter market altogether.
The Commission said that if allowed to buy De Havilland, the Aerospatiale and Alinea joint venture would have
50% of the world market and 67% of the EC market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft of a given size.
For planes of about 50 seats, the deal would have given ATR 63% of the world market and 74% of the EC
market.

For the De Havilland company and its 5000 employees, the Commission's decision will reopen the questions over the company's future.

The deal had already run into problems with the Canadian authorities who have been pressing for a solution which offered better guarantees for the company's future.

But the Brussels decision will not be welcomed by Boeing which took over the loss-making company in 1986 and having failed to turn it round is now keen to get out.

With British Aerospace and Fokker having problems of their own neither is likely to be in a position to step into the breach.
Earlier this year De Havilland announced plans to reduce its workforce by END

EC blocks  De Havilland  take-over

(Copyright 1991)
BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (AFP) - The  European Community (EC) has blocked the proposed take-over of Canadian aircraft-maker De  Havilland  by a French-Italian consortium,  EC Competitions Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said here Wednesday.
The decision, by the EC's 17-member executive  commission, is the first blocking of a major transaction since the
commission acquired  important anti-trust powers on September 21, 1990.

Brittan said that the purchase of De Havilland by a consortium of Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy would create an unacceptable concentration in the European market for commuter aircraft.

De Havilland is owned by Boeing of the United States. It is on the verge of bankruptcy, and its sale to the Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) consortium was strongly backed by the Canadian authorities.

The commission has looked at 50 mergers over the past 12 months and passed them all. In two cases, it ordered modification of the mergers to prevent excessive market concentrations.

Brittan said the De Havilland take-over would have created "a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft, with the world's number one producer buying the world's number two."

EC blocks  De Havilland  take-over

BRUSSELS, Oct 2 (AFP) - The  European Community (EC) has decided to block the take-over of Canadian aircraft maker De  Havilland  by a French-Italian consortium,  EC Competitions Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said here Wednesday.
The decision by the EC's 17-member executive  Commission is the first blocking of a major transaction since the
commission acquired  important anti-trust powers on September 21, 1990.

The purchase of De Havilland by a consortium of Aerospatiale of France and Aliena-Air Italia of Italy would create an unacceptable concentration in the European market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft, Brittan said.
De Havilland, owned by Boeing of the United States, is on the verge of bankruptcy.

Brittan said the De Havilland take-over would have created "a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft, with the world's number one producer buying the world's number two."

He said the merger would have had "undesirable effects" on consumers, and would have placed even the world's largest producers "at risk".

Last month, British Aerospace and the Dutch aircraft maker Fokker sent a joint letter to the Commission warning that the De Havilland merger would create a near-monopoly that could squeeze them out of the commuter plane market.

They said that this would in turn make their bigger aircraft more expensive, and therefore less able to compete with the U.S. firms Boeing and MacDonnell Douglas.

The Commission said the merger would have given a consortium of Aerospatiale-Aliena-De Havilland 50 percent of the world market for commuter aircraft, and 67 percent of the EC market.

It said the consortium would have an even bigger share of larger commuter planes -- 76 percent of the world market for planes with about 70 seats, and 75 percent of the EC market.

SIR LEON BRITTAN PROPOSES TO THE COMMISSION TO BLOCK THE AEROSPATIALE- ALENIA/DE HAVILLAND MERGER.
347 words
2 October 1991
Agence Europe
AGEU
English
(c) 1991 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Several Commissioners seem to be of a different opinion. BRUSSELS, 01/10/1991 (AGENCE  EUROPE) - The European Commission will on Wednesday have a debate on the planned  merger in the aeronautical industry between the Community companies  Aerospatiale and Alenia and the Canadian company De  Havilland.  Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for competition, is proposing that the  Commission blocks the operation.

It is the first time he has arrived at a negative conclusion on an operation notified under the Community legislation over prior control to mergers of a large dimension. It is not, however, said that the Commission will follow his recommendation: indeed, the services responsible for industrial policy, under the responsibility of Mr.
Bangemann, have also examined the dossier and came to radically different conclusions than those of the "merger task force"; in their opinion, the operation is legal and should be authorised. According to indications available, several commissioners share this second opinion.

The Commission could postpone its decision for between 8 and 10 days. Indeed, the deadline prescribed by the legislation on prior control expires on 14 October (four months after the opening of the in-depth investigation).

The differences in appreciation result essentially from the different methods for calculating the resulting company's position on the market. Given that in the aeronautic sector the market to take into consideration is the world market, the first difficulty involves the segment to consider. The competition services considered the 20 to
70 seater segment and came to the conclusion that the new company would occupy 49% of the market. The "industrial" services observe that the Commission has already considered as acceptable higher shares of the market, and especially that the calculations could be made differently: all that would have to be done would be to consider the seaters to arrive at a much smaller share of the market.

British Aerospace and Fokker have approached the Commission to ask that the operation be blocked, the firm concerned have opposing arguments.

Bombardier Seen Interested  In Boeing's De Havilland  Unit
By G. Pierre Goad

MONTREAL -DJ- Aerospace industry observers said Bombardier Inc. may be interested in  acquiring Boeing
Co.'s de  Havilland  unit.

As reported, the  European Community Commission blocked the proposed acquisition of de Havilland  by Aerospatiale of France and  Alenia S.p.A. of Italy. The terms of the proposed acquisition haven't been disclosed.

Aaron Hollander, an investment banker who specializes in the aerospace industry, said ''there are definitely other buyers out there'' for de Havilland. Hollander, managing director of First Equity Development Inc., said ''there is more than one aerospace group'' interested in de Havilland, though he declined to name them.

One possible buyer is Bombardier, which has rapidly built up its aerospace business by buying companies such as Learjet at fire-sale prices. (Mr. Hollander has advised Bombardier on acquisitions in the past but said he isn't working for Bombardier regarding de Havilland.)

Bombardier talked with Aerospatiale and Alenia about joining their bid for de Havilland. The talks ended when the two European concerns rejected Bombardier's terms, which weren't disclosed.

Bombardier declined to comment on the possibility of making its own offer for de Havilland. ''At the moment that is a hypothetical question,'' a Bombardier spokeswoman said.
Jon Reider, an analyst at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., said Bombardier could be interested in de
Havilland ''if it was on their terms.'' Mr. Reider said de Havilland would add to Bombardier's mix of products.

Bombardier is a major player in the business-jet market with its Learjet and Canadair Challenger jets and recently entered the passenger-jet market with its 50-seat Regional Jet. De Havilland amkes turbo-prop commuter aircraft.

In Downsview, Ontario, where de Havilland is based, a Boeing spokesman said, "I think all of the parties concerned, including Boeing, have to examine all of the options at this point."

Asked if that could include closing de Havilland, he said: "That could be one of the options available . . . although I'd stress there are other alternatives." About 4,300 employees work at de Havilland, which currently has a backlog for 83 Dash-8 aircraft.

Canada's Wilson Displeased  By EC's De Havilland  Decision

OTTAWA -DJ- Canadian Industry Minister Michael Wilson called the decision by the European Community Commission to block the proposed  acquisition of Boeing Corp.'s de  Havilland  unit by Alenia SPA and Aerospatial SNI "a very unwelcome turn of events."
Wilson said he expressed his "great displeasure" to the commision earlier today.
"It's their law and their decision. And there's nothing I can do," Wilson told reporters.
Wilson said it is too early to say whether de Havilland will close because of the commission's decision. "There is an appeal process but I don't think that would be the way to go," Wilson said about the Alenia and
Aerospatiale proposal. "If the deal is to go ahead, it would have to be restructured."

He said the Canadian government isn't prepared to take an equity stake in de Havilland. "We have indicated our participation through research and development funding," Wilson said.

MILAN, Italy -DJ-  Alenia SPA criticized the  European Community Commission's decision to block the proposed
purchase,  together with  Aerospatiale SA of France, of Boeing Corp.'s De Havilland  commuter plane subsidiary.

Alenia said in a statement that the EC Commission's decision ''raises the question whether  Europe is capable of conducting an industrial policy that will allow Europe's industry to face the challenges of international competition.''

The statement, which a spokesman said was coordinated with Aerospatiale, also said the acquisition of De Havilland wasn't ''fundamental for Alenia's future,'' but that the EC move meant losing an ''extraordinary opportunity for European industry and for the construction of Europe's economic unity.''
The spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement, which didn't say whether Alenia would try to appeal the
EC decision.

EC Blocks  Aerospatiale, Alenia Buy Of De Havilland
573 words
2 October 1991

BRUSSELS -DJ- The European Community Commission decided today to block the proposed  acquisition of Boeing Corp.'s Canadian de Havilland  commuter aircraft division by  Alenia e Selenia SpA of Italy and Aerospatiale SNI of France.

The Commission said it moved on the grounds that the  merger would create a "powerful and unassailable dominant position in the market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft" for the  merged company.
That would have "an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market," the Commission said.

The decision marks the first time the EC has blocked a deal under the year-old law giving it more power to rule on major mergers and acquisitions.

It represents a victory for the EC's top competition official, Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, who faced opposition from at least two of his colleagues on the 17-member executive Commission.

In a statement, Brittan said the commission "has demonstrated its determination to apply full and fairly the new regulation and to protect companies and consumers against the damaging effects that would follow the creation of such a dominant position."

The Commission said the proposed merger would have given GIE Avions de Transport Regional, a jointly owned unit of Alenia and Aerospatiale, and de Havilland a 50 pc share of the world market and a 67 pc share of the Community market for commuter aircraft. The shares are even higher for larger commuter planes, the fasest growing segment of the market.

The merger would have resulted "in increased market share without leading to economies of scale in production," it added.

Studies showed that existing competitors would have been forced to leave the market and newcomers discouraged from entering as growth levels off in coming years, the Commission said.
"In due course, the dominant position would lead to a quasi-monopoly," the Commission said.
The Commission said its probe used as its relevant market the global market for commuter aircraft with between
20 and 70 seats. Besides Avions de Transport Regional and de Havilland, competitors for various segments of
this market include British Aerospace PLC, Embraer of Brazil, Saab AB of Sweden, Fokker NV of the Netherlands
and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas SA, the Commission said.
ATR is the world's largest turbo-prop producer and de Havilland the second largest, the Commission said. The proposed acquisition was first disclosed in May. Terms weren't disclosed.
The Commission's decision to ban the deal wasn't close. "It was more than a hair's breadth," said Commission
Vice President Brittan. "It was a comfortable decision."

Brittan said the door was open to Avion de Transport Regional to come back to the Commission with another deal with de Havilland. But he said a second proposal would have to be "significantly different."

Avion de Transport Regional had made "no reasonable proposal" to change the takeover to make it acceptable during the Commission's probe, he said.

Other airplane manufacturers, possibly new ones, would be able to step in if de Havilland closed, Brittan said.

The official also said the head of France's Aerospatiale told him the de Havilland deal wasn't that important to the company.

"It isn't something that would make a significant difference to the two companies," Brittan said. "However, the deal would seriously put at risk other companies in the Community," he added.

TORONTO -DJ- Ontario Premier Bob Rae said his government is ''very disappointed'' at the decision by the European Community Commission to block the proposed  acquisition of Boeing Corp.'s de  Havilland  unit by Alenia SPA and Aerospatial SNI.

Rae said, ''We are going to do everything we can to see that de  Havilland  remains not only a viable company but remains an effective leader in ... a technology that is crucial to this province.''

As reported, Rae's government last month said it was prepared to take an equity position in the proposed new ownership of de Havilland. He told reporters today that the government is still committed to keeping de Havilland's jobs in the province, ''to the best of our ability.''

FOCUS-EC COMMISSION BLOCKS DE HAVILLAND BUYOUT.
By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Oct 2, Reuter - The  European Commission bared its teeth as  merger watchdog for the first time when it barred Europe's leading commuter aircraft manufacturer from taking over Boeing Co's De  Havilland division.

It was the first  deal blocked out of more than 50  mergers investigated by the  Commission since it won powers a year ago to block or approve big industrial alliances affecting the  European Community.

But the veto, which stopped France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia buying the Canadian company, has exposed -- and not resolved -- the conflict between enforcing competition and promoting Europe's global industrial clout.

At root, it is an ideological split over the purpose of the Community's single market drive which reveals the contradiction at the heart of the 1992 programme.

Companies are forced to compete in a barrier-free EC market so they can grow strong to take on their global rivals. Yet, EC competition policy must prevent them from dominating their new, expanded "home" market.

The liberal free-marketeers led by Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan are forever pitted against those on the 17-member executive whose inclination is to nurture European champions against Japanese and U.S. Rivals.
"It's the same old battle between industrial policy and competition policy," one Commission official said. On the day, Brittan mustered the bare minimum of nine votes for his proposal and demonstrated how far
competition policy depends on the convictions of the commissioner in charge.
The sale, which was backed by the Canadian government and sought by Boeing, was blocked on the grounds
that it would leave a single group with an "unassailable dominant position" as a manufacturer of commuter planes
at EC and world level.
But the Commission was split over Brittan's analysis of the market -- a focal point which has plagued the
Commission in several important recent merger cases.

Brittan judged that the Franco-Italian group would boost its market share, covering planes of 20 to 70 seats, to 50 pct if it bought the loss-making Canadian firm.

But figures provided by Commission sources show that others, including transport and industry Commissioners Karel Van miert and Martin Bangemann, said his figures were inflated. The two firms would only reach 34 pct, they said.

In other cases, the judgment has turned on the definition of the relevant market in which there must be competition.

Brittan on Wednesday acknowledged the problem of deciding what is the "relevant market" or the yardstick for measuring the impact of a merger on industry.

But he said each case had to be judged individually and that it was not possible to have general rules that would apply across the board.

For Brittan and his officials, it had been a crucial test. After approving so many mergers, they had shown themselves willing and able to use the ultimate sanction.

EC WATCHDOG BARS AIRCRAFT DEAL, FLASHES TEETH AT WORLD INDUSTRY.

BRUSSELS, Oct 2, Reuter - The European Commission flashed its teeth as  merger watchdog for the first time on Wednesday when it barred Europe's leading commuter aircraft manufacturer from taking over Boeing's De Havilland  division.

It was the first  deal blocked out of more than 50  mergers investigated by the  Commission since it won powers a year ago to block or approve big industrial alliances affecting the  European Community.
But the veto, which stopped France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia buying the Canadian company, has exposed
-- and not resolved -- the conflict between enforcing competition and promoting Europe's global industrial clout.

At root, it is an ideological split over the purpose of the Community's single market drive which reveals the contradiction at the heart of the 1992 programme.

On the one hand, companies are forced to compete in a barrier-free EC market so they can grow strong to take on their global rivals. On the other, EC competition policy must prevent them from dominating their new, expanded "home" market.

The liberal free-marketeers led by Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan are forever pitted against those on the 17-member executive whose inclination is to nurture European champions against Japanese and U.S. rivals.
"It's the same old battle between industrial policy and competition policy," one Commission official said. On the day, Brittan mustered the bare minimum of nine votes for his proposal and demonstrated how far
competition policy depends on the convictions of the commissioner in charge.

The sale, which was backed by the Canadian government and sought by Boeing, was blocked on the grounds that it would leave a single group -- ATR, as the Aerospatiale/Alenia partnership is known -- with an "unassailable dominant position" as a manufacturer of commuter planes at EC and world level.
But the Commission was split over Brittan's analysis of the market -- a focal point which has plagued the
Commission in several important recent merger cases.

Brittan judged that the Franco-Italian group, called ATR, would boost its market share, covering planes of 20 to 70 seats, to 50 per cent if it bought the loss-making Canadian firm.

But figures provided by Commission sources show that others, including transport and industry Commissioners Karel Van miert and Martin Bangemann, said his figures were inflated. ATR would only reach 34 per cent, they said.

If 19-seater planes were included, they said, the companies' share would have plunged to 28 per cent, compared with 24 per cent for dutch rival Fokker and 16 per cent for British Aerospace.

Van Miert reportedly argued for addition of jets with up to 110 seats in the assessment, on the grounds that regional airlines would sometimes interchange turbo-prop planes with jets. Within that range, ATR's share would have plummeted to just six per cent.

In other cases, the judgement has turned on the definition of the relevant market in which there must be competition.

Brittan originally opposed a car battery merger between Fiat and Alcatel earlier this year. It was approved only when Fiat agreed to sell off control of a third battery maker.

Some commissioners were upset that Brittan forced Fiat to divest one firm so that it would not dominate the French battery market after the link-up. They believed the power of a merging group should be measured at EC-level on the grounds that there would be a single EC market after 1992.

Brittan lost a similar battle shortly before the Commission won its extra merger review powers. He opposed the takeover of Dutch coffee group Van Nelle by the Sara Lee food group on the grounds that the firm would dominate the Benelux market.

He was forced to drop his oppsition when a majority of Commissioners rejected the plan and said coffee companies competed right across the EC and that Sara Lee was not going to corner a substantial part of a market spanning 12 nations.

Brittan on Wednesday acknowledged the problem of deciding what is the "relevant market" or the yardstick for measuring the impact of a merger on industry.

Commission officials were at one stage trying to draw up an outline paper which might develop a greater consensus on the market where firms really competed, given that markets could vary from regional to national or world level depending on the nature of the product.
"No doubt we'll want to reflect further on whether there will be more general rules," Brittan told reporters.

But he said each case still had to be judged individually and that it was not possible to have rules that would apply across the board.

For Brittan and his officials, it had been a crucial test. After approving so many mergers, they had showed themselves willing and able to use the ultimate sanction.

"The Commission has demonstrated its determination to apply fully and fairly the new (E C mergers) Regulation," Brittan said in his statement.

DEHAVILLAND VETO HAMPERS EUROPE FIRMS - AEROSPATIALE.

LBA

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Oct 2, Reuter - The veto of Aerospatiale and Alenia's SpA planned  purchase  of Boeing Co's de Havilland  unit calls into question whether European firms can truly compete with U.S. And Japanese rivals, Aerospatiale said.

The European Commission earlier said it had decided to veto the planned  purchase  of de Havilland,  a commuter aircraft maker.

"The decision...Poses a serious problem: whether Europe is capable of implementing an industrial and commercial policy that will allow European industry to face up to the challenges of international competition," Aerospatiale said in a statement read by a spokesman.

Aerospatiale, a French state-owned aerospace and defence company, said the purchase was not fundamental to its future.

But the firm said it faces vivid competition, notably from the United States, Japan and the newly industrialised countries of Asia.

"To any analyst aware of the world aerospace situation, it is impossible for a European company to have a lasting, dominant position in this sector, given the overwhelming power of the U.S. Industry and the ambitions of many countries in the world," the Aerospatiale statement said.

In explaining the Commission's decision, Commissioner Leon Brittan said Aerospatiale and Alenia could not be allowed to win "a powerful and unassailable dominant position" at the EC and world level.

Separately, French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said he deeply regretted the Commision's veto, saying the decision ran contrary to the interests of Europe's aerospace industry.

"Europe's aerospace industry is in a vulnerable position, given the power of the American industry and the ambitions of many newcomers, especially Asians," Quiles said in a statement.

EC BARS EUROPEAN PURCHASE OF BOEING'S DE HAVILLAND DIVISION.
By Brian Love

2 October 1991
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Oct 2, Reuter - The  European Commission, flexing its new muscles on  mergers, on Wednesday barred Europe's two biggest commuter aircraft makers from  buying  Boeing Co's Canadian-based de  Havilland division.

It was the first  deal shot down by the  Commission since it won sweeping powers a year ago to review and block major industrial alliances and prevent companies dominating rivals in the  European Community.

Commissioner Leon Brittan said after the decision that Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale of France and Alenia SpA of Italy could not be allowed to win "a powerful and unassailable dominant position" at EC and world level.
Canada and Boeing were in favour of the purchase of the loss-making manufacturer, based in Toronto.

The Aerospatiale-Alenia joint venture, called ATR, would have captured 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft of between 20 and 70 seats, a Commission statement said.
"This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market," it said.

The Commission, hailing its action as a signal that the EC's budding cartel office had "come of age", said there were no Japanese rivals in the commuter aircraft sector and the sale would have removed the only North American player.

Commuter aircraft can have up to about 70 or 100 seats, are generally turbo-prop powered and used by airlines for flights of up to 500 km (800 miles) or 600 km (960 miles).

For planes of about 50 seats, the deal would have given ATR 63 per cent of the world market and 74 per cent of the EC market.

"The Canadian government wanted the merger allowed and I can understand that," Brittan told a news conference.

But, he added: "Even the largest producers would have been at risk because it would have led to such a heavy concentration on the market. There is no group of competitors which would create the same problem."

There was no immediate reaction from the Franco-Italian group. But rival Dutch firm Fokker, whose share price jumped after the news, welcomed the EC decision.

"Our first reaction is quite positive...We are happy to see the EC supporting the vision of a competitive marketplace," Fokker spokesman Robert Mol said.

Boeing bought de Havilland from the Canadian government for 155 million Canadian dollars (136 million U.S. dollars) in 1986. Despite pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the plant, it has never been able to make it turn a profit.

Analysts estimate Boeing is losing between 50 million Canadian dollars and 100 million Canadian dollars (44 million dollars and 88 million dollars) a year on de Havilland, which makes the twin-turboprop commuter Dash 8 series 100, 300 and 400.

Page 50 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Up to the final hour on Wednesday the 17-member Commission had been split. Brittan argued for a veto while colleagues challenging his analysis of market size and the power the European firms would have had by clinching the deal.

Commission sources said Boeing had told the Commission the Europeans were the only viable suitors for de Havilland, a major employer in Canada's province of Ontario. Boeing said on Wednesday it would have to examine other options.

Aerospatiale and Alenia had been negotiating the purchase of de Havilland for nearly a year but the offer price was not revealed.

They can appeal against the veto in the EC's Court of Justice but such a case would take years to resolve, Community officials said.

Aerospatiale said later the Commission's decision called into question whether European firms can truly compete with U.S. and Japanese rivals.

"The decision...poses a serious problem: whether Europe is capable of implementing an industrial and commercial policy that will allow European industry to face up to the challenges of international competition," Aerospatiale said in a statement.

The French state-owned aerospace and defence company said the purchase was not fundamental to its future but noted that it faced fierce competition, notably from the United States, Japan and the newly industrialised countries of Asia.

"To any analyst aware of the world aerospace situation, it is impossible for a European company to have a lasting, dominant position in this sector, given the overwhelming power of the U.S. industry and the ambitions of many countries in the world," the statement said.

Separately, French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said he deeply regretted the Commision's veto, saying the decision ran contrary to the interests of Europe's aerospace industry.

COMMISSION BARS EUROPEAN BUYOUT OF BOEING'S DE HAVILLAND.

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, Oct 2, Reuter - The  European Commission dealt a crushing blow to Europe's two biggest commuter aircraft makers on Wednesday by barring them from  buying  Canada's De Havilland  from Boeing.

The planned takeover of De Havilland  by France's  Aerospatiale and Alenia of Italy was the first  deal blocked by the Commission since it won sweeping powers a year ago to review major industrial alliances and prevent companies from dominating rivals in the  European Community market.

Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the takeover would have give the Franco-Italian joint venture "a powerful and unassailable dominant position" at EC and world level.

"Even the largest producers would have been at risk because it would have led to such a heavy concentration on the market. There is no competitor or no group of competitors which would create the same problem," Brittan told a news conference.
There was no immediate reaction from the Franco-Italian joint venture, called ATR. But rivals British Aerospace
(BAe) and Fokker of the Netherlands welcomed the veto.

"We think it's the right decision," a BAe spokesman in London said. "Had the merger been permitted it would have distorted the market."

Fokker's shares jumped on the news. "Our first reaction is quite positive...We are happy to see the EC supporting the vision of a competitive marketplace," Fokker spokesman Robert Mol told Reuters.

Colin Overbury, head of the Commission's merger task force, hailed the decision as a signal that the Commission had "come of age" as the EC's cartel office.

In a statement explaining the veto, which Brittan said was backed by a comfortable margin of the 17 commissioners at their Wednesday meeting, the Commission said there were no Japanese rivals in the commuter aircraft sector and that the sale would have removed the only North American player.

Commuter aircraft can have up to about 70 or 100 seats, are generally turbo-prop powered and used by airlines for flights of up to 500-600 kilometres.
The Aerospatiale-Alenia venture would have had 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC
market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft of between 20 and 70 seats, the Commission said.
"This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market."

For planes of about 50 seats, the deal would have given ATR 63 per cent of the world market and 74 per cent of the EC market.

Officials said the commissioners were split on the case up to the final hour, with Brittan urging them to veto the deal but others challenging his analysis of market size and the power the European firms would gain if allowed to buy De Havilland.

Commission sources said Boeing had told the Commission the Europeans were the only viable suitors for the loss-making division it bought from the Canadian government in 1986. Boeing said on Wednesday it would now have to examine other options.

Asked about the risk that De Havilland, a huge employer in Canada's Ontario province, would collapse as a result of the EC veto, Brittan said it would be regrettable but would not be bad in competition terms.

"The general view is that there is overcapacity in the market, so, if the company closed down, that would be sad but it wouldn't really have an adverse effect on competition," he said.
Brittan confirmed that the Canadian government had wanted Brussels to approve the takeover but said it
"appreciated and understood" the Commission's analysis of the implications for competition.

Aerospatiale and Alenia, who have been negotiating the purchase of De Havilland for nearly a year, can appeal against the veto to the European Court of Justice but it would take at least a year before the court reached a verdict.

FOKKER RISES ON EC DE HAVILLAND RULING.

English
(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
AMSTERDAM, Oct 2, Reuter - Shares in aircraft maker Koninklijke Vliegtuigenfabrieken Fokker NV rose 0.40 guilders to 30.40 in active trade on news that the  European Commission (EC) will veto the  takeover of the Boeing Company's De  Havilland  division by Fokker's French and Italian competitors.

BRUSSELS, Oct 2, Reuter - The  European Commission said it decided to veto a  buyout  of the Boeing
Company's De Havilland  division by Ste Nationale Industrielle  Aerospatiale of France and  Alenia SpA of Italy.

The decision means the  purchase  cannot go ahead. It is the first time the  Commission has blocked an alliance under the merger control regulation which came into effect a year ago.

The Commission said in a statement the deal would be anti-competitive, giving the new group too great a share of the world market for commuter aircraft.

"The Commission decided today not to permit the proposed merger to go ahead, on the grounds that it would create a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop aircraft, with the world number one producer buying the world's number two.
"This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market," the Commission statement said.

"The Commission has demonstrated its determination to apply fully and fairly the new (merger control) regulation and to protect companies and consumers..." added Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.

ATR, which is the Aerospatiale-Alenia joint venture, would have 50 pct of the world market and 67 pct of the EC market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft of a given size, the Commission said. For planes of about 50 seats, the deal would have given ATR 63 pct of the world market and 74 pct of the EC market.

"Exhaustive analysis shows that existing competitors would probably be forced to withdraw from the market for commuter aircraft if the merger went ahead and potential entrants would be discouraged from entering given that market growth is expected to level out in a few years," the statement said.

Commission sources said De Havilland parent Boeing had told the Commission during its enquiry that ATR had made the only realistic offer for the loss-making division.

The issue had split the 17-member Commission, with some arguing that Brittan's analysis of market share was flawed.

Since the Commission won sweeping powers to intervene against corporate mergers affecting EC industry under the merger control regulation, it has cleared about 40 transactions, some after full investigations. In some cases,
it has forced companies to make changes to their plans before clearing them.

But this was the first time the Commission had concluded that there was no alternative but to block a merger outright.

The decision by the  European Community executive means the  purchase  cannot go ahead.

The Commission said in a statement the deal would be anti-competitive, giving the new group too great a share of the world market for commuter aircraft and that it had ruled aginst the deal under EC merger rules.

EC'S BRITTAN FACES ROW OVER DE HAVILLAND BUYOUT.
By Brian Love

BRUSSELS, Oct 1, Reuter - European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan risks a major row on Wednesday when he seeks to stop a Franco-Italian group buying  Boeing Co's De  Havilland  and becoming one of the world's leading commuter aircraft makers.

Commission sources say Brittan is under attack from other members of the  Commission who approve the sale. They reject his claim that it would strangle competition by leaving one group to dominate the industry at  EC and international level.
"He has a fight on his hands now and it's hard to see which way it could go," one official said.

It was unclear whether Brittan could win the majority within the 17-member European Community executive he needs to prevent the purchase, said the official, who asked not to be identified.

French Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia SpA, who top Europe's league of commuter aircraft makers, are poised to buy De Havilland but cannot take over the loss-making firm without EC clearance.

The Commission has yet to block a merger. Brittan's veto plan is seen as the body's first real test of solidarity since it won sweeping powers a year ago to decide the fate of industrial alliances affecting the EC.

The deadline for a verdict is October 14 but Brittan will seek a decision on Wednesday. He could try again at a later stage if he fails to get his way on the day, the sources said.

Brittan argues Aerospatiale and Alenia would have an excessive 60 pct of the world market in 40 to 60-seater planes if they bought Canada's De Havilland, which makes the 50-seater Dash 8 turbo-prop aircraft.

But according to some officials a near majority of other Commissioners believe Brittan's argument is flawed. They say the notional market he has used to measure the impact of the deal bears little relation to business reality.

They say the correct yardstick is the market for turbo-prop planes with between 20 and 110 seats, because these are the aircraft which airlines use on short or medium range flights.

Commuter aircraft are mostly turbo-prop powered, carry between 30 and 60 passengers and retail for 10 to 12 million dollars each. Sales have plunged in recent years, with orders for 200 in 1990 compared to 400 in 1989.

The companies' market share would fall to below 50 pct if the range was widened to cover aircraft with up to 70 seats, according to Commission estimates, and would drop even further if extended to include 100-seaters or jets.

Rivals of Aerospatiale and Alenia will be happy if Brittan's veto goes through. British Aerospace Plc and Dutch firm Fokker both have very small market shares and have lobbied hard to get the deal blocked.

One Commission official said British Aerospace had sent letters to commissioners warning that it would probably have to close its plant at Oldham, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs, if the De Havilland purchase were approved.

De Havilland  merger vetoed

The European Commission today blocked the  sale of Metro-based de  Havilland  Aircraft to a French-Italian consortium.
It was the first time the  European Commission has used its power to stop a  merger.

A commission statement said the takeover bid was killed because it would have created "a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop aircraft, with the world No. 1 producer buying the world's No. 2."

Today's veto could lead to a major confrontation between the European Commission and Canadian government officials, who are anxious to find a buyer for the troubled Downsview aircraft maker owned by Boeing Co. of Seattle.
The proposed deal had been making headway in Canada since the consortium of Aerospatiale and Alenia-Air
Italia sweetened their formal offer for de Havilland last month.

Ottawa had warmed to the takeover and the Ontario government removed a remaining roadblock by offering to take an ownership stake in de Havilland, thereby providing the European consortium with a Canadian partner.
European competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan visited Ontario Premier Bob Rae and federal Industry
Minister Michael Wilson last month before proposing that the takeover be vetoed.
Ed Philip, Ontario ministry of industry, trade and technology, appeared grim about the decision today.

"It is a surprise," Philip said. "We thought we were proceeding to a very, very, good company under the form that we were able to negotiate. It's a disappointment and now we'll have to see what action we can take."
Brittan said the only appeal against the decision would be to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The Ontario government had been negotiating with the French-Italian consortium to become a one-third partner in de Havilland, with strict guarantees on the plant's continuing role in building complete aircraft.

Asked if Ontario would now consider buying a larger share of the company, Philip said: "Oh, I wouldn't even speculate at that. That would be extremely expensive at the moment."

An official from Brittan's office in Belgium said he hoped that today's decision would not heat up tensions between the European Community and Canadian government officials.

"This was a merger that would have had considerable impact on the European market," said the official, who asked not to be named.
Canadians should not feel slighted because they have been hit with the first veto exercised by the European
Community after it has studied roughly 50 deals in the past year, he said.
"There was bound to be a first case and this is just the one that came up," the official said.


Page 58 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
De Havilland spokesperson John Davy said today that company officials are awaiting more information on the
European's Community's move before commenting on what de Havilland will do next.

"We are, of course, disappointed, but we're waiting to get further details and study their implications before we can comment further," Davy said.

Canadian Auto Workers president Bob White said he did not immediately know what this means for de Havilland's workforce of 4,900 in Metro.

Commission sources said Boeing had told the commission during its study that the French-Italian venture had made the only realistic offer for the money-losing division.

The French-Italian joint venture would have had 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft of a given size, the commission said.
"This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market," the commission's statement said.
White said this morning its too early to say if the move is good or bad for Metro workers.

But the veto clearly shows that much of the world does not operate under the free market assumptions often referred to by free-trade supporters, White said.

The Canadian aerospace industry is clearly too important to trust to the whims of the free market and clearly needs some form of government intervention, White said.

"Here we are in Canada talking about free trade . . . and the Europeans are obviously dealing from a different deck," White said. "The Europeans obviously have a structure to do what's best for Europe. The Canadian government obviously is lacking this kind of foresight."

The issue had split the 17-member European Commission, with some arguing that Brittan's analysis of market share was flawed.
The commission won sweeping powers to intervene against corporate mergers affecting EC industry a year ago.

BOEING'S DE HAVILLAND SALE BLOCKED EUROPEAN COMMISSION EXERCISES VETO

The Boeing Co.'s efforts to unload its money-losing commuter aircraft division were dashed yesterday by the
European Commission.

The commission barred Europe's two biggest commuter aircraft makers from  buying  Boeing's Canadian-based de Havilland  division.
Boeing had agreed in May to sell de Havilland for an estimated $200 million to Alenia e Selenia SpA of Italy and
Aerospatiale SNI of France, partners in GIE Avions de Transport Regional.

It was the first deal shot down by the commission, the European Community's executive body, since it won sweeping powers a year ago to block industrial alliances and prevent companies from dominating rivals in the
12-nation EC.

The deal, attacked by rival manufacturers in other European nations, would create a "powerful and unassailable dominant position in the market for turboprop commuter aircraft," EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in Brussels.

Jack Gamble of Boeing Commerical Airplane Group said executives were awaiting a written copy of the decision "so we can figure out what our options are." That could take months, he said. The company also must wait to see what steps will be taken by the Canadian government, which is involved in the deal both as regulator and
potential investor.
Alenia and Aerospatiale officials did not say whether they would appeal the decision to the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg.

The decision "raises the question of whether Europe is capable of conducting an industrial policy that will allow Europe's industry to face the challenges of international competition," Alenia and Aerospatiale said in a joint statement.

Boeing paid the Canadian government about $110 million for de Havilland in 1986 and has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into modernization, research, development and other improvements. It put the company up for sale last year after it lost $30 million.

Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York, said it could take up to a year to put another deal together. Boeing is well-prepared to wait, Nisbet added. Losses would be "at most $50 million a year - maybe the profit on one or two 747s," he said.
"This is not a major event in the life of Boeing," said Bill Whitlow, an analyst for Gallagher Capital Corp. in Seattle. De Havilland has been producing about 41/2 planes a month at its plant near Toronto, said spokesman John
Davy.
"The division has been moving steadily toward operational break-even, and we're very close this year," he said. Orders for the planes, which cost about $10.5 million, have declined from 118 when the deal was announced to
83, Davy said.

"We've been holding our own, at this point, in terms of market share," he said. "I'm sure this (pending deal) has not improved our ability to sell airplanes at all."

Analysts speculated that Boeing could choose to close the plant, although such action would likely meet stiff opposition from the Canadian government. Davy said the company "was not going to rule (a closing) out or rule it in."
DeHavilland employs about 4,400.

Some thought it was more likely another buyer would be found. Potential candidates mentioned by analysts were the Canadian government itself, or Canada's Bombardier Inc., a major player in the business jet market.

The Canadian government supported the takeover, and the Ontario government removed a roadblock by offering to take an ownership stake in de Havilland, providing the European consortium with a Canadian partner.

"There are definitely other buyers out there," said Aaron Hollander, an investment banker who specializes in the aviation industry. jk/dh

Brittan  seeks to bar De Havilland  buyout

BRUSSELS -  European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan risked a major feud yesterday, when he was to seek to stop a Franco-Italian group from  buying  Boeing's De  Havilland  and becoming one of the world's leading commuter aircraft makers.

Commission sources say he is under attack from other members of the  European

Sir Leon argues that Aerospatiale and Alenia would have 60 per cent of the world market if they bought De

But many of his colleagues believe his argument is flawed. They say the correct yardstick is the market for turboprop planes with 20 to 110 seats as this is the range of aircraft used for shorter flights. - Reuter.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION BANS THE PURCHASE OF THE DE HAVILLAND AERONAUTICS FIRM BY AEROSPATIALE AND ALENIA.

First negative decision under the ruling on prior  merger control.

BRUSSELS, 02/10/1991 (AGENCE EUROPE) - Following its Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan, the  European         Commission has prohibited the acquisition of De Havilland  (Canada, belonging to Boeing, United States) by Aerospatiale (France) and Alenia and Selenia (Italy). The decision was taken by a "comfortable majority", said Sir Leon.
This is the first prohibition decision taken under the new Merger Regulation.

After a four-week preliminary examination, the Commission decided on 12 June to carry out an in-depth enquiry lasting four months. It has therefore taken a stand in the time allowed. Sir Leon Brittan stated: "The Commission has demonstrated its determination to apply fully and fairly the new Regulation and to protect companies and consumers against the damaging effects that would follow the creation of such a dominant market position".
The reasons for the negative decision are the following. The market to be taken into consideration is the
turbo-prop ("commuter") market which is quite distinct from that of jets, both as far as cost and as far as scope is
concerned.

The relevant market involves commuter planes with between 20 and 70 seats which are in production or development. The proposed merger would consist in the purchase of the number one manufacturer in this sector by the number two manufacturer, with the result that the company arising from the merger would hold 50% of the world market and 67% of the Community market (percentages which are even higher for certain types of planes). Competitors would probably be forced to withdraw from the market for commuter aircraft if the merger went ahead and potential entrants would be discouraged.

At world level, Japan is not involved in this market and potential producers of former COMECON countries or Indonesia are in financial difficulties or manufacture products of insufficient quality. Also, the buyers of the category of planes considered are in general small airline companies (or subsidiaries of large companies) which are unable to call on their own or their parent company's purchasing power in order to act as a competitive counter-balance to the market strength of ATR/De Havilland.

Competitors of De Havilland and ATR (which is a joint enterprise of Aerospatiale and Alenia) are British Aerospace, Saab, Fokker and minor firms. The enterprises concerned may appeal against the Commission's decision at the Court of Justice.

Acquisition by Aerospatiale, Alenia Is Blocked  by EC

BRUSSELS -- In an unprecedented and controversial move, the European Community Commission used its antitrust powers to block the  acquisition of Boeing Co.'s de Havilland  subsidiary by a Franco-Italian consortium.

The decision, which was opposed by the French and Italian governments, is a setback for the would-be  buyers, Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia SpA. The two state-owned companies had hoped to make their Avions de Transport Regional joint venture the leading player in the highly competitive world market for commuter turboprop aircraft.

The commission said the acquisition would have given ATR an unfair advantage, allowing it to crowd out competitors such as British Aerospace and the Netherlands's Fokker NV. Giving ATR "a powerful and unassailable dominant position . . . would have had an undesirable impact on customers and the level of competition on the community market," said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner.
Sir Leon said the proposed combination would have given ATR 50% of the world market and 67% of the EC
market for commuter aircraft. Those figures were contested, however, by some of his fellow commissioners.

Wednesday's decision marks the first time that the commisson has used its power to veto a major business transaction under a year-old law. Under the so-called merger regulation, the commission has the final say over large mergers and acquisitions that would affect the EC market, regardless of whether the companies involved are based in the EC.

The ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, strikes a blow to the plans of ATR, which had hoped to strengthen its foothold in the North American market. The decision also prevents ATR from picking up de Havilland's cus tomers -- a move that analysts said would have boosted the consortium.

Analysts said the decision is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the market for commuter turboprop planes, which are made by about a dozen companies world-wide. They did say, however, that the move could mean the end of de Havilland, which employs 5,500 workers in Canada. Boeing bought the Toronto-based company from the Canadian government in 1986, but despite massive investments, de Havilland has yet to make a profit.

For Sir Leon, the decision is a major victory, albeit won by the skin of his teeth. The commission was the subject of intense lobbying over the proposed deal, and the outcome was unclear until the last minute. The debate pitted those who profess to support the emergence of "European champions" against those who favor a more open and competitive market.

Sir Leon mustered only nine of the votes on the 17-member commission. Four members, including Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, voted against blocking the deal. (Commission President Jacques Delors, who initially opposed blocking the accord, and three others abstained.)

But, despite the internal wranglings, the ruling was viewed widely as a boost to the commission's clout in enforcing EC competition law. "If companies think they can muscle through their deal by lobbying (the commission), they might be in for a surprise," said Frank Fine, a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer with Frere Cholmeley, a British law firm.



Page 64 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the vote also shows how the EC's process for reviewing mergers and acquisitions is highly politicized. For the most part, the commissioners' votes were in accordance with well-established industrial interests in their home countries. EC officials noted that the two Italian commissioners -- Carlo Ripa de Meana and Filippo Maria Pandolfi
-- both voted against Sir Leon.

"If there hadn't been conflicting European national interests at stake, this case could have gone the other way," said Mr. Fine, the antitrust lawyer.

British Aerospace and Fokker welcomed the decision, saying that the alliance could have forced them out of the market for 40-to-60-seat turboprop aircraft. Other competitors include Daimler Benz AG's Dornier GmbH of Germany, Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden. The industry is marked by numerous subcontracting arrangements and joint ventures, including a planned venture between Dornier, Alenia and Aerospatiale to build larger commuter aircraft.

Alenia, on the other hand, said "the decision means the loss of an extraordinary opportunity for European industry." And Aerospatiale said the move has cast doubt on the EC's ability to put in place commercial and industrial policies that permit European companies to compete with their Asian and U.S. counterparts.

Indeed, analysts and lawyers said they were confused about the commission's strategy in such matters. Earlier this year, another Aerospatiale merger was cleared by the commission. Under that transaction, the French company merged its helicopter operations with those of Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Bloehm GmbH. The resulting joint venture, known as Eurocopter, has 50% of the EC market for civilian helicopters. In approving the deal, the commission cited the threat of strong U.S. competition, even though EC manufacturers have a combined 54% of the U.S. market for civilian helicopters.

The mixed record shows how politically influenced the commission's merger review system is, analysts said. Sir Leon generally has managed to stand firm on legal and competition principles, but his term ends in 1992. And, with many EC governments in favor of a more hands-on EC industrial policy, some worry that a more-flexible successor could take Sir Leon's place.

"Other commissoners might have been unable to swing (the vote) as well as Sir Leon did" in the de Havilland case, said one veteran Brussels lobbyist.

MALGRE UNE VIVE DECEPTION SUITE A LA DECISION DE LA CEE: AEROSPATIALE CANADA POURSUIVRA SES ACTIVITES INDUSTRIELLES AU PAYS

(Copyright Canada Newswire)
OTTAWA, 3 oct. /CNW/ - Monsieur Michel Troubetzkoy, president d'Aerospatiale Canada Inc. (ACI) a tenu aujourd'hui a se faire le porte-parole de son President, monsieur Henri Martre, afin de reiterer que la decision de la Commission des Communautes Europeennes de mettre son veto a l'acquisition de De Havilland  par le consortium franco-italien, ne modifie en rien la strategie industrielle d'Aerospatiale au Canada.

``Nous sommes presents au Canada depuis plusieurs annees, grace a d'importantes relations d'affaires avec des partenaires canadiens. La decision annoncee cette semaine, bien qu'inopportune et tres decevante, n'affectera nullement la poursuite de nos objectifs en terre canadienne de meme que celle de nos activites industrielles et commerciales au pays'', a tenu a souligner aujourd'hui M. Troubetzkoy. ``Nous sommes au Canada pour y
rester''.

Rappelant que le recent veto de la CEE arrive a un bien mauvais moment, M. Troubetzkoy a confirme qu'au moment ou la decision europeenne etait annoncee, toutes les conditions semblaient reunies pour arriver rapidement a un accord de partenariat entre le consortium Aerospatiale-Alenia, le gouvernement federal et le gouvernement ontarien. ``Dans ce contexte, nous comprenons et partageons la deception des autorites federales et ontariennes, de meme que celle exprimee par les employes de De Havilland, d'autant plus que cette decision va a l'encontre des interets des industries aeronautiques canadienne et europeenne.''

Finalement, ACI rappelle que le Canada demeure le quatrieme plus important fournisseur d'Aerospatiale avec des achats de plus de 100 millions de dollars en 1990 et que les plus recentes previsions indiquent une croissance pour 1991.

Les differents projets presentement en discussion avec des partenaires canadiens permettent d'envisager l'avenir avec optimisme. A cet egard, mentionnons que la publication du livre blanc du ministere de la Defense nationale offrira a Aerospatiale de nombreuses possibilites de developpement de ses activites pour ses Groupes helicopteres, satellites de surveillance et systemes de defense.

En outre, les pourparlers presentement en cours sur le contrat d'industrialisation du missile anti-char a courte portee Eryx se deroulent bien, et ACI prevoit la finalisation de cette importante negociation dans un avenir rapproche.

``C'est donc dans le meme esprit de collaboration et de partenariat que Aerospatiale compte poursuivre ses bonnes relations avec le Canada et c'est avec optimisme qu'elle entrevoit l'avenir,'' de conclure Michel Troubetzkoy.

OTTAWA, Oct. 3 /CNW/ - Michel Troubetzkoy, President of Aerospatiale Canada Inc. (ACI), today declared, on behalf of his President, Henri Martre, that the European Commission's decision to veto the Franco-Italian consortium's  acquisition of De Havilland  in no way affects Aerospatiale's business strategy in Canada.

``We have been active in Canada for some years now because of major deals with Canadian partners. While unfortunate and very disappointing, the  EC decision will have no impact at all on the pursuit of our objectives on Canadian soil, nor on our industrial and commercial activities here'' said Troubetzkoy. ``We are in Canada to stay.''

Recalling that the recent EC veto occured at a bad time, Troubetzkoy confirmed that just as the decision was announced, all the conditions seemed ripe for the Aerospatiale-Alenia consortium, the federal government and Ontario to reach a partnership agreement. ``Under those circumstances, we understand and share the disappointment of federal and Ontario officials, as well as that expressed by De Havilland employees, all the moreso, since the decision is not in the best interest of either the Canadian or the European aeronautic industry.''

The ACI President also recalled that Canada remains Aerospatiale's fourth largest supplier, landing over $100 million worth of contracts in 1990, moreover, the latest projections indicate an increase in 1991.

Various projects now under discussion with Canadian partners allow ACI to be optimistic about the future. The National Defence white paper will give Aerospatiale numerous opportunities to develop business for its Helicopter, Surveillance Satellite and Defense Systems Groups.

Furthermore, talks now underway on the industrial production contract for the Eryx short-range anti-tank missile are going well and ACI expects to wrap up this important negotiation very soon.

``In the same spirit of cooperation and partnership, Aerospatiale plans to maintain its good relations with Canada and is looking forward to a bright future here,'' concluded Troubetzkoy.

De Havilland  at risk as EC reject mergerPurchase would give consortium too much power, commission
rules

The Globe and Mail The future of the de  Havilland  division of Boeing Co. was thrown into doubt yesterday when the European Commission rejected a bid by a French- Italian consortium to  buy the Toronto-based commuter plane manufacturer.

The commission, the executive branch of the  European Community, said its studies showed that the  purchase of de Havilland  would give the consortium 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the  EC market for commuter planes. the consortium, Avions de Transport Regional, is owned by  Aerospatiale SNI of France and Alenia e Selenia SpA of Italy.

The commission said it could not sanction the creation of "a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turboprop aircraft."

Canada's Industry Minister Michael Wilson called the development unwelcome, and Ontario Premier Bob Rae, whose New Democratic government had offered to buy a one-third interest in the consortium to operate de Havilland, said: "We intend to pursue every possible option in making sure that the company remains viable. The industry is too important for any of us to walk away."
The decision, the commission's first rejection of a merger proposal, can be appealed to the European Court of
Justice. None of the companies involved was prepared to say yesterday whether an appeal will be launched.

Ontario will not appeal, Mr. Rae said. "It would take many months, as many of these legal matters do, and frankly the business of the company is too important to be left hanging like that."

Mr. Wilson agreed that appealing to the European Court would not be an effective strategy. The only way to save the merger would be to restructure it and apply again for EC approval, he said.

Mr. Wilson said he expressed his displeasure to EC officials. "It's their law. It's their decision, and unfortunately there's nothing I can do about their decision," he told reporters. "This is a very unwelcome turn of events."

Aerospatiale rejected the commission's contention that the new entity would have dominated the industry. It said it faces strong competition from U.S. aircraft manufacturers and what it called "the ambitions of a number of companies in the world."
It said that the de Havilland purchase "is not fundamental for the future of Aerospatiale." It may, however, be fundamental to the future of de Havilland.
De Havilland employed as many as 6,200 people in 1988, but has whittled its work force to 4,300. The aircraft maker, based in the Toronto suburb of Downsview, has cut 800 positions since January.

"We've been holding our market share, but it's a very depressed market out there, and we have not been selling a whole lot of airplanes for the last year or so," spokesman John Davy said.

The division, which reduced its production rate in September to 4 airplanes a month from five, has 83 airplanes on order to build. The plant produces both a 40-seat and a 56-seat version of its Dash 8 aircraft.

Page 68 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr. Davy refused to comment on the possibility of Boeing simply closing the division. "I'm not going to rule it out or rule it in," Mr. Davy said.
But Bob White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said he doubts Boeing will shut the plant.

Mr. White said the decision puts de Havilland back at square one looking for a buyer, although its sales will continue to suffer while it remains in limbo.
"There's been enormous damage done to this plant in the last 18 months as a result of the uncertainty, and the
European consortium has gained sales at the expense of the Canadian plant," he said.

EC commissioner Sir Leon Brittan defended the landmark ruling by saying that the resulting company would have been so dominant as to have "damaging effects" on its competitors and consumers.

Consortium officials said de Havilland's weak financial position can only be exacerbated by the EC decision, since at best it will delay the investment that Aerospatiale and Alenia have been planning at Downsview.
"This decision is negative for the future of de Havilland and the future of the Canadian aerospace industry," said
Federico della Volta, a senior Alenia official. "De Havilland is surely in a very difficult situation."
De Havilland's competitors were delighted with the outcome. Both Fokker NV of the Netherlands and British
Aerospace had lobbied the European Commission hard to reject the proposed merger.
"There's no doubt that, had the merger been allowed, it would have created a monopoly or near-monopoly in the
40-to 70-seat (aircraft) market," British Aerospace spokesman Ian Woodward said. "We think it's the right
decision."

Fokker spokesman Leo Steyn said that at least his company will now compete on a level field. It makes the Fokker 50, which competes with the de Havilland Dash 8-300. Mr. Steyn said that if the merger had gone through Fokker would have reduced or halted its production of commuter aircraft.

De Havilland's prospects
513 words
3 October 1991
The Globe and Mail
GLOB

YESTERDAY'S decision by the  European Community to block the  acquisition of de Havilland  of Canada by a European consortium leaves the future of the Toronto aircraft manufacturer up in the air. The EC's competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said the  purchase  of de Havilland  would have given the consortium of Italy's Alenia and France's Aerospatiale "an unassailable dominant position" in the world market for commuter aircraft. The European Commission estimates that, if the  purchase  had gone ahead, the consortium would have controlled 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the  European market for commuter planes.

While there will be a temptation for Canadian politicians who support the sale of de Havilland  to the consortium to get the decision reversed, they have little choice but to respect it. The Commission was within its rights - and within the facts - to question the impact of the  purchase  on the commuter aircraft market.

Even so, the decision will be unsettling for de Havilland and its workers. For over a year, de Havilland's owner, The Boeing Co. of Seattle, has been trying to sell de Havilland, which has lost tens of millions of dollars since Boeing bought it from the federal government in 1986. Boeing will now have to reconsider its options.

Although de Havilland has not been profitable, it is hardly worthless. It reportedly has 20 to 22 per cent of the world market for commuter aircraft in the 20-to 70-seat range. Its 4,300 employees are producing 4.5 planes a month, and while the recession has hit the aircraft market, it has an order backlog of 83 planes. Its productivity has improved significantly under Boeing management, and it is close to breaking even on the planes it sells. While it still receives government funds from aerospace industry programs, the amounts are "not substantial," a de Havilland spokesperson says. One industry expert estimates that Boeing has brought the company about three-quarters of the way from bankruptcy to commercial viability.

Boeing still may not want to keep de Havilland. Boeing's losses as it tried to wring productivity improvement out of de Havilland's workforce soured it on the Toronto plant, and Boeing also found that de Havilland, a maker of turboprop commuter plans, was not an easy corporate fit for Boeing, a manufacturer of large commercial jets.

Now that the European consortium is apparently out of the picture, other buyers may materialize. In the last year, there have been expressions of interest in de Havilland from British Aerospace and an Asian group, but because of the terms of the agreement between the Europeans and Boeing, they were effectively kept out of the bidding.

Two prospective bidders that should stay out of the field are Ottawa and Ontario. Until yesterday, Ontario had been trying to buy into the consortium. De Havilland's viability depends on higher productivity under a new owner with commercial credentials. Before or after the European ruling, Ontario would not have been such a potential owner.

Competing views of competition ANALYSIS"Canada and the EC differ over the benefit of the de
Havillandsale - a conflict that underscores the need to harmonize  antitrust laws
DREW FAGAN

THE European Commission's decision to block the de  Havilland  sale appears to have jolted the federal and Ontario governments back to square one in their efforts to save Metropolitan Toronto's largest industrial employer.

The federal government - from the Industry Ministry through to the Bureau of Competition Policy - spent months trying to make sure the  deal would be a positive one for Canada.

Now, all that seems to have been negated by the European Commission, after it rejected a bid by a French-Italian consortium to buy the commuter plane maker out of concern that such a sale would allow the group to dominate the turboprop market.

But how can a deal considered anti-competitive in Europe be viewed as beneficial to Canada? The answer lies mainly in the differences between antitrust legislation in Canada and Europe, and the contrast in financial strength between de Havilland and the European consortium.

In fact, the dispute between Canada and the EC over the proposed deal is simply the most serious example, say competition analysts, of the need to better co-ordinate antitrust investigations.

"This is what many of us have been saying inevitably would happen," said Calvin Goldman, a former director of the federal competition bureau. "It would be utopian to think that different jurisdictions are always going to come to the same result."

In recent years, Canada has signed agreements with the United States and most European countries to share information on antitrust investigations so they don't end up working at cross purposes.

Federal officials say that has also been done in the de Havilland case. But the EC investigation reached different conclusions than Canadian authorities expected to reach, because EC laws are different on when a merger should be blocked.

In approving the deal, sources say, the federal competition bureau concluded that de Havilland possibly faced the risk of going out of business if the merger with Aerospatiale and Alenia did not go ahead. Under the Competition Act, that finding means the competition bureau can approve a merger that would otherwise be blocked for
causing a substantial lessening of market competition.

The same rationale has been used in the past. The best-known example was when the bureau approved the takeover of struggling Wardair Inc. by Canadian Airlines International Ltd. in 1989.

The recommendation by the bureau in the de Havilland deal, made privately last month, has been influential in swaying Industry Minister Michael Wilson. His support came because the deal met the litmus test of being of net benefit to Canada.

But the year-old merger guidelines applied by the members of the European Commission do not provide the same consideration for financially troubled firms. And in any case, de Havilland, the potentially failing firm, is not in its jurisdiction, but in Canada.


Page 75 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
As such, the commission simply considered the effect of the proposed merger on competition and concluded that the deal had to be stopped because the merged company would control about two-thirds of the European commuter aircraft market.

John Kazanjian, a partner at the McMillan Binch law firm in Toronto, said the need for increased harmonization of competition law is becoming obvious to international companies. In extreme cases, companies have to gain approval from six or seven competition authorities before making a merger final.

For example, federal approval for the takeover of Toronto-based Connaught Laboratories Ltd. by Institut Merieux SA of France was complicated by accusations by U.S. anti-trust authorities that the merged company would have too much clout in parts of the U.S. vaccine market.

That led to private concerns among Canadian officials that the U.S. government was meddling in Canadian regulatory procedures.

Now, Ottawa and Ontario are expressing the same concern that their ability to regulate competition in the domestic commuter aircraft market has been thwarted by the European authorities.
It's a complication that is likely to become more common as international mergers take place more frequently. Document glob000020011109dna3014na

De Havilland  veto a blessing in disguise?

TERENCE CORCORAN

THE European Commission's decision to block the  sale of aircraft maker de  Havilland  to a French-Italian consortium, although disturbing, could prove to be a blessing in disguise. Although who can tell? The whole portfolio of publicly released detail regarding de  Havilland  - its financial and operating status, the plans of  Alenia of Italy and  Aerospatiale of France and their original request for $1-billion in federal aid, and the Ontario government's subsequent scheme to invest real equity in the company - could be etched on a postage stamp.
Certainly there is nothing in the droppings of disclosed information to give anyone confidence that the
Franco-Italian purchase of Canada's leading aerospace company deserved anything but serious skepticism.
There's more than a passing chance, in fact, that Leon Brittan, Europe's commissioner for competition policy,
handed all of Canada a favour when he urged the 17-member commission to vote against the merger as an
emerging monopoly.

For one thing, it prevents Canada from plugging into the great European Community industrial strategy quagmire, a quirky mix of subsidy and bureaucratic fine-tuning. For all its claims to open trade and competition, and strict controls over subsidies and government meddling, Europe remains a continent clinging to many of the old protectionist and interventionist policies. The takeover of de Havilland would have woven Canada into the system.

The decision to stop Alenia and Aerospatiale - owned by their respective governments - from buying de Havilland demonstrates the European muddle. The commission said that if Alenia-Aerospatiale completed the merger with de Havilland, the new company would end up with 50 per cent of the world market for turboprop commuter planes and 63 per cent of the European market. In the 40-seat to 70-seat sector, the new company would hold up to 75 per cent of the market.

Isn't Europe a little late worrying about this? The commission would never have had to deal with any alleged market concentration threat if Europe had not spent billions of dollars in the first instance subsidizing the activities of Alenia and Aerospatiale and a host of other aerospace companies.

Aerospace is one of several European industrial sacred cows that apparently need to be fed large quantities of state aid in order to survive and succeed. Sometimes these state-supported enterprises get to be so big that they have to be reined in by bureaucrats like Mr. Brittan.

During a recent visit to Toronto, Mr. Brittan explained the system of allowed and non-allowed subsidies. "The whole question of state aid is a very complex area, and you can't just generalize. Our position, broadly speaking, is that state aid is not forbidden by the Treaty of Rome. It is merely regulated by the Commission." For example, he said, subsidies are permitted for certain purposes, including regional development and research and development.

Where subsidies are allowed, they are regulated. "You have to look at the specifics of each case. We have a whole code, for example, in the shipbuilding industry about exactly the extent of the subsidy that is permitted and not permitted. We have a different set of arrangements related to the motor industry." The aerospace sector, where Europe claims to compete against "hidden forms" of subsidies received by U.S. aerospace firms, is considered a "special situation" that deserves extraordinary quantities of state aid.

In joining this system, Canada would have been contributing to an exercise in economic absurdity. Canada would be subsidizing European governments to protect a Canadian industry against the competition created by the European subsidies. Last June I offered an industrial strategy textbook to anyone who could explain the merits of such economic activity, but nobody took up the offer.

Looking ahead, the collapse of the Alenia-Aerospatiale deal should not spell calamity for de Havilland. Everybody appears to agree that de Havilland's technology and planes are - or could be - competitive products. The
company has experienced management and a work force with built-up skills - if not built-up union and organizational savvy. There is persistent talk on the street that the company has been making money on an operating basis for several quarters.

The data droppings released to date give no hint whether any of this is true. But if de Havilland has value, as everyone seems to think, then in the weeks and months to come the company's owner, Boeing of Seattle, one of the world's great companies, is in a position to forge a new strategy, possibly with another company or companies that are less a part of the European subsidy muddle.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION blocks  Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland.
By Julie Wolf in Brussels.

The European Commission yesterday blocked a Franco-Italian bid for Canadian aircraft maker de  Havilland  on the grounds that it would have stifled competition in the market for small turbo-prop aircraft.
Sir Leon Brittan, the  EC's competition commissioner, said the  deal could have driven competitors, which include
British Aerospace, out of the market for commuter aircraft.

The case involved a bid by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, which already jointly produce a small aircraft, the ATR, to buy de Havilland from Boeing.

The decision marked the first time Brussels has blocked a merger under new powers it received a year ago. Sir Leon said the merged companies would have had half the world market for commuter aircraft and 67 per cent of the EC market.

There had been considerable opposition within the Commission to Sir Leon's recommendation that the merger be blocked, however. Several commissioners argued that the deal would help the European companies compete internationally and disputed Sir Leon's contention that the relevant market was 20-to 70-seat planes. According to sources, Sir Leon's proposal to prevent the merger received nine votes, the minimum needed for the 17-member Commission to take a decision.

Sir Leon, however, said the decision followed "an exhaustive analysis" which concluded the merger would "create a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop aircraft."

Several European companies, including BAe and Fokker of the Netherlands had written to Brussels complaining about the bid.

"We think it is the right decision. There is no doubt that, had the Commission allowed the takeover, it would have created a very significant monopoly indeed in the order of 90 per cent in the 40-to 70-seat plane market," a BAe spokesman said.

The Canadian Auto Workers union, representing workers at Boeing's de Havilland division, said it will urge the government to invest directly in the struggling division after the EC veto.

Boeing has said it must now examine its options and has declined to say if that might include simply closing the loss-making division.
Trade union local president Jerry Dias said: "The next move is for us to meet with government and demand the
$300 million that was available go to Boeing and demand that the 400 series be built."

The Canadian and Ontario governments had promised to provide the new company with $300 million in research and development grants.

Commission blocks  ATR's plans to take over De Havilland.

In the first decision of its kind, the  European Commission yesterday blocked the proposed  takeover of De Havilland,  the troubled Canadian aircraft maker, by ATR, the Franco-Italian manufacturer of turbo-prop commuter planes.

Sir Leon Brittan, the  EC Competition Commissioner, said the  acquisition would have given ATR-De  Havilland an unacceptable share of the  European commuter-plane market with the risk that the other competitors, in effect British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands, could have been driven from the market.
ATR, a consortium of Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia, is already the world's top manufacturer of
turbo-prop commuter aircraft ahead of De Havilland at number two. The proposed merger would, according to
Brussels, have given the group 50 per cent of the world commuter-plane market and 65 per cent of the EC
market.

This marks the first outright rejection by the Commission of a proposed acquisition since it was given anti-trust powers a year ago. The Canadian government had been anxious for the deal to go ahead as possibly the only way of securing the future of De Havilland, a subsidiary of Boeing of the US. ATR could appeal to the European Court of Justice, or it could reframe proposals to try to convince Brussels that the impact of a deal on competition would be minimised.

EC Blocks  Sale of a Boeing Unit To French-Italian Joint Venture

BRUSSELS -- In an unprecedented move, the European Community Commission used its antitrust powers to block the acquisition of Boeing Co.'s de Havilland  subsidiary by a French-Italian consortium.

The decision, which was opposed by the French and Italian governments, is a setback for the would-be  buyers, Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia S.p.A. The two state-owned companies had hoped to make their Avions de Transport Regional joint venture into the leading player in the highly competitive world market for commuter turboprop aircraft.

The commission said the acquisition would have given ATR an unfair advantage, allowing it to crowd out such competitors as British Aerospace and the Netherlands' Fokker N.V. Giving ATR "a powerful and unassailable dominant position . . . would have had an undesirable impact on customers and the level of competition on the community market," said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's commissioner in charge of competition matters. Sir Leon said the proposed combination would have given ATR 50% of the world market and 67% the EC market for commuter aircraft.

Yesterday was the first time the Commisson used its power to veto a major business transaction under a one-year-old law. Under the so-called merger regulation, the commission can block large mergers and acquisitions affecting the EC market, regardless of whether the companies are based in the EC or not.

The ruling is a blow for ATR, which had hoped to gain a stronger foothold in the North American market. The decision also prevents ATR from picking up de Havilland's customers -- an acquisition analysts say would have been a big boost for the consortium.

Analysts said that the decision is unlikely to have a great effect on the market for commuter turboprop planes, which are manufactured by about a dozen companies world-wide but that it could mean the end of de Havilland. Boeing bought de Havilland in 1986 from the Canadian government but, despite massive investment, the unit has yet to make a profit.

In Downsview, Ontario, where de Havilland is based, a Boeing spokesman said, "I think all of the parties concerned, including Boeing, have to examine all of the options at this point."

Asked if that could include closing de Havilland, he said: "That could be one of the options available . . . although I'd stress there are other alternatives." About 4,300 employees work at de Havilland, which currently has a backlog for 83 Dash-8 aircraft.

"There are definitely other buyers out there," says Aaron Hollander, managing director of First Equity Development Inc., Stamford, Conn., although he declined to name potential suitors. Bombardier Inc., which has built up its aerospace business by buying companies, such as Learjet, at fire-sale prices, previously was interested in joining Alenia and Aerospatiale in their bid. Yesterday, Bombardier declined to comment.

When Boeing announced it had put de Havilland on the block in July 1990, analysts welcomed the news because the commuter airplane subsidiary has been an incessant financial drain on its Seattle parent. Most analysts figured the unit would fetch up to $200 million, although a sound estimate was difficult to calculate because de Havilland has been steadily unprofitable.

For Sir Leon, the decision is a major victory, although one won by the skin of his teeth. The commission had been the subject of intense lobbying over the deal, and the outcome was unclear until the last minute. The debate
pitted those in the EC -- such as France and Italy -- who want to see the emergence of "European champions" against those who favor a more open and competitive EC market.

The commission's vote shows how the EC's process for reviewing mergers and acquisitions is highly politicized. For the most part, the commissioners' votes happened to be in accordance with well-established industrial interests in their home countries. EC officials noted that the two Italian commissioners -- Carlo Ripa de Meana and Filippo Maria Pandolfi -- both voted against Sir Leon.

"If there hadn't been conflicting European national interests at stake, this case could have gone the other way," says Mr. Fine.

British Aerospace and Fokker welcomed the decision, saying the de Havilland deal could have forced them out of the 40-seat to 60-seat turboprop aircraft market. Other competitors include Daimler-Benz AG's Dornier G.m.b.H. of Germany, Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden.

Alenia said "the decision means the loss of a extraordinary opportunity for European industry." And Aerospatiale said it casts doubt on the EC's ability to put in place commercial and industrial policies that permit European firms to compete with those in Asia and the U.S.

CANADA FACES MAJOR DILEMMA AFTER EC VETOES DE HAVILLAND SALE.

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
TORONTO, Reuter - Canada will have to consider whether to bail out Boeing's de  Havilland  commuter aircraft subsidiary after the  European Commission vetoed sale of the Toronto-based division to a French-Italian venture, analysts say.
The European Community's executive body on Wednesday vetoed the proposed  takeover of money-losing de
Havilland  by France's Ste Nationale Industrielle  Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy.

The commission, in its first veto of an international takeover, said in a statement the deal would be anti-competitive and give the new group too great a share of the world market for commuter aircraft.

The Canadian government declined immediate comment on the ruling but analysts said it now faces the possibilty of having to take de Havilland off Boeing Co's hands to secure 3,000 jobs and maintain a strong Canadian aerospace presence.

A spokeswoman for the Ontario government said it was "extremely concerned" and planned to meet with all parties to discuss the development.

A spokesman for Boeing of Seattle said the company must now examine its options. He declined to say whether that might include simply closing down the plant.

Commission sources said Boeing had told the commission during its study that the French-Italian venture had made the only realistic offer for de Havilland, which makes 37-to 40-seat and 50-to 56-seat turboprop aircraft.

Boeing bought de Havilland from the Canadian government for C$155 million ($136 million) in 1986. Despite pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the plant, it has never been able to make it turn a profit.

Analysts estimate Boeing is losing between C$50 million and C$100 million ($44 million and $88 million) a year on de Havilland.

Boeing negotiated a deal to sell the division to the French-Italian group, known as ATR, last summer but the Canadian government turned it down because it called for too much government funding -- up to $885 million over 10 years.

ATR revised its offer and the Canadian and Ontario governments agreed to give it $265 million in research and development grants.

EC Commission blocks  takeover of Boeing branch

BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Commission on Wednesday blocked Boeing Co.'s planned  sale of its struggling Canadian subsidiary, de Havilland,  to a French-Italian consortium.

The decision marked the first time the  commission has used its 1-year-old antitrust powers to block a cross-border merger in the community. So far, it has checked 52  mergers, clearing 47 and demanding modifications to the other five.

De Havilland has been a money-loser for Boeing ever since it acquired the Toronto manufacturer of commuter aircraft in 1986.

"It's never been able, despite our best efforts, to turn a profit," a Boeing spokesman in Seattle said. "While revenues have grown, it's never really contributed to Boeing's bottom line."

The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, noted that the vote within the commission was very close. He said the company would have to study the decision and wait to see what action the Canadian government might take before deciding its own future course with regard to de Havilland.

The EC's executive body said it had vetoed the takeover by ATR, a joint venture between state-owned Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, because the merged group would have had a "powerful and unassailable" position in the world market for turboprop commuter aircraft.

Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, said the merger would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the EC commuter aircraft market.
ATR builds 48- and 66-seater planes while de Havilland in Toronto is best known for its Dash 8 range of 30- to
50-seat turboprops. De Havilland ceased building its four-engine Dash-7 aircraft in 1988.

The proposed merger would give ATR/de Havilland 50 percent of the world market and 67 percent of the EC market for commuter planes. In the fastest-growing market, for larger planes with about 70 seats, its shares would be 76 percent and 75 percent.

Sir Leon said there was a "very serious" risk that existing European manufacturers, such as British Aerospace and Fokker in the Netherlands, would be forced to quit the market if ATR acquired de Havilland.
The companies had not suggested any "realistic" changes to their planned takeoover, Sir Leon said. Document rnob000020011110dna300nee

By a majority of nine, the minimum necessary, the EC Commission yesterday rejected the bid by ATR, the Alenia-Aerospatiale consortium, to  acquire De Havilland  of Canada. The figures produced by Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for competition, on which the decision was based, have aroused argument. Many, including
industry commissioner Martin Bangemann, feel they are of limited reliability and not up to date. The Brittan figures show the merger project would have given ATR a dominant position in the regional transport aircraft sector: 50% of the world market and 67% of the  European market.

Alenia says the decision calls into question Europe's capacity in the aircraft industry and its ability to compete internationally. Athough not essential to Alenia's future, the decision marks a lost opportunity for the  European aircraft industry.

Aerospatiale-Alenia Plan to Buy Boeing Unit Is Blocked  by the EC on Antitrust Grounds  --- Disputed
Ruling Says Purchase Of de Havilland  Would Give Firms an Unfair Advantage

BRUSSELS -- In an unprecedented and controversial move, the European Community Commission used its antitrust powers to block the  acquisition of Boeing Co.'s de Havilland  subsidiary by a Franco-Italian consortium.

The decision, which was opposed by the French and Italian governments, is a setback for the would-be  buyers, Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia SpA. The two state-owned companies had hoped to make their Avions de Transport Regional joint venture the leading player in the highly competitive world market for commuter turboprop aircraft.

The commission said the acquisition would have given ATR an unfair advantage, allowing it to crowd out competitors such as British Aerospace and the Netherlands's Fokker NV. Giving ATR "a powerful and unassailable dominant position . . . would have had an undesirable impact on customers and the level of competition on the community market," said Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner.
Sir Leon said the proposed combination would have given ATR 50% of the world market and 67% of the EC
market for commuter aircraft. Those figures were contested, however, by some of his fellow commissioners.

Wednesday's decision marks the first time that the commisson has used its power to veto a major business transaction under a year-old law. Under the so-called merger regulation, the commission has the final say over large mergers and acquisitions that would affect the EC market, regardless of whether the companies involved are based in the EC.

The ruling, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, strikes a blow to the plans of ATR, which had hoped to strengthen its foothold in the North American market. The decision also prevents ATR from picking up de Havilland's customers -- a move that analysts said would have boosted the consortium.

Analysts said the decision is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the market for commuter turboprop planes, which are made by about a dozen companies world-wide. They did say, however, that the move could mean the end of de Havilland, which employs 5,500 workers in Canada. Boeing bought the Toronto-based company from the Canadian government in 1986, but despite massive investments, de Havilland has yet to make a profit.

Canadian Industry Minister Michael Wilson told reporters the decision was "a very unwelcome turn of events," adding, "It's their law and their decision and there's nothing I can do."

For Sir Leon, the decision is a major victory, albeit won by the skin of his teeth. The commission was the subject of intense lobbying over the proposed deal, and the outcome was unclear until the last minute. The debate pitted those who profess to support the emergence of "European champions" against those who favor a more open and competitive market.

Sir Leon mustered only nine of the votes on the 17-member commission. Four members, including Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, voted against blocking the deal. (Commission President Jacques Delors, who initially opposed blocking the accord, and three others abstained.)

But, despite the internal wranglings, the ruling was viewed widely as a boost to the commission's clout in enforcing EC competition law. "If companies think they can muscle through their deal by lobbying (the

commission), they might be in for a surprise," said Frank Fine, a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer with Frere
Cholmeley, a British law firm.

But the vote also shows how the EC's process for reviewing mergers and acquisitions is highly politicized. For the most part, the commissioners' votes were in accordance with well-established industrial interests in their home countries. EC officials noted that the two Italian commissioners -- Carlo Ripa de Meana and Filippo Maria Pandolfi
-- both voted against Sir Leon.

"If there hadn't been conflicting European national interests at stake, this case could have gone the other way," said Mr. Fine, the antitrust lawyer.

British Aerospace and Fokker welcomed the decision, saying that the alliance could have forced them out of the market for 40-to-60-seat turboprop aircraft. Other competitors include Daimler Benz AG's Dornier GmbH of Germany, Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden. The industry is marked by numerous subcontracting arrangements and joint ventures, including a planned venture between Dornier, Alenia and Aerospatiale to build larger commuter aircraft.

Alenia, on the other hand, said "the decision means the loss of an extraordinary opportunity for European industry." And Aerospatiale said the move has cast doubt on the EC's ability to put in place commercial and industrial policies that permit European companies to compete with their Asian and U.S. counterparts.

Indeed, analysts and lawyers said they were confused about the commission's strategy in such matters. Earlier this year, another Aerospatiale merger was cleared by the commission. Under that transaction, the French company merged its helicopter operations with those of Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Bloehm GmbH. The resulting joint venture, known as Eurocopter, has 50% of the EC market for civilian helicopters. In approving the deal, the commission cited the threat of strong U.S. competition, even though EC manufacturers have a combined 54% of the U.S. market for civilian helicopters.

The mixed record shows how politically influenced the commission's merger review system is, analysts said. Sir Leon generally has managed to stand firm on legal and competition principles, but his term ends in 1992. And, with many EC governments in favor of a more hands-on EC industrial policy, some worry that a more-flexible successor could take Sir Leon's place.

"Other commissoners might have been unable to swing (the vote) as well as Sir Leon did" in the de Havilland case, said one veteran Brussels lobbyist.

OTTAWA - Federal Industry Minister Michael Wilson refuses to reconsider the possibility of Ottawa investing in
Metro-based de Havilland  Aircraft, now that a  European takeover has been vetoed.
Wilson called yesterday's decision by the  European Commission to block the  sale of de Havilland  to a
French-Italian consortium "a very unwelcome turn of events."

But he stressed the next steps are up to the airplane manufacturer's American owners, Boeing Co. of Seattle, the consortium that sought to buy it, and the Ontario government.

The jobs of roughly 4,900 Metro workers are at risk if a solution can't be found for the ailing Downsview firm's woes.
The Ontario government had planned to buy a chunk of de Havilland as part of the deal with the consortium of
Aerospatiale and Alenia-Air Italia.

"I had some discussions with the Commission and I expressed my great displeasure with what has happened," Wilson said yesterday after sale collapsed. "But it's their law, it's their decision, and unfortunately there is nothing I can do about the decision."

Meanwhile, Premier Bob Rae is urging de Havilland employees to keep their hopes up, The Star's Matt Maychak reports.
"The critical point is the industry is too important for any of us to walk away," Rae told reporters yesterday. "This industry lies at the hub of aerospace in Ontario, and we intend to make sure that it stays there." Workers anxious/A28

Future of de Havilland  in doubt as sale vetoed

The reluctant owner of Metro aircraft maker de  Havilland  is pondering its options today after the  European           Commission yesterday blocked a sale to a French-Italian group.

A spokesperson said Boeing Co. of Seattle wants more details before commenting, including whether the would-be buyers can appeal yesterday's ruling and whether they want to.

Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy did not make their intentions clear in brief statements. But observers wondered whether Boeing, or Canada, can afford to leave de Havilland's future hanging any longer.

"It's hard to predict (what will happen) tonight," said Boeing's Craig Martin. "The Canadian government has a say. The buyers have a say. Boeing has say."

The 17-member European Commission, the European Community's executive board, has ruled that Aerospatiale and Alenia would obtain "a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop aircraft" if they acquired de Havilland from Boeing.

The companies would own the largest and second-largest producers of turbo-prop commuter aircraft, accounting for half of world sales and 67 per cent in Europe.
"This would have an unacceptable impact on customers and the balance of competition in the European
Community market," the commission said.

A spokesperson for the commission in Canada said the decision is final and unalterable, although an appeal to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg might be possible.

Union officials and industry observers doubt Boeing would simply close the 4,300-employee factory it has been trying to sell since mid-1990 after investing more than $500 million.

The cost of severing contracts and risking damage to its reputation would be too high, argued Jerry Dias, president of Local 112 of the Canadian Auto Workers union.

Industry Minister Michael Wilson told reporters in Ottawa he had expressed his "great displeasure" over the action of the European Commission. But he gave no indication he will listen to union leaders who immediately called on Ottawa and Ontario to come to de Havilland's rescue.

Dias said Ontario and Ottawa should now offer Boeing the same $303 million in financial support they tentatively offered the European consortium last month, at the time Ontario said it would seek a part ownership of de Havilland.

But Dias said the money should only be given on the condition that Boeing proceed with the development of a new 70-seat, 400-series version of the Dash 8 aircraft.
"That would ensure continued research and development and guarantee jobs.

"The Ontario and federal governments have to move now before Boeing overreacts," Dias said. "The have to put enough money on the table to make it worthwhile to Boeing."

Bob White, president of the CAW, said "whatever Boeing does, this facility can't be left idle," The Star's Dan Girard reported. "It's an important aerospace facility in Canada and the governments have some responsibility to work to . . . find a new purchaser.

"You're not going to have many people going and ordering these planes until they're sure who the owners are going to be and what the future of the facility is," White said.

Osgoode law professor Ian McDougall urged Ontario government officials to take a deep breath before rushing into anything.
"It's unlikely Boeing will make an irrational decision (and close the factory)," he said. "It's an asset worth keeping." It's unlikely Boeing can recover the money it has already put into de Havilland, but, McDougall said, the factory is
well-positioned to take advantage of a recovery in the economy.
Sales of commuter aircraft have dried up in the past six months. Boeing has cut the rate of production at de
Havilland and laid off hundreds of workers in the past two years.

BOEING'S DE HAVILLAND SALE BLOCKED; EUROPEAN COMMISSION EXERCISES VETO

The Boeing Co.'s efforts to unload its money-losing commuter aircraft division were dashed yesterday by the
European Commission.

The commission barred Europe's two biggest commuter aircraft makers from  buyingBoeing's  Canadian-based de Havilland  division.
Boeing had agreed in May to sell de Havilland for an estimated $200 million to Alenia e Selenia SpA of Italy and
Aerospatiale SNI of France, partners in GIE Avions de Transport Regional.

It was the first deal shot down by the commission, the European Community's executive body, since it won sweeping powers a year ago to block industrial alliances and prevent companies from dominating rivals in the
12-nation EC.

The deal, attacked by rival manufacturers in other European nations, would create a ``powerful and unassailable dominant position in the market for turboprop commuter aircraft,'' EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in Brussels.
Jack Gamble of Boeing Commerical Airplane Group said executives were awaiting a written copy of the decision
``so we can figure out what our options are.'' That could take months, he said. The company also must wait to see
what steps will be taken by the Canadian government, which is involved in the deal both as regulator and
potential investor.
Alenia and Aerospatiale officials did not say whether they would appeal the decision to the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg.

The decision ``raises the question of whether Europe is capable of conducting an industrial policy that will allow Europe's industry to face the challenges of international competition,'' Alenia and Aerospatiale said in a joint statement.

Boeing paid the Canadian government about $110 million for de Havilland in 1986 and has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into modernization, research, development and other improvements. It put the company up for sale last year after it lost $30 million.

Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York, said it could take up to a year to put another deal together. Boeing is well-prepared to wait, Nisbet added. Losses would be ``at most $50 million a year - maybe the profit on one or two 747s,'' he said.
``This is not a major event in the life of Boeing,'' said Bill Whitlow, an analyst for Gallagher Capital Corp. in
Seattle.
De Havilland has been producing about 41/2 planes a month at its plant near Toronto, said spokesman John
Davy.
``The division has been moving steadily toward operational break-even, and we're very close this year,'' he said. Orders for the planes, which cost about $10.5 million, have declined from 118 when the deal was announced to
83, Davy said.


Page 95 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
``We've been holding our own, at this point, in terms of market share,'' he said. ``I'm sure this (pending deal) has not improved our ability to sell airplanes at all.''

Analysts speculated that Boeing could choose to close the plant, although such action would likely meet stiff opposition from the Canadian government. Davy said the company ``was not going to rule (a closing) out or rule it in.''
DeHavilland employs about 4,400.

Some thought it was more likely another buyer would be found. Potential candidates mentioned by analysts were the Canadian government itself, or Canada's Bombardier Inc., a major player in the business jet market.

The Canadian government supported the takeover, and the Ontario government removed a roadblock by offering to take an ownership stake in de Havilland, providing the European consortium with a Canadian partner.

``There are definitely other buyers out there,'' said Aaron Hollander, an investment banker who specializes in the aviation industry.

EC watchdog bars planned takeover of aircraft  maker
468 words
4 October 1991

BRUSSELS - The European Commission showed its teeth as  merger watchdog for the first time on Wednesday when it barred Europe's leading commuter aircraft manufacturer from taking over Boeing's De  Havilland  division.

It was the first  deal blocked out of more than 50  mergers investigated by th e Commission since it won powers a year ago to block or approve big industrial alliances affecting the  European Community (EC).

But the veto, which stopped France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia from buying the Canadian company, has exposed - and not resolved - the conflict between enforcing competition and promoting Europe's global industrial clout.

At root, it is an ideological split over the purpose of the Community's Single Market drive which reveals the contradiction at the heart of the 1992 programme.
On the one hand, companies are forced to compete in a barrier-free EC market

so they can grow strong to take on their global rivals. On the other hand, EC competition policy must prevent them from dominating their new, expanded "home" market.
The liberal free-marketeers led by Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan

are forever pitted against those on the 17-member Executive whose inclination is to nurture European champions against Japanese and US rivals.
"It's the same old battle between industrial policy and competition policy," one Commission official said.
Sir Leon mustered the bare minimum of nine votes for his proposal and demonstrated how far competition policy depends on the convictions of the Commissioner in charge.
"The Commission has demonstrated its determination to apply fully and fairly the new (EC mergers) regulation," he said in his statement.
The sale, which was backed by the Canadian government and sought by Boeing, was blocked on the grounds
that it would leave a single group with an "unassailable dominant position" as a manufacturer of commuter planes
at EC and world levels.
But the Commission was split over Sir Leon's analysis of the market - a foca l point which has plagued the
Commission in several important merger cases.
Sir Leon judged that the Franco-Italian group would boost its market share, covering planes of 20 to 70 seats, to
50 per cent if it bought the loss-making Canadian firm.

But figures provided by Commission sources show that others, including Transport and Industry Commissioners Karel Van Miert and Martin Bangemann, said his figures were inflated. The two firms would only reach 34 per cent, they said.

In other cases, the judgment has turned on the definition of the relevant market in which there must be competition.

Sir Leon originally opposed a car battery merger between Fiat and Alcatel earlier this year. It was approved only when Fiat agreed to sell off control of a third battery maker. - Reuter.

France lambasts  EC veto of De Havilland  takeover, demands backtrack
342 words
4 October 1991

English
(Copyright 1991)
PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP) - The French government Friday sternly took to task the  European Commission for seeking to block the  takeover of the Canadian aicraft manufacturer De  Havilland  and called on it to "reconsider its decision without delay".

A statement from the office of Prime Minister Edith Cresson "marked its disapproval" of the decision, saying it contested the motives put forward to justify it and "reserved the right" to take the case to the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The decision was, the statement said, "taken in complete ignorance of the need to strengthen the European aeronautic industry in the face of its competitors" and "seriously prejudices the interests of European industry and maintaining employment in the face of international competition".

The European Commissioner for Competition Leon Brittan has vetoed the proposed takeover of financially troubled De Havilland by the European ATR company, which is owned equally French state-owned Aerospatiale and Italian Alenia.

Brittan said that the deal would have caused unacceptable concentration of European manufacturing of commuter aircraft, consequently adversely affecting the market for other aircraft.
The other two manufacturers of commuter aircraft in the EC are Fokker and British Aerospace.

But the French government statement said that Brittan's arguments reposed on interpretation of a rule aimed at preventing the constitution of dominant positions in the Community market. This rule, "adopted under French presidency, has been deviated from its aim".

The decision, the statement said, "ignores the reality of the world market which is characterised by wide domination by a few big constructors upon whom there weighs no constraint as regards competition".
The government would as a result ask in the current revision of the Treaty of Rome founding the European
Community that "such decisions be subject in the future to political and not just juridical considerations".
Earlier, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France would press the EC council of ministers meeting in
Utrecht (Netherlands) Saturday to act against the Commission veto.

France to use powers for reversal of EC's De Havilland  veto

(Copyright 1991)
PARIS, Oct 4 (AFP) - France is to press the  EC council of ministers on Saturday to act against a  Commission veto blocking the  takeover of the Canadian De  Havilland  aircraft manufacturer, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said here on Friday.

He was referring to a decision by the Commissioner for Competition Sir Leon Brittan to veto the proposed takeover of financially-troubled De Havilland  by the European ATR company, which is owned equally by French state-owned  Aerospatiale and Italian Alenia.

Brittan, who was a cabinet minister under former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said that the deal would have caused unacceptable concentration of European manufacturing of commuter aircraft, consequently adversely affecting the market for other aircraft.
The other two manufacturers of commuter aircraft in the EC are Fokker and British Aerospace.

Dumas told journalists: "To the extent that the Commission exceeds its competence, use must be made of control mechanisms".

He noted that the administrative and executive Commission of the European Community (EC) came "under the double political jurisdiction of the council of ministers and judicial authority of the European court in Luxembourg".

He said: "The government and the companies concerned will see if it is desirable to have recourse to these means."

The decision was "regrettable" because "everything that can strengthen European industry in the face of world competition is a good thing."
"France will bring this before the EC council of ministers meeting informally in Utrecht (The Netherlands) on
Saturday and will use means available to it under the Treaty of Rome (which founded the Community)," he said.

Outrage Spreads In France Over EC Veto Of Aviation Merger
DAVID CRARY

The Associated Press
ASP

(Copyright 1991. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)
PARIS (AP) - Abandoning its professed respect for  European Community institutions, France demanded Friday that the  EC Commission reconsider its veto of a French-Italian bid to  buy the De Havilland  aircraft company.
Premier Edith Cresson issued a communique stating the government's "disapproval" of the veto and reserving
France's right to appeal to the  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

"This decision is seriously prejudiced against European interests and saving jobs in the face of international competition," the statement said.

The communique followed two days of outraged statements by French politicians over the decision, which they said prevents Europe from competing on a global scale with the United States and Japan.

Conservative leaders were as vehement as the governing Socialists. Former Premier Jacques Chirac said Friday the veto was "an unjust decision, contrary to the interests of Europe."

He expressed indignation that Jacques Delors, the Frenchman who is president of the commission, abstained during Wednesday's 9-4 vote to block the proposed purchase of De Havilland, a Toronto-based division of Boeing Co.

The takeover was sought jointly bu Europe's two biggest commuter-aircraft makers, Aerospatiale SA of France and Alenia SpA of Italy, both state-controlled.

The majority on the EC Commission decided that the purchase would create such a dominant entity that other European companies - specifically British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands - would be forced out of the market.

French officials countered that major mergers were needed, in the aviation industry and elsewhere, if Europe was to compete successfully in coming decades with the United States and Japan.

Paris is normally one of the strongest proponents of European integration and of strengthening the powers of EC institutions. The EC has been taking steps to intensify the integration of its 12 members, moving from purely economic to political union.

Aerospatiale, although disappointed by the decision, said it was unlikely to file an appeal with the European Court of Justice because such a process could take several years and be very costly.

Alain Madelin, deputy leader of the conservative Union for French Democracy, touched on one of the most sensitive aspects of the ruling - whether France could give wholehearted support in the future to moves that would give the EC bureaucracy more power as Europe moves toward a single market.

"It's not the decision in itself that should be condemned, but the nature of the powers that were given to the commission - the powers to control mergers," he said.
"I hope ths lesson is heeded in the future when someone tries to grant more powers to Brussels." Document asp0000020011109dna400xpi

OTTAWA -DJ- Canadian Industry Minister Michael Wilson told reporters that the Canadian government doesn't intend to make a direct investment in Boeing Co.'s de  Havilland  commuter airplane subsidiary.

The Canadian government sold de Havilland  to Boeing in 1986. Boeing has proposed to sell de  Havilland  to two European companies, Aerospatiale SNI of France and Alenia E Selenia SPA of Italy. But Wednesday, the European Community Commission blocked the proposed acquisition on competition grounds.

Wilson said the government was prepared to assist Boeing and the two European companies ''to come to some other arrangement if that is possible.''

He also said the Canadian government was prepared to make funding available to de Havilland under various federal programs.

Ontario Premier Bob Rae also said yesterday that ''anything we can do to continue the company as a viable presence in the industry is what we want to do.''

Potential  suitors in the wings ANALYSIS"Aircraft maker still attractive takeover target
GEOFFREY ROWAN
1,015 words
4 October 1991
The Globe and Mail
GLOB

THE faltering de  Havilland  division of Boeing Co., staring at an uncertain tomorrow, remains an attractive
takeover target if for no other reason than to remove it completely from the competitive scene.

On Wednesday, the  European Commission rejected a bid by a French- Italian consortium to  buy de Havilland, leaving the financially moribund Toronto-based company twisting in the wind.

Boeing wants to unload the company, which makes the popular Dash 8 airplane, but it doesn't seem to have a lot of offers.

There are too many companies making commuter airplanes in the world so if one disappears, it won't be missed much, industry analysts say. But, they add, de Havilland may be saved anyway, as a simple defensive move to keep others from making gains.

"The attractiveness of de Havilland to another manufacturer of a similar-sized aircraft is not de Havilland itself but the threat that might be posed if another manufacturer got a hold of it," said Professor Regas Doganis, head of
the Department of Air Transport at Cranfield Institute of Technology's College of Aeronautics in Britain.

Certainly, the European Commission saw the purchase of de Havilland by the consortium - Avions de Transport Regional - as a threat to other European carriers. ATR would have had an unacceptable 67 per cent of the European commuter aircraft market if the deal went through, the EC said.

ATR's 50-50 partners, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, denounced the EC decision as "19th-century thinking" and self-serving protectionism, promoted by Britain and the Netherlands.

Indeed, the EC decision may well serve British and Dutch interests by keeping de Havilland out of the hands of their major European competitors.

A senior federal official in Ottawa said yesterday that British Aerospace PLC and NV Fokker of the Netherlands have both expressed an interest in de Havilland, if the consortium deal fell through.

A spokesman for Fokker denied that it has an interest in de Havilland, but in an industry with six major players, and not enough business to support them all, something has to give.

"The economics of aircraft construction suggest there shouldn't be more than two or three major, world-sized producers," said Prof. Doganis.
That's the case with large airliners and with jet engines, he said.
"It's inevitable something like that will happen at the bottom end of the size market."

Martin Beyer, chairman of the international aviation consulting firm Avmark Inc. of Arlington, Va., agrees that there may be too many commuter airplane makers.

But he thinks de Havilland is positioned to remain a significant player. "They've got a very sizable sector of the market with the Dash 8, and Dash 7s are still around," Mr. Beyer said. "The marketplace is saying 'we want the airplanes.' "

Page 104 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
If that's the case, and it seems reasonable in view of de Havilland's order backlog of 83 airplanes, then the
$12-million question is why would Boeing want out, one Canadian analyst said.

Boeing, with its vast international marketing network and a powerful need to recover revenues lost to military cutbacks and the downturn in the airline industry, should be anxious to make de Havilland work for it.

The same customers it calls on to sell big airliners aren't buying many of those these days but they are buying commuter planes.

The easing of restrictions on commercial air travel in Europe and deregulation of the industry in the United States has created a brisk market for commuter aircraft - planes in the 20-to 70-seat category.

European carriers such as Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have been integrating the smaller planes into their fleets recently to give them the competitive advantage of being able to offer more flights without having to fill up enormous airliners.

In the United States, deregulation spawned a host of smaller carriers feeding traffic into major hubs along regional spokes.

With the Dash 8 in its stable, Boeing is well placed to exploit the growing demand for commuter planes in Europe and North America, an analyst said.
But Boeing doesn't see it that way.

Company spokesman Jack Gamble said the company hasn't seen the EC's written report so it doesn't know what options it has to pursue.
Asked if de Havilland wasn't a logical fit for a company in Boeing's current situation, he responded gruffly:

"It is not a logical fit if it is an entity that does not produce a profit for the bottom line and it has never produced a profit for Boeing."
Last year it lost $30-million for Boeing.

So why can't Boeing make de Havilland work for it when there is market demand, one of the world's most well-established marketing forces and a hefty backlog of orders?

"(De Havilland) has had very serious internal problems related to cost," said Prof. Doganis. "They are in an ancient facility, built in World War Two, it's a veritable rabbit warren of a facility."

Prof. Doganis also cited "an unbending labour force that has not been willing to make concessions to improve production and reduce costs."
That, he said, may be what finally destroys de Havilland.

"That problem will have to be addressed. People's interest in the organization will be directly proportional to the degree to which those problems are addressed and the degree to which government supports it."

With enough government support, Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, which makes a popular commuter aircraft of its own, might even find that de Havilland complements its Canadair division nicely without much overlap, said several analysts.

A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to discuss such a scenario, saying it was hypothetical. But Bombardier did give some thought to joining the ATR consortium at one point.
A final option, Mr. Beyer said, is that nobody will do anything.
"The possibility is that everybody will walk away form the party and there won't be any party anymore." Document glob000020011109dna4015a4

French minister blasts EC decision Jeanneney says 'biased'  measure used

OTTAWA

France has denounced the  European Commission's decision to block the proposed acquisition of de Havilland by a French-Italian consortium as "short-sighted" and against the best interests of the European aerospace industry.

"The French government has received this decision with deep regret," Jean-Noel Jeanneney, France's secretary of state for external trade, told reporters yesterday during an official visit to Canada.

French officials also accused the commission of using a "biased" measure in calculating the consortium's dominance of the European market for commuter aircraft.

The commission, the executive branch of the European Community, ruled on Wednesday that it could not sanction the creation of "a powerful and unassailable position in the world market for turboprop aircraft."

The commission estimated that the consortium, Avions de Transport Regional, would grab 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC market for commuter planes if the acquisition went through.

Mr. Jeanneney accused the commission of failing to take into account that it was dealing with an international market where there was overcapacity and a need for industry restructuring.

"This decision will weaken the European aeronautic industry at the expense of several countries that are already strong in the area or are becoming so, notably the U.S. and the Asian countries," he said.
The consortium is owned by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Both are state-controlled.

The French minister accused the commission of making an unfair calculation of the consortium's market share by taking the number of commuter planes sold by each company, and multiplying the result by the number of seats on each aircraft.

Because competing manufacturers tend to make smaller aircraft, with fewer than 40 seats each, and the consortium makes larger planes, with as many as 66 places each, the calculation gives the consortium a bigger proportion of the market, French officials claim.

"It's a little bizarre," Mr. Jeanneney said. "It's as if we compared the relative strength of auto makers by multiplying the number of cars sold by the number of doors, or the number of horsepower or the number of passenger spaces."

Mr. Jeanneney said he was also concerned that the commission was extending the effects of its competition policy beyond Europe. "It's a principle that merits some reflection."

He said the companies may decide to appeal to the European Court of Justice, but added that such a move is up to the industrialists who run the consortium and not his government.

FRANCE AIMS TO APPEAL EC'S DE HAVILLAND VETO.

PARIS, Reuter - France will use all its powers to appeal against the European Commission's veto of a planned purchase  by Aerospatiale and Alenia of Boeing Co's De Havilland  subsidiary, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said on Friday.
Dumas told reporters that France intended to lodge its objections to the veto at a meeting on Saturday of
European Community foreign ministers.

Dumas said France regretted the Commission's veto and said "France will use all possible means, in conformity with the Treaty of Rome", to appeal.

The Commission said on Wednesday it had vetoed the purchase of De Havilland, a Canadian commuter aircraft maker, by French state-owned Aerospatiale and Alenia, which is owned by the Italian government.

Dumas said there was a possibility that Paris and the aircraft makers could lodge an appeal with the European Court of Justice, but he added that they would have to decide whether the Commission had exceeded its authority.

"The (French) government regrets this decision," Dumas told reporters attending an Anglo-American press luncheon.

Dumas said there would have been no distortion of European competition if the planned purchase had been allowed and that it would have strengthened European industry in the face of world competition.
He said the French government believed the planned agreement was in conformity with the Treaty of Rome. Foreign ministers of EC member states are scheduled to meet on Saturday in Utrecht, Netherlands. Document lba0000020011124dna405awz

AEROSPATIALE MAY APPEAL AGAINST DE HAVILLAND VETO.

PARIS, Reuter -  Aerospatiale of France said on Friday it did not rule out appealing against a  European                Commission veto of a planned  purchase  by itself and  Alenia of Italy of de  Havilland,  a Canadian division of Boeing.

Henri Martre, president of the French state-controlled aerospace firm, told French radio that the  Commission's policy must be aimed at building a  Europe that can defend itself.

"There must, therefore, be a change in policy at Brussels and if this appeal helps that change, we will do it," he said.

The Commission on Wednesday said it had vetoed the planned purchase of de Havilland, a Canadian commuter aircraft maker which Boeing Co of Seattle, Washington, bought five years ago from the Canadian government.

Explaining the EC executive's decision, Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said Aerospatiale and Alenia could not be allowed to win "a powerful and unassailable dominant position at the European Community and world level" in the commuter aircraft market.

Martre said certain members of the Commission were "old-fashioned Thatcherites who are completely short-sighted when it comes to the world's economic realities and who score own goals for Europe."
Brittan was once a member of the British government when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. Separately, French Transport Minister Paul Quiles said in a radio interview that he regretted the Commission
veto. "I myself would like the Commission to revise its stance," he said.

Trade and Industry Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the leader of the neo-Gaullist RPR opposition party, Jacques Chirac, added their voices to the chorus of complaints.

"It's a too narrow vision of competition," Strauss-Kahn told the French daily Liberation. "Pragmatism and a long-term vision must be applied to support the interests of the community."

Strauss-Kahn added that the Commission's argument took only certain parts of the aircraft construction industry into account, ignoring the growing strength of other players in the industry and the importance of the world market.

Asked if the decision reflected a desire by Brittan to protect the interests of British Aerospace Plc, Strauss-Khan said it had probably been motivated by ideology.

Chirac said the decision was unjustified at a time when Europe's aircraft industry had to face the crushing domination of its U.S. competitors.
"The French government must demand that this decision is withdrawn as soon as possible," he said. Document lba0000020011124dna405ay5

OTTAWA - The  European bid to take over Metro-based de  Havilland  appears to be dead, but there may yet be a white knight ready to rescue the troubled aircraft manufacturer.
The French-Italian consortium is unlikely to appeal a  European Commission decision to block its takeover of de
Havilland,  which is owned by Boeing Co. of Seattle, says a spokesperson for France's Aerospatiale.
"We don't see how we can overcome this problem," said Michel Troubetzkoy, an Aerospatiale official in Ottawa. An appeal to the European court is possible, "but it takes three years. If we had to wait three years, I don't know
how much of de Havilland would still be left," Troubetzkoy said yesterday.

The European Commission blocked the acquisition on the grounds that the European consortium of Aerospatiale and Italian-based Alenia would have a stranglehold on the market for commuter airplanes.
The decision has again thrown into confusion the future of the plant and its 4,300 workers.

Troubetzkoy said Aerospatiale and Alenia were still examining their options, including the possibility of some type of strategic alliance with Boeing.

Investment Canada spokesperson Charles Byron said the Aerospatiale/Alenia bid remains an open file but "we would expect a notice of withdrawal by the investor and that hasn't happened yet."
Boeing spokesperson Craig Martin said the company is now reviewing all options for the Toronto aircraft maker. Asked whether that included shutting down the Downsview plant and writing it off, Martin said, "We have to look
at all the alternatives. But I'm not going to outline any of them."
Junior industry minister William Winegard said other companies may be waiting in the wings to buy de Havilland. "It's well known other companies have had an interest in Boeing," Winegard said in the House of Commons.
"Those other companies have not been able to move as long as this particular deal was on the table. If this deal is
off the table, those other companies can come back into the picture to try to resolve this situation."

Winegard did not elaborate on which companies were thought to be interested. However, British Aerospace has indicated an interest in buying de Havilland, while Dutch-based Fokker and Deustche Aerospace also signalled a general interest.

Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. was also once considered interested, but the company would not comment on the latest developments.

France, angered by EC ruling  on De Havilland,  prepares appeal
ISABELLE HOURCADE

(Copyright 1991)
PARIS, Oct 5 (AFP) - As enraged politicians and businessmen here vented anger over a  European Commission
veto of a joint French-Italian  takeover of Canada's troubled De  Havilland  aircraft manufacturer, France was set
to appeal the decision Saturday at a meeting of  EC foreign ministers.

Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France would use the meeting in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to press its case and would "use means available to it under the Treaty of Rome," which founded the  European Community, to overturn the decision.
The proposed takeover was "in conformity with the requirements of the Treaty of Rome and could be useful to
European companies," Dumas said.

He was backed in his campaign by Prime Minister Edith Cresson whose office "marked its disapproval" of the decision, and said it contested the motives to justify the veto and "reserved the right" to take the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Commissioner for Competition Sir Leon Brittan rejected the takeover of De Havilland by the European ATR
company, which is owned equally by French state-owned Aerospatiale and Italian Alenia.

He ruled that it would have caused unacceptable concentration of European manufacturing of commuter aircraft and adversely affect other companies.
Brittan, a former cabinet minister under prime minister Margaret Thatcher, has previously crossed swords with
French authorities over state aid to the Renault car company, and has been branded here as "anti-French."

Conservative opposition RPR deputy Jean de Lipkowski questioned the "impartiality" of Brittan on Saturday, while Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR (Rally for the Republic), said he was "profoundly shocked" that Commission President Jacques Delors, a Frenchman, had abstained from the vote.

The president of Aerospatiale, Henri Martre, attributed the decision to "Thatcherite diehards" who "terrorize" their colleagues on the commission.

BAN ON AEROSPATIALE/SELENIA  ACQUISITION OF DE HAVILLAND MEETS WITH CRITICISM IN FRANCE.

PARIS - 04/10/1991 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The European Commission's decision to ban the acquisition of the Canadian firm De Havilland  by Aerospatiale (France) and Alenia e Selenia (Italy) - see EUROPE of 3 October, pp. 9-10 - has provoked extremely critical reactions in France. The Minister for European Affairs, Mrs. Guigou, has said this decision is based on an exclusively legal approach to competition problems and risks seriously handicapping European industry. The  acquisition of De Havilland  would have been, in her view, a means of "becoming stronger facing American and southeast Asian competition... This approach contradicts the guidelines of the industrial policy" proposed by Vice-President Bangemann and shared by the Council.

Even harsher criticism was voiced by other ministers and especially representatives of industry, some personally calling into question Sir Leon Brittan and accusing him of defending the interests of British industries that are Aerospatiale's competitors.

ONE of the fundamental rules for a negotiator - or a poker player - is not to show your bottom line before you have to. If you do, your opponent is more than likely to take you to the cleaners.

What, then, are Ontario taxpayers to think of Premier Bob Rae and Treasurer Floyd Laughren, those obliging palookas who are in the ring to defend the honour of de  Havilland  aircraft plant against international corporate villainy? "Anything we can do to continue the company as a viable presence in the industry is what we want to
do," Mr. Rae said after the  European Commission vetoed the  sale of de Havilland  by The Boeing Co. of Seattle to a European consortium. When asked where the money for a rescue would come from, Mr. Laughren chimed in "if we have to find it, we'll find it." Huzzah.

The seemingly open-ended invitation for someone to loot the provincial treasury to save de Havilland was all the stranger for its timing. It came the day after Mr. Laughren clipped $600-million off this year's spending plans, and said that it would be a struggle to keep spending within the already generous bounds he has set for next yext.

Whatever Ontario's financial involvement in de Havilland, it should based on a balance of interest among the cost to the province's taxpayers, the state of the treasury, other spending requirements and the situation of the aircraft manufacturer. By tipping its hand now, Ontario has weakened the province's negotiating position and abandoned its responsibility to properly weigh any financial commitment to de Havilland.

Unfortunately, the temptation to throw money in de Havilland's direction will be reinforced by yesterday's announcement that, in the first six months of next year, the aircraft maker is laying off 1,270 of its 4,170 workers and cutting production from 4.5 to two planes a month.

The cutbacks are not surprising. The recession has slowed the pace of new orders from 104 planes two years ago to 46 last year to 19 so far in 1991. While the company's backlog of unfilled orders is 85 planes, the delivery dates stretch out over the next five years.

It is unfortunate layoffs are necessary. But the fundamental issue at de Havilland is not the number of employees but the viability of the company. If the company is not made viable, no jobs will be saved. Viability will only be achieved with increased productivity from de Havilland's management and workers.

Boeing still seems to want to sell de Havilland. Ontario now seems to be moving towards buying it. An NDP government would not likely cut jobs, no matter how battered de Havilland's order book. Mr. Rae will "do anything" and Mr. Laughren "will find" the money. Watch out Ontario taxpayers.

Delors to meet with Aerospatiale chief on De Havilland  issue

English
(Copyright 1991)
HAARZUILEN, Netherlands, Oct 6 (AFP) -  European Community Commission president Jacques Delors is to meet on Monday with the  Aerospatiale Group chairman to discuss the Franco-Italian desire to  buy Canada's De Havilland  aviation firm, French foreign minister Roland Dumas said here over the weekend.

Dumas told a press conference that Delors and chairman Henri Martre will discuss "ways of changing the project to bring it more into conformity with Commission precedents", in the wake of the  Commission's veto of the Franco-Italian  takeover of the troubled De Havilland  aircraft-maker.

That veto, at the urging of EC competition commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, has enraged French politicians and businessmen, who have called it "scandalous", "unacceptable" and "inconsistent", among other things.

But Dumas warned that "I did not say the Commission would change its point of view - the case is rather the reverse", the idea being to try to make the vetoed proposal more "presentable".

Asked whether the Commission might reconsider its veto if the plan developed by Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia is modified, Delors responded "Why not? We're not obstinate people."

He defended the Commission's decision, with which he expressed "solidarity", on the basis that with an eye on the future EC single market, it is vital for the Community to make sure competition rules are properly respected.

The EC ruling was made on the basis that the acquisition would lead to unacceptable concentration of European manufacturing of commuter aircraft and would adversely affect other companies.

Delors justified his abstention in the Commission vote on the De Havilland deal as normal in a case in which a Commission president found himself in opposition to another commissioner - "especially in a case involving France". (Delors is French.)

He commented that the EC Commission president "does not rule the roost", and the French have to realize that the Commission is not like a presidential regime.

Pressure to change merger rules AFTER DE HAVILLAND TAKEOVER BID BLOCKED.
By Andrew Marshall in Brussels

The European Commission's decision to block a  takeover bid for the Canadian aircraft builder de  Havilland  by the joint venture formed by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's  Alenia has produced pressure to change the recently established European Community's  merger regulatory framework.

French representatives and officials in the industry directorate of the  Commission were furious at the decision by Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, to block the  deal, which casts doubt on the future of the ailing subsidiary of US aircraft maker Boeing.

While the first such application of the Commission's one-year-old anti-trust powers is seen as a boost for Brussels' credibility as an impartial competition watchdog, there is believed to be growing support for a European competition agency that would be independent of the Commission.

French officials fought hard for the deal and believed until the last that they would win. It is thought there was a last-minute surprise shift in opinion within the Commission.

Industry commissioner Martin Bangemann supported the bid in private, according to officials. And Sir Leon, who pressed the Commission to block the bid, was unsure whether he would win on the morning it voted.

Last Wednesday's decision was seen as an historic victory not just for Sir Leon and the competition directorate but also for the EC's merger task force. As well as demonstrating the expanding role of the Commission, task force members believe it showed national merger authorities in the US and Europe that they intend to take the competition issue seriously.

The battle pitted advocates of European industrial champions against those with a more pro-market view. The former believed that the ATR consortium's acquisition of de Havilland would ensure that the European aviation industry succeeded in a key sector. Those who opposed the bid saw it as anti-competitive and were concerned about the effect it would have on smaller European companies, in particular Britain's British Aerospace.

Sir Leon said the merger would have given de Havilland and ATR 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC market for commuter aircraft of 20 to 70 seats. This would have given the group a powerful advantage over competitors, such as BAe and Fokker of the Netherlands, without any competition from the US or Japan to offset it.
At present, all European commissioners can vote on the decision to block bids.

This led to accusations that Sir Leon was defending BAe, and that the French were backing ATR. The main source of contention was over the way in which the competition directorate defined de Havilland's market and what impact the takeover would have had on it. The industry directorate came up with diametrically opposed conclusions.

This emphasised the built-in conflict in the Commission on takeover issues between views on competition policy and national considerations.

It is felt that an independent agency would avoid this, insulating the commissioners. But lawyers say it would not remove the uncertainties from the Commission's merger regulations.

EC COMMISSION GETTING TOO BIG FOR ITS BOOTS, BEREGOVOY SAYS.

(c) 1991 Reuters Limited
PARIS, Oct 6, Reuter - Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, angered by the  European Commission's veto of a French-Italian venture's  purchase  of Boeing Co's de  Havilland  commuter aircraft subsidiary, said on Sunday the commission was acting outside its jurisdiction and needed to be brought into line.

"The European Commission should be made to face up to its responsibilities and and reminded that power lies with the European Council," he said in a radio interview.
It was not immediately clear whether the French minister meant the regular meeting of leaders known as the
European Council or the Council of Ministers, which takes most EC decisions on legislation.

Denouncing what he described as a "technocratic deviation", Beregovoy said it was time for Europe to become more democratic. "The last word should be with the politicians."

France has said it intends to appeal against the veto on the purchase of loss-making de Havilland by French state-owned Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA of Italy.

The Commission said the merger would be anti-competitive, giving the new group too great a share of the world market for commuter aircraft.

"The Commission is not the alpha and omega of European construction," Beregovoy said, saying the question was whether the Commission would allow Europe to compete effectively with Japan and the United States.
"France's Finance Ministry is a little castle facing up to the immense Brussels fortress," he added.

De Havilland announced in Toronto on Friday it planned to cut its workforce from 4,200 to 2,900 in the first half of next year because of reduced orders for its Dash 8 commuter airliner.

A spokesman for the company, Colin Fisher, said the cuts were not related to the EC Commission veto. "The lowering of the production rate is a direct result of the worldwide recession and the slump in regional aircraft," he said.

Boeing, based in Seattle, Washington, said after the EC veto was announced that it would have to consider its options with respect to de Havilland.

THE ROW over Sir Leon Brittan's decision to block the takeover by Aerospatiale and Alenia of Canadian aircraft builder De  Havilland  is hotting up, with European Community Foreign Ministers and possibly heads of government getting sucked in.

The real reason the French and Italians have become so hot under the collar is that this decision shows once again the lack of any kind of  European industrial policy. As they see it, the  Commission should be helping build up Europe's industrial base against US and Japanese competition. Sir Leon's puritan version of the Tebbit doctrine seems to be doing precisely the opposite.

France and Italy want to know how Brussels answers the question of how to keep intact a viable European aircraft industry, as they also want to know how it intends to maintain a competitive computer or car sector. Sir Leon claims that market forces have transformed the UK economy. That is precisely what worries our French and Italian friends.

BRUSSELS, Oct 7 (AFP) - Aerospatiale managing director Yves Michaut is to meet senior officials of the  EC       Commission to study how the "De Havilland  file can be advanced", an industrial source here said.

The Commission of the European Community (EC) last week vetoed a proposed  takeover of Canadian De Havilland,  a troubled manufacturer of commuter aircraft, by French  Aerospatiale and Italian  Alenia through their ATR joint venture.

French political and business leaders have accused the commission of exceeding its powers and acting in national interests to protect the Fokker and British Aerospace companies.

The EC Competition Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is a former cabinet minister under former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But Commission President Jacques Delors, a former French cabinet minister, has rejected the charges.

The commission vetoed the proposal on the basis that it would have created an unacceptable concentration in the production of commuter aircraft in Europe, with repercussions on the market for other aircraft.

Michaut was to meet the head of Delors' private office Pascal Lamy and possibly also a commission director general Riccardo Perissich who is responsible for the internal market and industrial affairs.

It had earlier been announced that Delors would meet Aerospatiale president Henri Martre on Monday. But Delors had to attend a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg.

French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas has said that the meeting in Brussels was to study ways of changing the takeover proposal so that it was more in line with the legal requirements of the commission.

MAARSSEN, the Netherlands -- Representatives of France's Aerospatiale SA and Italy's  Alenia SpA will visit the European Community Commission today in the wake of the commission's decision to block their  takeover of Boeing Co.'s de Havilland  unit.

At a weekend meeting of  EC foreign ministers to discuss political union, the French and Italian governments took the unusual step of insisting that the issue of de Havilland,  a commercial aircraft maker, be put on the agenda. Both governments expressed their dissatisfaction with the commission's ruling, arguing that it undermines the chances for European companies to compete successfully on the international stage.

This insistence put Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, in the uncomfortable position of defending a rul ing that he personally opposed.

The ruling was based on a recommendation by Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner. Sir Leon contended the takeover would give the companies a dominant position in the market for commuter turboprop planes, hampering competition in Europe.
Mr. Delors said member states are free to appeal commission decisions to the European Court of Justice.

The representatives of the two aerospace companies are expected to try to discuss with Brussels whether they can revise their bid in order to have the purchase approved. Commission officials, however, have said that such a scenario appears unlikely, given the narrow product range in question.

Aerospatiale Seeks To Revive De Havilland  Bid With EC

BRUSSELS -DJ- A delegation from France's  Aerospatiale SNI met with top officials from the European Community (EC) Commission this evening in an apparent bid to breath new life into the blocked de Havilland takeover bid.
The team, headed by  Aerospatiale vice-president Yves Michot, met with top officials from  Commission
President Jacques Delors' cabinet to ''see how things can develop,'' a company spokesman said.
''I believe they want to find out the possibility of a new deal being resurrected,'' said Delors' spokesman. Neither side was willing to say more about the meeting.
Both said the other had initially demanded the meeting.
Delors is due to meet with Aerospatiale president Henri Martre on Oct. 15.

The meeting was fixed before the Commission banned Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia e Selenia Spa Wednesday from taking over De Havilland of Canada, added Delors' spokesman.

The ban provoked a political uproar in France including attacks on Delors and calls for reform of the one-year old merger regulation.

EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said a new Franco-Italian takeover would have to be ''significantly different'' from the first agreement to merit a second Commission examination.

There was no point the companies ''tinkering about'' with the first agreement in an attempt to make it acceptable, Brittan explained after breaking news of the ban.
De Havilland is a commuter airline subsidiary of Boeing Co.

A WATCHDOG BARES ITS FANGS: EC's rejection of de Havilland  takeover is part of a broader debate

It is some time since Sir Leon Brittan QC actively practised law. But at Wednesday's meeting of the  European      Commission it was the British competition commissioner's cool advocacy which persuaded a majority of his colleagues to block the Franco-Italian  takeover of de Havilland.
Weeks of fierce lobbying in Brussels by the companies affected - particularly the French bidder  Aerospatiale SA
- and several days of intense press speculation about the outcome had proved inconclusive. When
commissioners sat down, it was still unclear whether they would, for the first time since new  EC merger
regulations came into force a year ago, outlaw a  takeover. In the end they did, on the grounds that it would have
given the new combined company 50% of the world market and 67% of the  EC market for commuter aircraft of 20
to 70 seats.

''I think Leon Brittan changed a lot of minds,'' one senior commission official said. ''He spent a lot of energy explaining to colleagues what {the case} was about and making them aware it was an important issue.''

The decision has provoked a furious reaction in Paris and Rome because of its implications for the troubled European aerospace industry. Paul Quiles, the French transport minister, warned: ''This goes against the interests of the European aerospace industry and risks weakening it dangerously against world competition.''

Aerospatiale and Alenia SpA, the Italian state aerospace group, saw the acquisition of de Havilland as an important step in their effort to create a large European industrial entity in the troubled market for commuter and regional aircraft. De Havilland was to have been linked in Aerospatiale's and Alenia's broader co-operation in this field with Deutsche Aerospace.
It also seems increasingly likely that British Aerospace PLC, one of the big objectors to the takeover, will
approach the three other European companies to discuss the possibility of joining their new European alliance for
regional aircraft. This would create what could ultimately become a consortium similar to Airbus in which BAe,
Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain co-operate in the large airliner market.

The regional aircraft market is the one sector of the industry which no longer interests big U.S. manufacturers. After all, Boeing Co. has been trying for some time to sell de Havilland and move out of turbo-propeller commuter aircraft. The European makers saw an opportunity to become market leaders, although they have been aware for months that the only hope of making money out of regional aircraft was to consolidate the industry into one or two groups of partner companies.

This development has been thrown into some doubt by the commission's decision. But in the eyes of Sir Leon's supporters, the block has given the year-old EC merger task force a final seal of credibility.

De Havilland was the 53rd case to be despatched by the task force since its inception in September 1990, and its decisions have now spanned the full range of possibilities - from straight clearance of a deal, via clearance with conditions, to rejection of a bid. Unlike previous mergers that had won conditional approval from the Commission, Sir Leon claimed that in the case of de Havilland there was no obvious means of reducing the enlarged group's dominance by demanding divestments or restructuring.

A senior EC competition official said the commission's decision represented a ''new maturity of merger policy,'' in particular because in their debate, commissioners stuck to the principle that takeovers should be judged on pure

Page 125 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
competition grounds. The merger regulation states that industrial and social policy factors can be taken into account, but competition-related criteria - such as the market share of the combined group - are equally important.

Sir Leon's opponents, however, argue that industrial and social factors made the de Havilland takeover a special case. Aerospatiale says the creation of a strong European aerospace industry should have been more important than a strict application of competition rules: all the more so since it also had significant implications not only for Europe but also for Canada.

The Canadian authorities told Sir Leon during his visit to Toronto and Ottawa last month that de Havilland's very survival depended on the Franco-Italian deal. The company is the biggest industrial employer in the Toronto area. Besides its own 4,300 employees, its suppliers employ an additional 20,000 people.

Backers of a strong Brussels line on competition, however, believe that a precedent has been established - a loose ''case law'' of European merger policy. The decision will make it more difficult for the less supportive commissioners to muddy the waters of EC antitrust policy in future. More important, supporters believe it should lessen the chances of Sir Leon's successors reneging on the strong and consistent line which Sir Leon and his predecessor, Peter Sutherland, have established.

Wednesday's decision may also make the U.S., and possibly Japan, sit up and re-examine their own antitrust policy. ''I think it's going to come as a major surprise {for the U.S.},'' one senior commission official says. ''They already feel that this merger regulation is more modern than their system and this {decision} is going to reinforce that view.''

But doubts do remain about the genuine purity of Brussels' competition policy. The commission's harshest critics have always been the national merger watchdogs - in particular the Office of Fair Trading and Monopolies and Mergers Commission in Britain, and the Bundeskartellamt in Germany. One national official welcomed the de Havilland decision, but added: ''One decision in the direction we would have liked doesn't necessarily prove that they would always do it that way.''

It is no secret, for example, that some national authorities would have liked the commission to block the merger between Robert Bosch and Varta, two German manufacturers of car batteries, and the bid by Tetra Pak, the liquid packaging group, for Alfa-Laval, a Swedish food-processing equipment company. Both deals were passed.

According to one competition official in Brussels, the next big challenge for the merger task force would be ''a hotly contested Anglo-Saxon takeover bid.'' British merger-control officials claim they are not jealous of the young Brussels task force's extensive powers, but its performance in such a high-profile case would almost certainly be scrutinized closely from London.

Perhaps a more important cloud over the future of Brussels' merger policy is that Wednesday's vote was still tinged with national sentiment, despite the alleged impartiality of the commission. The two Italian commissioners voted against the proposal, one of the French commissioners was absent, and the commission president, France's Jacques Delors, abstained from the vote. Delors was said to feel that to oppose Sir Leon would have been interpreted as a French-influenced decision undermining the credibility of the commission's merger regulation.

But the bitterness that Sir Leon's decision has left in France and Italy risks eventually undermining the commission's new antitrust policies. The suspicion is that in future a weaker case than de Havilland might not win the same backing, allowing thinly veiled national feelings to emerge. Sir Leon no doubt won some support for his case by stressing in the meeting that to allow the merger to go through would strike at the heart of EC competition policy.

Finally, even if the debate was fought on pure competition grounds, it still saw Sir Leon, the grand advocate of antitrust policy, ranged against Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner. In the past he has stood four-square behind the principle of allowing companies to build themselves into ''Euro-champions'' that can compete in a world market.

A single commission decision is not going to defuse the debate between the backers of industrial and competition policy. As one official put it: ''If you give the same case to two judges, you can get different results.''

Delors defends de Havilland  decision EC to meet with Aerospatiale officials

HAARZUILEN, Netherlands

European Commission President Jacques Delors, under fire in his native France, has defended the
commission's decision to block a French-Italian  takeover of Canadian aircraft manufacturer de  Havilland.

He said representatives of the French Aerospatiale group, one of the parties in the thwarted merger, will meet the commission today to discuss alternatives to the deal.

But in response to a spate of personal attacks from French politicians over the decision, he reiterated that the European Community's merger control laws cannot be twisted. The only appeal against the decision is to the European Court of Justice.

"This is not a presidential regime. The commission president does not make the rain fall and the sun shine," Mr. Delors said, banging his hand on the table for emphasis.

"The president is only the first among equals, who tries to make sure that a group of 17 people of 12 nationalities, representing the whole spectrum of political opinion, can work."

Under rules agreed to two years ago when France held the EC presidency, the 17-member commission has the right to block large pan-European mergers if they would damage competition in the community.

Last Wednesday, the commission ruled that state-run Aerospatiale and Alenia of Italy could not buy money-losing de Havilland because the purchase would give Aerospatiale and Alenia too dominant a place in the market for turbo-prop commuter aircraft.

De Havilland, which is owned by Seattle-based Boeing Co., has been suffering badly from a weakened market. Last week, de Havilland announced it will lay off more than a quarter of its staff and cut production of its Dash 8 commuter airplane.
The issue of the de Havilland purchase was raised during an informal meeting of EC foreign ministers in
Haarzuilen, Netherlands, yesterday by France's Roland Dumas.

"The merger control text should strengthen the competitiveness of European industry, not hinder it." Aerospatiale will discuss with the commission how it could change its plans to conform with EC competition rules, he said.

That would probably involve selling off part of the merged business and would require the deal to again be put before the commission, which would have to open a new inquiry.

Mr. Delors said he would be happy if the two companies could find a solution to allow them to pursue their global strategy.
He abstained at Wednesday's vote after registering his objections privately. But said he was wrongly accused by
French politicians whose protests were damaging France's EC image.

Mr. Delors suggested some might be attacking him because of his high standing in the opinion polls. He is seen as a possible future prime minister and likely candidate to succeed President Francois Mitterrand.

Commission president attacks France over merger block on De Havilland.

From David Usborne in Haarzuilens

Jacques Delors, the  European Commission President, yesterday struck back at his native France in an extraordinary row that has broken out over last week's decision by Brussels to block a Franco-Italian  takeover bid for De Havilland,  the troubled aircraft manufacturer.

The outburst came at the end of a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Haarzuilens in the Netherlands, near Utrecht, when, exceptionally in such circumstances, the French government's grievances about the case were officially raised by France's foreign minister, Roland Dumas.
Today, senior EC officials are to meet executives of Aerospatiale in Brussels to consider whether the bid for De
Havilland, made jointly with Alenia of Italy, might be adjusted to bring it into line with EC competition law.

Aerospatiale and Alenia have formed a consortium, ATR - already the world's top manufacturer of turbo-prop commuter aircraft ahead of De Havilland, which is number two.

The development will alarm British Aerospace (BAe), which was delighted that the bid, launched by ATR, was blocked on the advice of the EC Competition Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan.

BAe and Fokker of the Netherlands are the only other real competitors in the market for commuter turbo-prop planes of 20 to 70 seats.

Enraged by a right-wing press campaign in France demanding his resignation from the Commission, Mr Delors said he was being victimised by political leaders in his own country.

He added that the French government itself was in error to challenge a decision reached according to a regulation agreed by all member states two years ago.

"I cannot accept that we should be put on a phoney trial on phoney evidence. It will damage the image of Europe and damage the image of France in Europe," he said.

Demonstrating the depth of his anger, Mr Delors publicly attacked Mr Dumas for giving a press conference at the same time as his own, held jointly with the Dutch EC presidency.
"I am astonished by his performance here - even if I do not have legal jurisdiction in matters of politeness."
As for his position as Commission President, Mr Delors was adamant that the decision had been taken by the
17-member Commission as a whole and that he, as a "primus inter pares" could not be held in any way
responsible for the decision, nor could he have vetoed it.
"French people will have to understand that this is not a presidential system here," he said.

He suggested some might be attacking him because of his high standing in the opinion polls. He is seen as a possible future prime minister at home and likely candidate to succeed President Francois Mitterrand.

Mr Delors expressed optimism that Aerospatiale might be able to reformulate the takeover bid in a way that would satisfy the Commission.


Page 129 of 132 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Officials in Brussels consider this unlikely, however.

If Aerospatiale cannot reformulate the bid satisfactorily its only avenue of appeal would be to the European Court of Justice.

Mr Dumas complained that "the merger control text should strengthen the competitiveness of European industry, not hinder it".

According to Sir Leon's estimates, a merged ATR De Havilland grouping would dominate the commuter plane sector, with 50 per cent of the world market and 67 per cent of the EC market.

An irony of the affair is that the merger regulation, which gives the Commission such sweeping powers to block anti-competitive mergers, was agreed by member states when France had the rotating EC presidency.
Controversy over the decision has been heightened because this is the first merger to have been blocked by the
EC since it was given anti-trust powers a year ago.

The Canadian government has been anxious for the deal to go ahead as possibly the only way of securing the future of De Havilland, a subsidiary of Boeing of the US.

HAARZUILEN, Netherlands, Oct 6, Reuter -  European Commission President Jacques Delors, under fire in his native France, defended the  EC executive's decision to block a Franco-Italian  takeover of Canadian aircraft manufacturer De  Havilland,  a unit of The Boeing Co.

FRANCE'S BEREGOVOY SAYS EC EXCEEDS ITS AUTHORITY.

PARIS, Oct 6, Reuter - French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, angered by the European Commission's veto of a French-Italian venture's  purchase  of Boeing Co's De  Havilland  subsidiary, said the commission was acting outside its jurisdiction and needed to be brought into line.

"The European Commission should be made to face up to its responsibilities and and reminded that power lies with the European Council," Beregovoy said in a radio interview.

It was not clear whether he meant the regular meeting of leaders known as the European Council or the Council of Ministers, which takes most EC decisions on legislation.

Denouncing what he described as a "technocratic deviation," Beregovoy said it was time for Europe to become more democratic. "The last word should be with the politicians."

France has said it intends to appeal the veto on the purchase of De Havilland, a Canadian commuter aircraft maker, by French state-owned Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia SpA .

The Commission said the merger would be anti-competitive, giving the new group too great a share of the world market for commuter aircraft.
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas was due to raise the issue with his EC partners in Haarzuilen, the
Netherlands, on Sunday.

"The Commission is not the alpha and omega of European construction," Beregovoy said, saying the question was whether the Commission would allow Europe to compete effectively with Japan and the United States.
"France's Finance Ministry is a little castle facing up to the immense Brussels fortress," he added. Document lba0000020011124dna705f9d
