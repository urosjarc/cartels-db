EU Makes It Official: No Honeywell  for GE --- Regulatory Policy Hits a Continental Divide

STRASBOURG, France -- In one of its most high-profile and controversial antitrust decisions ever, the
European Commission officially blocked  General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc.

The rejection of the merger, a unanimous decision by 20 Europeancommissioners, may illustrate a divergence in the way U.S. and Europeanregulators approach megamergers. It also reflects the closer view the
commission is taking in investigating mergers than its U.S. counterparts, which could in turn lead to a greater degree of scrutiny and  regulation.

In announcing the decision, European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti repeatedly referred to close antitrust cooperation between the U.S. and the European Union. He also said that "the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded." He stressed the need to improve U.S.-EU collaboration "to reduce this risk further."

The opposite conclusions reached by EU and U.S. regulators in the GE-Honeywell case are all the more striking given the truly global nature of the proposed acquisition. While the sides have disagreed in the past, their conclusions could usually be explained in the context of their different markets.

With GE and Honeywell, however, the relevant market is the global aerospace industry, which transcends national borders. Therefore, the rejection of the case speaks to a difference of approach much larger than one-time divergence.

"This is the first time that we have come to a different conclusion in the same market," Mr. Monti said. "I'm genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred."

A reason behind the EU's negative opinion is the lack of tools European antitrust enforcers have to prevent the abuse of market power after a merger has been approved.

Under U.S. antitrust practice, the government or anyone else can file a lawsuit against a deal that has already received a regulatory green light. Such postmerger oversight is almost impossible in Europe. "This is a notable difference," Mr. Monti said without referring to the GE case in particular. "We have a one-shot possibility to approve or block a merger."

Another difference is the powerful voice that competitors of the merging companies possess in European merger reviews. Although Mr. Monti dismissed the criticism that regulators were swayed by competitors, he also confirmed for the first time that several U.S. airlines provided the commission with crucial evidence in the
GE-Honeywell investigation on condition of anonymity.

These airlines, Mr. Monti said, were reluctant to voice their concerns in the more-public forum of U.S. antitrust reviews for fear of testifying against a company as powerful as GE. Most of the industry rivals sought not to kill the deal but to impose strict conditions on it. The most vociferous complaints came from U.S.-based United Technologies Corp., Rolls Royce PLC of Britain, Paris-based Thales SA and Rockwell International Corp. of the U.S.

Tuesday's decision marks the end of a tortuous five-month negotiating process during which GE and Honeywell first fought together to overcome the commission's opposition, but in the end began fighting each other on how, and whether, to save their rapidly collapsing deal.

Page 5 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
At the core of the commission's concerns was the combination of GE's power in the market for aircraft jet engines and Honeywell's strength in manufacturing the crucial electronic guts of airplanes, known as avionics. Further exacerbating concerns was GE's lucrative aircraft-financing and leasing business, which the commission has accused of using anticompetitive tactics to squash competitors.

Despite their testimony to the contrary, the companies were never able to overcome the commission's allegations and would have been forced to partially float GE Capital Aviation services and sell some of Honeywell's core avionics businesses to win approval.

The companies' final offer -- which included a private placement of a 19.9% stake in the aircraft financing arm and the sale of some of Honeywell's businesses -- didn't appease European antitrust enforcers.

Faced with a rapidly unraveling deal, GE's negotiators were prepared in mid-June to tear up the merger to avoid the negative implication of having an official decision against the company. But Honeywell, which stood to lose most from a failed merger, refused to abandon the deal, according to people familiar with the situation. This disagreement came to a head on June 29 when Honeywell's Chairman and Chief Executive Michael R. Bonsignore publicly pleaded with his counterpart at GE, John F. Welch Jr., to do more to secure approval. Mr. Welch declined.

In a statement on Tuesday, GE expressed disappointment with the commission's decision, saying, "We strongly disagree with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence if GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services."

The company is considering appealing the commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, people familiar with the situation said. A GE spokesman said only that the company "will consider all our options."

The public spat between the two companies last week gave rise to speculation that Honeywell might sue GE for not pursuing "reasonable best efforts" to close the deal. A spokesman for Honeywell declined to comment on the company's potential future actions, saying only that it was disappointed with the commission's decision. Asked about any possible lawsuit from Honeywell, a spokesman for GE said the company doesn't "see any grounds for any such action."

The board of Honeywell International planned to meet in New York a few hours after the EU vote Tuesday, and was expected to oust Mr. Bonsignore. In addition to the collapse of its merger with GE, Honeywell has been beset by earnings shortfalls and morale problems among its employees. Mr. Bonsignore, who wasn't slated to take a
day-to-day role within GE following its acquisition of Honeywell, also has been accused by some managers and directors of becoming disengaged from operations in recent months.

According to people familiar with the situation, Honeywell planned to bring back former chairman Lawrence A. Bossidy for a one-year term as chief executive, with a mandate to decide whether the company should go it alone or consider another merger partner. United Technologies, which was close to acquiring Honeywell before GE stepped in with a better offer last October, is still considered a likely buyer, analysts said.

EU blocks  merger of GE, Honeywell; trade tension  rises

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Tuesday rejectedGeneral Electric's  $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell International, blocking what would have been the biggest industrial merger ever and exacerbating antitrust tensions with the United States.

The unanimous decision by the 20-member  EU Executive  Commission marks the first time foreign  regulators alone have killed a merger between two American companies. President Bush and U.S. legislators had lobbied for the deal, but the campaign backfired when  EU antitrust officials angrily objected to the political pressure.

The action also denied GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Welch the capstone to his 20-year career. Welch postponed his retirement to see the deal through and was deeply disappointed.

Meanwhile, Honeywell's board of directors announced Tuesday in New York that Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore would resign, effective immediately, after 31 years with the company. The board announced it would replace him with Lawrence Bossidy, 66, former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corp., which acquired Honeywell and adopted its name in 1999.

The U.S. Justice Department approved the GE-Honeywell deal, with minor alterations, in May. The EU veto came after the two companies failed to alleviate European fears that the merger would squelch competition and give GE a near-monopoly in jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
GE sharply disputed the European conclusions.

GE said it was incomprehensible how EU antitrust officials could take such a different view of a deal that was approved in the United States, Canada and a dozen other jurisdictions. Within the U.S. government, the reaction was similar.
The Justice Department issued a statement Tuesday reaffirming its conclusion.

"The merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," said Charles James, assistant attorney general for antitrust.

Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said last week that an EU rejection of the deal would be "off the wall." U.S. senators warned that the move would damage trans-Atlantic relations and compel retaliatory U.S. action.

After lashing out two weeks ago against U.S. pressure tactics, Mario Monti, the EU's top antitrust official, took a conciliatory approach Tuesday at a news conference in Strasbourg, France. He emphasized that U.S. and European antitrust officials had worked well together in the past and that their collaboration must be strengthened to cope with global corporations.

Monti acknowledged that the different interpretation reached by the Justice Department, which expressed none of the qualms voiced by European regulators, was a troubling development.

Multinational companies are required to follow the laws in all countries where they operate. Both EU and U.S. antitrust authorities review mergers of foreign companies with substantial activities within their jurisdiction.

EU officials say much of the misunderstanding can be attributed to the extraordinary power wielded by European regulators, who in effect act as judge, jury and prosecutor in antitrust cases. Instead of hearing cases in court, as U.S. regulators do, EU antitrust officials reach their own judgments after listening to the arguments of the companies involved and their competitors.

In the GE-Honeywell case, EU officials heeded the warnings of jet engine manufacturers, notably United Technologies and Rolls Royce, and avionics firms such as Rockwell International. They contended that their earnings would be devastated by General Electric's ability to slash prices by combining sales of jet engines, cockpit controls and financial credit from GE Capital.

Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, normally one of the leading proponents of free trade in Congress, recently complained about the EU's expected rejection of the deal.

"My concern is that we don't have bad policies imposed on us as Europeans try to protect themselves from competition," said Gramm, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which has oversight of mergers in the financial sector.
One pending deal that could face additional scrutiny is the Swiss company Nestle's $10.1 billion purchase of the
American Ralston Purina Co.

``The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines,'' said Mario Monti, the EU's top antitrust official. While the companies offered various concessions over eight months of negotiations, the remedies were insufficient, he said.

GE sharply disputed the European conclusions. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said, ``We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices.''

GE said it was incomprehensible how EU antitrust officials could take such a different view of a deal that was approved in the United States, Canada and a dozen other jurisdictions. Within the U.S. government, the reaction was similar.

In addition, GE Capital Aviation Services is the world's largest plane-leasing business and accounts for about 10 percent of global aircraft purchases. European regulators said it could give General Electric an unfair advantage in demanding use of Honeywell avionics on all plane purchases, just as it does with GE engines.

Monti's staff argued that such clout in ``bundling'' products across several markets might temporarily reduce prices but ultimately would cause GE's rivals to fail. That could give GE a near-monopoly in which it could dictate much higher prices. That argument, EU officials said, prompted more than a dozen airlines, European and American, to testify against the merger.

EU deals final blow to GE on merger;  Honeywell  sacks CEO in aftermath

European regulators dealt a final blow to  General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc. yesterday, marking the first time overseas authorities killed a proposed  merger between two companies based in the United States.

The European Commission, which handles merger approvals for its 15 member countries, charged that the combination would have allowed  GE, the world's largest company by market value, to choke off  competition in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
The rejection prompted Honeywell's board last night to replace Chairman and Chief Executive Michael
Bonsignore with former Chairman and CEO Lawrence Bossidy.

The European move was widely expected, but it signaled a particularly bitter end to the row between GE and European officials. In most cases, when a merger is likely to be blocked, the companies involved withdraw their application to avoid a high-profile rejection.
GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch, who put off his retirement to shepherd the deal, expressed
"profound regret" at the European decision, calling it a "setback."

Fairfield, Conn.-based GE needs the approval of European authorities to buy Morristown, N.J.-based Honeywell, just as European companies have to comply with American antitrust laws in the United States.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer held out the possibility of an appeal in European Union courts. But few observers expected legal action could save the deal. Of the 15 mergers EU authorities have blocked over the last 10 years, six have been taken to court, none successfully.
The odds of a successful legal challenge are "very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research
Group.

Mr. Sheffer said GE will not submit a new merger plan to European authorities, which would restart the approval process.

European authorities objected to the deal on the grounds that GE, which had $130 billion in sales last year, would be able to use its dominance in the jet-engine sector to undercut European rivals Rolls-Royce PLC of Britain and Thales SA of France.

In particular, they feared GE would be able to package its own jet engines with Honeywell's avionics and finance sales through GE Capital Aviation Services.
On Friday, GE rejected Honeywell's proposal for last-ditch revisions to the deal that would have pared more than
$1 billion from the takeover price. In return for a lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its
holdings to satisfy European concerns.

Mr. Monti sought to downplay the trans-Atlantic friction that has arisen from the European stance, preferring to emphasize his close links with American regulators.

"The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close cooperation during this investigation," Mr. Monti said. "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions."

The Justice Department approved the deal on May 2, under the condition that Honeywell sell off its helicopter-engine business.

Mr. Monti previously lashed out at what he called unjustified political pressure to approve the deal. Mr. Welch spoke to White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card when the deal began to fall apart, and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill heavily criticized European opposition in a Monday interview with The Washington Times.

European regulators have blocked only one other U.S. merger, between WorldCom and Sprint in 1999, but in that case they agreed with their American counterparts. The Department of Justice sued to stop the deal the following day.

The collapse of the GE-Honeywell link-up is a major defeat for Mr. Welch, 65, who postponed his April retirement as GE's highly successful CEO to see the Honeywell merger through to completion. GE veteran Jeffrey Immelt will succeed Mr. Welch.

Mr. Immelt told Bloomberg News yesterday that GE will purchase more companies in the future, despite the collapse of its bid for Honeywell.

"We'll continue to grow through technology and through acquisitions," said Mr. Immelt, named in November to succeed Mr. Welch.

GE shares fell 69 cents to $49.51 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to $35.10.

Dec. 1, 1999 - AlliedSignal Inc. buys Honeywell Inc. for $16.1 billion and assumes the name, combining Allied's flight systems with Honeywell's automated controls.

Oct. 20, 2000 - General Electric Chief Executive Jack Welch faxes a hand-written note to Honeywell CEO Michael Bonsignore topping United Technologies's bid as the Honeywell board meets to vote on United Technologies' offer. United Technologies Chief Executive George David withdraws the offer.
Oct. 22, 2000 - General Electric says it plans to buy Honeywell for about $48.4 billion in stock and assumed debt. Feb. 21, 2001 - General Electric is likely to face a prolonged, four-month review of the transaction, a source
familiar with the situation tells Bloomberg News. The European Commission has until March 6 to decide to clear
the transaction or open a longer review.
Feb. 27 - General Electric says the European Commission plans to extend its antitrust review. March 1 - The European Commission officially announces its investigation.
March 30 - EU Antitrust chief Mario Monti says the transaction prompted a "significant number" of complaints by
North American customers and competitors.

May 2 - The companies get approval from the Justice Department. Justice demands the sale of Honeywell's helicopter-engine business and selection of another company to maintain jet engines and auxiliary power units made by Honeywell.
May 8 - General Electric receives the 150-page "statement of obligations" from the European Union.

June 8 - Talks hit a snag after EU officials ask GE to spin off or sell shares to the public in its airplane leasing unit, Gecas.

June 13 - Mr. Welch meets twice with Mr. Monti in a bid to overcome his objections. He calls President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, to ask for White House support.
June 14 - The transaction appears on the verge of collapse after Mr. Welch says in a statement the company isn't
"optimistic" that the purchase can proceed.

June 18 - Mr. Monti rebuffs U.S. political pressure to approve the transaction.

June 26 - Mr. Monti says he expects almost unanimous support in blocking the transaction. Rejection would be the first time Europe has acted alone to halt a U.S. takeover.
June 27 - U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill criticizes the European Commission's resistance.

June 29 - Honeywell offers to reduce the purchase price to win European approval. Mr. Welch essentially cancels the transaction later that day, saying in a letter to Mr. Bonsignore that Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense for our shareholders."
Yesterday - The European Commission votes unanimously to block the purchase. Source: Bloomberg News

Harbor waste-site  project  could now be revived Honeywell  had agreed to weigh development near

A decision by European regulators yesterday to derail a  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell
International Inc. may revive a plan to build housing and offices on a toxic waste site in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.

Honeywell,  which owns the land, had agreed to explore a $300 million project proposed by local developers. The site near Caroline Street contains buried waste from a former AlliedSignal Corp. chromium ore plant. At 27 acres, it is the harbor front's largest undeveloped parcel.

Developers H&S Property Development Corp. and Struever Bros., Eccles & Rouse Inc. had to put the plan on hold for nearly a year as General Electric sought to merge with Honeywell.

An official familiar with the deal said General Electric would not have allowed housing as part of the project because of potential liability.

"There were concerns about the suitability of that property for housing," said the source, who did not want to be identified. "There are liability issues associated with it and fears the company [General Electric] would leave itself open. There are a different set of circumstances with businesses vs. all those individual homeowners."

The original proposal negotiated between the developers and Honeywell called for about 1.8 million square feet of offices, apartments and shops on the site.

Much of it would be constructed on top of a clay cap that covers toxic waste generated on the site until 1985. It took AlliedSignal 10 years and $100 million to clean the site and prepare it for future development.

State regulators and contractors have said they believe that the Baltimore project would be one of the nation's largest undertakings of its kind. It would require federal, state and local government approval and constant monitoring.

While government regulators have deemed the parcel properly cleaned and safe for some uses, Honeywell will never be liability free.

A study released last year by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health linked exposure to certain chromium compounds to higher risk of lung cancer.
For now, no one is sure where the project stands.

A development executive at Struever Bros. said no one at the company had talked with the site's owners since the European Union's decision was announced. "We couldn't comment until we discussed it with Allied," said Linda T. LoCascio, a Struever Bros. senior development director.

AlliedSignal bought Honeywell in 1999 and took on the Honeywell name. A spokesman for Honeywell said plans would be determined soon.

"GE had slowed the discussion process," said Tom Crane, the Honeywell spokesman. "We'll probably be exploring the next steps pretty quickly as we get through the next couple of days."

But they may have to wait.

General Electric has not publicly declared the Honeywell deal dead. While merger efforts are widely considered to be over, General Electric spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was "keeping its options open."
The company could appeal the ruling by the European Union, which said the $41 billion merger would be
anti-competitive. It marks the first time European regulators have blocked a deal between two U.S. companies.
Sheffer would not comment on the AlliedSignal site.

EU rejects Honeywell-GE merger GE's Welch leaves room for appeal of ruling; Honeywell  CEO resigns

Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, though
GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a ''setback.''
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
''We will consider all of our options,'' Sheffer said.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, however, announcing that chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore had resigned and saying it expected to remain an independent company.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again, and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt ''profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen.''

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
''I think they're very slim,'' said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

''Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedential value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe,'' said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold &White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

''Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion of this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go,'' Sheffer said.

Page 16 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but ''the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns'' resulting from the deal.

''The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was modified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines,'' EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's ''dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets.''

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was ''deeply disappointed'' with the outcome.

''We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefitted consumers in terms of quality, service and prices,'' the statement said.

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, ''We're disappointed in their decision,'' referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible ''chilling effect'' on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the ''risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded,'' he said.

Still, dissension is rare. Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal-WorldCom- Sprint-was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

Last Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would have also pared more than $1 billion from the takeover price. In return for lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Welch said Honeywell's proposal ''makes no sense'' for his company's shareholders.

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

The European Union has vetoed General Electric's  proposed US$41 billion acquisition of  Honeywell
International, according to news wires.
It marked the first time that a  merger between two American companies has been blocked by the 20-member
commission, and the decision risked souring relations between the US and  Europe.

The EU's veto of the deal was widely predicted after the companies failed to tackle European concerns that the merger would have an unfairly dominant position in the markets for jetliner engines and avionics.

GE, the world's biggest conglomerate, last week offered to sell assets worth about $2.2 billion in annual revenues in a bid to win European Union approval. Had the GE-Honeywell deal gone through, it would have been the biggest industrial takeover in corporate history.

The European Commission has blocked General Electric's  US$41 billion buy-out of  Honeywell  International.
The commission says the merger will severely reduce competition in the aerospace industry.
It is the first time European regulators have squashed a a merger approved by the United States.
The commission, meeting in Strasbourg, France, rebuffed earlier pleas from US President George W. Bush and
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to approve the purchase.

EU Commissioner Mario Monti acknowledged it was the first time the European Union and US antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.
But he defended the commission 's decision.

"In adopting this decision the commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell," Mr Monti said.

"This merger as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and result ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he added.
The merger would have been a crowning achievement for GE's outgoing chairman Jack Welch. The company says it is deeply disappointed by the EC decision.
Sources close to the deal say GE plans to file an appeal.

EU SCUPPERS #30BN US MERGER.

AMERICAN industrialist Jack Welch's dream #30bn megamerger between his  General Electric  and Honeywell
was blown out of the sky by the  European Union.

Despite winning the blessing of US authorities, the world's biggest industrial deal was blocked by  EU                    Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, dubbed 'Super Mario'.

It would have combined GE's aero engines with Honeywell's aircraft electronics systems, but Monti argued they would have had unfair control over key areas of the European aerospace industry.

Among those who raised objections were engine-maker Rolls-Royce and airlines on both sides of the Atlantic. European plane-builder Airbus, part-owned by BAE Systems, was a supporter.

It is the first time the EU has rejected an all-American merger, sparking an angry reaction and threats of retaliation from congressmen on Capitol Hill. GE chairman Jack Welch last week rejected a compromise by Honeywell's Michael Bonsignore who wanted to sell part of GE Capital Aviation Services to secure EU approval.

Welch, who staked his reputation on the deal and put off his retirement until it was completed, is expected to step down within weeks. Bonsignore now looks likely to come under pressure.

There is speculation that Honeywell could renew talks with America's United Technologies, owner of engine-maker Pratt & Whitney.

THE European Commission today killed what would have been the biggest industrial  merger in corporate history. It risked cooling relations with the United States to block the proposed $US45 billion ($87 billion)  merger of General Electric  and Honeywell  International.
"The European Commission has decided to prohibit the proposed acquisition by  General Electric  Co. of
Honeywell  Inc," the 20-member  commission said after meeting in Strasbourg.

It was the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU authorities, and risked opening new sores in relations between Europe and the US.
Had it gone through, the GE-Honeywell deal would have been the biggest industrial takeover in corporate history. It also would have capped the career of GE's legendary chairman Jack Welch.
"This merger, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said EU Competition Commission chief Mario Monti.
He said there were ways to eliminate these concerns and allow the merger to proceed.

But he added: "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the commission's competition concerns."

General Electric, reguarly ranked as America's most admired company, has interests ranging from aerospace and financial services to mass media - it owns the NBC television network - and GE-branded home appliances.
* OTHER big mergers which have been called off include:
July 2000 - WorldCom/Sprint ($US152 billion) due to opposition from US and European regulators February 1998
- Glaxo/SmithKline ($US70 bn), disagreement over management October 1998 - American Home/Monsanto
($US35 bn), clashes over management styles April 2000 - Deutsche Bank/Dresdner ($US29 bn), disagreement
over Kleinwort Benson May 1999 - USA Networks/Lycos ($US22 bn), share price fall and shareholder opposition.

Vivendi CEO: EU Competition Body Should Ease M&A Rules

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Media giant Vivendi Universal's (V) Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier said
Wednesday that E.U.  competition authorities are "much tighter than the U.S.  regulatory commissions today."
Referring to the E.U.  rejection of the General Electric  (GE)/Honeywell  (HON) merger, Messier said E.U. rules
"can't remain like this for too many years."

Speaking at an investors conference here, Messier said "the divestment from (Vivendi's stake in U.K. broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (U.BSK)) was not an obvious request...on the business side, it didn't really make sense."
"I've been obliged to give up too much to get the green light," he added.

E.U. competition authorities have said Vivendi must dispose of its BSkyB 23% stake within two years of Vivendi's buy of Seagram's media assets late last year.
Messier has repeatedly stated he won't sell the stake on the market and that his group would instead be
interested in swapping it for shares in U.S. media company USA Networks Inc. (USAI), held by cable tycoon John
Malone's Liberty Media Group (LMGA).
Vivendi Universal already owns around 42% of USA Networks.

EU Watchdog  Appeals For Global Antitrust Efforts

GENEVA (AP)--The  European regulator who scuttled the merger of U.S. giants  General Electric  and Honeywell  appealed Wednesday for world cooperation among antitrust watchdogs to ease fears of global domination by big business.

"Competition policy, and specifically international cooperation on  competition policy, has an important role to play if we are to avoid resentment against globalization and protectionist backlash," said EUCompetition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The E.U.'s decision to block General Electric's purchase of Honeywell after it had been approved by American regulators has prompted some key members of the U.S. Congress to suggest the U.S. might start looking to block plans among European companies to merge.

Monti has already described the EU decision as "a rare case" of trans-Atlantic antitrust disagreement and urged close cooperation between EU and U.S. regulators to prevent future clashes over mergers.

In a speech to a U.N. meeting Wednesday, Monti said that cooperation needs to be broadened beyond the two governments most directly involved in overseeing mergers because "bilateral agreements are clearly not enough."

"Involving more competition authorities in the discussion of international competition cases will yield better results both for bilateral as well as for multilateral cooperation," he said.

Monti appealed to developing countries at the meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development to drop their objections to including the issue in a new round of World Trade Organization negotiations.
The issue is one of the biggest obstacles to starting a new round of global round of trade negotiations at a WTO
ministerial meeting set for Nov. 9-13 in Doha, Qatar.

"Launching negotiations on a realistic competition agreement at Doha is essential to establish a solid basis for international cooperation against anticompetitive practices with an impact on international trade," said Monti.

The developing countries say it is impossible for them to make commitments on competition policy when many don't even have national laws on the subject.

About 80 countries worldwide currently have antitrust legislation and other systems designed to prevent dominance by one or a small group of companies in a particular trading sector. Only about 30 developing countries have such policies.

Monti said the EU wants to see an agreement which would set out the "core principles" of competition policy, such as transparency, nondiscrimination and due process, but said it would not cover the technical issues involved in an antitrust investigation at this stage.

At the same time, the EU wants to set up a Global Competition Forum, where competition authorities would meet to discuss issues of common importance.
"The range of international antitrust issues of common concern is very wide," Monti told reporters.

Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, stressed that ensuring fair competition is vital to boost developing nations' economies.


Page 23 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Competition is the soul of the market," Ricupero said. "I take issue with the widespread perception that competition should be a luxury, something which a developing country only needs when it reaches a high degree of development."

BONSIGNOR OUT, BOSSIDY IN AS HONEYWELL GOES IT ALONG//THE NEW CEO SAYS HIS FOCUS WILL
BE ON GETTING HONEYWELL BACK ON ITS FEET, NOT ON BREAKING IT UP.

NEW YORK -- Michael Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday after the EuropeanCommission's rejection of the company's planned $41 billion  merger with General Electric  Co.
Bonsignore, 60, will be replaced by Lawrence Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal
Inc., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.
Bossidy, 66, was briefly chairman of the merged Honeywell, retiring in April 2000 and handing the reins to
Bonsignore, who had been the Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive.

Bossidy said Honeywell's board wants him to focus on turning the company as a standalone operation, instead of breaking it up, as some analysts had speculated.

The merger agreement with GE is still in effect, but Bossidy said "the Honeywell board is looking at all its options."

"The idea is to stay independent, to get this company back on its feet," Bossidy said, adding that the merger process has been a major distraction for Honeywell and its 120,000 workers.

Some Honeywell assets will probably be sold and job cuts are likely, but Bossidy said a more pressing task is to convince employees thinking about leaving the company that they should stay on.
"One of the priorities is to retain people who were otherwise going to leave," he said.

Bossidy faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first-quarter profits fall 92 percent, also said Tuesday that second-quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts surveyed
by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Honeywell said it expects to record a second-quarter pre-tax charge of $575 million to $625 million related to repositioning, customer settlements, asset impairments, merger-related expenses, legal and environmental costs.

After the European veto of the deal became official Tuesday, GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission. The ruling was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was modified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Conn.-based United
Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as a likely Honeywell suitor.

Bossidy didn't rule out the possibility of Honeywell entering into another combination at some point, but said his task is to rebuild the company. He plans to stay on the job about a year.

"I have some heart and soul in this company. I hate to see it frankly in the condition it is in right now. ... I'm not here for a new career, but for a time I can restore stability," Bossidy said.
United Technologies, which makes jet engines and elevators and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked
that deal last fall.

Bossidy said he was first contacted about taking the top Honeywell job about three weeks ago. He declined to comment when asked whether Bonsignore was pressured to resign by Honeywell's board.
"I wasn't involved in those discussions," Bossidy said.

He acknowledged talking with Welch on Tuesday morning, before his appointment was announced, but would not tell reporters what was said.
"We just had a general conversation and arranged a golf game," Bossidy quipped.

Europe says no to GE's merger Top exec resigns  from Honeywell

The European Union rejected General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion acquisition of  Honeywell International Inc. on Tuesday, the first time a merger of two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European regulators.

Hours after the rebuff, Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as  Honeywell's  chairman and chief executive. Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in
1999 acquired Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

Honeywell has suffered declining earnings for the past year, and late Tuesday the Morris Township, N.J.-based company warned that the trend will continue. Honeywell estimated its second-quarter ongoing earnings at 53 cents to 55 cents a share, well below the average estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts polled by First Call/ Thomson Financial.
The European Commission, the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union, said it ruled against the
GE-Honeywell deal because it feared the combined company would have too much control of the market for
aviation products and services.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Mario Monti, the competition commissioner.
GE Chairman and CEO Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a setback.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

European regulators were particularly worried that a combined GE- Honeywell could steer aviation business to itself, creating an unfair advantage over such competitors as Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, and possibly stifle competition. The commission wanted GE to sell a minority stake in its aviation financing unit.
`Profound regret'

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe. "Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it

Page 27 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington.
Honeywell's options

For Honeywell, rejection of the deal is a harsh blow. United Technologies had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked that deal last fall. However, a GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

Bossidy, for his part, said in a statement that he would seek to breathe new life into Honeywell. "We will move quickly and aggressively to improve our performance, further strengthen our management team and rebuild the confidence of our shareowners, customers and employees," Bossidy said.
GE shares fell 69 cents Tuesday, to $49.51, on the New York Stock Exchange, where Honeywell shares gained
99 cents, to $35.10.

The European Union yesterday blocked the world's largest industrial  merger - General Electric's  #26.5 billion purchase of Honeywell  International.

The veto by the  EU's 20-member commission had been widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engine and avionics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

A statement from the Commission added that while GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns result-ing from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell."

It said the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets".

EU sources said the commission's decision was unanimous and that companies were notified immediately after the decision.

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: Staying overseas: As expected, the  GE-Honeywell  deal is dead. The European Commission formally voted yesterday to block the $43 billion deal, which had already been approved  here in the US. This is the first time a merger of two US companies has been stopped solely by regulators overseas. The EU feared the combined GE-Honeywell  deal would have dominated the engine and avionics market.

Mr. MARIO  MONTI (EU Competition Commission): The commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets, and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns.

EU blocks  GE's US$42B Honeywell  takeover:  'The merger ... would have severely reduced competition':
Unprecedented move

WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented move that may curb huge global deals, the  European Union yesterday blocked the US$42-billion  merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers, already  approved  by the United States and Canada, came as no surprise after the  EU's 20-member commission said last week the two aerospace giants had not gone far enough with concessions to prevent them dominating the  European market for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Mario Monti, the EU's Competition Commissioner.

Last-minute amendments proposed by Connecticut-based GE "were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns," the commission said.
This is only the second time since 1990 the EU has blocked a proposed deal. It rejected the takeover by
WorldCom Inc. of Sprint Corp., a deal also rejected by U.S. antitrust regulators.
The new rejection is bound to provoke Washington politicians.

George W. Bush, the U.S. President, has been critical of the threatened rejection while Paul O'Neil, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, said it was "off the wall." Several U.S. senators have warned that rejection of the deal could hurt U.S.-Europe trade relations or bring retaliation from the United States.

Mr. Monti went out of his way to explain the commission was not anti-business, insisting the EU looks positively on mergers such as AOL Time Warner. "I for one am genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred," he said at a news conference in Strasbourg, adding that Jack Welch, GE's chief executive, was not just an American icon but "a world icon."

Mr. Welch, who had planned to retire once this deal closed, balked at making any more concessions to the EU, including one that would have seen Honeywell drop its asking price by US$1.7-billion as compensation for other properties the EU wanted GE to sell. Mr. Welch said the latest Honeywell proposal made no sense to GE shareholders.

Saying he was deeply disappointed, Mr. Welch said the aircraft giant disagreed with the way the commission did its analysis.

"The Commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the U.S., Canada and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any conditions," he said.

Others, such as Alex Burnside, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels, said the merger was hurt by the high-handed approach taken by both the firms and the U.S. government.

"It was a deal that was launched without consultation with (EU) antitrust counsel, an outspoken chief executive, a highly motivated group of complainants and an irritation to the commission caused by a high-profile press campaign culminating in superbullying from the United States," he said.

GE did not say if it planned to challenge the decision. As in North America, companies must pass anti-trust scrutiny in Europe before being allowed to take over firms operating on the continent.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department said the EU ruling reflects a "significant point of divergence" between the two antitrust enforcers. The United States concluded the deal "would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers."

Jack Welch will be remembered  for protecting GE shareholders

Even in his wildest dreams, Jack Welch is unlikely to have seen a low-key, soccer-loving Italian economics professor standing in the way of the last great act of his stellar career at the helm of mighty  General Electric.  Nor could the executive who was once nicknamed Neutron Jack for his ruthless efficiency have foreseen the fallout from his sloppy and ultimately doomed effort to gobble up  Honeywell  International in the world's biggest industrial merger.

Mario Monti, Europe's chief competition watchdog, formally shot down the $40-billion-plus (U.S.) acquisition yesterday, after rejecting last-ditch efforts by  GE to salvage the deal.

The decision was widely expected, but it was nevertheless a stunner, marking the first time the European Commission has stood in the way of a major merger by two U.S. companies that had already won the stamp of approval from Washington. Ottawa also had no objections to the combination.

European objections had previously sunk Alcan's efforts to form a global aluminum powerhouse and helped bury the proposed WorldCom-Sprint merger. But this time, two U.S. companies had made enough concessions to win the okay in Washington, and Mr. Monti insisted that this simply was not good enough.
Although GE had offered to sell off $2.2-billion worth of Honeywell assets, the promised concessions didn't satisfy
Mr. Monti's concerns that GE would win unfair dominance in the markets for jet engines and electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell . . . would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he told reporters in Strasbourg, France.

In one fell swoop, the former academic, who specialized in monetary theory before becoming a Eurocrat, sank the career of the chief executive officer of one big U.S. company, Honeywell's Michael Bonsignore, took some of the burnish off the reputation of the much-admired Mr. Welch and fired a shot at Washington policy makers who insist that what's good for American companies must be good for the world.

The European decision could exacerbate growing tensions between Europe and the United States on a host of trade and investment issues. It also brings into relief fundamental differences between the two jurisdictions over what constitutes unfair competition.

The Bush administration, which instinctively and politically dislikes government meddling in business decisions, and a handful of powerful U.S. senators failed to dissuade Mr. Monti from blocking the deal.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill had derided the European demands for billions of dollars in concessions as "off the wall" and noted that Brussels spends too much time listening to competitors, which would naturally say anything to prevent a strong rival from getting even stronger.
But Mr. Monti ignored all the criticism and insisted he was just following the law, not playing politics. "We remain distinctively unimpressed by political pressure from within and without the EU," he sniffed.


Page 33 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Mr. Welch made the takeover offer to struggling Honeywell last October, topping a bid from aerospace rival United Technologies. As press reports have indicated, he was in a hurry, orchestrating the entire deal in three days and failing to keep regulators informed.

GE easily won over U.S. antitrust officials with a promise to divest Honeywell's helicopter engine operations, among other smaller moves.

But Mr. Monti and other EU officials feared GE's vertically integrated power would shut out competitors and drive up prices.

Honeywell's Mr. Bonsignore was so desperate to get the deal done that he begged Mr. Welch to make the necessary concessions and offered to lower the price of the transaction by nearly $2-billion.
Having failed to budge Mr. Welch, Mr. Bonsignore now faces unemployment.

His replacement: a former GE vice-chairman who may well end up carving Honeywell into pieces and peddling them to the highest bidders.
GE, under Mr. Welch's successor, Jeffrey Immelt, will almost certainly be in the hunt.

At the end of the day, Mr. Welch proved just as tough and stubborn as Mr. Monti, and may even have welcomed the EU's intervention, once Honeywell's deteriorating position became clear.

GE's commander, who had delayed his scheduled retirement to steer his last deal to completion, said he could not agree to demands that would adversely affect shareholders.

That, more than anything else, is likely to be what Mr. Welch, the pre-eminent business executive of his era, is remembered for.

EU Rejects GE Acquisition of Honeywell  Deals: The decision could discourage other mega-mergers
requiring European review, some analysts  predict.

The European Union, showing its increasing clout, formally rejectedGeneral Electric  Co.'s proposed $42-billion acquisition of Honeywell  International Inc. Tuesday, all but scuttling the largest industrial  merger ever.
The decision, widely expected despite some last-minute concessions by GE, marked the first time a  merger
between two U.S. companies has been blocked by European regulators after having cleared U.S. scrutiny.

The Competition Commission, a 20-member panel representing 15 European countries, voted unanimously to reject the deal, which it said would have created a company with too much control of the world's market for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

The merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The fallout was immediate at Honeywell headquarters, where the board ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore, saying it expects to implement a strategy to "enhance share-owner value as an independent company." Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., before it merged with Honeywell.

Although the decision is not likely to have much effect on small or mid-size deals, some analysts predict that the rejection could put a chill on other mega-deals that would require European review and even perhaps prompt a retaliatory move by U.S. regulators.

"I wouldn't be surprised if a European company trying to make an acquisition in the U.S. runs into trouble," said Paul H. Nisbet, aerospace analyst for JSA Research Inc., a Newport, R.I., research firm for institutional investors. "For the smaller acquisitions, this would not have a great deal of impact. It is the blockbuster deals that are going to get a jaundiced view, much more so than before."

The rift already was widening as President Bush stepped into the fray last month saying he was concerned by the way the European Commission was handling the proposed merger. Though the White House had not lobbied directly for the deal, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill had said a rejection would be "off the wall."

The latest decision brought reminders of the 1997 merger of aerospace giants Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which the European Union opposed but ultimately approved after a transatlantic trade dispute almost erupted.

"I could see the whole thing being raised again, and it could get pretty ugly," said Thomas Meagher, an analyst with Fairfax, Va.-based BB&T Capital Markets.

On Tuesday, there was little sign that longtime GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack Welch was giving up on the deal, although he is faced with ending his 20-year reign sooner than anticipated. Welch had extended his retirement date by a year to oversee the combination in what he called his last great accomplishment.
GE said it was disappointed by the decision but was not yet ready to scuttle the merger, saying it was considering
"all of our options," including an appeal.
Page 35 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
An appeal to the European Union's Court of First Instance can take years. Analysts said an appeal would have little or no chance of success.

Of the 14 mergers that were rejected in the last decade, the court has considered six appeals. It has sided with the commission in three of the cases, one was withdrawn and two are still pending, including a deal between Worldcom and Sprint, which was rejected by both the U.S. and European regulators a little more than a year ago.

"I feel profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen," Welch said.

If GE decides to appeal, the move could prevent any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner pending resolution of the case.

Analysts were speculating that Honeywell may want to hook up again with United Technologies, the company that first attempted to acquire Honeywell before it was outbid by GE. The Hartford, Conn.-based maker of helicopters and jet engines helped persuade the European Commission to block the GE/Honeywell combination.

In reaching its decision, the European panel said it was particularly fearful of GE "bundling" its jet engines and avionics to leverage sales and using its aviation leasing and financing company, the largest in the world, to steer business to itself and stifle competition.

Europe's argument reflected a divergent view of the merger from U.S. regulators, who were more concerned about the deal's effect on consumers than on competitors.

GE said it believed the combination would have "clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices."

In a last-minute effort to address European concerns, GE offered to sell a portion of its holdings in GE Capital Aviation Services, the leasing and financing arm of the company, to the public. But the European Commission, which wanted GE to sell a minority stake to a competitor, said the concession didn't go far enough.

"In adopting this decision, the commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell," the commission said.

Though companies considering multibillion-dollar deals may get skittish over the latest decision, most companies won't be affected because the commission reviews only deals that involve at least 5 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, in global turnover, of which at least $215.9 million is in EU states.

On the other hand, U.S. regulators can weigh in on any mergers valued at $50 million or more, as well as smaller deals when niche areas of competition are involved.

On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of GE and Honeywell changed slightly as investors anticipated the decision. GE fell 69 cents to close at $49.51, while Honeywell rose 99 cents to $35.10.

GE-HONEYWELL MERGER HALTED IT'S 1ST TIME MARRIAGE OF U.S. FIRMS BLOCKED BY EUROPEAN

Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, though
GE Chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a setback.
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

Later Tuesday, Michael Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of Honeywell. Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
The Wall Street Journal had reported that after the merger's veto, Honeywell's board of directors would remove
Bonsignore and replace him with Bossidy.

Honeywell's future also remains unclear. With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies, the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as the most likely Honeywell suitor.

United Technologies makes jet engines and elevators and helped persuade the EU to block the GE-Honeywell merger.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission, one was withdrawn and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process again and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's effect on the company's ability to do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

The commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant market share for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - EU prohibits GE's acquistion of Honeywell.

Strasbourg, 03/07/2001 (Agence  Europe) - Following an in-depth investigation launched on March 1, the European Commission has, as expected, decided to prohibt the proposed acquistion of  Honeywell  by GE. In adopting the decision, which was idfficult given the size of the operation (the media had talked about the biggest acqusition in the hisotry of the industry), the  Commission wanted to show that safeguaring consumer interests and ensuring an even playing field were its priorities. "The  merger between GE and Honeywell,  as it was notified, would have severly reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines", Commissioner Mario Monti told journlaists.

The Commission's in-depth investigation had already highlighted the danger the acquisition would pose to competition since GE alone already had a dominant position in the markets for jet engines for large commercial and large regional aircraft. Honeywell is the leading supplier of avionics and non-avionics products, as well as of engines for corporate jets and of engine starters (a key input in the manufacturing of engines). The combination of the two companies' activities would have resulted in the creation of dominant positions in these markets, would have eliminated competition and ultimately adversely affected product quality, service and consumer prices. Anticipating the problems of obtaining the EU's approval (despite having won the agreement of the US anti-trust authorities), GE proposed a number of undertakings on June 14 2001 intended to address these concerns, which were considered insufficient (see EUROPE of 15 June, p.9, and 16 June, p.12). In a final bid, GE proposed a new set of remedies on June 28 (well after the deadline for the submission of undertakings), but to no avail. Commissioner Monti basically said that the Commission had had to make a prima facie assessment but this had been enough to note that the measures were not sufficient to solve the problems. Lacking time and certainty, he said, they had had to decide against the acquisition, although he did insist that "there were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed". "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns". Asked about EU conditions concerning Gecas, GE's aircraft hire subsidiary (which had been the real stumbling block for the merger given the importance of Gecas in the new company), Commissioner Monti stressed that the Commission had never demanded that GE give up control of Gecas. He said that the Commission had requested a structural remedy within Gecas which could give serious guarantees that no discriminatory policy could be pursued in terms of purchasing. He stressed that this issue had been at the heart of the discussions between GE and Honeywell, but they did not actually propose this minimum acceptable remedy. The Commissioner also noted that the Commission and the US
Justice Department had worked in close co-operation during the investigation. "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions (...) the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never to totally excluded. The GE/Honeywell is a rare case where the transatlantic competition authorities have disagreed. I am determined to strengthen our bilateral cooperation in the future to try and reduce this risk further". Mr Monti repeated his view that the Commission's refusal would not damage EU/US cooperation in future competition cases, quoting the example of the Air Liquide (France) merger with BOC (UK) which had been blocked by the US authorities without that giving rise to reprisals by the EU. He firmly laid to rest allegations of the GE/Honeywell case being, in reality, a test of strength between the EU and the US, insisting that the country of ownership of a company is irrelevant to competition laws, which are the basis of Commission decisions. He added that both companies had headquarters both in the US and in Europe in any case, namely United Technologies and Rolls Royce for engines and Rockwell and Thales for avionics[United Technologies and Rockwell are US companies, Rolls Royce is British and Thales is French.]. He stressed that this meant there was perfect symmetry on either side of the Atlantic. Commissioner Monti concluded by drawing the lessons of this failure by advising companies to come and speak to the Commission early in the day, to not delay in submitting their notifications and not to put the Commission in a position whereby it is unable to make a proper investigation.

EU REJECTS GE-HONEYWELL DEAL; ; CONCERNS ABOUT COMPETITION SINK $41 BILLION MERGER.
COMPANY OFFICIALS ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPEAL

NEW YORK -- Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. yesterday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision is the first time a merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by European         
regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

EU Commission Blocks  GE Deal --- Regulators' Decision  to Veto Honeywell Merger Is Unanimous

STRASBOURG, France -- The European Commission blocked General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion bid for Honeywell  International Inc., the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies was prevented solely by European Union regulators.

The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20-member executive  commission was widely expected after the U.S. companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engine and avionics.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is expected to oust Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to name as a replacement Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66 years old, the former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name. Mr. Bossidy, who served as chairman of the combined entity for four months, handed the reins to Mr. Bonsignore in April 2000.
GE, which is headquartered in Fairfield, Connecticut, called the EU's decision "deeply disappointing."

It said the commission took "a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues" than regulators in the U.S., Canada, "and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions."

"We strongly disagree with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell," the company said in a statement. GE disputed the commission's stand on the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services, saying the panel's view isn't supported by the facts.
"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," GE
said.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said in a statement that the proposed merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

The commission's decision was unanimous. It came after a one-hour meeting during which Mr. Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.

EU officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both companies were notified immediately after the decision.

GE and Honeywell's plans weren't immediately clear. GE could either challenge the decision in court or file a new application and start the process all over again. But many believe the deal is dead.

To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by U.S. law to do business in America. But the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles. U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President George W. Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Mr. Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.
Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal -- between
WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- was barred. Washington also blocked the deal.

GE and Honeywell had still held out hope of salvaging the deal as recently at last weekend. GE and Honeywell offered two different proposals to assuage the commission's fears, making very significant concessions. The European regulators rejected both plans.
On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions suggested by Honeywell. GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jack
Welch said Honeywell's proposal made "no sense" for his company's shareholders.

Honeywell had offered a lower purchase price, and in return asked GE to divest itself of more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

EU kills off biggest  merger.

The European Commission yesterday killed off what would have been the world's biggest industrial  merger - the #30 billion link up between American giants  General Electric  and Honeywell.

The deal, which would have been the crowning glory of legendary  GE chief executive Jack Welch's colourful career, had been approved  in the US.

But the 20-strong EU executive meeting in Strasbourg yesterday used its powers to block the deal on the grounds that it would have forced some European rivals in the aerospace sector out of business.

Commission experts claimed that GE, which makes engines for airliners, would be able to package Honeywell's avionics to help it compete unfairly against competitors.

It is only the 15th time in over a decade the Commission has blocked a merger and the first time it has barred an all-American deal, which had been approved by US regulators in May.

The merger negotiations turned into a titanic struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching concessions - including a call to sell off its Gecas aero engines business to Rolls-Royce or Pratt & Whitney - the Commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

The deal created a transatlantic rift with US officials, from President George W Bush down, voicing concern at the European Commission's handling of the merger. US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill had said EU rejection would be 'off the wall'.

But EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said: 'The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines.'

Mr Monti said the Commission and US Department of Justice had worked closely together during the investigation, and said it was 'unfortunate that in the end, we reached different conclusions'.
Yesterday's decision leaves a big question mark over Honeywell and a battered share price.

The last chance to save the deal evaporated on Friday when Mr Welch rejected a suggestion by his counterpart at Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, that he slash #1.2 billion from Honeywell's price tag to compensate GE for extra sell-offs to win Brussels' approval for the merger.

GE said it was disappointed that the EU had blocked the deal and said the Commission took a fundamentally different approach to that of US regulators.

GE disagreed with the Commission's conclusion that the transaction would have unfairly enhanced its market position and the influence of its aircraft engines and aircraft leasing businesses.
'The facts just don't support these assertions,' GE said.
'We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices.'. Document bmp0000020010727dx74000mj

Scuttled  GE Deal Leaves Honeywell  Adrift
Kevin Maler

4 July 2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Saint Paul Pioneer Press - Minnesota

Michael Bonsignore two years ago was the admired leader of a well-run avionics and building controls company that in his eyes needed to be bigger. Today, the chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. is out of a job, a casualty of a disastrous  merger he himself set in motion.

Honeywell's  board said Tuesday it had replaced Bonsignore just hours after a decision by  European regulators to block a proposed buyout by  General Electric.  The scuttled deal leaves  Honeywell  and its more than 6,000 local employees adrift, and will no doubt prompt many to ask how two highly respected companies could have so badly misread the international  regulatory environment.

But observers say the real misstep came when Bonsignore agreed to sell Minneapolis-based Honeywell to AlliedSignal Inc., a Morristown, N.J.-based company that on paper looked like a nice fit but turned out to be messy.

Bonsignore made at least two faulty assumptions in that deal, observers said, that would eventually lead it to the corporate auction block: First, he assumed that the different cultures of the two firms could be easily reconciled. And second, he underestimated how a slowdown in the economy might affect what had become a highly cyclical firm.

Those two miscalculations led to lackluster financial performance in 2000 and a sinking stock that made the company vulnerable to a takeover. Instead, Bonsignore hunted for a suitor, striking an agreement with United Technologies. That offer was topped by GE, which then fought unsuccessfully to get the deal approved in Europe.

Now Honeywell will come full circle: Lawrence Bossidy, who led AlliedSignal when it merged with Honeywell and stayed on for a short time as chairman, will return as chairman and CEO of Honeywell International. He promised to "re-energize and refocus our employees" and said that "it is time to leave behind the distractions of the past."

Bossidy, 66, is a hard-charging executive in the mold of GE's Jack Welch -- in fact, he's a former vice chairman of the firm and a friend of the legendary CEO. Wall Street analysts applauded the move, though it's anyone's guess whether he is up to the tremendous challenge that now faces Honeywell.

What's more clear is that Bonsignore, 60, a leader who would rather delegate responsibility than bark orders, was probably better suited to run the old Honeywell than the merged Honeywell-AlliedSignal.

"I think it's because he was used to running a company that has very strong market share and is at the top of its competition levels in its major products," said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I AlliedSignal, meanwhile, "was not at the top of anything. They were a tertiary supplier of automotive and chemical supplies ... and had a ragtag operation in aerospace," Nisbet said. Under Bossidy, AlliedSignal cut costs, pushed managers and drove employees to generate solid financial numbers.
Bonsignore couldn't manage the same results.

AlliedSignal also relied on a more hierarchical structure than Honeywell, said Bruce Erickson, a professor of business and government at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. And Bonsignore was at a disadvantage because he came from the smaller of the two merged companies.

"Allied was a conservative, old-line Eastern company," said Erickson, adding that Bonsignore's team was probably better. Still, "It's harder for the smaller unit to change the larger unit."

Many of the old Allied businesses began to slide as the economy slowed, and the combined Honeywell failed to meet its optimistic earnings forecasts. In June 2000, Honeywell said it would miss its second quarter earnings estimates, and over the next three days its stock lost more than a quarter of its value.

Page 46 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The company blamed rising raw material costs and a parts shortage. The new Honeywell was also squeezed by a slowing economy, analysts said.
Fred Zimmerman, a business professor at the University of St. Thomas who studies manufacturing, said
Bonsignore should have anticipated the slowing economy and seen the cultural mismatch.
"The track record on big mergers is pretty well established," Zimmerman said, noting the most fail.

With the problems apparent, Bonsignore sought a buyer. He found United Technologies. GE's Welch caught wind of the deal and swooped in with a better offer, saying he would delay his retirement to complete a deal that he figured to be a career-capper. Bonsignore would have been well compensated if the deal were completed -- collecting around $15 million in severance and consulting fees.

But Welch underestimated the concerns of European regulators, who worried that GE's span of products, from jet engines to avionics to financing, would put customers and competitors at a disadvantage. By last week it was clear neither side would reach an agreement. Welch rejected a last-ditch offer by Bonsignore to cut the sale price if GE would make further concessions.

Honeywell employees in the Twin Cities seemed to take the latest shake-ups in stride. Some said they were relieved to not be swallowed by GE, which was expected to shed thousands of jobs.
"It's just a matter of staying focused on our strategic plans," said Brad Morton, vice president and general
manager of Honeywell's advanced circuits division. "Our efforts as an organization are focused around Honeywell
as a standalone business."

Now Bossidy must pull Honeywell together. Bonsignore, meanwhile, will be compensated for leaving his job: His contract includes a severance clause that could mean as much as $9 million. Honeywell's statement did not say if he would receive any additional pay.

Europeans  Veto GE Merger with Honeywell

General Electric's  $45 billion bid to buy industrial conglomerate  Honeywell  was rejected by European anti-trust regulators yesterday, marking the first time such a deal between two American companies was vetoed by Europeans.

Honeywell  promptly ousted its chairman Michael Bonsignore, the author of the deal.
The rejection may also lead to a high-voltage lawsuit featuring celebrity attorney David Boies.

The unanimous decision by the European Commission, an arm of the 15-nation European Union, was expected even though the two companies had undertaken a number of last-ditch attempts to make their union more palatable to the regulators overseas.

The European Commission voted in Strasbourg, France, citing concerns that the combined company would have too much control over the market for aviation products. These are core businesses for Honeywell and GE which have strong European competitors who crave protection.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Europe's competitions commissioner Mario Monti.
GE CEO Jack Welch left open the possibility of a court appeal over the commission's decision, calling it a mere
"setback."
But most analysts agreed that the deal was all but dead.
GE shares fell 69 cents yesterday to $49.51, while Honeywell jumped 99 cents to $35.10.
An appeal by the companies to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg would be a longshot, analysts said. Meanwhile, in the wake of the failed merger, Honeywell's board of directors met yesterday in the Times Square
offices of the lawfirm Skadden Arps, to oust Bonsignore.

His replacement is Lawrence Bossidy, 66, formerly the head of AlliedSignal, which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

Honeywell hired Boies to look into whether the company has grounds to claim GE undermined the deal by failing to do enough to win the approval of European regulators.
To do business in Europe, American companies must first get the approval of European regulators, just as
European companies must be approved by American regulators to do business here.
"I think now GE will continue to focus on smaller or mid-size acquisitions," said James Kelleher, an analyst with
Argus Research. "Now they've been bitten, so they'll be more shy."

European Union Deals the Final Blow to GE on Merger

European regulators dealt a final blow to  General Electric  Co.'s proposed $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc. yesterday, marking the first time overseas authorities killed a proposed  merger between two companies based in the United States.

The European Commission, which handles merger approvals for its 15 member countries, charged that the combination would have allowed  GE, the world's largest company by market value, to choke off  competition in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
The rejection prompted Honeywell's board last night to replace Chairman and Chief Executive Michael
Bonsignore with former Chairman and CEO Lawrence Bossidy.

The European move was widely expected, but it signaled a particularly bitter end to the row between GE and European officials. In most cases, when a merger is likely to be blocked, the companies involved withdraw their application to avoid a high-profile rejection.
GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch, who put off his retirement to shepherd the deal, expressed
"profound regret" at the European decision, calling it a "setback."

Fairfield, Conn.-based GE needs the approval of European authorities to buy Morristown, N.J.-based Honeywell, just as European companies have to comply with American antitrust laws in the United States.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer held out the possibility of an appeal in European Union courts. But few observers expected legal action could save the deal. Of the 15 mergers EU authorities have blocked over the last 10 years, six have been taken to court, none successfully.
The odds of a successful legal challenge are "very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research
Group.

Mr. Sheffer said GE will not submit a new merger plan to European authorities, which would restart the approval process.

European authorities objected to the deal on the grounds that GE, which had $130 billion in sales last year, would be able to use its dominance in the jet-engine sector to undercut European rivals Rolls-Royce PLC of Britain and Thales SA of France.

In particular, they feared GE would be able to package its own jet engines with Honeywell's avionics and finance sales through GE Capital Aviation Services.
On Friday, GE rejected Honeywell's proposal for last-ditch revisions to the deal that would have pared more than
$1 billion from the takeover price. In return for a lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its
holdings to satisfy European concerns.

Mr. Monti sought to downplay the trans-Atlantic friction that has arisen from the European stance, preferring to emphasize his close links with American regulators.

"The European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have worked in close cooperation during this investigation," Mr. Monti said. "It is unfortunate that, in the end, we reached different conclusions."

Page 49 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Justice Department approved the deal on May 2, under the condition that Honeywell sell off its helicopter-engine business.

Mr. Monti previously lashed out at what he called unjustified political pressure to approve the deal. Mr. Welch spoke to White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card when the deal began to fall apart, and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill heavily criticized European opposition in a Monday interview with The Washington Times.

European regulators have blocked only one other U.S. merger, between WorldCom and Sprint in 1999, but in that case they agreed with their American counterparts. The Department of Justice sued to stop the deal the following day.

The collapse of the GE-Honeywell link-up is a major defeat for Mr. Welch, 65, who postponed his April retirement as GE's highly successful CEO to see the Honeywell merger through to completion. GE veteran Jeffrey Immelt will succeed Mr. Welch.

Mr. Immelt told Bloomberg News yesterday that GE will purchase more companies in the future, despite the collapse of its bid for Honeywell.

"We'll continue to grow through technology and through acquisitions," said Mr. Immelt, named in November to succeed Mr. Welch.

GE shares fell 69 cents to $49.51 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to $35.10.

Monti sees no risk to EU firms from Honeywell/GE.

GENEVA, July 4 (Reuters) - EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said on Wednesday he did not expect the EC's decision to block a $42 billion merger between General Electric  and Honeywell  International to harm European companies.

Monti also reaffirmed his view that the decision, taken unanimously by the European Commission on Tuesday, should act as a spur towards cooperation between the United States and the European Union on competition issues.

"I do not expect consequences for European companies and I have already stated our determined intention regarding cooperation with U.S. anti-trust agencies," he told a news conference.

The Commissioner, who was in Geneva for an international conference on competition policy, said that he hoped that the "unusual divergence" between U.S. and EU regulators over the GE/Honeywell merger would also be a spur to more multilateral contacts on competition issues.

The 15-state EU opted to block the merger, the largest industrial marriage ever proposed, after voicing concerns the deal would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets.

The deal between two of the largest U.S. conglomerates with businesses ranging from aerospace to broadcasting and power systems had previously been approved by the U.S. with only minor conditions.

"This unusual divergence is only a stimulus for bilateral cooperation quite apart from hoped-for multilateral developments," Monti said. The European Union has proposed that competition be included in future trade liberalisation negotiations within the ambit of the World Trade Organisastion (WTO).

Monti said that he also backed an idea, first put forward by the U.S. in 1999, for a global competition forum in which competition ideas could be thrashed out.

UPDATE 1-GE, Honeywell  CEOs take the heat for deal failure.
By Nichola Groom

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The death of the  GE-Honeywell merger on Tuesday threatened to tarnish the reputation of an American corporate titan and may have ended the career of another chief executive - reflecting the high personal stakes involved in today's mega deals, management experts said.

Much of the blame for the miscalculations leading up to Tuesday's announcement from the  European                  Commission that it was blocking the deal is sure to be pinned on Michael Bonsignore, who resigned as Honeywell  CEO late Tuesday. Bonsignore is being replaced by Larry Bossidy, former CEO of Allied-Signal Corp, which acquired Honeywell  in 1999. Bossidy handed the reins to Bonsignore in April 2000.

"It's tough and they know it. It can be very lucrative for those who win, but the trade-off is that if they mess up, the consequences can be severe," said Professor Bart Victor, who teaches business ethics at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennesee.

General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch, who postponed his retirement to see through the proposed $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell International Inc., is in danger of letting what was supposed to be his last hurrah mar his legacy as the greatest icon of contemporary management.

"This is one of those deals where some of us were wondering what Jack Welch was doing in the first place," said Jay Barney, Professor of Management and Human Resources at Ohio State University's Fisher School of Business. "It's amazing that they would have miscalculated so much.

Welch would not be the only CEO in recent memory to go one deal too far only to have his once God-like reputation stained by a failure. Daimler-Chrysler AG Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp, the architect of Daimler-Benz AG's problematic merger with Chrysler, has been the target of resignation calls from investors weary of seeing the group's share price plunge.
Unlike Schrempp, however, experts agree that despite the GE-Honeywell deal's failure to receive approval from
European regulators, Welch's reputation is unlikely to be dented severely.

"People will say he took a swing, it was just more complicated than he envisioned," Janet Lowe, author of "Welch: An American Icon", told Reuters. "It's a reflection of the size of his spirit."

During his 20-year tenure as CEO, Welch succeeded in increasing GE's market capitalization to around $490 billion from $13 billion, a feat that will remain at the forefront of any future discussion of his legacy.
But the same cannot be said of Bonsignore.

"The reports are that Bonsignore has sort of lost interest, and this board has seen that it is going to take an enormous amount of energy and commitment to turn this thing around," said John O. Whitney, Professor of Management at Columbia University's Business School.
Bonsignore was blamed for Honeywell's 33-percent stock plunge during his tenure.

"The market for talent at this level is like in professional sports. He looks now like someone who duffed, someone who lost the big one," Victor said.

Whether Bossidy will be able to institute a turnaround for the embattled company remains to be seen, but experts agree that the need for change is dire.

"The anticipation of an acquisition can really hurt a company's productivity," Barney said.

In fact, Honeywell's first-quarter earnings dropped 92 percent as it took nearly $600 million in charges related to cost cutting, including job losses.

The slowdown in productivity needs to be remedied before Honeywell can enter into another merger deal, experts said.

"Moving Bossidy in is going to be a great benefit," Whitney said, but he suggested the former chairman would also have to share some of the responsibility for the company's problems. "But I can't think of a better choice at least in the interim period to get this straightened out." (additional reporting by Steve James).

UPDATE 6-EU blocks  GE's takeover of Honeywell.
By Kristin Roberts

4 July 2001

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) - The  European Commission blocked General Electric  Co.'s $42 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, marking the first time European regulators have killed a merger     approved  by their counterparts in the United States.

The European Union's 20-member executive arm took the bold step after voicing concerns the deal would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets - a conclusion that was strikingly different than the U.S. finding that only minor changes were needed to clear the deal.
GE countered the Commission's conclusions, saying not only that it was disappointed but that it disagreed. "The facts just don't support these assertions," GE said in a prepared statement. "We believe this acquisition
would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices."

Late on Tuesday Honeywell announced that it named former Chairman Lawrence Bossidy as chairman and chief executive officer, taking the place of Michael Bonsignore who is retiring.

Bossidy, who led AlliedSignal when it acquired Honeywell in 1999, said he intended to keep the company independent, quashing speculation that Honeywell would entertain merger talks with GE rival United Technologies Corp. .

Shares of Honeywell, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have fallen over the last week to trade at levels unseen since the GE deal was first announced last fall. The stock rose 99 cents to $35.10 in Tuesday's trading session, which was shortened ahead of the Independence Day holiday.

The merger would have combined two of the largest U.S. conglomerates with businesses ranging from aerospace and engines to financial services, broadcasting, and power systems.

GE, the world's largest company by stock market capitalization, generated $25 billion in revenues from European operations last year. That represents just less than 20 percent of its total $129.85 billion in 2000 revenues.
The company also employs 85,000 people in Europe out of a total worldwide work force of 313,000. Negotiations over the merger turned into a titanic struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching
concessions the Commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti acknowledged this was the first time the European Union and U.S. antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.

"I, for one, am genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred," Monti told a news conference in Strasbourg where the Commission made its decision.
EVERYONE'S A CRITIC

The Commission's review of the case brought scorching criticism from President George W. Bush and top U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who said EU rejection would be "off the wall."

Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said the EU's decision reflected a significant divergence between the two antitrust enforcers, showing a need for consultation to "move toward greater policy convergence."

Page 54 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Several U.S. senators had warned that rejection of the GE deal could hurt U.S.-European trade relations or bring retaliation from the United States.

Monti tried to ease the impact, pointing out that this was only the 15th time in over a decade the Commission had blocked a merger and lavishly praising GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch: "He is not an American icon, he is a world icon."

He also stressed his determination to strengthen EU-U.S. cooperation in the competition field to reduce the risk of future disputes. But that did not lessen the reality of the Commission's findings.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Monti said.

Analysts and antitrust lawyers, however, have noted that regulators in Brussels considered the views of industry rivals in their review of the transaction while regulators in Washington weighed the interests of consumers.

"The Commission took a fundamentally different approach to competitive issues than its counterparts in the U.S., Canada, and nearly a dozen other jurisdictions, which approved the acquisition with few, if any, conditions," GE said in its statement.

The decision leaves Honeywell with an uncertain future. The company spent nine months anticipating it would be integrated into GE's operations, in which time Honeywell management has not been thinking strategically, Wall Street analysts said.

On Tuesday, Honeywell said Bossidy would take the reins immediately. Bossidy told reporters he would look to asset sales to help rebuild Honeywell's financial strength.

He also said Honeywell's board intended to keep the company independent. United Technologies, whose bid for Honeywell had been trumped by GE last year, has been expected to come back in with a renewed, and cheaper, offer. A spokesman for United Technologies said the company had no comment on the EU decision.
THE DEAL BREAKER

An impasse over GE's aircraft leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), appeared to be the deal breaker, sources said. The operation buys, sells, and leases aircraft.

The Commission alleged that GE used the GECAS division to help sell its engines to aircraft customers. Commission experts also said GE would be able to bundle its engines with Honeywell's avionics systems.
To close the deal, Monti requested GE sell assets that generate more than $6 billion in revenues.

The commissioner also wanted GE to sell a stake in the GECAS unit to rivals Rolls-Royce Plc and Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. , according to a document obtained by Reuters.
GE, however, proposed only to sell $2.2 billion in assets.

In a late move, the company said it would agree to sell 19.9 percent of GECAS in a private transaction, but not to competitors and only in exchange for a significant reduction in the amount of assets it would need to divest.
That final offer was rejected by the Commission. WELCH'S VALEDICTION
The defeat was a major disappointment for GE's Welch, who delayed his departure from the company to see the deal through. But one Wall Street analyst said the decision might make life easier for his successor, Jeffrey Immelt.

"GE's going to do fine with or without Honeywell," said William Fiala of Edward Jones. "Honeywell was an opportunistic acquisition. It was driven in part by the defensive nature of (rival bidder) United Technologies trying to buy Honeywell."

"So, it's partly bad for GE, but they have a great business portfolio and this probably makes Jeff Immelt's succession easier," Fiala said.

UPDATE 2-Honeywell's Bonsignore quits, Bossidy returns.
By Kristin Roberts
981 words
4 July 2001
03:55
Reuters News
LBA
English

NEW YORK, July 3 (Reuters) -  Honeywell  International Inc. late on Tuesday said it brought back former Chairman Lawrence Bossidy to replace Michael Bonsignore as chairman and chief executive just hours after European regulators killed the company's $42 billion  merger with General Electric  Co.

Bossidy, who signed on with a one-year commitment, said he intended to keep  Honeywell  independent, despite analysts' expectations that  GE rivals would step in to bid for the company.

"The board has decided today that we want to proceed independently," Bossidy told reporters on a conference call.

"The idea is to stay independent now, to get the company back up on its feet, to get the people reengaged and obviously at some point in the future the company may reconsider it again," he said, regarding other merger possibilities. "But it's not the intention of the board to have any considerations right now."

The management change is effective immediately, Honeywell said in a statement announcing that Bonsignore was retiring effective immediately.

Bossidy, 66, served as Chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal from 1991 to 1999, when he became Chairman of Honeywell following the merger of the two companies. AlliedSignal adopted the Honeywell name following the deal.

Honeywell, whose products range from aircraft electronics to home security systems, also said earnings for the second quarter and full year would come in at the lower end of Wall Street's current targets.

The Morris Township, N.J.-based company expects to record $575 million to $625 million in pretax charges related to merger expenses, repositioning, customer settlements, asset impairments, legal and environmental costs. That comes on top of more than $1 billion in charges taken since the GE deal was first announced last fall.

Bossidy said he could not comment on any charges Honeywell may need to incur in future quarters, noting he had just been appointed CEO and had not previously been privy to that financial information.

"There are some business issues that need to be faced decisively and promptly," Bossidy said. "But you can be sure we're going to get those costs behind us as quickly as possible."
OUTSTANDING GE QUESTION
Bossidy said the merger agreement between GE and Honeywell is legally still in effect.
Analysts and antitrust lawyers speculated as the deal began to unravel that Honeywell could file suit against GE
to recover some costs Honeywell incurred as it prepared to be integrated.

Bossidy said Honeywell's board was considering all its options related to GE, and the outstanding agreement. He said the company could be expected to make a decision over the summer on how to resolve that situation.

"I think Honeywell's board is looking at all it's options and there will be some decisions reached on that in the future," he said without elaborating.



Page 57 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Shares of Honeywell fell over the last week to levels held before the GE deal was announced. The stock closed up 99 cents at $35.10 in Tuesday's trading session, which was shortened ahead of Wednesday's Independence Day holiday.

Bossidy said that among his first moves to improve Honeywell's financial health will be to reexamine underperforming business units. Bossidy noted the company will likely shed some assets, such as the friction materials operation.

Due to the GE deal Honeywell had held onto some businesses previously pegged for sale. That contributed to Honeywell's poor quarterly earnings performance. The company took more than $1 billion in charges as it readied to be integrated into a new parent company.

For the second quarter, Honeywell said it expects to report on-going earnings in the range of 53 cents to 55 cents per share, excluding charges. Revenues should total $6 billion with free cash flow of $175 million to $200 million. The company posted operating earnings of 75 cents a share in the year ago second quarter.
For the full year, Honeywell said it should report on-going earnings per share of $2.15 to $2.30 with revenues of
$24 billion to $24.5 billion and free cash flow of $900 million to $1 billion.

Wall Street's profit expectations for Honeywell's results range widely, partly because the company has not held a conference call for investors all year.

Analysts, on average, pegged Honeywell at a profit of 60 cents per share for the second quarter, with estimates ranging from as low as 48 cents up to 70 cents per share, according to tracking firm Thomson Financial/First Call.

For the full year, analysts expected the company to report earnings of $2.46 per share with estimates ranging from $2.10 to $2.70.
STRUGGLES BEYOND GE

"This was a great company when we put it together just 18 months ago and it's still a great company," Bossidy said, referring to the merger with AlliedSignal. "It's obviously had some issues that have been economy-caused and there are probably some issues as a result of (merger-related) distraction."

Some of Honeywell's financial troubles are linked to the weak economic environment that has hurt many industrial companies, he said.

The industrial automation and automotive businesses, for example, have taken a hit due to current economic softness, Bossidy noted.

More broadly, Bossidy said he hopes to retain employees who had otherwise expected to lose their jobs had the merger with GE gone through.

"I have some obligation, I have some heart and soul in this company," Bossidy said. "I hate to see it frankly in the condition it is in right now in terms of both disappointment and in terms of earnings performance."

"I'm not here for a new career but for a time where I hope I can restore stability, improve the self-confidence of the people and give the company the focus it needs to perform again," he said.

EU blocks  General Electric's Honeywell  takeover.
703 words
4 July 2001
Mediafax Economic Service

STRASBOURG, France, July 3 (MEDIAFAX) - The European Commission on Tuesday blocked General           Electric Co's proposed $42 billion acquisition of Honeywell  International, killing what had been billed as the world's largest industrial  merger despite its approval  in the United States, Reuters informs.

The 20-member EU executive, meeting in Strasbourg, took the bold step over concerns the deal would have forced rivals in several aerospace and related markets out of business. It is only the 15th time in over a decade the Commission has blocked a merger and the first time it has barred an all-American deal, which had been approved  by U.S.  regulators in May.

The merger negotiations turned into a titanic struggle with GE unwilling to agree to the far-reaching concessions the Commission said were needed for it to approve the deal.

The deal created a transatlantic rift with U.S. officials from President George W. Bush down voicing concern at the European Commission's handling of the merger.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill had said EU rejection would be "off the wall". EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti begged to differ.
"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he said in a statement.

Monti added the Commission and U.S. Department of Justice had worked closely together during the investigation, and said it was "unfortunate that in the end, we reached different conclusions..." He said he was determined to strengthen EU-U.S. cooperation in the competition field in future to try to reduce the risk of transatlantic disputes.
The decision leaves Honeywell to an uncertain future and a battered share price.

The two companies had considered pulling the merger before the EU blocked it, but were apparently unable to agree to do so.

Commission experts have said that GE, which makes engines for airliners, would be able to package Honeywell's avionics to help it compete unfairly against competitors. The last chance to save the deal evaporated on Friday when GE Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch rejected a suggestion by his counterpart at Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore, that he slash $1.7 billion from Honeywell's price tag to compensate GE for extra sell-offs to win Brussels' approval for the merger.
Welch said that still made no sense for GE's stockholders and a Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday said that
Bonsignore would be replaced by the board of Honeywell.

Alec Burnside, a lawyer with Linklaters & Alliance in Brussels, said a series of problems ultimately spelled the end of the deal.

He ticked off the troubles as "a deal that was launched without consultation with antitrust counsel, an outspoken chief executive, a highly motivated group of complainants and an irritation to the Commission caused by a
high-profile press campaign culminating in superpower bullying from the United States."

Burnside said that the problem of the handover of the Justice Department antitrust division in the United States - which was without a chief for months - may have created a vacuum at the top, although cooperation continued at lower levels between Justice and the European Commission.

Page 59 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Burnside said another problem was that the European Commission process "does not contain sufficient checks and balances to validate their new economic thinking against the facts."

By contrast, U.S. agencies must test their theories in court before they may block a deal. One of the key issues for the Commission was GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, which buys, sells and leases aircraft. The Commission wanted GE to surrender some of its exclusive ownership of the division.

Monti wanted GE to divest a piece of Gecas to GE engine competitors Rolls-Royce Plc or Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., according to a document obtained by Reuters. The Commission alleged that GE used Gecas to help sell its engines to aircraft customers, which often have a choice of engines.

On February 5, the companies filed with the European Union with the expectation of a quick, one-month approval. Welch came to Brussels twice to meet Monti.

HONEYWELL CHIEF QUITS AFTER GE LINK IS BLOCKED.

Honeywell  chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore today quit the engineering group only hours after its attempts to form the world's biggest industrial  merger with America's  General Electric  were killed off by European regulators.

The dramatic move ends Bonsignore's 31 years of service with the company and, while dressed up as a retirement, will be seen as an attempt to draw a line under the episode of the failed  merger.

Highlighting the irrelevance of age in the 60-year-old's departure, Honeywell has installed in his place former chairman Larry Bossidy, six years his senior.

Bossidy has committed to the post for only a year and the changes were made effective immediately in the early hours of this morning.

In the dying days of the $42 billion (#30 billion) talks last week, the unassuming Bonsignore drew heavy flak when he sent an open fax to his opposite number at GE, Jack Welch, offering to accept a lower price and further sacrifices to steer the merger through the European Commission.

Welch faxed back a terse reply ruling out further concessions, leaving Bonsignore, and Honeywell, looking increasingly desperate.
Bossidy was chairman and chief executive of Allied Signal, which merged with Honeywell two years ago. Document ns00000020010912dx74000rs

GE MAY APPEAL VETO OF MERGEREUROPEAN REGULATORS TUESDAY REJECTED GE'S UNION WITH
HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL.

NEW YORK -- Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, though GE Chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators.
Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.
GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European
Union's Competition Commission.

The ruling was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, announcing that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Bonsignore had resigned. He will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year. GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares
gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

EU vetoes $41 billion GE purchase  of Honeywell

NEW YORK -- European regulators vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell
International Inc. yesterday, though GE chairman John F. Welch Jr. left open the possibility of an appeal.
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted that the move would kill one of the largest industrial mergers ever.

The fallout extended to the executive suite: Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of Honeywell International yesterday. Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said his company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears that the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's effect on the company's ability to do business in Europe. "Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White L.L.P. in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans to retire by the end of this year, though the exact timing is unclear.

A statement from the Commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed . . . were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Mario Monti, EU competition commissioner.

The Commission concluded that the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."
The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting.

In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome. "We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.
Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European

EU CITES COMPETITION CONCERNS IN BLOCKING GE-HONEYWELL DEAL

Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Honeywell  International Inc. yesterday, though  GE
chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors is reportedly going to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.
Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane would not comment yesterday on the newspaper report.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission; one was withdrawn; and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedential value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold &White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion at this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.
Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While the they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded," he said.

Still, dissension is rare. Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal -- WorldCom- Sprint -- was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

On Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would have also pared more than $1 billion from the takeover price. In return for a lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Welch said Honeywell's proposal "makes no sense" for his company's shareholders.

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

Honeywell  chief quits after GE link is blocked

HONEYWELL chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore today quit the engineering group only hours after its attempts to form the world's biggest industrial  merger with America's  General Electric  were killed off by European regulators.

The dramatic move ends Bonsignore's 31 years of service with the company and, while dressed up as a retirement, will be seen as an attempt to draw a line under the episode of the failed  merger.

Highlighting the irrelevance of age in the 60-year-old's departure, Honeywell has installed in his place former chairman Larry Bossidy, six years his senior.

Bossidy has committed to the post for only a year and the changes were made effective immediately in the early hours of this morning.

In the dying days of the $42 billion (Pounds 30 billion) talks last week, the u n a s s u m i n g B o n-signore drew heavy flak when he sent an open fax to his opposite number at GE, Jack Welch, offering to accept a lower price and further sacrifices to steer the merger through the European Commission.

Welch faxed back a terse reply ruling out further concessions, leaving Bonsignore, and Honeywell, looking increasingly desperate.
Bossidy was chairman and chief executive of Allied Signal, which merged with Honeywell two years ago.

GE DEAL'S DEMISE SCATTERS FALLOUT; KEY SHIFT SIGNALED AS BOSSIDY TAKES HONEYWELL

Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. yesterday following the  European Commission's rejection of the company's planned $41 billion  merger with General       Electric  Co.
Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive officer of
AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired  Honeywell  for about $14 billion and adopted the  Honeywell  name.
Honeywell employs the equivalent of more than 2,800 full-time employees in the Richmond-Petersburg, Va., area. "We will move quickly and aggressively to improve our performance, further strengthen our management team
and rebuild the confidence of our shareowners, customers and employees," Bossidy said in a statement.

"We will re-energize and refocus our employees and, with their hard work, Honeywell will create greater shareowner value and resume our journey to become a premier global company."

He faces hefty challenges, however, as Honeywell copes with a new future without GE amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, which saw first-quarter profit fall 92 percent, said yesterday that second-quarter ongoing earnings will be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share from analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Despite Bossidy's statement, Honeywell's future remains unclear. With the apparent demise of the GE-Honeywell deal, analysts are looking at Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., the huge manufacturer of helicopters, as the most likely Honeywell suitor.

United Technologies, which helped persuade the EU to block the GE-Honeywell merger, had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE suddenly came courting and blocked that deal last fall.

However, a GE appeal of the European ruling could block any attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner. GE hasn't ruled out an appeal, saying it is leaving all its options open.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

"You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass," Heymann said.

Honeywell is known for its technology and creativity, but Heymann said that Bonsignore had failed to execute the financial restructuring required after AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell.

The combined company, which kept Honeywell's better-known name, makes equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and automated controls for homes, factories and other buildings, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial materials.

Bossidy, AlliedSignal's top executive, became chairman of the combined company briefly, retiring in April 2000 and handing the reins to Bonsignore, who had been the Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive.
Page 74 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Bonsignore then started an aggressive cost-cutting program and strengthened Honeywell's Internet business strategy.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell announced in June 2000 that second-quarter profit would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed "surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity."

By this past April, as the economy cooled, sales in key markets continued to slump. The company again cited higher costs, but also blamed decisions to halt some business activities and delay plans to sell its consumer automotive products and friction materials businesses because of its pending merger with General Electric.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 of its 125,000 jobs. About 400 jobs in the
Richmond-Petersburg area were eliminated between the first of last year and the beginning of this year.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's yesterday affirmed its "stable" ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has "substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial policy."

NEW YORK --  European regulators vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell International Inc. yesterday, although  GE Chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.
But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company is considering whether to appeal the decision by the
European Union's Competition Commission.

The move was widely expected after the companies failed to ease European fears that the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission, one was withdrawn and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold &White in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans to retire by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors reportedly is going to oust Michael Bonsignore, chairman and chief executive officer, at a meeting Tuesday.

The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that his replacement will be Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell.

NEW YORK -- Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.' s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to close at $35.10.

Fury at GE after EC kills merger

THE European Commission yesterday blocked plans by giant  General Electric  to take over fellow-US
aero-engineer Honeywell.
The EC said the $42billion (GBP30billion) purchase, the world's biggest industrial  merger, would reduce
competition in the European aerospace industry and lead to higher prices for customers, particularly airlines.
This is the first time a merger involving only US firms has been blocked by the Commission.

Commissioner Mario Monti said GE had been given a chance to remove EC concerns after an earlier proposal was rejected but it had failed to find an acceptable solution.
The Commission found GE on its own already dominated the markets for large commercial and regional aircraft. GE chief executive Jack Welch reacted angrily.
He said he "strongly disagreed" with the EC's findings that a merger would result in dominant positions in the markets for avionics, including engines for corporate jets and engine starters.
"The facts just don't support these assertions, " claimed Welch.
"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices." Competition bodies in the US, Canada and elsewhere have approved the acquisition "with few, if any, conditions",
Welch added.

BECKY ANDERSON, BUSINESS INTERNATIONAL: Well, as some countries move towards cooperation, the  GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) deal threatens to disturb the trade balance elsewhere. In blocking the $42 billion deal between the two companies, the  European Commission is sending a tough message to US businesses which could impact trade relations between both sides. The move has met with criticism in the US leading US Treasury Secretary Paul O`Neill to question the  EU`s authority to judge merger cases. Liz George has this report
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

LIZ GEORGE, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Bananas, beef, wheat gluten, steel, (INAUDIBLE) corporation tax, all thorny trade issues but in recent months, progress has been made between the US and the European Union to build a better relationship. The two have even been working together towards an autumn round of world trade talks. But now the EC has blocked the GE/Honeywell merger, a deal which got the all clear in the US. IAIAN MACVAY, STEPTOE AND JOHNSON: It will give some further ammunition to those who would be protectionist, would be isolationist anyways, to say, look at those beastly Europeans. They`re doing it again. We must not be so friendly to them. But I don`t think that the administration will react that way. In fact, their suggestions so far have been while they may not like everything that`s gone on, it will not impact on the trade agenda.

GEORGE: The regulators in both countries are aiming for the same thing but they operate with different rules. With this decision, the EC has broken new ground and businesses are definitely taking note.

FRANCES MURPHY, ROWE AND MAW: It`s said to have the potentials for damaging business and I think very much depending on how the immediate aftermath is handled by the representative camps. I think one could see a (INAUDIBLE) prepared -- almost business will hold off. The legal advisors will hold off. The markets will hold off generally and there will be a standard review, of course. GEORGE: So even if the US and the EU managed to move forward on trade disputes, the impact of the EC`s decision to block GE/Honeywell is likely to be felt hardest in the acquisition arena.

(on-camera): The number of mergers that`s now referred to the EU competition authorities has risen to around about 300 per year and the experts say that the next wave of mergers is going to be between US and EC companies. So unless the two competition authorities start working more closely together, it`s likely that more clashes will happen in the future. Liz George, CNN financial news, London.

HEADLINE: Europe blocks  GE merger

NEW YORK -  General Electric's  $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International was vetoed Tuesday by the European Union - the first time a  merger of two U.S. companies has been stopped solely by Europeanregulators.
The decision by the  EU's 20-member Competition Commission in Strasbourg, France, was unanimous.

The merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.
Michael R. Bonsignore resigned as Honeywell's chairman and chief executive after the commission's rejection.
He will be replaced by Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which
in 1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

GE chief executive Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, characterizing the widely expected rejection as a setback. But analysts said the deal - one of the biggest industrial mergers in history - is probably dead.

The deal had won regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust regulators but ran into resistance from the EU, angering some members of Congress. President Bush also expressed concern.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law, just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The commission vetoed the deal after executives failed to allay European fears that their merged company would dominate markets for jet engines and aircraft electronics.

Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since 1990, six have been taken to court. None of the challenges has been successful.
The combined company would have been a behemoth.

Honeywell, with some 120,000 employees worldwide, makes industrial materials such as plastics and chemicals as well as equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and factories.

GE is best known for making light bulbs and appliances, but it also includes NBC and makes power plant parts and aircraft engines. It has 313,000 employees.

Honeywell had offered to accept a lower purchase price and in return asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators. But GE rejected the revisions Friday.

The Wall Street Journal had reported that Honeywell's board of directors would oust Bonsignore as a result of the failed deal.
GE fell 69 cents to $49.51 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell rose 99 cents to $35.10. On the Net: General Electric,  www.ge.com; Honeywell, www. honeywell.com; European Commission,

Honeywell  says its chairman and CEO has resigned and will be replaced by retired chairman Lawrence Bossidy. The change was notified soon after the European Commission's decision on 3 Jul to block General Electric's (GE) acquisition of  Honeywell.  Honeywell  will remain independent for the time being. Honeywell  had intended selling its automotive brakes and fine chemicals businesses before the  merger with GE was announced. Poorly performing assets may be disposed of.

EUROPE REJECTS GE-HONEYWELL DEAL

NEW YORK -- Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission, one was withdrawn, and two are pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.
A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a
GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to
do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedential value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing was unclear.

"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion at this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

EU blocks  $41-billion GE-Honeywell merger over competition fears

NEW YORK (AP) _ Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41-billion-US purchase of  Honeywell  International
Inc. on Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal against this ``setback.''

It was the first time a proposed  merger between two American companies had been blocked solely by  European regulators. Analysts said this appeared to kill what would have been one of the world's largest-ever industrial mergers.
But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the
European Union's Competition Commission.
Hours after the EU's veto, Honeywell took steps to move forward, announcing that chairman and chief executive
Michael Bonsignore had resigned.
He will be replaced by Lawrence Bossidy, 66, former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in
1999 acquired Honeywell and adopted the Honeywell name.

Tuesday's European Commission ruling had been widely expected after the companies failed to allay European fears that the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court. In three cases, the court sided with the commission, one was withdrawn, and
two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides giving up on the merger would be for GE and Honeywell to start the merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt ``profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen.''
Analysts said the odds are against a successful appeal.
``I think they're very slim,'' said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.

A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination, John Briggs, suggested that any GE appeal might not be intended to win Honeywell but merely ``to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe.''

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but ``the remedies proposed ... were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns.''

The GE-Honeywell merger ``would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines,'' EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti stated.

GE issued a statement saying it was ``deeply disappointed'' and added: ``We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices.''

Page 89 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
To do business in Europe, American companies must comply with EU law.
However, the EU's quashing of a deal already approved by U.S. antitrust authorities raised American hackles. American senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible ``chilling effect'' on relations. EU officials point out that transatlantic antitrust co-operation is generally smooth, but Monti pointed out that the
``risk of dissenting views ... can never be totally excluded.''

Still, dissension is rare. Of almost 400 mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one _ WorldCom-Sprint _ was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.
Last Friday GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would have pared more than
$1 billion from the takeover price and divested more holdings in a bid to satisfy European antitrust regulators.
Welch said Honeywell's proposal ``makes no sense'' for his company's shareholders.

As a result of the failed deal, Honeywell's board of directors was reported to be preparing to oust chairman and chief executive Michael Bonsignore.

GE shares fell 69 cents to close at $49.51 US Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Honeywell shares gained 99 cents to $35.10.

CEO falls, future of Honeywell  up in the air after EU shoots  down GEmerger

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) _ Michael Bonsignore resigned as chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International on Tuesday following the EuropeanCommission's rejection of the company's planned $41-billion-US  merger with General Electric  Co.

Bonsignore will be replaced by Lawrence Bossidy, the former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which in 1999 acquired Honeywell  and adopted the  Honeywell  name.

``We will move quickly and aggressively to improve our performance, further strengthen our management team and rebuild the confidence of our shareowners, customers and employees,'' Bossidy, 66, said in a statement.

He faces hefty challenges as Honeywell copes with a new future without General Electric amid a struggling U.S. economy.

Honeywell, whose first-quarter profit fall 92 per cent, said Tuesday that second-quarter ongoing earnings will only be 53 to 55 cents per share, below the consensus estimate of 60 cents a share among analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

Despite Bossidy's statement, Honeywell's future remains up in the air, because a GE appeal of the European ruling could block an attempt by Honeywell to find another merger partner.

Analysts point to United Technologies, a huge manufacturer of helicopters, as the most likely Honeywell suitor. United Technologies also makes jet engines and elevators, and helped convince the EU to block the
GE-Honeywell merger.

United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., had been in talks to merge with Honeywell when GE barged in last fall.

Nicholas Heymann, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, said Bossidy would be more likely to sell individual units of the company, breaking it into as many as a dozen pieces. A GE appeal would not
prevent Bossidy from doing that.

``You could end up getting more value from the parts, by a good margin, than you could for the whole mass,'' Heymann said.

Honeywell is known for its technology and creativity, but Heymann said Bonsignore failed to execute a needed financial restructuring after AlliedSignal Inc. acquired Honeywell Inc. for $14 billion in December 1999.

The combined company, which kept Honeywell's better-known name, makes aerospace systems, power generation and transportation equipment, and automated controls for homes, factories and other buildings, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibres and other industrial materials.

Bonsignore, who had been Minneapolis-based Honeywell's chief executive, got the same job at the new company. Bossidy, AlliedSignal's top executive, became chairman of the combined company briefly, retiring the following April and handing the reins to Bonsignore.
Bonsignore then started an aggressive cost-cutting program and concentrated on Honeywell's Internet strategy.

But after a strong initial quarter, the new Honeywell International announced in June 2000 that profits would fall below expectations. Bonsignore blamed ``surging raw material prices, a weakened euro and pockets of slow economic activity.''

By April, as the economy cooled, the company reported profits were down 92 per cent, with sales in key markets slumping.
Since spring, Honeywell has eliminated nearly 6,500 of its 125,000 jobs.
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday affirmed its ``stable'' ratings outlook for Honeywell, saying the company has
``substantial operating diversity, solid competitive positions, a strong financial profile, and a moderate financial
policy.''

EU Watchdog  Appeals For Global Antitrust Efforts

GENEVA -- The  European regulator who scuttled  General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion  merger with Honeywell International Inc. appealed Wednesday for world cooperation among  antitrust watchdogs to ease fears of global domination by big business.

"Competition policy, and specifically international cooperation on competition policy, has an important role to play if we are to avoid resentment against globalization and protectionist backlash," said EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti.

The EU's decision to block General Electric's (GE) purchase of Honeywell (HON) after it had been approved by U.S. regulators has prompted some key members of the U.S. Congress to suggest the U.S. might start looking to block plans among European companies to merge.

Mr. Monti has already described the EU decision as "a rare case" of trans-Atlantic antitrust disagreement and urged close cooperation between EU and U.S. regulators to prevent future clashes over mergers.

In a speech to a U.N. meeting Wednesday, Mr. Monti said that cooperation needs to be broadened beyond the two governments most directly involved in overseeing mergers because "bilateral agreements are clearly not enough."

"Involving more competition authorities in the discussion of international competition cases will yield better results both for bilateral as well as for multilateral cooperation," he said.

Mr. Monti appealed to developing countries at the meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development to drop their objections to including the issue in a new round of World Trade Organization negotiations.
The issue is one of the biggest obstacles to starting a new round of global round of trade negotiations at a WTO
ministerial meeting set for Nov. 9-13 in Doha, Qatar.

"Launching negotiations on a realistic competition agreement at Doha is essential to establish a solid basis for international cooperation against anticompetitive practices with an impact on international trade," said Mr. Monti.

The developing countries say it is impossible for them to make commitments on competition policy when many don't even have national laws on the subject.

About 80 countries world-wide currently have antitrust legislation and other systems designed to prevent dominance by one or a small group of companies in a particular trading sector. Only about 30 developing countries have such policies.

Mr. Monti said the EU wants to see an agreement which would set out the "core principles" of competition policy, such as transparency, nondiscrimination and due process, but said it wouldn't cover the technical issues involved in an antitrust investigation at this stage.

At the same time, the EU wants to set up a Global Competition Forum, where competition authorities would meet to discuss issues of common importance. "The range of international antitrust issues of common concern is very wide," Mr. Monti said.

Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, stressed that ensuring fair competition is vital to boost developing nations' economies.

"Competition is the soul of the market," Mr. Ricupero said. "I take issue with the widespread perception that competition should be a luxury, something which a developing country only needs when it reaches a high degree of development."

EUROPE BLOCKS $41B MERGER GE-HONEYWELL DEAL SET BACK

Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of Morris Township-based  Honeywell  International Inc. on Tuesday, although GE Chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators. Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.

An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the Commission since 1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far has been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the Commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the Commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Honeywell has about 1,800 employees in Morris Township, including workers in its technical center and other business units and about 500 in corporate headquarters, positions that would have been eliminated if the GE deal went through.
The company also has about 200 employees at an avionics facility in Teterboro that was a key part of the GE
purchase, and a couple of hundred workers elsewhere in New Jersey, officials said.

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.

A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against a GE-Honeywell merger said a GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal, but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedential value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold &White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans to retire by the end of this year, although the exact timing was unclear.
"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion at this process.

Page 95 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.

A statement from the Commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed . . . were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The Commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices," the statement said.

Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their decision," referring to the European commission's veto.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business here.

However, the EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities has raised American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on trans-Atlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.

EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good. As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation.

Monti said U.S. and European regulators regularly consult on their respective investigations of corporate linkups. While they usually come to similar verdicts, the "risk of dissenting views . . . can never be totally excluded," he said.

Still, dissension is rare. Of nearly 400 cases involving U.S. companies reviewed in Brussels since 1990, only one deal WorldCom- Sprint was barred. And Washington moved to block it the next day.

Last Friday, GE rejected last-ditch revisions in the deal suggested by Honeywell that would also have pared more than $1 billion from the takeover price. In return for the lower purchase price, Honeywell asked GE to divest more of its holdings to satisfy European antitrust regulators.

HONEYWELL'S CEO IS CASUALTY OF BAD DEAL//LONG BEFORE GE DEAL FELL APART,
BONSIGNORE'S PROBLEMS BEGAN WITH ALLIEDSIGNAL MERGER

Michael Bonsignore two years ago was the admired leader of a well-run avionics and building controls company that in his eyes needed to be bigger. Today, the chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International Inc. is out of a job, a casualty of a disastrous  merger he set in motion.

Honeywell's  board said Tuesday it had replaced Bonsignore just hours after a decision by  European regulators to block a proposed buyout by  General Electric.  The scuttled deal leaves  Honeywell  and its more than 6,000 local employees adrift, and will no doubt prompt many to ask how two highly respected companies could have so badly misread the international  regulatory environment.

But observers say the real misstep came when Bonsignore agreed to sell Minneapolis-based Honeywell to AlliedSignal Inc., a Morristown, N.J.-based company that on paper looked like a nice fit but turned out to be messy.

Bonsignore made at least two faulty assumptions in that deal, observers said, that would eventually lead it to the corporate auction block: First, he assumed that the different cultures of the two firms could be easily reconciled. And second, he underestimated how a slowdown in the economy might affect what had become a highly cyclical firm.

Those two miscalculations led to lackluster financial performance in 2000 and a sinking stock that made the company vulnerable to a takeover. Instead, Bonsignore hunted for a suitor, striking an agreement with United Technologies. That offer was topped by GE, which then fought unsuccessfully to get the deal approved in Europe.

Now Honeywell will come full circle: Lawrence Bossidy, who led AlliedSignal when it merged with Honeywell and stayed on for a short time as chairman, will return as chairman and CEO of Honeywell International. He promised to "re-energize and refocus our employees" and said that "it is time to leave behind the distractions of the past."

Bossidy, 66, is a hard-charging executive in the mold of GE's Jack Welch --in fact, he's a former vice chairman of the firm and a friend of the legendary CEO. Wall Street analysts applauded the move, though it's anyone's guess whether he is up to the tremendous challenge that now faces Honeywell.

What's clearer is that Bonsignore, 60, a leader who would rather delegate responsibility than bark orders, was probably better suited to run the old Honeywell than the merged Honeywell-AlliedSignal.

"I think it's because he was used to running a company that has very strong market share and is at the top of its competition levels in its major products," said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I.

AlliedSignal, meanwhile, "was not at the top of anything. They were a tertiary supplier of automotive and chemical supplies ... and had a ragtag operation in aerospace," Nisbet said. Under Bossidy, AlliedSignal cut costs, pushed managers and drove employees to generate solid financial numbers.
Bonsignore couldn't manage the same results.

AlliedSignal also relied on a more hierarchical structure than Honeywell, said Bruce Erickson, a professor of business and government at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management. And Bonsignore was at a disadvantage because he came from the smaller of the two merged companies.

"Allied was a conservative, old-line Eastern company," said Erickson, adding that Bonsignore's team was probably better. "It's harder for the smaller unit to change the larger unit."

Many of the old Allied businesses began to slide as the economy slowed, and the combined Honeywell failed to meet its optimistic earnings forecasts. In June 2000, Honeywell said it would miss its second-quarter earnings estimates, and over the next three days its stock lost more than a quarter of its value.

The company blamed rising raw material costs and a parts shortage. The new Honeywell was also squeezed by a slowing economy, analysts said.
Fred Zimmerman, a business professor at the University of St. Thomas who studies manufacturing, said
Bonsignore should have anticipated the slowing economy and seen the cultural mismatch.
"The track record on big mergers is pretty well established," Zimmerman said, noting that most fail.

With the problems apparent, Bonsignore sought a buyer. He found United Technologies. GE's Welch caught wind of the deal and swooped in with a better offer, saying he would delay his retirement to complete a deal that he figured to be a career-capper. Bonsignore would have been well compensated if the deal were completed -- collecting around $15 million in severance and consulting fees.

But Welch underestimated the concerns of European regulators, who worried that GE's span of products, from jet engines to avionics to financing, would put customers and competitors at a disadvantage. By last week it was clear neither side would reach an agreement. Welch rejected a last-ditch offer by Bonsignore to cut the sale price if GE would make further concessions.

Honeywell employees in the Twin Cities seemed to take the latest shake-ups in stride. Some said they were relieved to not be swallowed by GE, which was expected to shed thousands of jobs.
"It's just a matter of staying focused on our strategic plans," said Brad Morton, vice president and general
manager of Honeywell's advanced circuits division. "Our efforts as an organization are focused around Honeywell
as a standalone business."

Now Bossidy must pull Honeywell together. Bonsignore, meanwhile, will be compensated for leaving his job: His contract includes a severance clause that could mean as much as $9 million. Honeywell's statement did not say if he would receive any additional pay.

Honeywell  deal, CEO gone

Hours after the  European Commission rejected the $45-billion acquisition by General Electric  of Honeywell
International, Michael Bonsignore, the chairman and chief executive of Honeywell,  tendered his resignation.

Bonsignore, 60, will be replaced by Lawrence Bossidy, who was chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal when it bought  Honeywell  in 1999 and served for a brief period as chairman of Honeywell  following the  merger. The announcements came Tuesday evening, at the close of an extended meeting of Honeywell's  board.

Tuesday's unanimous decision by the 20-member EU Executive Commission marks the first time a merger between two American companies has been killed solely by foreign regulators. President Bush and U.S. legislators had lobbied for the deal, but the campaign backfired when EU antitrust officials angrily objected to the political pressure.

The action also denied legendary GE chairman and chief executive Jack Welch the capstone to his 20-year career. Welch had postponed his retirement to see the deal through and was deeply disappointed in the outcome.

The EU veto came after the two companies failed to alleviate European fears that the merger would squelch competition and give GE a near-monopoly in jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," said Mario Monti, the EU's top antitrust official. While the companies offered various concessions over eight months of negotiations, the remedies were insufficient, he said.

GE sharply disputed the European conclusions. GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said, "We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service, and prices."

The Justice Department issued a statement Tuesday reaffirming its conclusion. "The merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been procompetitive and beneficial to consumers," said Charles James, assistant attorney general for antitrust.

Multinational companies are required to follow the laws in all countries where they operate. Both EU and U.S. antitrust authorities review the mergers of foreign companies with substantial activities within their jurisdiction.

EU officials say much of the misunderstanding can be attributed to the extraordinary power wielded by European regulators, who in effect act as judge, jury and prosecutor in antitrust cases. Instead of arguing their case in court, as U.S. regulators do, EU antitrust officials reach their own judgments after listening to the arguments of the companies involved and their competitors.

In the GE-Honeywell case, EU officials heeded the warnings of jet engine manufacturers, notably United Technologies and Rolls Royce, and avionics companies such as Rockwell International. They contended that their earnings would be devastated by General Electric's ability to slash prices by combining sales of jet engines, cockpit controls and financial credit from GE Capital.

In addition, GE Capital Aviation Services is the world's largest plane-leasing business and accounts for about 10 percent of global aircraft purchases. European regulators said it could give General Electric an unfair advantage in demanding use of Honeywell avionics on all plane purchases, just as it does with GE engines.

Monti's staff argued that such clout in "bundling" products across several markets might temporarily reduce prices but ultimately would cause GE's rivals to fail. That could give GE a near-monopoly in which it could dictate much higher prices. That argument, EU officials said, prompted more than a dozen airlines - European and American - to testify against the merger.

Honeywell now finds itself back at square one. The Morristown, N.J., company said it would take a pretax revamping charge of $575-million to $625-million in the second quarter and forecast full-year revenue and earnings that were lower than consensus Wall Street estimates.

In recent weeks, as the prospects that Honeywell and General Electric would merge faded, analysts said Bonsignore's future role at an independent Honeywell was increasingly suspect. They said the appointment of Bossidy was a positive move.

"Mr. Bossidy's return is a plus for the stock," said Harriet C. Baldwin, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "He is very focused on operating numbers. With him in charge the likelihood improves that Honeywell will improve profit margins over the next year. And he has very good credibility with investors. And it will be important for Honeywell to communicate with investors."
In a telephone conference call with reporters, Bossidy, who is 66, said he was first approached about returning to
Honeywell three weeks ago, following a board meeting.

"There was a discussion about a change of command," he said. "I know the company better than anybody else, and I was an ideal candidate."

Bossidy, who has signed a one-year contract, said his tenure at Honeywell "might be less, it might be more. I am not here to start a new career, but to restore stability."

The intention, Bossidy insisted, is not to prepare Honeywell for an immediate sale. "We want to stay independent now, and get the company back on its feet," he said. But in the next breath, he described his mandate from Honeywell's board to be "fix the company or sell it."
Shares of Honeywell closed at $35.10, up 99 cents Tuesday. GE shares fell 69 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at $49.51

MICHAEL BONSIGNORE, the embattled chairman and chief executive of  Honeywell  International, is expected to be the first big casualty of the  European Commission's decision to block his company's takeover by  General     Electric.

Trade relations between the US and  Europe were expected to deteriorate further after yesterday's formal ruling on the merger.

President Bush has expressed anger at the Commission's decision, which contradicts a ruling by American regulators.

GE's $43 billion ( #30 billion) acquisition of Honeywell would have been the world's biggest industrial merger to date. But GE refused to agree to the concessions demanded by Mario Monti, the EU's Competition Commissioner.
Honeywell now faces an uncertain future without GE, and is expected to replace Mr Bonsignore with Lawrence
Bossidy, former head of AlliedSignal Corporation, which merged with Honeywell in 1999.

Signor Monti said: "The merger would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."

He admitted that the ruling was the first time that EU and US regulators had come to such dramatically different conclusions with the same facts.

EU blocks US mega merger The EU yesterday blocked General Electric's  #28.5 billion purchase of  Honeywell International - the first time a proposed  merger between two US companies has been blocked solely by European regulators. The veto of one of the world's largest industrial mergers by the EU's 20 member Commission was widely expected after the American companies failed to allay European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics. The  Commission's decision was unanimous. Centrica buys FORMER British Gas group Centrica has bought the UK arm of Australian telecoms provider One.Tel for #58 million. One.Tel Australia, of which Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan was a director, went into administration in May. One.Tel UK, which acts as an alternative carrier to the likes of British Telecom, has 650,000 customers. Chris Watson, managing director of One.Tel UK, called the deal "very good news".

House prices rise HOUSE prices rose by 1.9% during June as consumer confidence continued to buoy up the housing market, it emerged yesterday. Figures from the Nationwide Building Society showed the UK was on course to achieve 9.3% annual house price inflation by the end of the year.

Production boost BP said gas and oil production for the first half of its financial year would be 4% up on last year. The rise comes despite a 3% fall in output over the past three months compared to the first quarter of the year. Higher profits HOUSEBUILDER Wilson Connolly said profits for the half year would be higher than last year's corresponding figure. The integration of the Wainhomes business bought in April would generate more cost savings than the #3.5 million initially forecast, it added.

NEW YORK - Europe vetoed General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion purchase of  Honeywell  International Inc. on
Tuesday, though GE chairman Jack Welch left open the possibility of an appeal, calling the  rejection a "setback."
The decision marked the first time a proposed  merger between two U.S. companies has been blocked solely by
European regulators.
Analysts predicted the move would kill one of the world's largest industrial mergers ever.

But GE spokesman Gary Sheffer said the company was considering whether to appeal the decision by the European Union's Competition Commission, a widely expected move after the companies failed to ease European fears the deal would create an unfairly dominant position in markets for jetliner engines and aircraft electronics.
"We will consider all of our options," Sheffer said.
An appeal to the EU's Court of First Instance can take years. Of the 15 mergers rejected by the commission since
1990, six have been taken to court, but none so far have been successful. In three cases, the court sided with the
commission, one was withdrawn, and two are still pending.
To do business in Europe, U.S. companies must comply with EU law just as European companies must abide by
U.S. law to do business in America.

The only other apparent option besides ending the merger is for GE and Honeywell to start their merger process over again and submit a new proposal to the commission. Sheffer said GE would not follow that course.

Welch said in a statement that he felt "profound regret at this setback for the thousands of GE and Honeywell employees who worked so hard for the last eight months in an attempt to make this deal happen."

Welch's choice of words left analysts predicting GE was still trying to find a way to get approval for the combination. But they said the odds were against a successful appeal.
"I think they're very slim," said Ed Wheeler, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group.

A lawyer who led competitor Rockwell International's legal effort against the GE-Honeywell combination said a GE appeal may not be designed to preserve the deal but to limit the decision's impact on the company's ability to do business in Europe.

"Any appeal would be designed to eliminate the decision and its precedental value so it cannot hurt GE in future acquisitions and joint ventures in Europe," said the lawyer, John Briggs, of Howrey, Simon, Arnold & White LLP in Washington, D.C.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, still plans on retiring by the end of this year, though the exact timing is unclear.

"Jack has said he would retire at the conclusion at this process. That's unchanged. When he's ready to go, he will go," Sheffer said.

A statement from the commission said GE was prepared to make amendments to the deal, but "the remedies proposed were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns" resulting from the deal.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti said.

The commission concluded the merger would have given the new company a dominant share in the market for corporate jet engines and aircraft electronics as well as strengthening GE's "dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets."

The unanimous decision came after a one-hour meeting during which Monti presented the issues to his colleagues.
In its statement, GE said the company was "deeply disappointed" with the outcome.

"We believe this acquisition would have clearly benefited consumers in terms of quality, service and prices," the statement said.
Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said, "We're disappointed in their (EU's) decision."
The EU's objections to a deal that had already secured regulatory approval from U.S. antitrust authorities raised
American hackles.

U.S. senators accused EU regulators of protectionism and warned of a possible "chilling effect" on transatlantic relations. Even President Bush expressed concern.
EU officials point out that trans-Atlantic antitrust cooperation is generally good.

As evidence, Monti noted that the two sides of the Atlantic usually reach the same decision, a tribute to daily contacts and close cooperation between the agencies.

The European Commission has blocked General Electric  Co's proposed US$43 billion (NZ$107.25 billion) acquisition of Honeywell  International, the first time Europeans  have killed a merger approved  by the United States. The 20-member commission said the deal would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets.

Leading article - EU stops US merger - But neglects  to regulate its own backyard.

By blocking General Electric's  proposed takeover bid for  Honeywell,  the European Union has proved that it is not an impotent bystander in the march towards globalisation. This is the first time European legislation has been used to block a merger between two US companies. Even though the  merger would probably not have
happened anyway, the EU has established a precedent that will be fiercely resisted in the US. George Bush did not get elected with a proactive business agenda in order to have it undermined by collectivist  Europe.

Pity then that Europe had to spoil it all yesterday when the European parliament rejected - on a tied decision - an EU directive that has been 12 years in the making to help create a level playing field for takeovers in Europe. Fourteen out of the 15 EU governments favoured the legislation, but Germany - fearing more unwanted foreign takeovers like that of Vodafone for Mannesmann last year - launched a furious counter-offensive, which found favour among enough Euro MPs to scuttle it.

The lesson of these two events is that more, not less, international legislation is needed to provide global rules for multinational corporations. Britain is rightly irked that companies in Germany and France can freely make
takeover bids in the UK - as witness the way our utility companies have fallen into foreign hands - while UK companies are denied reciprocal rights in many European countries. Europe may take pleasure in the way it cocked a snook at the US over the GE-Honeywell merger, but how would it have reacted if a US court had
blocked a merger between two European companies on the grounds that consumers in America would have been adversely affected? If globalisation is to be tamed it needs global rules and global investigating bodies.
Meanwhile, before Europe tries to impose a level playing field in the US on merger activity it ought to establish one in its own backyard.

MAIN (A)
FOR UTC, HONEYWELL SEEMS DISTANT

Any hopes United Technologies executives might have had of making a quick run on  Honeywell  International seem to have dimmed with the return of Lawrence A. Bossidy to  Honeywell's  helm.

Tuesday, after the European Commission rejected a proposed $42 billion merger of Honeywell  with General Electric,  the Honeywell  board ousted Michael R. Bonsignore from the chief executive's chair and replaced him with his predecessor -- Bossidy.

And in his first comments to reporters Tuesday night, Bossidy sounded like a man in no rush to sell the company. He spoke of his desire to keep Honeywell independent until he can "stabilize" the operation.

Bossidy said he has a one-year contract to try to turn Honeywell around. His tenure, he said, "might be less or more, but that's the intention."

"The idea is to stay independent now, to get the company back on its feet," he said, suggesting that only then might the board consider offers for the company.
Bossidy, 66, then also is expected to choose his successor.

In his prepared comments Tuesday, presumably carefully crafted to send the right message to Honeywell workers, Wall Street and potential suitors, Bossidy made clear where his immediate attentions must go. And that didn't appear to be another difficult merger.

"It is time to leave behind the distractions of the past several months and to immediately implement a laser-sharp focus on consistently meeting our financial commitments and our customers' needs," said Bossidy, a 34-year veteran of GE before moving to Allied Signal. He presided over that company's 1990s turnaround and negotiated its merger with Honeywell in 1999.

Hartford-based UTC had been in talks with Honeywell last fall when GE, eager to avoid the potentially potent combination of aerospace businesses, swooped in with a higher offer. George David, UTC's chairman, has said he would be interested in trying again if the merger did not go through.
But UTC has said little about the deal in recent weeks, and Peter Murphy, a company spokesman, said
Wednesday that UTC had no comment on either the deal's demise or the management change at Honeywell.

Industry analysts said Bossidy would immediately begin implementing some of the sell-offs and restructuring under way before Honeywell accepted GE's offer last October. Much has been on hold since then, with attention diverted by the merger and staff jumping ship because they were fearful of losing their jobs.

Bossidy talked in his conference call of sharpening the focus on the company's successful aerospace divisions and holding onto key employees.

Paul Nisbet, an industry analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said Bossidy would likely start by selling off commercial product lines such as carpet nylon and automotive parts.

And Nisbet said any merger talks between UTC and Honeywell would start at the top, between David and Bossidy. If Bossidy makes clear he is not interested, Nisbet said, David would be unlikely to proceed with an unfriendly effort.

Bossidy said Tuesday that Honeywell is considering, among other options, negotiating a settlement with GE or taking legal action over the failure of the planned merger.

Bossidy also said he had a "general conversation" with GE Chairman Jack Welch Tuesday morning, but he didn't provide specifics. It is unclear whether Bossidy's close ties to Welch would reduce the chances of Honeywell filing a lawsuit against GE.

Honeywell  Installs  Bossidy as New Chief --- Company Must Now Contend With Failed GE Merger And
Slipping Earnings

Lawrence A. Bossidy returned Tuesday night to run beleaguered  Honeywell  International Inc. and immediately faced a host of woes, ranging from disappointing earnings to the prospects of a legal battle against  merger partner General Electric  Co., Mr. Bossidy's onetime employer.

Against the backdrop of the  European Commission's official  rejection of GE's $43 billion acquisition and yet another Honeywell  profit warning, the board ousted Michael R. Bonsignore, 60 years old, as  Honeywell chairman and chief executive, thanking him for his 31 years of service. As expected, the board replaced him with Mr. Bossidy, 66, former chairman and chief executive of AlliedSignal Corp., which merged with  Honeywell  in late
1999.

After its three-hour meeting, Honeywell's board made no comment about potential litigation against GE. The merger agreement remains in effect and technically could stand until Nov. 30, the "walkaway date," but keeping it in place restricts Honeywell's ability to make major business decisions without consulting GE. Honeywell's board is debating whether to officially terminate the deal. It also must decide whether to sue GE for allegedly failing to use its "reasonable best efforts" to win antitrust approval for the deal as required in the merger agreement.

In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Bossidy, who was contacted by the board three weeks ago to take over as chairman and CEO, said the company was considering its legal options and would make a decision "sooner
rather than later."

Honeywell disclosed the profit warning and the management switch Tuesday evening. At 1 p.m. Tuesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Honeywell shares were up 2.9%, or 99 cents, at $35.10 on news of Mr. Bossidy's impending return, which had been reported in that day's edition of The Wall Street Journal. GE shares were down 69 cents at $49.51 at 1 p.m. in NYSE composite trading.

Investors were optimistic Mr. Bossidy, a onetime vice chairman of GE who made a name for himself producing stellar earnings during nine years at the helm of AlliedSignal, was the right person to turn around Honeywell. Known as a demanding boss, Mr. Bossidy has a reputation for being focused on the bottom line and on Tuesday termed himself an "ideal candidate" to lead Honeywell.

This time around, though, Mr. Bossidy faces some unique challenges. The company never has been fully integrated following the Honeywell-AlliedSignal deal, and it still faces a bloated cost structure and tensions between the two camps.

The biggest challenge may be in boosting morale and keeping people. A number of top executives have left or are on the way out, as a result of plans to merge with GE, and Mr. Bossidy said Tuesday that he wants to do his best to "retain these good people."

Despite constant speculation about an offer for Honeywell from spurned suitor United Technologies Corp., Mr. Bossidy, who was hired under a one-year contract, said the "idea is to stay independent for now, and at some point in the future the company may consider" a merger again. "It's time to forget the past and what might have been" and focus on the future, added Mr. Bossidy.

That may be easier said than done, since Honeywell is facing a bleak earnings outlook. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue to be $6 billion, with "ongoing earnings" between 53 cents and 55 cents a share


Page 113 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
-- well below analysts' estimates of 60 cents a share. That earnings forecast excludes a pretax charge of $575 million to $625 million to cover merger-related expenses, legal fees and asset impairments, among other costs.

Furthermore, analysts and investors said Mr. Bossidy shares the blame for last year's earnings woes, since many of the problems were from the old AlliedSignal businesses.

"Bossidy's reputation is a bit tarnished by the fact that the merger that he crafted has failed so miserably," said Michael Holton, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, a large Honeywell shareholder. "This is an opportunity to redeem himself."

Mr. Bossidy and the board also need to make a decision on whether to pursue a lawsuit against GE. The board needs to show its shareholders that directors are doing everything possible to protect the rights of Honeywell shareholders under the merger agreement.
But the merits of a lawsuit are unclear, and Honeywell may be entering uncharted territory.

A "reasonable best efforts" clause is common in merger agreements, but courts seldom have considered the true meaning of the phrase because parties involved in failed takeovers usually settle their differences out of court.

Under the agreement, GE is required to use reasonable best efforts to win antitrust approval and agree to certain measures, such as divestitures, so long as those measures don't result in a "material adverse effect" on Honeywell's business.

People close to GE said Honeywell's offer last week, to reduce the takeover price if GE agreed to the European Commission's required concessions, is proof the concessions demanded were material. These people said GE clearly made its best effort to get the deal approved.

Takeover experts are divided on whether the concessions demanded by European regulators, including the sale of a stake in GE's airplane-finance unit, were too much.

There is also disagreement over whether GE failed to live up to the deal by refusing to agree to the demands, or waiting too long to offer its own concessions.

Looking at what GE would have been required to do, one could argue that the EU demands "did not have a material adverse effect on Honeywell, and GE did not comply with its obligations to use reasonable best efforts," said one veteran takeover lawyer who asked not to be identified.

Others disagreed. "The fact that there might have been conditions under which the EU would have approved the deal doesn't mean that GE was required within terms of the clause to accept those conditions," said Jeffrey N. Gordon, a Columbia University law professor.

"It's very, very tough, when you're talking about getting approval of government agencies, to say somebody didn't use their best efforts. Here, the indications are that GE wasn't seeking a way out of the deal," added Michael Hanrahan, a partner at Prickett, Jones & Elliott in Wilmington, Del., which isn't involved in the GE situation.

U.S. Antitrust Chief Criticizes EU Decision  To Reject Merger of GE and Honeywell
By John R. Wilke

WASHINGTON -- Charles James, the U.S. antitrust chief, sharply criticized the  European Union for rejecting    General Electric  Co.'s $43 billion  merger with Honeywell  International Inc.

"Clear and longstanding U.S.  antitrust policy holds that the  antitrust laws protect  competition, not competitors," Mr. James said. The  EU decision "reflects a significant point of divergence."

The remarks were the first by a senior Justice Department official on the failed merger, which the U.S. had approved in May. Mr. James, an assistant attorney general, was appointed by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate last month.

After an extensive investigation completed earlier this year, the antitrust division "reached a firm conclusion that the merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been procompetitive and beneficial to consumers," Mr. James said. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers world-wide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually. That, in our view, is the essence of competition."

The EU, he said, "apparently concluded that a more diversified, and thus more competitive, GE could somehow disadvantage other market participants." As a result, "we appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets," he added.

Mr. James noted that U.S. and EU antitrust enforcers had long enjoyed a close and cooperative relationship. In fact, he said, "there were extensive consultations in this matter throughout the entire process." But, he added, this "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence."

Separately, a senior Treasury Department official said Tuesday that the matter may be discussed at the G-7 finance ministers' meeting in Rome this Saturday. But he played down any hint that the failed merger would affect wider U.S. relations with the European Union. Last week, after a speech in Detroit, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was less diplomatic. He called the decision "off the wall" and complained that there was no effective
judicial recourse for decisions by "autocratic" European antitrust enforcers.

Reaction on Capitol Hill was subdued, in part because GE made no effort to lobby the issue here. But the rejection has crystalized the differences between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement and raised the prospect of further divergence as Republicans assert control at the two U.S. antitrust agencies.

Some senators are considering hearings on the move, but aides said Tuesday no decision has been made. In a recent statement, Sens. Herbert Kohl (D., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, and Mike DeWine (R., Ohio), called the deal a "complicated transaction, one on which reasonable people may differ." But they added that "the stark difference in conclusions by the American and European antitrust authorities may indicate a need for further examination of the various processes and standards used by the different agencies."

The two lawmakers warned that "uncertainty about coordination or the legal ground rules will hinder development of free and open markets."

Others have been more blunt. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D., W.Va.), chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee, said in a recent letter to EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation." And Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.)

Page 115 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
accused the commission of "using its merger-review process as a tool to protect and promote European industry at the expense of U.S. competitors."

Mr. Monti fired back yesterday, noting that some of the strongest objections heard by EU antitrust enforcers came from U.S.-based competitors and customers of GE and Honeywell. He also said that the U.S. has often forced changes or in some cases even blocked mergers that the EU has allowed to proceed.

David Balto, a former federal antitrust enforcer now with the law firm of White & Case in Washington, said the record bears out Mr. Monti's complaint, especially in pharmaceuticals mergers, where the U.S. demanded changes in several deals the EU approved.

"People are upset that two big American companies have gotten sideswiped for the first time by the EU, but it's really no different from what we've been doing to them for years," Mr. Balto said.

Barred Merger Signals U.S.-EU Divergence
By Philip Shishkin
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
879 words
5 July 2001

STRASBOURG, France -- In one of its most high-profile antitrust decisions ever, the  European Commission officially blocked General Electric  Co.'s bid to acquire Honeywell  International Inc., raising questions about the balance of power in global merger reviews.

The implications of the decision -- made unanimously by 20 Europeancommissioners -- are likely to go beyond the immediate impact on the companies themselves. The rejection of the merger, which has been already approved  by U.S.  antitrust authorities, could signal a possible trans-Atlantic divergence in  regulating megadeals in globally consolidating industries.

Although in announcing the decision European Competition Commissioner Mario Monti repeatedly referred to close antitrust cooperation between the U.S. and the European Union, he also said "the risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded." He stressed the need to improve U.S.-EU collaboration "to reduce this risk further."

The opposite conclusions reached in the GE-Honeywell case become all the more striking given the truly global nature of the proposed acquisition. In a statement on Tuesday, GE expressed its disappointment with the commission's decision, saying "we strongly disagree with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation Services." The company may consider an appeal of the commission's decision at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, according to people familiar with the situation. A GE spokesman said only that the company "will consider all our options."

Although rare, past differences of opinion between the U.S. and EU antitrust enforcers could be explained by different geographic and product markets that each authority had to investigate. In GE-Honeywell, however, the relevant market is the global aerospace industry that transcends national borders. Therefore, the rejection of the case bespeaks a difference of approach much larger than a mere procedural divergence.

"This is the first time that we have come to a different conclusion in the same market," Mr. Monti acknowledged. "I'm genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred."
There are several reasons.

Unlike their U.S. counterparts, European antitrust enforcers lack the legal tools of addressing the abuses of market power after a merger has been approved. In the U.S. antitrust practice, the government or anyone else
can file a lawsuit against a deal that has received the regulatory green light. Such postmerger regulation is almost impossible in Europe. "This is a notable difference," Mr. Monti said without referring to the GE case in particular. "We have a one-shot possibility to approve or block a merger."

In practice, this could mean the commission will take a longer view in investigating mergers than its U.S. counterparts. This, in turn, could lead to a greater degree of scrutiny and regulation.

Another difference is the powerful voice that competitors of the merging companies possess in European merger reviews. Although Mr. Monti dismissed the criticism of being a concealed weapon in the hands of disgruntled rivals, he also confirmed for the first time that several U.S. airlines provided the commission with crucial evidence in the GE-Honeywell investigation on condition of remaining anonymous.


Page 117 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
These airlines, Mr. Monti said, were reluctant to voice their concerns in a much more public forum of U.S. antitrust reviews for fear of testifying against a company as powerful as GE. Most of the industry rivals never set out to kill the deal outright, but rather sought to impose strict conditions on it. The most vociferous complainants included U.S.-based United Technologies Corp., Rolls Royce PLC of Britain, Paris-based Thales SA and Rockwell International Corp. of the U.S.

Tuesday's decision marks the end of a tortuous five-month negotiating trek during which GE and Honeywell first fought together to overcome the commission's opposition, but in the end began to fight each other over how to save their rapidly collapsing deal, or whether to save it at all.

O'Neill offers muted criticism of EU rejection of GE merger
364 words
5 July 2001

AFPR
English
(Copyright 2001)
WASHINGTON, July 5 (AFP) - US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill offered a muted criticism Thursday of the EU rejection of the General Electric-Honeywell merger, saying it highlights a "significant difference" in antitrust enforcement by Washington and Brussels.

O'Neill echoed comments late Tuesday by the head of the US Justice Department's  antitrust division that suggested that US and  EU officials should work more closely together to harmonize standards for big mergers.

O'Neill, asked about Tuesday's decision by the European Commission to block the 45 billion dollar acquisition by GE after US authorities had approved it, said the move underlines the different philosophies between US and EU policy.

"On the one hand, the US is focusing on what's good for customers, and Europe appearing to (be) ... focusing on the question of what are the implications of this merger for competitors, rather than whether it's good for customers," O'Neill said. "I think that is a significant difference."

O'Neill did not directly criticize the EU but maintained that "it does seem to me that what the people of the world should want is economic efficiency that gets to the customer. And if combinations of companies result in the living standards of people going up, because the combination produces more value for less inputs, that's a very good thing."
O'Neill appeared to be toning down his comments after remarking last week that a thumbs-down from the
Europeans would be nothing less than "off the wall."

Late Tuesday, Charles James, assistant US attorney general for antitrust, issued a statement reiterating Washington's position that the merger of the two industrial conglomerates "would have been pro- competitive and beneficial to consumers."

James said that US and EU regulators "appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets," adding that "clear and longstanding US antitrust policy holds that the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors."

James said the EU decision "reflects a significant point of divergence" and "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence."

ECB rates, US-EU trade to top agenda at G7 Rome meeting

FRANKFURT, July 5 (AFP) - G7 finance ministers meeting in Rome on Saturday are likely to discuss to what extent a cut in  euro-zone interest rates could provide a boost to growth in the world's second- biggest economic area, and consequently help stabilise the slowing global economy.

Also high on the agenda will be the growing risk of a new trade war between the United States and Europe following an EU Commission decision this week to block the planned mega-merger of US giants General Electric  and Honeywell,  and ongoing tensions between the two regions over steel, analysts here said.

The European Central Bank said that none of its top officials were scheduled to attend the one-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven most industrialised nations.

But the pow-wow in Rome comes just two days after a key meeting of the ECB in Frankfurt on Thursday, where the bank is once again expected to resist pressure to cut its key interest rates as a means of steering Europe and the entire world economy back onto a path of growth.

So the ECB's monetary policy is likely to be very much on the minds of participants at the Rome meeting, even if they refrain from making their feelings known in public, economists said.

The US Federal Reserve has slashed its key rates six times this year to prevent the world's powerhouse economy from slipping into recession. By contrast, the ECB has trimmed a mere quarter of a percentage point off its own
key rates.

The European bank argues that inflation is currently too high to allow for a reduction in the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, its overriding task is to keep inflation in check rather than take any active measures to kick-start the economy.

Nevertheless, the latest price data for both Germany and Italy appear to suggest that inflation has already begun to slow in June, possibly paving the way for a small gesture on the part of the ECB as early as this week.

But ECB President Wim Duisenberg promptly poured cold water on such speculation on Tuesday by saying that no new information had emerged since its policy-setting meeting last month that would justify a further cut in euro-zone interest rates.

Even if the ECB holds rates steady again this week, finance ministers are likely to hold their tongues, at least in public, because they will not want to be seen to interfere with the bank's fiercely-guarded independence.
"The politicians are clever enough to realise that putting pressure on the ECB won't achieve anything, even if the
US have made it clear they'd prefer lower rates in Europe," said Commerzbank economist Christoph Weil.
Industrial Bank of Japan economist Ulla Kochwasser agreed.
"A lot of what comes out in the final communique on Saturday will depend largely on what the ECB decides on
Thursday," she said.

"But even then, the ministers will only discuss ECB policy internally and not state publicly what they believe the bank should be doing," she added.

Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein economist Eckhard Schulte said that exchange rates were not likely to figure highly at the meeting, since the euro appears to have stabilised at present.

Page 120 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's no big issue at the moment and the different positions are already well known," Schulte said.

Ray Attrill, director of analysis at 4Cast in London, said that Japan's economic and financial reforms could be touched on. But coming so soon after a US-Japan summit at the weekend, the G7 meeting in Rome will probably not come up with "anything fresh here, just further praise for Japan's reform agenda and encouragement for them to press ahead post haste".
Attrill did suggest, however, that trade could feature prominently, especially after the EU blocked the proposed
GE- Honeywell merger earlier this week.

The action in Brussels was the first time that a US corporate merger has been blocked solely by EU authorities and risks opening new sores in relations between Europe and the US.

Those relations have recently become strained following the US threat of possible protectionist measures to help its steel industry.
"There is a quite serious risk of a new trade war between the United States and Europe, Attrill argued. spm/pvh

European Union competition commissioner Mario Monti said yesterday he did not expect the European Commission's decision to block a $42 billion (U.S.) merger between General Electric  Co. and Honeywell International Inc. to harm  European companies.

Monti also reaffirmed his view that the decision, taken unanimously by the European Commission on Tuesday, should act as a spur toward co-operation between the United States and the European Union on competition issues.

"I do not expect consequences for European companies and I have already stated our determined intention regarding co-operation with U.S. antitrust agencies," he told a news conference.

Monti, who was in Geneva for an international conference on competition policy, said that he hoped that the "unusual divergence" between U.S. and EU regulators over the proposed marriage of GE and Honeywell would also act as a catalyst to more multilateral discussions on competition issues.

The 15-state EU opted to block the merger, the largest industrial marriage ever proposed, after voicing concerns the deal would have hurt competition in several aerospace and related markets.

The deal between two of the largest U.S. conglomerates with businesses ranging from aerospace to broadcasting and power systems had previously been approved by the United States with only minor conditions.

"This unusual divergence is only a stimulus for bilateral co-operation quite apart from hoped-for multilateral developments," Monti said.

The European Union has proposed that competition be included in future trade liberalization negotiations within the World Trade Organization. Monti also sees the creation of a global competition forum.

U.S. Antitrust Chief Blasts  EU For Rejecting GE's Merger Bid --- Decision  `Reflects a Significant Point of
Divergence,'  James Says --- Some Senators Are Considering Hearings on European Commission's Veto

WASHINGTON -- Charles James, the U.S. antitrust chief, sharply criticized the European Union for rejecting    General Electric  Co.'s $41 billion (48.33 billion euros) proposed takeover of Honeywell  International Inc.

"Clear and longstanding U.S.  antitrust policy holds that the  antitrust laws protect  competition, not competitors," Mr. James said. The  EU decision "reflects a significant point of divergence."

The remarks were the first by a senior Justice Department official on the failed merger, which the U.S. had approved in May. Mr. James, an assistant attorney general, was appointed by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate last month.

After an extensive investigation, the antitrust division "reached a firm conclusion that the merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers," Mr. James said. "Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers world-wide, that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually. That, in our view, is the essence of competition."

The EU, he said, "apparently concluded that a more-diversified, and thus, more-competitive GE could somehow disadvantage other market participants." As a result, "we appear to have reached different results from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets."

Mr. James noted that U.S. and EU antitrust enforcers have long had a close and cooperative relationship. In fact, he said, "there were extensive consultations in this matter throughout the entire process." But, he added, this "points to the continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence."
Separately, a senior Treasury Department official said Tuesday that the matter may be discussed at the Group of
Seven finance ministers' meeting in Rome Saturday.

Reaction in Congress was subdued, in part because GE made no effort to lobby the issue here. But the rejection has crystallized differences between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement, and raised the prospect of further divergence as Republicans assert control at the two U.S. antitrust agencies, one within the Justice Department and the other being the Federal Trade Commission.

Some senators are considering hearings on the EU's action, but aides said Tuesday no decision has been made. In a recent statement, Sens. Herbert Kohl, a Democrat from Wisconsin who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, and Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio, called the deal a "complicated transaction, one on which reasonable people may differ." But they added that "the stark difference in conclusions by the American and European antitrust authorities may indicate a need for further examination of the various processes and standards used by the different agencies."

Others have been more blunt. Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat from West Virginia and chairman of the Senate aviation subcommittee, said in a recent letter to EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti that a rejection "could have a chilling effect on future trans-Atlantic aviation and aerospace cooperation."

Mr. Monti responded by noting that some of the strongest objections heard by EU antitrust enforcers came from U.S.-based competitors and customers of GE and Honeywell. He also said that the U.S. has often forced changes or, in some cases, even blocked mergers that the EU has allowed to proceed.

EU'S REJECTION OF MERGER LIKELY TO ADD FRICTION

WASHINGTON -- The  European Union's decision to block  General Electric's  purchase of  Honeywell  is a setback for one of President Bush's early economic priorities: to set a better tone for trade relations with  Europe.

Analysts said Tuesday that  Europe's numerous critics in Congress were likely to add this development to a long list of grievances they hold against America's biggest economic competitor.

"Because this case is ending unhappily, there could be recriminations of various kinds," said Gary Hufbauer, trade expert at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.

Even before the formal veto announcement, various members of Congress were asking why the EU felt the need to block a deal that had received the blessing of American regulators.
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, recently complained about the EU's expected rejection of the GE-Honeywell action. "My concern is that we don't have bad policies imposed on us as Europeans try to protect themselves from
competition," said Gramm, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which has oversight of mergers
in the financial sector. One pending deal that could face scrutiny is the Swiss company Nestle's purchase of the
American Ralston Purina Co.
The Bush administration took office with a goal of reducing tensions over such issues as Europe's ban on
American beef produced with growth hormones and sales by American banana companies.

European Commission blocks  GE's takeover of Honeywell.

The European Commission has blocked General Electric's  US$41 billion buy-out of  Honeywell  International.
The commission says the merger will severely reduce competition in the aerospace industry.
It is the first time European regulators have squashed a a merger approved by the United States.
The commission, meeting in Strasbourg, France, rebuffed earlier pleas from US President George W. Bush and
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to approve the purchase.

EU Commissioner Mario Monti acknowledged it was the first time the European Union and US antitrust agencies have looked at the same facts in the same market and gone different ways.
But he defended the commission 's decision.

"In adopting this decision the commission concluded that the merger would create or strengthen dominant positions on several markets and that the remedies proposed by GE were insufficient to resolve the competition concerns resulting from the proposed acquisition of Honeywell," Mr Monti said.

"This merger as it was notified would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and result ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," he added.
The merger would have been a crowning achievement for GE's outgoing chairman Jack Welch. The company says it is deeply disappointed by the EC decision.
Sources close to the deal say GE plans to file an appeal.

GE-Honeywell's roadblocks rare An exception amid a flood of global mergers
RC Longworth, Tribune staff reporter

Jack Welch and General Electric  Co. blew a tire on one of the few potholes on the global highway.

The collapse of the proposed  merger between GE and Honeywell  International Inc. has produced indignation, mostly in Washington, about differences between U.S. and European antitrust laws and the difficulty in setting up a major corporate merger that satisfies  regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
In fact, the GE-Honeywell breakdown is literally the exception that proves the rule.

Antitrust laws in the U.S. and the European Union indeed differ. But the application of those laws is getting closer every day. The result is an avalanche of U.S.-European corporate marriages. And almost all of them, with a rare exception like GE-Honeywell, go through without a hitch.

As globalization grows, so do transnational mergers and acquisitions. These cross-border marriages have been rising at an annual rate of 42 percent for the past 20 years. There were 24,000 transnational mergers and acquisitions in 1999--worth a total $2.3 trillion--and about 80 percent of them were between the United States and the European Union, according to Thomson Financial Securities.

Larger mergers have to be reported to officials, but only 10 percent of them get more than a cursory review, according to antitrust officials. Of those, about 1 percent are challenged by regulators.
Even then, almost all of them succeed, sometimes with changes in terms to make them more palatable. Regulators "are not hostile to business, not hostile to mergers," said Loyola University law professor Spencer
Waller. "They will help companies, so long as the companies cooperate."

"Globalization creates a pressure toward efficiency," said New York University Professor Eleanor Fox. "Does antitrust stand in the way? The answer is that it's less likely today on either side of the ocean."
The result, almost always, is a successful merger. High-profile mergers like AOL-Time Warner, and
Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, were scrutinized and debated but safely skirted the potholes to gain approval.

Microsoft Corp. agreed to revamp a deal to buy a stake in British cable company Telewest Communications PLC, allowing the plan to avoid further scrutiny from the European Commission. After lengthy negotiations with the commission, Microsoft agreed to give up rights that would allow it to influence decisions at Telewest, meaning its
$3 billion purchase of MediaOne's 23.7 percent stake would no longer formally give it joint control of the cable firm.

Indeed, the last failed merger collapsed a year ago, when WorldCom and Sprint couldn't overcome opposition from regulators in the U.S. and Europe and scrapped a $129 billion telecommunications deal.

Even mergers that take place within the borders of one country become the business of antitrust regulators around the globe. A merger of two big American aircraft companies, like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, can affect airplane purchasers worldwide.



Page 127 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Thus a major merger, like Exxon-Mobil, may have to be approved by antitrust regulators in up to 60 countries, wherever the companies' clout is felt. The merger of three big European communications firms- -Vodafone, AirTouch Communications and Mannesmann--had to be approved by U.S. regulators.

In practice, U.S. and EU regulators are the main gatekeepers. They may be reading different music but, increasingly, they sing the same song.
"What's going on [is] convergence," according to Bernard Phillips, head of the Competition Law and Policy
Committee at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.

Phillips and other experts say with increased globalization there is growing pressure for uniform antitrust regulation, despite differences in laws, and regulators are happy to oblige.
Most regulators "have more in common with each other than with people in their own government," Waller said. They know each other well, and they talk daily by telephone or e- mail, coordinating their responses to
challenges. They also meet often--at OECD conferences, at annual seminars at Fordham University and in
Sweden, at conclaves sponsored by the American Bar Association. They also meet with officials of merging
corporations and their lawyers.

The upshot, according to experts, is a fraternity of regulators with an ideological bent toward successful mergers and a professional pride in making them go smoothly.

The main complaint of corporations now is the time and effort needed to notify regulators in dozens of countries. Regulators have begun to push for a more standardized notification.

New York, Jul 5 (EFE).- Share prices on Wall Street opened lower Thursday.

Dow component Honeywell  International, whose proposed  merger with General Electric  was rejected earlier this week by European regulators, said second-quarter earnings would come in at 53-55 cents per share, compared to consensus estimates of 60 cents per share, because of the economic slowdown.

UAL, parent company of United Airlines, said it would slash its quarterly dividend from 31.25 cents per share to five cents per share in an effort to conserve cash.

Struggling telecom company WorldCom said that 2001 earnings would hover around $1.05-1.10 per share, below previous estimates of $1.20 per share.

Federated Department Stores warned that second-quarter and full-year earnings would come in below analysts' expectations.

The retailer said that second-quarter profits would fall to 40-50 cents per share, compared with previous forecasts of 70 cents per share.

In international news, the European Central Bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.50 percent, as most analysts expected, while the Bank of England kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 5.25 percent.

Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.11 points, or 0.09 percent, to 10,562, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 18.85 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,121.95.
The S&P 500, which tracks the leading U.S. large-cap companies, lost 2.66 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,231.79. The 10-year Treasury bond gained 1/8, to 97 1/4, pushing the yield down to 5.36 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index measures all Nasdaq domestic and non-U.S.-based common stocks listed on the
Nasdaq stock market and is weighted by market capitalization.
The Nasdaq composite index includes more than 5,000 companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average includes 30 blue-chip U.S.-based companies selected by the editors of The
Wall Street Journal and is the oldest U.S. market index, dating back to 1896.

The DJIA was originally calculated by adding up the stock prices and dividing by the number of stocks. The same methodology is currently used, but the divisor is adjusted to preserve continuity.

GE and Honeywell  bosses exit as merger plan stalls

The European Commission's formal blocking of the proposed $US41.7 billion ($80.5 billion)  merger of General
Electric  and Honeywell  International has resulted in the departure of the chief executives at both companies.

On Tuesday,  Honeywell's  chairman and chief executive, Mr Michael Bonsignore, was replaced by the company's former chairman, Mr Lawrence Bossidy. Mr Bossidy has a one-year contract to "implement a strategy to enhance shareowner value as an independent company".

Mr Bonsignore's GE counterpart, Mr Jack Welch, is also poised to leave after previously delaying his retirement to see the collapsed deal through. Mr Welch has not announced his retirement date.

The EC's 20 members voted unanimously on Tuesday to reject the transaction, the first time a proposed merger of US companies has been blocked by European regulators.

Announcing the decision, the European competition commissioner, Mr Mario Monti, highlighted the close ties between Europe and the US. However, Mr Monti said the "risk of dissenting views, although regrettable, can never be totally excluded".

"This is the first time that we have come to a different conclusion in the same market," Mr Monti said. "I'm genuinely interested in understanding better why this divergence occurred."

The central EC concern involved GE Capital Aviation Services and the strength a merged group would have in the avionics industry, particularly once GECAS joined with Honeywell's manufacturing operations.

"The merger between GE and Honeywell, as it was notified, would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," Mr Monti said.

The decision has sparked intense debate about the regulatory environment governing companies with global operations. Competition regulators in the US, Canada and other jurisdictions had approved the GE-Honeywell union with minimal changes.
Observers believe that although US anti-trust laws look at whether consumers are disadvantaged by deals, the
EC also considers such transactions in terms of competition within industry sectors.

Mr Monti revealed a number of GE's competitors, including Rolls Royce, Rockwell International and United Technologies, had privately expressed concern about the deal to the EC. He said those companies were reluctant to do so in the more public US process.

Both GE and Honeywell had worked to overcome the EC's concerns. However, a revised deal put by Honeywell to GE late last week was rejected by GE's Mr Welch, who on Tuesday said the EC decision was a "setback".

That comment sparked speculation that GE might consider appealing the EC decision to the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg. In a statement, GE said: "We strongly disagree with the commission's conclusions about the competitive effects of GE's acquisition of Honeywell and its statements about the market position and influence of GE Aircraft Engines and GE Capital Aviation
Services."

Honeywell made no formal response to the decision, instead announcing Mr Bossidy's appointment and releasing earnings forecasts to reassure investors about the company's future.

Newscast:  Lawrence Bossidy is named new CEO at Honeywell

NANETTE HANSEN, anchor: On this day after Americans celebrated their independence, it's a different type of independence that Honeywell  is about to pursue, still feeling the fallout from Europe rejecting its marriage to GE. Today, Lawrence Bossidy reclaims the CEO's office at  Honeywell,  a position he had right before CEO Michael Bonsignore, who resigned right after the deal with  GE died Tuesday.

Who is Bossidy, and where will he steer  Honeywell?  Well, according to The Wall Street Journal, Bossidy--who was hired under a one-year contract--says, `The idea is to stay independent for now. And at some point in the future, the company may consider a  merger again. It's time to forget the past and what might have been and focus on the future.'
Honeywell faces a bleak earnings outlook, though. According to The Journal, the company expects
second-quarter revenue to be $6 billion, with ongoing earnings between 53 cents and 55 cents a share. This is
well below estimates of 60 cents a share. Honeywell is also deciding whether to sue GE, the parent of this
network, for allegedly failing to use its reasonable, best efforts to win antitrust approval for the deal as required in
the merger agreement. So Mr. Bossidy has his work cut out for him, to say the least.

KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: The reality of the global economy hit home this week, when European antitrust regulators scuttled the merger deal between General Electric  (URL: http://www.ge.com/) and Honeywell  (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , two U.S. corporations.

DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNNfn ANCHOR, THE MONEY GANG: Now the  GE/Honeywell  deal unraveling the latest in a string of  antitrust issues in the news over the past week.

PILGRIM: Joining us now with his perspective on the business environment is antitrust lawyer, Barry Brett. He`s a partner in the law firm Jenkins, Gilchrist, Parker & Chapin.
Welcome to "The Money Gang". Thanks very much for joining us.
BARRY BRETT, PARTNER, JENKINS GILCHRIST PARKER & CHAPIN: Thank you.

PILGRIM: In fact we emphasis, very heavily, that these were two U.S. corporations that had Justice Department approval to merge-and yet it was a not a done deal for Europeans.

BRETT: Never happened before. And really a very dramatic change in antitrust enforcement. The only think we had similar to that in the past was when the Europeans made a issue out of the Lockheed/Boeing deal. And there, the American enforcement officials-after approving it-went over to Europe, put a lot of pressure on Mario Monti. And they approved it. So, this is really a very significant development.

HAFFENREFFER: What was it that the European regulators were upset about that the U.S. regulators didn`t seem to be upset about?

BRETT: I don`t know if the U.S. regulators weren`t upset. But it was a matter of degree. And it was also a matter of the information and pressures. Honeywell-GE competitors put a major push on the European Community, headed by Mario Monti, and persuaded them that GE and Honeywell combined-with the GE financial
services-could impact a lot of the European business community. And a lot of the access of Europeans to financing.

PILGRIM: Barry, I think if you polled anybody`s competitors they would be in favor of crippling your ability to outpace them. How fair is this process to be polling competitors.

BRETT: Well, it is always done. You always poll competitors. Competitors always come in and talk about the transaction. What was significant, here, was the degree of reaction they got-and they got from Europeans, when those impacted were not basically European companies.

Looking back at Lockheed/Boeing most impacted company was the Airbus. And there the deal ultimately went through. So, that the ability of American companies to persuade the Europeans to block an American deal-when they couldn`t get the Americans to do it-very, very big change.

HAFFENREFFER: Is this more of a reflection of a business-lenient White House that we have in Washington? Or a strict European regulatory group?

BRETT: I think a combination of the two. Certainly, the deal was approved in U.S., by the old enforcement people, who had not left office. So, it had gotten through those who might be viewed as stricter. What will be significant to watch in the future is when the new regulators, the new enforcement people in the United States, are in place. Charles James at the Department of Justice, Tim Uris over at the FTC, if-as anticipated-they are less vigorous in

Page 134 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
their opposition to mergers. A lot more of the interest and the play will shift to the Europeans as they get more aggressive.

PILGRIM: There was talk of trade war. That this might trigger acrimony between the U.S. and Europe, in terms of any future deals? How much do you assess the damage? How bad was it?

BRETT: It doesn`t appear to be damage up to this point. Great cooperation between the European regulators. Mario Monti speaks here all the time. He has had great relationship with the American enforcement people. They worked together on Sprint PCS (URL:  http://www.sprintpcs.com/) WorldCom (URL:  http://www.worldcom.com/) deal and came to the same conclusion.

Here, the U.S. regulators do not try to put pressure on them. And it is too early to say whether that will have repercussion in terms of relationships between the U.S. and Europeans. They have worked hard to maintain good relationships, exchanges of information. And I think they will continue to try to do that.

HAFFENREFFER: How will this affect future deals between U.S. companies as they go overseas? Will they try to prepare more? Or will this lessen the number of deals that are going on?

BRETT: I think it will make a lot more companies gun shy about being a target in a deal. One looks at the position that Honeywell and USAirways (URL:  http://www.usairways.com/) are left in after these two deals. Those companies have been badly hurt. They have had a period of a year or more where they have been in limbo. They`ve been in play. Clearly the morale of the personnel, knowing that their company was going to be directed
by others has to be down. And they have some very real difficult situations to deal with. And other companies being the target of deals that will sustain heavy antitrust scrutiny, will have to take some very serious and long looks at that.
You know merger filings are down?
PILGRIM: You know there was some discussion that they did not really consider European implications when
they put this together, early enough. Do you think this will, as David said, accelerate the thinking process and how
this may play out in other arena?

BRETT: I think it will definitely get them looking more at Europe earlier. But it will also get them looking more at deals generally. Because of the position that you see, the targets left then, with having been directed in essence by the acquiring company for a year-or a year or more. Now they have to find new directions for the companies. But Europe is only part of it, but it is certainly going to be a very important part.

HAFFENREFFER: I want to ask you about Microsoft. (URL:  http://www.microsoft.com/) Because they had their case kicked back to the lower courts. This was a victory for Microsoft. But how do you think this will wind up playing out?

BRETT: I think you will have a modest decree entered by a district judge in the District of Columbia. There may very well be a settlement. There is going to be a lot of difficulty between the state attorneys general and Department of Justice.

Clearly, the Department of Justice will press very hard for a settlement and look to settle it. One thinks that the states will not be nearly as desirous of getting a settlement. They may push it and may want to back to get a decree from a district judge. But it will be a lot more modest decree than Judge Jackson entered. And there is really no movement left for anything like a break up of Microsoft. That`s not going to happen.
PILGRIM: All right. Thank you very much for your considerable analysis. Barry Brett of Jenkins, Gilchrist, Parker
& Chapin.
BRETT: Thank you.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
New Honeywell  head faces host of problems Bossidy takes over as merger fizzles and possible legal fight
with GE looms

NEW YORK, NEW YORK and PITTSBURGH -- Lawrence Bossidy returned Tuesday night to run beleaguered Honeywell  International Inc. and immediately faced a host of woes, ranging from disappointing earnings to the prospects of a legal battle against  merger partner General Electric  Co., Mr. Bossidy's onetime employer.

Against the backdrop of the  European Commission's official  rejection of GE's $43-billion (U.S.) acquisition and yet another  Honeywell  profit warning, the board ousted Michael Bonsignore, 60, as  Honeywell  chairman and chief executive officer, thanking him for his 31 years of service. As expected, the board replaced him with Mr. Bossidy, 66, former chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corp., which merged with  Honeywell  in late 1999.

After its three-hour meeting, Honeywell's board made no comment about potential litigation against GE. The merger agreement remains in effect and technically could stand until Nov. 30, the "walkaway date," but keeping it in place restricts Honeywell's ability to make major business decisions without consulting GE. Honeywell's board is debating whether to officially terminate the deal. It also must decide whether to sue GE for allegedly failing to use its "reasonable best efforts" to win antitrust approval for the deal as required in the merger agreement.

In a conference call with reporters, Mr. Bossidy, who was contacted by the board three weeks ago to take over as chairman and CEO, said the company was considering its legal options and would make a decision "sooner
rather than later."

Investors were optimistic that Mr. Bossidy, a onetime vice-chairman of GE who made a name for himself producing stellar earnings during nine years at the helm of AlliedSignal, was the right person to turn around Honeywell. Known as a demanding boss, Mr. Bossidy has a reputation for being focused on the bottom line and on Tuesday termed himself an "ideal candidate" to lead Honeywell.

This time around, though, Mr. Bossidy faces some unique challenges. The company never has been fully integrated following the Honeywell-AlliedSignal deal, and it still faces a bloated cost structure and tensions between the two camps.

The biggest challenge may be in boosting morale and keeping people. A number of top executives have left or are on the way out as a result of plans to merge with GE, and Mr. Bossidy said Tuesday that he wants to do his best to "retain these good people."

Despite constant speculation about an offer for Honeywell from spurned suitor United Technologies Corp., Mr. Bossidy, who was hired under a one-year contract, said the "idea is to stay independent for now, and at some point in the future the company may consider" a merger again. "It's time to forget the past and what might have been" and focus on the future, Mr. Bossidy added.

That may be easier said than done, since Honeywell is facing a bleak earnings outlook. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue to be $6-billion, with "ongoing earnings" between 53 cents and 55 cents a share
-- well below analysts' estimates of 60 cents a share. That earnings forecast excludes a pretax charge of
$575-million to $625-million to cover merger-related expenses, legal fees and asset impairments, among other
costs.

Furthermore, analysts and investors said Mr. Bossidy shares the blame for last year's earnings woes, since many of the problems were from the old AlliedSignal businesses.

"Bossidy's reputation is a bit tarnished by the fact that the merger that he crafted has failed so miserably," said Michael Holton, an analyst at T. Rowe Price, a large Honeywell shareholder. "This is an opportunity to redeem himself."

Mr. Bossidy and the board also need to make a decision on whether to pursue a lawsuit against GE. The board needs to show its shareholders that directors are doing everything possible to protect the rights of Honeywell shareholders under the merger agreement.

Leading article - Competition policy  should  be focused  on consumers.

It is right that the  EU should take a more proactive role, instead of rubber-stamping American decisions. Indeed, it is difficult to see the logic behind a single market not having a single competition policy. The next stage in the project ought to be for member states to transfer  competition policy fully to the commission, to avoid the waste and stupidity of having 15 separate policies.

But such an enhanced role for the commission must be accompanied by a fundamental reassessment of the underlying philosophy of European competition policy. US anti-trust legislation aims, above all else, at
protecting the consumer. If companies hurt each other, but not consumers, the law has no role. That was what lay behind last week's US Appeal Court decision not to go ahead with the break up of Microsoft. The same logic was applied to the  GE/Honeywell  merger in the US. Because they have no directly competitive products, the authorities happily approved  the merger.

Crucially, however, where US law is based on protecting consumers, EU competition policy focuses primarily on protecting competitor companies. Thus the GE/Honeywell merger was blocked because Mr Monti feared that, by bundling their respective aerospace products (jet engines and avionics) and producing a new, lower-price product, they would usurp their competitors and take too big a share of the market.

The US's bias towards the consumer is a critical factor behind its position as the most competitive economy in the world. Companies have to compete in the market. As the GE/Honeywell merger prohibition shows, in the EU they can instead compete in the regulator's office to protect their market share. We need to test whether it is
consumers who are harmed, not competitors.

WHERE DID THIS DEAL GO WRONG?; ; GE CHAIRMAN JACK WELCH POSTPONED RETIREMENT FOR
HONEYWELL MERGER. IT DIDN'T WORK AS PLANNED.

Three critical meetings over two days ended with a handshake between  General Electric  Co.'s chief executive, Jack Welch, and  Europe's top business  regulator, Mario Monti.

"I'm going to go home and write my book, and I'm going to put out a press release," Welch told  Monti when they parted on June 14, according to sources familiar with the talks in Brussels, Belgium.

The pair had failed to reach agreement over GE's proposed $41 billion purchase of Honeywell International, which the European Union wanted whittled down.

Monti thought Welch would make a graceful exit, withdrawing the merger proposal from consideration in keeping with custom when companies can't come to terms with European regulators. Instead, Welch issued a blistering statement, accusing Europe of making "extraordinary demands."

Before the EU formally rejected the deal Tuesday, there would be three more tumultuous weeks, including another round of high-stakes bargaining, claims by U.S. politicians that Europe was treating the merger unfairly and a last-ditch effort by Honeywell to salvage the combination by cutting more than $1 billion from the takeover price.

Welch, who postponed his retirement to see the merger through, can now focus on the book, for which he received a $7.1 million advance. But he'll be hard-pressed to find a happy ending for the chapter on what was supposed to be the peak of his career with the world's most profitable corporation.
GE's bid for Honeywell seemed jet-propelled last October, when Welch glanced up from the trading floor of the
New York Stock Exchange to look at the electronic ticker.
"I saw Honeywell go past up 10 points, and I damn near dropped," Welch recalled.

Realizing that Honeywell was about to be sold to GE rival United Technologies Corp., Welch set into motion one of the most frenzied weekends of his career - a headlong rush into corporate matrimony during an intense weekend of negotiations that scrapped his well-scripted plans to retire in April.

"I've spent more time with Jack in the last 72 hours than I've spent with my wife," Honeywell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael R. Bonsignore said last Oct. 23 as he and a hoarse but still voluble Welch talked about the deal, one of the biggest industrial takeovers ever.

Honeywell International had been created less than a year earlier, when Minneapolis-based Honeywell was acquired by AlliedSignal, which is based in Morristown, N.J.

The company, with 120,000 employees worldwide, manufactures equipment for aerospace systems, power generation, transportation and factory automation, as well as specialty chemicals, plastics, fibers and other industrial materials.

Welch was widely credited with transforming GE - best known for making light bulbs and appliances - into an empire that includes TV network NBC and also produces power plant parts and aircraft engines. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., has 313,000 workers.
Page 140 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But in the rush to seal a deal to create one of the largest industrial companies, Welch and Bonsignore never held initial consultations with their Brussels lawyers who specialize in European competition concerns.

Although sources say those lawyers eventually signed off on the deal, the issue would prompt speculation months later that Welch could have avoided problems in Europe by seeking more legal advice earlier.

The merger received conditional approval in the United States in May, after the Justice Department required Honeywell to divest its helicopter-engine business and authorize new third-party maintenance and repair services for some of its aircraft engines.

Monti and Welch had met in late February, when Welch was still hoping to win easy clearance in Europe. Instead, the EU launched an in-depth probe, citing concerns about the deal's potential to reduce competition in areas such as regional-jet engines, where GE and Honeywell dominate the market.

They were particularly worried that GE-Honeywell could "bundle" GE jet engines with Honeywell electronics and financing from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), then sell them to Boeing or Airbus at discounts competitors like Britain's Rolls Royce PLC and France's Thales SA couldn't match.

Observers didn't think that was enough to block the merger entirely - until Welch held his meetings with Monti last month.

At the first meeting with Monti, Welch offered to divest $2.2 billion worth of Honeywell's aviation electronics business, but the offer didn't satisfy the European Commission, said a person close to the negotiations.
EU antitrust officials expressed concern that GECAS, one of the world's top purchasers of aircraft, would promote
GE-Honeywell equipment to the detriment of competitors, which could lead to higher prices.

They pushed GE to spin off part of GECAS to independent investors to ensure greater discipline on GE without threatening its control of the unit. GE proposed a separate management for GECAS, but refused to consider selling a minority share.

Welch said that the two sides never came close to an agreement, and said the $2.2 billion in divestitures offer would stand.

"In this case, the European regulators' demands exceeded anything I or our European advisers imagined," he said, adding that the demands show "you are never too old to get surprised."

At a news conference, Monti said the merger had "raised strong concerns" among airlines on both side of the Atlantic, declining to name names. "This is not a trans-Atlantic dispute," he said. "There have been concerns expressed both by customers and competitors on both sides."

In the end, the Europeans' vote on Tuesday to block the deal was unanimous. Monti said the merger "would have severely reduced competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines."
GE said it was "deeply disappointed," but a spokesman said the company had not decided whether to appeal. In October, Welch acknowledged he was taking a risk by pursuing Honeywell.
"I could've gone home early and been a great hero," he said. "I'm betting everything, my reputation, that this makes GE a lot better and (shareholders') investment a lot stronger."

Divergent  Histories Helped to Scuttle  GE-Honeywell  Deal --- Competitors vs. Customers: Both EU, U.S.
Show Biases --- Could Augur a Hiatus for Megadeals

Antitrust cops in Europe and the U.S. work the same beat, but they don't always patrol the streets the same way.

That is clear from the attempted  merger of General Electric  Co. and Honeywell  International Inc.  European      regulators tend to worry first of all about whether a merger will hurt business competition. Their U.S. counterparts tend to focus on whether it will hurt consumers.

"The advance of consumer interests ... is fundamentally the underlying rule of all American antitrust statutes," Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told a Senate panel several days ago. "That's not true in Europe."

The European Commission Tuesday blocked the $43 billion GE-Honeywell proposed merger, leaving open the question of how regulators from similar free-market democracies arrived at such divergent views in the first place.

The answer lies in some powerful forces -- in the way war, peace and recovery have affected the political and economic development of the U.S. and Europe during the past 50 years. One area in which their paths have diverged since World War II is the care and feeding of the new economy emerging on both sides of the Atlantic. And while the views aren't radically different, their implications can be large.

In the proposed GE-Honeywell merger, European regulators worried about "bundling," or the potential for GE to use its clout to tie two core products into a single package -- jet engines and Honeywell avionics -- and sell it at a price lower than European competitors could match. The European Commission acknowledged that this might lead to lower prices for customers in the short and medium term. However, it also worried that it might erode profit margins for GE's competitors and affect competition in the aerospace industry in the long run. U.S. regulators approved the merger after seeking remedies in two areas where they found significant market overlaps, namely helicopter engines and maintenance.

With the GE-Honeywell merger all but dead, corporate executives and government officials are going to be focusing on whether these same kinds of disagreements could arise again. When the deal faltered in Europe, current and former U.S. officials from both parties lobbied the European Commission to change its mind.

The merger's troubled history in Europe also will probably leave a cloud over Wall Street's already-sleepy merger business. "It will slow merger activity down, particularly large deals where the players have reasonable market size," says Christopher Bright, an antitrust lawyer with Shearman & Sterling who has represented GE in its Honeywell merger.

Some prospective deals could be vulnerable. United Technologies Corp., the parent of aircraft maker Pratt & Whitney and the suitor for Honeywell before GE stepped in, is likely to renew its efforts to purchase the company. Also awaiting antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic is Nestle SA, which earlier this year unveiled plans to buy Ralston Purina Co. for $10.1 billion.

On the U.S. side, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, who heads the aviation subcommittee, has already begun making threats about blocking mergers sought by European companies. Other lawmakers are likely to board an anti-Europe bandwagon, especially if the U.S. fights with Europe over steel trade intensify. The Bush administration will be

Page 142 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
under increasing pressure to find a reason to block a merger European companies want, whether for national security or other rationales.

Some officials argue that, despite the views that separate the two sides, they have kept disputes to a minimum. "Our respective rules, while phrased in quite different language, and with very different historical antecedents, are, in most respects, pursuing the same objectives," Mario Monti, the European Commissioner in charge of
competition policy, said several days ago. Although there has never been "any attempt to harmonize these laws," he added, there has been a "marked convergence" in application of them in recent times.

Charles Stark, who recently left the U.S. Justice Department after heading its international antitrust division and now works for Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, a law firm that represented Honeywell, offers a sports analogy. The European Union's antitrust cops prefer a world that resembles the National Football League: many closely matched teams, battling year after year for dominance. U.S. regulators are comfortable with the New York Yankees model: a powerhouse dynasty free to use its might to acquire players and invest in team development -- provided the fans are still getting to see good baseball at a reasonable price.

European antitrust policy rose from the ashes of World War II. In its formative years, the policy was heavily influenced by the condition of the European continent in the war's aftermath, especially in Germany. Hoping to diminish the power of the industrial barons that had bankrolled the Nazi war machine, the U.S. pushed for West Germany to establish an antitrust policy to make sure that such industrial conglomerates couldn't gain the kind of power they had accumulated in the 1930s.

The German antitrust system, which became the bedrock of European antitrust thinking, had strict legal prohibitions against abuses of dominant position, but the German approach also held that competition was defined by the absence of restrictions on economic freedom. In practical terms, this meant antitrust policy should be geared toward keeping markets open and allowing as many competitors as possible, even if that reduced efficiency.

Then for a time Europe embraced a cartel-oriented line that departed from the maximum-competitors philosophy. The shift came as Europeans began to think of themselves as a single market rather than a collection of small ones. The Continent's leaders -- West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg -- also were looking to prevent another war by blocking any one country from controlling the means of war, which then were mainly coal and steel.
These and other key industries were to be organized along Europe-wide rather than national lines.
Trans-European cartel rules were set up in 1952. No central law emerged to check the spread of mergers
because there was a general belief that they "would be good for integration," says New York University antitrust
expert Eleanor Fox.

European countries promoted their so-called national champions through technology grants and government contracts. Aircraft maker Airbus was the exemplar, though at various times, Siemens of Germany, Renault of France and Philips of the Netherlands received such treatment. Eventually, policy makers came to see national champions in other areas -- computers, semiconductors, automobiles, aircraft, defense and other large industries
-- as a way to compete directly with giant companies in the U.S. and Japan.

By the late 1980s, however, European leaders had come to believe that these industrial giants had failed to produce economic growth and still lagged behind in competition with the U.S. and Japan. The new approach was to use antitrust policy to assure more competition, in the belief that this was the only way for Europe to stay healthy in global economic fights. Antitrust thinking moved back closer to its postwar roots.

"Today, the people in charge of antitrust policy are taking an aggressive position on competition because they believe in the bankruptcy of national champions," Harvard Business School Professor David Yoffie says. In short, European thinking became: Keep as many competitors as possible, and the economy will benefit.

In the U.S., antitrust thinking has evolved over a different and longer timeline. The policy began taking shape with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, though the power of that legislation wasn't really brought to bear until the trustbusting Theodore Roosevelt became president a decade later.

Early U.S. trustbusters weren't concerned so much with mergers but with something that is prominent in today's European worries: interlocking trusts, in which a single company can dominate not just one market niche but several. In Roosevelt's time, the interlocking trusts that roused the regulators were those that dominated railroads, harvesting machines and oil. "The concern was that big firms could steer customers to themselves, and win business not on the merit," says Prof. Fox of New York University.

Page 143 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Early in the century, the trust-busting impulse led the U.S. to go after Standard Oil, American Tobacco Co. and the DuPont empire. Over time, the impulse came to include proposed mergers. By the 1960s, antitrust policy sometimes was being used essentially to advance a social theory, that small businesses were better for the country than big businesses. "It was clearly social, rather than economic rationales," says James Rill, who ran the Justice Department antitrust enforcement in the first Bush administration.

However, by the 1970s, that version of American big-is-bad thinking was changing, as academics and intellectuals began arguing for a different approach. With the arrival of the Reagan administration in the 1980s, a new era of antitrust thought arrived, one that reflected a broad new American belief in the power of markets to make better decisions than social engineers or regulators.

Influenced heavily by conservative economic and legal thinkers mainly at the University of Chicago, the U.S. began to focus on the effect a merger would have on prices, innovation and product development, rather than the fate of the companies left to compete with the new entity. In short, the new approach placed less emphasis on market analysis and more on economic analysis. The focus became how a merger affected the consumer, not how it affected the competitive balance between business rivals.

While Europe and the U.S. have arrived at somewhat different intellectual points, this doesn't mean that there will be constant disagreements, or that the EU is simply against megamergers. It allowed the AOL-Time Warner merger, which took effect in January without any required remedies, despite many complaints from some competitors or would-be competitors. And it allowed the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp., which took effect in November 1998.

But concerns about competition can arise. In the Microsoft Corp.-Telewest Communications PLC case last year, the commission argued that by taking control of Telewest, Microsoft would be able to act in concert with Telewest's second major shareholder, AT&T Corp.'s Liberty Media, and coax Telewest into choosing Microsoft software for its cable set-top boxes. Left unrestricted, Microsoft's foray into digital television through joint control of Telewest "could have substantially reduced the technological alternatives available to customers and led to
potentially higher prices for households," the commission feared. In the end, Microsoft had to sever its contractual links with Liberty Media, preventing the software concern from exercising joint control over Telewest. U.S. regulators didn't scrutinize the deal.

It is too early to make judgments about whether the U.S. or European style of antitrust enforcement makes more sense for the modern economy. To the degree that European regulators protect local companies, and that protects the jobs of their workers, antitrust policy is one more strand of a social safety net that is badly frayed in the U.S. To the extent that the EU policy blocks megamergers -- or frightens companies from attempting such combinations -- it probably affects the U.S. and European economies equally because the companies involved are global concerns.

The imbroglio could have some positive effects. The dispute will put renewed emphasis on coming up with some common rules on antitrust enforcement, not just between the U.S. and Europe, but with the 60 or so nations that have merger controls. Indeed, says Gary Hufbauer, a trade economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., the dispute could give impetus to a new round of global trade talks, which could include competition policy.

And while the collapse of the GE-Honeywell merger will "probably deter any really big deals," says Robert Litan, a former Clinton antitrust official now at the Brookings Institution in Washington, "if we end up with a world with
fewer megacompanies, I'm not sure we're worse off."

GE-Honeywell  Collapse Rare Amid Flood of Global Mergers

Jack Welch and General Electric  Co. blew a tire on one of the few potholes on the global highway.

The collapse of the proposed  merger between GE and Honeywell  International Inc. has produced indignation, mostly in Washington, about differences between U.S. and European antitrust laws and the difficulty in setting up a major corporate merger that satisfies  regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
In fact, the GE-Honeywell breakdown is literally the exception that proves the rule.

Antitrust laws in the U.S. and the European Union indeed differ. But the application of those laws is getting closer every day. The result is an avalanche of U.S.-European corporate marriages. And almost all of them, with a rare exception like GE-Honeywell, go through without a hitch.

As globalization grows, so do transnational mergers and acquisitions. These cross-border marriages have been rising at an annual rate of 42 percent for the past 20 years. There were 24,000 transnational mergers and acquisitions in 1999--worth a total $2.3 trillion--and about 80 percent of them were between the United States and the European Union, according to Thomson Financial Securities.

Larger mergers have to be reported to officials, but only 10 percent of them get more than a cursory review, according to antitrust officials. Of those, about 1 percent are challenged by regulators.
Even then, almost all of them succeed, sometimes with changes in terms to make them more palatable. Regulators "are not hostile to business, not hostile to mergers," said Loyola University law professor Spencer
Waller. "They will help companies, so long as the companies cooperate."

"Globalization creates a pressure toward efficiency," said New York University Professor Eleanor Fox. "Does antitrust stand in the way? The answer is that it's less likely today on either side of the ocean."
The result, almost always, is a successful merger. High-profile mergers like AOL-Time Warner, and
Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, were scrutinized and debated but safely skirted the potholes to gain approval.

Microsoft Corp. agreed to revamp a deal to buy a stake in British cable company Telewest Communications PLC, allowing the plan to avoid further scrutiny from the European Commission. After lengthy negotiations with the commission, Microsoft agreed to give up rights that would allow it to influence decisions at Telewest, meaning its
$3 billion purchase of MediaOne's 23.7 percent stake would no longer formally give it joint control of the cable firm.

Indeed, the last failed merger collapsed a year ago, when WorldCom and Sprint couldn't overcome opposition from regulators in the U.S. and Europe and scrapped a $129 billion telecommunications deal.

Even mergers that take place within the borders of one country become the business of antitrust regulators around the globe. A merger of two big American aircraft companies, like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, can affect airplane purchasers worldwide.

Thus a major merger, like Exxon-Mobil, may have to be approved by antitrust regulators in up to 60 countries, wherever the companies' clout is felt. The merger of three big European communications firms--Vodafone, AirTouch Communications and Mannesmann--had to be approved by U.S. regulators.

In practice, U.S. and EU regulators are the main gatekeepers. They may be reading different music but, increasingly, they sing the same song.

"What's going on "is" convergence," according to Bernard Phillips, head of the Competition Law and Policy
Committee at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.

Phillips and other experts say with increased globalization there is growing pressure for uniform antitrust regulation, despite differences in laws, and regulators are happy to oblige.
Most regulators "have more in common with each other than with people in their own government," Waller said. They know each other well, and they talk daily by telephone or e-mail, coordinating their responses to challenges.
They also meet often--at OECD conferences, at annual seminars at Fordham University and in Sweden, at
conclaves sponsored by the American Bar Association. They also meet with officials of merging corporations and
their lawyers.

The upshot, according to experts, is a fraternity of regulators with an ideological bent toward successful mergers and a professional pride in making them go smoothly.

The main complaint of corporations now is the time and effort needed to notify regulators in dozens of countries. Regulators have begun to push for a more standardized notification.

Honeywell  may be safe from hostile  takeover attempts.
By Kristin Roberts

Reuters News

English
(c) 2001 Reuters Limited
NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) -  Honeywell  International Inc.'s new chief faces a bevy of challenges in rebuilding the company's financial position, but he may be safe from one - a hostile takeover attempt, analysts said.

Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Bossidy, named to the post on Tuesday, hours after  European Union regulators killed Honeywell's  planned $42 billion  merger with General Electric  Co. , was quick to say he intends to keep Honeywell  independent.

Bossidy said he intended to sell off assets that have performed poorly, retain and bring back the company's strongest employees and boost morale over his year-long stint.

And analysts say he may get a chance to do that, noting that Honeywell's would-be suitors may feel no rush to bid on the company.

"I don't think that anyone's going to challenge him that way," said Paul Nisbet, analyst at JSA Research, referring to Bossidy.
The most likely suitor, according to industry experts, is United Technologies Corp. , which had offered to buy
Honeywell last fall, before being trumped by GE.

But United Technologies, having reportedly played a large role in convincing European regulators to kill the proposed GE-Honeywell combination, knows very well the issues it would face in trying to acquire the company.
"There would be some similar issues they'd have to address," said Christopher Mecray, an analyst at Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown.

What's more, United Technologies likely feels no rush to do so, according to analysts who said the company's biggest concern was simply keeping Honeywell out of GE's hands, not actually owning Honeywell itself.
"There's no sense of urgency for United Technologies to act and strike a deal," said William Fiala, analyst at
Edward Jones. "I think they realize time may be on their side."

Shares of Honeywell, a component of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, climbed $1.64 to $36.55 on Thursday afternoon, after dropping over the last two weeks back to levels held before the GE merger was announced last fall.

United Technologies, also part of the Dow Jones average, fell 25 cents to $72.70, continuing a slide that began as Wall Street realized GE's proposed $42 billion combination with Honeywell was unlikely to receive European clearance.
SAME ISSUES

In blocking the deal, European regulators were largely concerned that the company could bundle its products and damage competitors. The combination, they noted, would allow GE to bundle the aircraft engines it makes with Honeywell's avionics. It would also be able to use GE's leasing arm, GE Capital Aviation Services, to help companies pay for the airplanes that use those products.

United Technologies would face some of the same concerns, analysts said, noting that Honeywell's avionics could just as easily be bundled and sold with engines made by United Technologies.

Page 147 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Pratt & Whitney, United Technologies' engine business, has a commercial engine leasing program as well, which could raise similar issues for European regulators as GE's GECAS operation.

Honeywell will likely begin reassessing its core operations and picking out which businesses should be shed, analysts said.

Before the GE deal was announced, Honeywell had planned to sell its friction materials business, which supplies automotive brake friction materials and aftermarket brake products. So it was no surprise that Bossidy named that operation as one likely to be divested.

Other consumer automotive operations may also be sold, analysts noted, saying the automotive parts and products industry has been hurt this year by soft demand in a weak economic environment.

Honeywell's auto consumer products group makes and markets products such as Autolite spark plugs, Prestone antifreeze and car care products - all of which may be targeted.

The one operation Bossidy highlighted as core to Honeywell's operations was the aerospace business, which makes auxiliary power units, such as turbofan, turboprop and turboshaft propulsion engines, along with ground power systems and engine systems.

The aerospace division also makes commercial avionics, including flight control systems and enhanced ground proximity warning systems. The aerospace electronics systems operation provides avionics for military aircraft and defense and space systems.

"We've got the best aerospace business in the world," Bossidy said this week, after Honeywell announced his appointment. "That continues to be the centerpiece of what we're going to try to develop and grow further."

US has no grounds for complaint over GE-Honeywell  veto
CHRISTOPHER HUHNE

THE EU Commission's decision to block the  General Electric merger with Honeywell  is controversial, but right. It takes some chutzpah to veto the world's largest industrial takeover - at a bid price of $43 billion - let alone when it is between two companies based in the United States.

Predictably, US politicians - notably Senator John D Rockefeller IV, the chairman of the Senate's aviation subcommittee and the quick-shooting Texan Senator Phil Gramm - have gone ballistic.

The Commission's veto is only the second prohibition of a merger between US companies, but the first - MCI WorldCom-Sprint - was also banned by the US competition authorities. So this veto is the first occasion that the Commission has blocked a US-approved merger.

The reason the Commission can extend its reach in such a a dramatic way is simple: GE and Honeywell operate in Europe on a vast scale, employing nearly 100,000 people. They are subject to the laws of the European Union in competition matters, just as they are subject to the tax jurisdiction of each country in which they operate.

It would, though, be regrettable if this decision were to sour transatlantic relations or politicise merger control. There is no reason to believe that the Commission in any way took account of the nationality of the companies involved.

The American politicians who are shooting their mouths off ignore the inconvenient fact that the US competition authorities also reach beyond their own borders.

The US Justice Department has blocked a merger between European companies - in the case of the Air Liquide bid for BOC - even though the Commission approved it. There was no hue and cry on this side of the water.

Nor are the Commission's concerns eccentric. There was no fundamental divergence of view with the US Justice Department under Joel Klein, though President Bush's Chicago-influenced appointees may be more relaxed about approving big mergers.

It is not true that the Commission ignores consumers and worries about competitors: it recently approved the merger of the second and third-biggest German bus makers, believing two big companies would compete more fiercely than one market leader and two small followers.

The charge of anti-US discrimination simply does not stack up. Over the 11 years in which the Commission has been reviewing mergers, it has looked at 1650 cases, of which 24% involved US companies.

Some 22% of the 73 cases which were aborted or withdrawn involved US companies. Only two US cases were prohibited out of a total of 15, a proportion of 13%.
If anything, US companies seem to have got off more lightly than their EU counterparts. Takeover Directive blow
YESTERDAY'S loss of the Takeover Directive is deeply disappointing. We need a level playing field in corporate control across Europe. Minority shareholders should be treated equitably. But the closeness of the vote in the European Parliament - a tie of 273 votes each way, leading to a rejection - may now encourage the EU Commission to think of other ways of dealing with the same problem.

Without a European framework putting limits on "poison pills" - the ability of managements to issue shares to friendly companies or sell key assets without shareholder approval - the restructuring of European business unleashed by the euro may be impeded by national measures. This is a key part of the Lisbon economic reform agenda.

However, all is not lost. When the Parliament has voted against a compromise with the Council of Ministers in the past, the Commission has been able to put forward a new and similar proposal, with some amendments to sooth the antagonists.
Commissioner Frits Bolkestein is keeping his options open, but I would not be surprised to see the same strategy. If so, he needs to move quickly before the change of heart in German boardrooms - and in the Italian
government, which did not want a French, State-owned utility taking over Italian companies - spreads.

Ironically, the most pro-European countries when it comes to political integration - Germany and Italy - seem to be the least prepared to see foreign companies take over their own.

The controversy over the  European Commission's attitude to the proposed merger of GE and Honeywell  has highlighted political and highly technical differences in the way the regulatory authorities in both regions, react to corporate consolidation. The upshot could be to drive even more US investors out of  European equities
By Chris Johns

A lot of US investors are clearly growing disenchanted with Europe. This is in stark contrast to only last year. Why the change in sentiment? From a dollar base it is clear that the euro has hurt a lot of investors, not just US companies. American institutions are mystified by the dollar's strength - they see cyclical domestic economic weakness and an appreciating currency as a paradox that is tough to resolve. But negative attitudes towards Europe have not been driven entirely by the euro. The currency is merely symptomatic of a much deeper malaise. It really is all about structural change. Or lack of it. During cyclical downturns it is hard to get bullish about structural change. (Ask the Japanese.) Introducing structural reforms is always politically difficult as they always involve somebody taking some pain.

Governments find it as hard to reform their spending habits as they do to implement changes that allow labour markets to operate as real markets should. Germany's structural list of problems include a dysfunctional labour market (they still talk about the wage round!), persistent backsliding over pension reform, (hence no equity culture), lack of a service sector, over-regulation, cross shareholdings (that may or may not be unwound) and abysmal demographics. It is no wonder that many people are starting to draw parallels with the paralysis that has gripped Japan over the past decade. During the good years of the second half of the 1990s, Europe promised much structural change but has delivered little.

The latest development to increase US disenchantment with things European has been the row over the GE - Honeywell proposed merger. It has been absolutely fascinating to watch how the debate has developed on both sides of the Atlantic. This has been a classic dialogue of the deaf. There have been two levels to the debate, one political, and therefore easy to understand. The other, more technical, has received less publicity but is of even greater importance for understanding why there is such a huge gulf between the sides.
The political dimension is transparently clear. US critics of the EU (Commission) see a classic 'anti-US' (or even
'anti-market') philosophy holding sway with a group of people who have little understanding of how modern
financial and product markets are supposed to operate. On this line of thinking, the EU's hostility toward the
merger is entirely political and motivated by antagonism towards the US in particular, and 'Anglo-Saxon
capitalism' in general. While this description might be somewhat caricatured, it is a reasonably accurate account
of some of the views that we see in the media and as expressed by some institutional investors. But the
arguments run much deeper than this.

US officials are steeped in the theory and practice of anti-trust legislation, an arcane branch of law and economics. They fully understand the arguments put forward by the Commission. For example, Hal Varian, a prominent US economist, has written extensively (and prominently, in the NY Times, for example) about the way in which the Commission has inappropriately used the analysis of a well-known French economist, Antoine Cournot, to justify blocking the proposed merger. The fact that M. Cournot has been dead for 124 years is referred to, slightly scathingly, by Professor Varian; but that is not the main reason for criticising the EU. It's a bit dry, but it is worth briefly delving into all of this to get an understanding of the fundamental gap between the US and Europe on this issue.
The relevant bit of Cournot's analysis is all about the strategic interaction between firms that produce
'complementary products'. GE and Honeywell are classic examples: one produces aircraft engines, the other
produces landing gear, navigation kit and communications parts. If a company supplies complementary products
in a highly competitive market, this is bad for profits (competition usually is); but merging is not necessarily a profit

booster either in theory or practice. But GE and Honeywell are not in super-competitive markets. Cournot's insight, somewhat counter intuitively perhaps, is that if two such companies merge, profits are indeed higher, but prices charged to consumers are lower; a classic win-win situation. This is where it gets interesting.

The Commission acknowledged this 'Cournot effect' but fretted over the fact that the lower prices charged to consumers would hurt other firms competing in the same industries. This is what annoys the Americans: they argue that the EU is more concerned with the interests of 'national champions' (the 'other firms') than with the interests of consumers. The bottom line, according to commentators such as Varian, is that US anti-trust regulators look for benefits to consumers before ruling on a merger while EU regulators are more concerned with the consequences for national champions. The EU might argue that this is a bit rich, coming from a country not averse to promoting its own interests; but the Americans do seem to have a strong case in this particular instance.

This is the real US view: the EU doesn't understand how to regulate modern market structures. More importantly, it is believed, in some quarters, that the EU doesn't want to understand. Whether or not this is completely true, or fair, is beside the point. On this reading of US attitudes, the chances of the US re-discovering an appetite for
euro-zone equities are slim. Cross-border consolidation is the only thing that will change their minds.

EU Commission Blocks  $40 Billion GE-Honeywell Merger
365 words
5 July 2001

Lockheed Martin [LMT]: Raytheon [RTN]:
English
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc.
The European Union (EU) on Tuesday as expected formally blocked the potential $40 billion  merger between
General Electric  [GE] and Honeywell  [HON].

"The merger between GE and Honeywell,  as it was notified, would have severely reduced  competition in the aerospace industry and resulted ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines," EuropeanCompetitionCommissioner Mario Monti said in a statement.

Monti acknowledged that there were opportunities to resolve the competition dilemmas presented by the pending merger, but that an adequate solution could not be agreed upon.

"There were ways of eliminating these concerns and allowing the merger to proceed," he said. "I regret that the companies were not able to agree on a solution that would have met the Commission's competition concerns."

The two companies offered their merger for regulatory clearance in Europe on Feb. 5, and the EU's Commission commenced a detailed investigation into the matter on March 1. In the end, given the leading status in various markets of both GE and Honeywell, a merger of the two would create dominant positions in the "markets for the supply of avionics, non-avionics and corporate jet engines, as well as to the strengthening of GE's existing dominant positions in jet engines for large commercial and large regional jets," the Commission said.

The Commission cited the horizontal overlap in some markets, the broadening of GE's financial power and vertical integration to Honeywell endeavors and the combination of the companies' complementary products as means by which the merged companies could have restricted competition. GE formulated two sets of plans to revise the agreement in an attempt to meet the EU demands in June, but the Commission rejected both proposals.

Tuesday's decision marks the 15th occasion since September 1990 that the EC has prohibited a merger, but only the second time that such a decision has included American firms.

Also significant in the decision is the difference of opinion demonstrated by the Commission and the Department of Justice, which approved the deal May 3. Justice had directed the new company divest Honeywell's helicopter engine unit to avoid antitrust issues (Defense Daily, May 4).

City - Honeywell  ex-chairman back from retirement.

HONEYWELL has brought back former chairman Lawrence Bossidy from retirement to run the engineering and electronics conglomerate after its failed $42 billion ( #30 billion)  merger with General Electric.

The 66-year-old replaces Michael Bonsignore, 60, who retired on Tuesday, hours after the  European                   Commission ended his plans for the world's biggest takeover by formally blocking the deal.

Mr Bossidy, who expects to be in the job for a year, said: "The idea is to stay independent now, to get the company back on its feet, to get the people re-engaged."

However, he did not rule out the possibility of a future merger. "Obviously at some point in the future the company may have to consider it again."
His arrival was marked by a profits warning from Honeywell, which said second-quarter earnings would be about
10pc less than expected. In addition, the company said it faced as much as $625m in merger costs, legal and
environmental costs, and customer settlements.

Mr Bossidy, a former GE executive whose mother persuaded him to turn down a career as a professional baseball player, ran engineering group AlliedSignal until it merged with Honeywell in 1999. AlliedSignal took the name Honeywell and Mr Bossidy retained the chairmanship until April 2000.

Analysts said the appointment of Mr Bossidy reduces the chance of a legal battle between GE and Honeywell over the collapse of the merger. Mr Bossidy is close to GE chief Jack Welch and advised him informally on the planned merger.

EU rejection of merger marks a blow to Bush ; More friction with Europe called likely

WASHINGTON - The  European Union's decision to block  General Electric's  purchase of  Honeywell  is a
setback for one of President Bush's early economic priorities - setting a better tone for trade relations with  Europe.

Analysts said that  Europe's numerous critics in Congress were likely to add this development to a long list of grievances they hold against America's biggest economic competitor.

"Because this case is ending unhappily, there could be recriminations of various kinds," said Gary Hufbauer, trade expert at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.

Even before the formal veto announcement, various members of Congress were asking why the EU felt the need to block a deal that had received the blessing of American regulators.

Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., has warned that his aviation subcommittee may begin looking into various mergers sought by European companies.

Rockefeller has also been a vocal critic of sales by foreign steelmakers in the United States at what the U.S. industry considers unfairly low prices.

Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, normally one of the leading proponents of free trade in Congress, recently complained about the EU's expected rejection of the GE-Honeywell action.

"My concern is that we don't have bad policies imposed on us as Europeans try to protect themselves from competition," said Gramm, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which has oversight over mergers in the financial sector.
One pending deal that could face additional scrutiny is the Swiss company Nestle's $10.1 billion purchase of the
American Ralston Purina Co.

The Bush administration took office with a goal of reducing tensions about such issues as Europe's ban on American beef produced with growth hormones and barriers to sales by American banana companies. Europe had lost both cases before the World Trade Organization.

Just last weekend, the administration announced with fanfare that it was lifting punitive tariffs imposed in the banana case, hoping to build momentum for the resolution of other disputes.
But the WTO dealt the United States a major blow with a preliminary ruling that $4 billion in tax breaks for
American exporters violate global trade rules.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has warned that imposition of such a huge sanction would be the equivalent of a setting off a nuclear bomb in the trade world.
But even before the GE case, many experts wondered how a solution could be found short of sanctions.

But a senior Treasury Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted that the EU decision would not cast a pall on economic talks on Sunday in Rome between U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and his counterparts from Japan, Canada and the major European economic powers.

The United States goes into those meetings already concerned that Europe is not doing enough to boost world economic growth.

While the White House refused comment on the GE decision, Charles James, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement, "Clear and long-standing U.S. antitrust policy holds that antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors. Today's EU decision reflects a significant point of divergence."

Blame the EU's Antitrust Rules -- Not Monti
By Brian M. Carney
958 words
6 July 2001
The Wall Street Journal

BRUSSELS -- Mario  Monti is an unlikely villain. Soft-spoken and reserved, he betrays no desire for the limelight. But under Mr.  Monti's tenure as the  European Union's competition commissioner, he and his merger task force have become the most prominent symbols of the rising importance of something called "Europe."

Most recently, Mr.  Monti raised a ruckus with a decision to block the $42 billion merger of General Electric  and Honeywell,  the first time the EU has shot down a U.S.  merger approved  by U.S. regulators. On Wednesday, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, Charles James, lambasted the decision, saying that it marked a "significant divergence." Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went further, calling the  commission's decision "off the wall."

This divergence is often put down to an American emphasis on the consumer and a European preoccupation with protecting competitors. This is right, but it is more a description than an explanation of the problem. The causes, rather, are deeply embedded in the laws that govern European antitrust enforcement. These laws were not
written by Mr. Monti, nor can he change them. But the EU's member states can, and it is to them that Mr. O'Neill should direct his call for reform.

After Mr. Monti announced the European Union's rejection of the GE-Honeywell merger, he expressed his determination "to strengthen bilateral cooperation" to reduce the risk that regulators would disagree in the future. Mr. James echoed this call for cooperation.

This is a noble goal, and one that shows that the famously independent Mr. Monti is aware of the political dimension of his department's decisions. But if Mr. Monti is serious about eliminating the disparity, it will take more than improved communication.

The regulation that lays down the law Mr. Monti must interpret and follow states that the commission "shall take into account . . . . the interests of the intermediate and ultimate consumers." So far, so good. But the law goes on to state that a merger that "creates or strengthens a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded" should be rejected (emphasis added).

Those two words -- "dominant position" -- are at the heart of the difference between EU and U.S. merger regulation. With them, the EU has adopted an approach to merger regulation that concerns itself as much with the outcome of competition as with the rules by which it is played.

Of course, even the commission won't go so far as to say that something is wrong with having achieved a position of dominance in an industry. Indeed, dominance often indicates that a company is exceptionally well run, or has a lower cost structure than its competitors, or is providing added value that customers want.

But, as Mr. Monti has explained, dominance increases the opportunity and therefore the probability that abuses will result. So the commission views success as dangerous, and tries to prevent any one company from getting out of hand by blocking mergers or imposing severe restrictions.

Take mobile-phone operator Vodafone, which last year received the green light to buy Mannesmann, an industrial giant that Vodafone bought mostly for its mobile-phone network assets. The price of success was that Vodafone was forbidden to provide its customers discounts on roaming charges that weren't also extended to competitors' customers.



Page 160 of 163 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
This prevents Vodafone from taking full advantage of the assets it has acquired, and amounts to a redistribution of wealth from Vodafone to its smaller European competitors. The three-year limit is designed to allow others to "catch up." When everyone is equal, they'll be allowed to "compete" again.

But in a free market companies are rarely equally matched, and when they are they don't stay so for long. So Mr. Monti's merger task force has replaced the free market with a managed one, in which the commission accords itself the wisdom of knowing how many competitors a given market ought to have, what percentage of market share is "dangerous" and so on.

The commission is not so presumptuous as to simply hand down Delphic pronouncements. The merger task force conducts careful and detailed economic analyses and gathers evidence in support of its theories. The problem is that these theories, which attempt to determine the appropriate structure of a market, are the equivalent of central planning. Central planning doesn't work because it always lacks at least some of the information that the market
is constantly uncovering through, for example, responses to price changes or technological advances.

The most obvious way of climbing down from its role as central planner is for the EU to stick to pursuing actual violations of the law. This change can be codified by eliminating parts of the regulation that require the use of the "dominant position" standard in evaluating mergers, and retaining only consumer-harm language.

Although still some way off, this is not quite a pipe dream. Within the Council of Ministers, sources close to the matter say that there is support from the U.K., Ireland and Mr. Monti's Italy for revising these standards. That is already a substantial start, and once the issue is on the agenda, others may also see the light.

If a change can be effected, there is hope that the commission will be forced to move from a standard that punishes success to one that merely requires companies not to break law. This may help head off the brewing dispute over the disparity between U.S. and EU antitrust enforcement. It is an idea whose time has come.

Brown faces U.S. fury as Pounds 32bn deal is blocked

GORDON Brown faces angry protests from the U.S. tomorrow over the  EU's decision to block a  merger of two
American firms that would have created the world's biggest company.

Washington is furious that Brussels has refused to approve the planned Pounds 32billion deal between plane engine maker General Electric  and aerospace giant Honeywell  International Mario  Monti, the European           competition commissioner nick-From named 'Super Mario', ruled that the  merger would 'have severely
reduced competition in the aerospace industry'.
It would result 'ultimately in higher prices for customers, particularly airlines,' he added.
But the U.S. Government condemned the decision as 'unjustified meddling' by the European Union.
A senior U.S. Treasury official said the issue will be raised tomorrow when the G-7 finance ministers, including Mr
Brown, gather in Rome.

Given the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain, the Chancellor is expected to be a target for protests by U.S. officials.

The EU has a right to intervene in because the companies trade in Europe just as European firms doing business in America have to abide by U.S.
antitrust laws.
But this was the first time a proposed merger between two U.S. companies has been quashed solely by European regulators. U.S.
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said: 'The EU decision is right off the wall.' He claimed European antitrust enforcers were 'autocratic' and complained there was no effective judicial recourse.

Senator Ernest Hollings accused the commission of 'using its merger-review process as a tool to protect and promote European industry at the expense of U.S.
competitors.' The U.S. approved the GE-Honeywell merger last May.

U.S. Assistant Attorney General Charles James said: 'Our conclusion was based on findings, confirmed by customers worldwide that the combined firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices than either firm could offer individually.' It is the latest transatlantic row following the outcry at President Bush's abandonment of the Kyoto global warming treaty and protests over the death penalty in America.

US Treasury Secretary, Italy's Tremonti  meet before G7 summit

ROME, July 6 (AFP) - Giulio Tremonti, the Italian Economy and Finance Minister, met US Treasury Secretary
Paul O'Neill on Friday, on the eve of the one-day pow-wow of G7 finance ministers here.

Officially, the two men did not speak about the recent decision by the EU Commission to block the proposed mega-merger of US industrial giants  General Electric  and Honeywell.  And the meeting at the Italian Economy Ministry was described as "courteous".
But a US Treasury sherpa was quoted by Italian news agency Radiocor as saying that the issue was too
important for the US to be ignored at the Rome summit, which was officially expected to focus on themes such as
the global economic slowdown, abuses of the global financial system and debt of the world's poorest countries.

Italian sources said that the GE-Honeywell issue could therefore effectively become an item on the agenda of talks to be held in the Villa Madama on the outskirts of Rome on Saturday.

The Italian Economy Ministry described the meeting between Tremonti and O'Neill as "very satisfactory". The two men "generally discussed problems of global growth," the ministry said.

The Italian ministry then met with his Japanese counterpart, Masajuro Shiokawa, and was also scheduled to meet with Russian Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin, also among the participants.

A scheduled tete-a-tete between Tremonti, Eurogroup president and Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders and EU Commissioner Pedro Solbes had been cancelled owing to transport problems the latter had encountered due to a strike in the Italian aerospace sector.

Italy is currently holding the presidency of the Group of Seven most industrial countries, which are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.
