German TV Scene To Change With Or Without  Pay-TV Merger

BONN (Dow Jones)--Germany's television landscape looks set to change regardless of whether the  European
Union Commission backs or rejects the pay-TV merger of  Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT) and Kirch Group (G.KCH).

A last round of talks between company executives and E.U. competition officials is underway in Brussels on Tuesday, and it remains uncertain how, or even if, commissioners will reach agreement on the matter at their meeting Wednesday.

If Bertelsmann and Kirch's arguments are persuasive, the merger and joint-marketing of their pay-TV activities will give them an unrivaled position in the German digital TV market. If they fail, both companies will have a lot of thinking to do.

Kirch recently warned that a veto from Brussels would force it to pull the plug on its existing pay-TV service, DF1. Without a merger with Premiere, jointly owned by Kirch and Bertelsmann, Kirch Managing Director Peter Halm warned a month ago, DF1 "has no hope of staying alive."

Leo Kirch, eponym and owner of the Kirch Group, would be hard hit if this happened. Not only would he be left with thousands of his "d-box" digital decoders, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop; he would also be left with a mountain of programming bought for DF1 at great expense in 1996.

While the closely-held Kirch is secretive about its account books, reports the company is in financial trouble have made the rounds repeatedly over the past year.

Van Miert/Kirch/Bertelsmann -2: Criticizes Companies  >G.BRT

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The  European Union's top competition official refused to forecast Tuesday whether the E.U.  Commission will block the digital television joint venture of Germany's Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG.

Speaking before the  European Parliament's Economics  Commission, E.U. Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said: "We'll have to wait and see" what transpires over the next few days. The 20-member E.U. Commission is expected to discuss the Kirch/Bertelsmann venture Wednesday.

Van Miert also castigated the Germany companies for waiting until the last minute before considering serious proposals that might allay the Commission's competition concerns.
He also said the Commission wouldn't be at fault if Kirch and Bertelsmann fail to gain clearance of the venture. "I
can't help it if the two main players are at loggerheads," said Van Miert, without elaborating.

Van Miert said the development of digital television in Germany, and in Europe generally, would "work much better based on a competitive framework and not a dominant position."

Van Miert's comments follow a meeting Monday of national E.U. competition experts who agreed by a vote of
14:1 that the  Commission should block the venture. Luxembourg - the home of  Bertelsmann television unit
CLT-Ufa SA - was the lone dissenter.

E.U. sources told the Wall Street Journal  Europe that Kirch and  Bertelsmann officials would be in contact with the Commission Tuesday in a last-ditch attempt to gain approval.

At the European Parliament, Van Miert made reference to other European digital TV ventures to suggest ways in which the Germany companies might have broken the impasse with the Commission.

He noted in particular the British Interactive Broadcasting venture between British Telecommunications PLC (BTY) and British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (BSY), which is well on the way toward Commission approval.


British Telecom announced last week it was willing to fulfill
Commission demands for third party access to the BIB-subsidized set-top boxes and related software; and for the sale of cable television franchises in Westminster and Milton Keynes.

Tuesday's announcement that  Deutsche Telekom will unbundle its broad-band cable business sparked speculation that the move was a concession to the European Union Commission for the proposed digital television alliance between Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (B.BRT).

Kirch and Bertelsmann want to pool their resources to create a digital TV platform out of Premiere, a German analog Pay-TV channel in which both share a financial and operations interest.

And since Deutsche Telekom dominates the cable network market throughout Germany, it would be seen as exclusive distributor of the digital TV platform, sources said.

A spokesman for Telekom, however, said Tuesday's announcement isn't related to the E.U.'s pending decision on the Kirch-Bertelsmann alliance.

A last round of talks between company executives and E.U. competition officials is underway in Brussels Tuesday, and it remains uncertain how, or even if, commissioners will reach agreement on the matter at their meeting Wednesday.

"This resolution has nothing to do with the E.U. Commission decision" on Kirch-Bertelsmann, the spokesman said. "Our plans to unbundle the cable business in this manner were announced back in November, and this is just a further step in the restructuring."


Late last November, Telekom said it would spin off its cable television business into a newly structured unit, paving the way for possible new business partners.

EU Commission Is Set For Talks on TV Plan --- Move Anticipates Decision  Against  Joint Venture Of Kirch,
Bertelsmann

BRUSSELS -- The European Commission is expected to hold talks today with Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG in a last-ditch bid to head off a European Union ruling against the companies' planned pay-television venture in Germany, according to people familiar with the case.
The talks come as divisions have surfaced within the  commission over EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert's call
for the alliance involving Kirch,  Bertelsmann's TV unit CLT-Ufa and Deutsche Telekom AG to be blocked unless
the companies offer further changes to guarantee competition in the German digital-TV market. The discord
increased the pressure on Mr. Van Miert to reach a negotiated settlement.
At the same time, however, the commissioner's hard-line stance was backed Monday by an advisory committee
of competition officials from EU countries. The committee voted 14-1 in favor of Mr. Van Miert's recommendation,
with only Luxembourg opposed, according to people familiar with the matter.

While the panel's vote isn't binding, it gives Mr. Van Miert additional ammunition in negotiations with the companies as well as with other commissioners, some of whom fear that a negative decision would stymie Germany's nascent digital-TV market.

Martine Reicherts, the commission's spokeswoman, signaled the depth of these doubts when she raised the possibility that Mr. Van Miert might not get the majority needed among the 20-member commission to veto the TV linkup. "It is difficult to say at this stage what the decision will be. The (draft decision) requires a majority of 11 votes and it risks being contested," Ms. Reicherts said. Mr. Van Miert is "but one of 20 commissioners," she added.

Ms. Reicherts said the planned TV alliance raises issues of "industrial policy" and "cultural policy," not just competition.

The commission is due to rule on the case at its weekly meeting Wednesday, although Ms. Reicherts and others said the decision could be delayed for a week. The final deadline for an EU ruling is June 3. Ms. Reicherts said the lobbying ahead of the commission's decision has been "intense."

Executives from Kirch and Bertelsmann are scheduled to meet commission competition officials today, according to people familiar with the case, but the companies insisted that they would make no further offers to counter the concerns raised by Mr. Van Miert.

"The economic viability of the venture is questionable already," said Bertelsmann spokesman Helmuth Runde. "Further concessions would take away the economic basis altogether." Kirch officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Insiders said, however, that the companies are bracing themselves for a rejection from the commission.

Although Ms. Reicherts declined to elaborate on the positions of individual commissioners, people familiar with the situation said Mr. Van Miert's stance is strongly opposed by Commission President Jacques Santer, Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Culture Commissioner Marcelino Oreja. Moreover, Regional Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies, Research Commissioner Edith Cresson and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy also are likely to express doubts about blocking the venture, these people added.

Commission officials were uncertain about whether Mr. Van Miert's opponents -- who alone don't have enough votes to overrule the competition commissioner -- would be able to garner more strength. Of key importance could be the stance taken by Mr. Santer, who is from Luxembourg -- where CLT-Ufa is based and boasts as chairman of its board of directors a former commission president, Gaston Thorn.

Politically, "it would be hard for Mr. Van Miert to act against the views of both German commissioners and both French commissioners," said a commission official who asked not to be identified. "There's a lot of pressure on him to reach a compromise."

Others, however, pointed out that the commissioner's view on a merger case has been rejected by his colleagues only once before -- in 1994, when the commission cleared a steel merger between Mannesmann of Germany, Vallourec of France and Ilva of Italy. Moreover, the German TV alliance has been criticized by the German federal cartel office, private cable operators in Germany and Austria, and German public broadcasters. Mr. Van Miert's "economic arguments are very solid. The companies would be creating a monopoly," another commission official said.

The stakes in the commission verdict are high for all those involved. Already, Kirch and Bertelsmannn say, the delay due to the extended inquiry into the planned merger has cost them more than 100 million marks ($56.9 million). Both companies have spent years to develop a plan to build a digital-TV market in Germany. Both jointly own Premiere, an analog pay-TV channel whose future would be made uncertain by a veto from the commission. In future attempts to build a pay-TV business, both would have to contend with consumer skepticism rife after years of haggling and uncertainty.

A prohibition from the EU also would mark a setback for German telephone titan Deutsche Telekom, which is hoping that its agreement with Kirch and Bertelsmann will help turn around its unprofitable cable business. Along with Kirch and Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom has offered to open up Beta Research, a Kirch subsidiary
charged with the marketing of digital decoder boxes, to outside partners. In the original merger proposal, the three groups would have split ownership of Beta Research among themselves. After fresh concessions from Deutsche Telekom last week, commission officials said that this part of the merger was "all but clearable."

But it is Leo Kirch, owner and founder of the Kirch Group, who would be hit the hardest if the deal fell apart. Mr. Kirch has spent billions of dollars to build his own digital platform, DF-1, which was supposed to be merged with Premiere. In case of an EU veto, DF-1 would be shut down. But Mr. Kirch would be left with vast programming supplies that he amassed at huge expense to air on DF-1 and Premiere. Without the merger, Mr. Kirch could still sell the bulk of these programs to Premiere. But it is unclear whether he could sell all of them and whether Premiere would pay the high prices that Mr. Kirch paid for the rights in 1996.

THE CURRENT  BERTELSMANN-KIRCH PROJECT REJECTED BY VAN MIERT AND FOURTEEN MEMBER STATES, BUT "THE LINE OF NEGOTIATIONS HAS NOT BEEN CUT OFF".

Brussels, 26/05/1998 (Agence  Europe) - The planned Bertelsmann-Kirch alliance is regarded as incompatible with the rules of competition by fourteen Member States (all except Luxembourg) within the Mergers Advisory Committee and Karel Van Miert may rest his negative opinion, in  Commission on Wednesday, on this opinion. However, circles close to the Commissioner stress that "the line of negotiations has not been cut off", which means that there may still be arrangements by the deadline of 2 June, if the companies make further concessions. Wednesday's  Commission meeting will not therefore be decisive.

Conditional Yes To German TV Alliance  Seen As Worst Outcome
530 words

Dow Jones News Service

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--A senior source within the alliance of companies hoping to launch a digital TV platform in Germany said late Tuesday conditional approval for the deal would be 'the worst of all results.'

'If the  European Commission approves the deal but insists on concessions then the alliance (between Luxembourg-based broadcaster CLT-UFA (L.CLT), German TV company Kirch Group (G.KCH) and German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom (DT)) will be a new deal, not the one we planned,' the source told Dow Jones on condition of anonymity.
'We can't accept major deviations from what we initially proposed,' he said.

The source was present at a meeting with competition commissioner Karel Van Miert Tuesday, at which the alliance didn't table any new concessions, he said.

'We want a result as soon as possible,' the source said. 'A 'yes' vote by the commissioners would be the best result, but a 'no' would be better than a 'yes but',' he said.
'We're not going to sign a deal we don't like. We have a responsibility for the future of CLT-UFA and Premiere
(the pay-TV joint venture jointly owned by Kirch and CLT-UFA). We should never accept a deal that won't fly.'

Van Miert insists on four key concessions from the alliance, in order to allay his fears that the deal would distort competition in the German TV industry, the source said.

One demand is that the alliance shares fully its list of subscribers to the proposed digital TV platform the companies plan to launch under the Premiere brand name, he said.

'We can't accept this, it would be a major deviation from what we initially proposed,' the source said, refusing to reveal the other three concessions.

The source said that after meeting with Van Miert, he wouldn't want to guess which way the Commission will vote, but he said he hopes they decide 'sooner rather than later.'
The Commission has set a deadline of June 3 for a conclusion to the case. However, the 20 commissioners meet
Wednesday to debate it, and a final vote may come out of this meeting.

'If they vote 'yes' to the alliance then there will be a lot of work to do to build the digital platform. If the vote is 'no' then it will be followed by a lot of negotiations,' the source within the alliance said.

Those negotiations might entail Kirch selling its loss-making digital prototype DF-1, which hasn't managed to exceed 100,000 subscribers since its launch in 1996, said media analyst at J.P. Morgan, Nick Bertolotti.

'A no vote might be the best outcome for CLT-UFA, because it would push Kirch to close DF-1, giving Premiere a monopoly position in German pay-TV,' Bertolotti said.
CLT-UFA has a 37.5% stake in Premiere, with an option to increase its stake to 50%. Kirch owns the remaining
62.5% in Premiere, having bought French pay-TV company Canal Plus' 37.5% stake last year.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  European regulators Wednesday unanimously rejected the proposed digital-television venture between German media companies Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG amid concerns over competition.

European Union antitrust chief Karel Ven Miert said the 20-member EUCommission reached its decision after Bertelsmann rejected a compromise aimed at guaranteeing competition in the German digital-TV market. Kirch and Deutsche Telekom AG, which also was involved in the proposed venture, had verbally agreed to the compromise.

Van Miert also said the commission denied Kirch's request for another day to try to reach a deal with Bertelsmann. Although the official deadline for a decision on the venture was June 3, Van Miert said commission members didn't see the point of delaying their decision since "Bertelsmann clearly confirmed in writing this morning that there was no possibility" of a compromise.

Bertelsmann, which is in a stronger position than Kirch to weather the decision, said it was "disappointed, but not surprised."

Under the proposed alliance, Kirch and CLT-Ufa - which combines the television interests of Luxembourg broadcaster CLT SA and Bertelsmann - planned to merge their digital TV business and jointly market digital television in Germany using the "d-box" developed by Kirch as their standard decoder for digital TV. They planned to jointly bring key sports and film-broadcasting rights to the alliance and distribute the service via Deutsche Telekom's cable network.

Under the venture, CLT-Ufa and Kirch would take joint control of Premiere, Germany's leading pay-TV channel. Kirch would have merged its existing digital pay-TV service, DF1, into Premiere.

Digital television promises a huge number of channels along with superior picture and sound quality. The commission's view was that in the nascent digital market, the same groups shouldn't control both access to the channels and program content - in particular films and sports rights, which are likely to be the most popular digital offerings.

The EU Commission last week ordered that third-party broadcasters be allowed to market their programs jointly without restrictions on Bertelsmann's Premiere channel, according to the German weekly magazine Focus. But the magazine quoted Bertelsmann executive board member Michael Dornemann as saying that proposal "would destroy our competitive position."

A proposal from Kirch and Bertelsman to drop Telekom from the deal didn't impress Brussels. Bertelsmann steadfastly opposed further concessions, saying the project in its current form is already on the brink of being no longer viable financially.
Van Miert declined to speculate on how the commission's decision might affect the development of digital TV in
Germany and in the EU generally.

"If the deal doesn't go ahead, that opens up other possibilities," he said, without being more specific. "But it is not up to the commission to favor one or another of these possibilities. That's up to the parties concerned and the market."

Kirch recently warned that a veto from Brussels would force it to pull the plug on its existing pay-TV service, DF1. Without a merger with Premiere, jointly owned by Kirch and Bertelsmann, Kirch Managing Director Peter Halm warned a month ago that DF1 "has no hope of staying alive."

Such a decision would be hardest on Leo Kirch, owner of the Kirch Group. Not only would he be left with thousands of his "d-box" digital decoders, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, he would also be left with a mountain of programming bought from Hollywood studios for DF1 at great expense in 1996. While closely held Kirch is secretive about its account books, reports the company is in financial trouble have made the rounds repeatedly over the past year.

Nick Bertolott, media analyst with JP Morgan in London, noted that if DF1 closes, premiere would have a monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

While a spokesman for Kirch on Wednesday told German newswire VWD that the company wasn't in liquidity trouble, rumors to the contrary have been kept alive by a series of newspaper articles, published - and denied - in the last year. Start-up costs for the struggling DF-1 alone are widely held to have been huge.

If Bertelsmann doesn't heed Kirch's call to reapply for commission approval - and there were no suggestions from comments Wednesday that it will - then Kirch could be forced into sell-offs to make up for supposed funding difficulties.

In one respect Kirch is lucky: Premiere has agreed to use the "d-box" digital decoder developed by Kirch for hundreds of millions of dollars. But the company has spent an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars for film rights, bought in 1996 from Hollywood studios.

"I'd expect a no vote would also force Kirch to pass over his huge library of film rights to Premiere, and then the two companies would build Premier as an analog pay-TV station, as it is at the moment," Bertolott at JP Morgan said.

But neither company has abandoned its digital ambitions yet. Both Wednesday reiterated their commitment to expand in partnership Premiere as a digital service.
CLT-UFA has a 37.5% stake in Premiere, with an option to increase its stake to 50%. Kirch owns the remaining
62.5% in Premiere, having bought French pay-TV company Canal Plus's (F.CLP) 37.5% stake last year.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (AFP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked German media groups Kirch and Bertelsmann from merging their digital television interests into a new pay-TV joint venture, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert announced.
The decision to reject the deal reflects concerns that the two companies will establish a stranglehold on the
German market that would restrict the capacity of rival companies to compete.

Van Miert said the decision had been taken "unanimously," by the 20-member Commission after Bertelsmann rejected the Commission's demand for further changes to the deal to guarantee greater competition.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (AFP) - The  European Commission on Wednesday blocked German media groups Kirch and Bertelsmann from merging their digital television interests into a new pay-TV joint venture, Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert announced.

The decision to reject the deal reflects concerns that the two companies will establish a monopoly on the German market that would restrict the capacity of rival companies to compete.

Van Miert said the decision had been taken "unanimously," by the 20-member Commission after Bertelsmann rejected the Commission's demand for further changes to the deal to guarantee greater competition.

Van Miert offered a deal under which other German cable TV channels would have free access to Premier, the subscriber channel the two companies intended to form.

Despite agreement from Kirch and Deutsche Telecom, which was also involved in the proposed merger, Bertelsmann had been unwilling to accept the condition.

Kirch said Wednesday it would be prepared to re-apply for approval of its plans, taking into account the conditions set out by the commission. Bertelsmann said it was not ready to make the concessions demanded.

Van Miert told a press conference Wednesday he had worked to find a solution right up until the end of negotiations. He stressed he had taken the "exceptional" step of personally offering solutions for a merger which respected EU regulations and left the market open.
Kirch had immediately accepted the offer, he said, adding that he was at a loss to explain the opposition from
Bertelsmann, as "our conditions were reasonable and justified".
Deutche Telecom had also accepted the proposal that competitor cable operators could use its network. Agreement in principle was reached on giving competitors access to the D-box decoder used by the two groups
and needed for Premiere, Van Miert said.
The commission opened an enquiry in December over the merger, which also attracted the attention of the
German Cartels Office.
The EU's consultative committee also turned down the deal last week. Bertelsmann and Kirch agreed a deal to set up Premiere in November 1997. stb-gg-jsc/mab/jz

Kirch prepared to re-apply for EU approval  for pay-TV deal

MUNICH, Germany, May 27 (AFP) - German media group Kirch said Wednesday it would be prepared to re-apply for European Commission approval of its plans to merge its digital television interests with  Bertelsmann into a new pay-TV joint venture.

Responding to the  EU's decision Wednesday to block the plans, Kirch said in a statement it "regrets the negative decision."
"Approval, which seemed possible up until this morning, would have been a positive signal for an early move of
Premiere and its competitors into new markets," the statement said.

Kirch said it "is still prepared to work with its partners on a new proposal in line with last compromises put forward by the EU Commission."

EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert put forward a proposal whereby the pay-TV channel Premiere would unbundle its services and give cable operators paid access to part of Premiere's digital package of TV channels.

"In our opinion, the solution still offers a sustainable basis for the digital development of Premiere despite all the objections," the Kirch statement said.
But Bertelsmann was not ready to make the concessions demanded by EU Commissioner's Karel van Miert. Board member Michael Dornemann said in a statement that "the concessions demanded by the commission
would have completely distorted competition in Germany."

"We would have been obliged to subsidize our rivals. Our capacity to innovate and take risks would have been restricted," Dornemann said.

A Bertelsmann spokeswoman said: "We went along with all the concessions proposed to date. But this last demand was no longer economically acceptable for us."
"We had hoped that the EU Commission would have seen this, and we regret that the chance to introduce digital
TV to Germany at this time has now been quashed," she said.

The EU Commission rejected the deal amid concerns that Kirch and Bertelsmann would establish a stranglehold on the German market that would restrict the capacity of rival companies to compete.

EU rejects German TV venture

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union's executive agency Wednesday blocked a digital television venture between two German companies, saying it could stifle competition.
All 20 members of the  European Commission voted to reject the proposed venture between Kirch Group and
Bertelsmann AG.
In explaining the decision, the EU's top antitrust official, Karel Van Miert said: "We've got to ensure that the (digital
TV) market remains an open market."
He said Bertelsmann rejected a compromise that the Commission had worked out with Kirch and Deutsche
Telekom, which was also involved with the project.

Kirch Group spokesman Johannes Schmitz in Munich said the partners hoped to make a new joint application soon, but Bertelsmann spokesman Manfred Harnischfreger ruled it out.

Bertelsmann chief Michael Dornemann said in a statement that the digital TV plans collapsed because of exaggerated conditions set by Van Miert.

"To an astounding degree, he took the arguments of competitors and opponents of the contract as his own," Dornemann said. "An approval based on such an exaggerated catalog of concessions made the success of this project impossible."

While the official deadline for a decision on the venture was June 3, Van Miert said the Commission members did not see the point of delaying a decision because of Bertelsmann's position.
The competition chief said the Commission only would have accepted a compromise that guaranteed the
potential for future competition in the German digital TV market, "even if in the immediate period it could lead to a
monopoly."

Van Miert declined to speculate on how the decision might affect the development of digital TV in Germany, which is lagging behind other EU countries like France, Italy and Spain.

Kirch launched Germany's first digital service in 1996 to much fanfare, but people were reluctant to buy the expensive decoder boxes necessary to receive it, and the unprofitable service has attracted only 160,000 customers.

To keep DF1 going, Kirch wanted to merge it with Premiere, an analog pay-TV service with 1.6 million subscribers. Kirch and Bertelsmann would each then own 50 percent of Premiere.

Kirch spokesman Schmitz reiterated Wednesday that the company saw no economic future for DF1 by itself, but added that Kirch would not pull the plug just yet in the interest of the customers and with a view toward a possible new merger application.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - A  European Commission source said on Wednesday that the  Commission had reached a compromise with German media tycoon Leo Kirch and  Deutsche Telekom on a proposed German pay-television tie-up, but said  Bertelsmann AG, a key player in the deal, was resisting the accord.

The Commission source added that the 20-seat  Commission, the European Union's antitrust watchdog, was unlikely to take a final decision on the planned deal at its regular weekly meeting today.

A source close to the talks told Reuters earlier that European competition chief Karel Van Miert had struck a compromise deal with Kirch and Deutsche Telekom on conditions to clear the proposed German pay-TV alliance.
That source also said that Bertelsmann had asked for another two days to consider the compromise.

The Commission has the power to prohibit or set strict conditions to mergers and takeovers which would create or strengthen dominant positions. It has formally set a June 3 deadline to reach a verdict.
Kirch and Bertelsmann last year agreed to pool forces in pay-TV to get digital television off the ground in
Germany after years of bitter rivalry which left the Bavarian media mogul in need of cash.
Kirch, who controls two powerful free television channels, has threatened to close down his DF1 digital pay-TV
company if the Commission blocks the alliance with Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

Kirch, Telekom reach EU deal, Bertelsmann resists.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) -  European competition chief Karel Van Miert was expected to tell the European Commission on Wednesday that he had struck a compromise with Leo Kirch and Deutsche Telekom on conditions to clear a German pay-TV alliance, a source close to the talks told Reuters.

But Bertelsmann, a key party to the planned deal, has asked for another two days to consider the compromise, the source said.

Van Miert on Tuesday met with Kirch, Michael Dornemann, the head of Bertelsmann's entertainment division, and Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, chief executive officer of Bertelsmann's CLT-Ufa television subsidiary, to try to avert a ban of the alliance which would have split the 20-seat EU executive.

The source, who was consulted by the Commission on Tuesday night about the compromise, said: "There is an agreement between Van Miert, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom, but Bertelsmann said it was not ready to accept and asked for two days to think it over."

"I think this is going to put enormous pressure on Bertelsmann and I would not be surprised if (German Chancellor Helmut) Kohl was to apply pressure and argue that without the deal Kirch would disappear and that would be catastrophic," he said, adding: "I don't think Bertelsmann will be able to say 'No'. They have Kirch's fate in their hands".

Bertelsmann and Telekom declined to comment, as did the Commission, but the EU executive was expected to make a statement around 1000 GMT.

It has the power to prohibit or set strict conditions to mergers and takeovers which would create or strengthen dominant positions.
Kirch and Bertelsmann last year agreed to pool forces in pay-TV to get digital television off the ground in
Germany after years of bitter rivalry which left the Bavarian media mogul in need of cash.
Kirch, who controls two powerful free television channels, has threatened to close down the DF1 digital pay-TV
company if the Commission blocks the alliance with Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.
The Commission has formally until June 3 to reach a verdict.

Tuesday's compromise focuses on the price cable operators other than Telekom will be able to charge customers to distribute the digital platform of Kirch and Bertelsmann in parallel with the two partners, the source said.

Kirch initially argued that discounts given by rival cable firms should be very small to reduce competition. He also wanted the firms to provide data on their customers, a demand which has apparently been dropped.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday wielded its rarely used power to
ban big anti-competitive corporate mergers, and stopped a German pay-television alliance between  Bertelsmann
AG, Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch and  Deutsche Telekom AG.

Cementing its reputation as one of the world's most independent and tough antitrust enforcers, the  European Union executive reached the decision unanimously, despite earlier concerns that it would back down in an effort to bolster the  European television industry.
Van Miert said the Commission spared no efforts to try to save the deal but in the end had no choice but to veto it
- only the ninth time it has blocked a merger since it became the clearing house for large mergers and takeovers
in 1990.

"We tried to be as flexible as we could in seeking a solution with the parties. I don't think anybody can dispute that," he told a news conference.
Van Miert made a last attempt on Tuesday to find a compromise and indeed was able to persuade Kirch and
Deutsche Telekom, Germany's former telecommunications monopoly, to make further concessions.

But the efforts were thwarted by Bertelsmann, which rejected the compromise in a letter to the Commission as it was holding its weekly meeting on Wednesday to give its final verdict.

"I felt rather confident that the conditions spelt out yesterday and accepted by Kirch and Telekom were reasonable and defendable ... but Bertelsmann rejected the proposals," Van Miert said.
Kirch and Bertelsmann last year agreed to pool forces in pay-TV in Germany after years of bitter rivalry.

The alliance involved merging Premiere, the only successful German pay-TV company jointly owned by CLT-Ufa and Kirch, with Kirch's digital pay-TV channel DF1 to develop Premiere into a digital pay-TV bouquet. CLT-Ufa is a joint venture between Bertelsmann and Luxembourg-based holding company Audiofina into which they merged their TV interests in 1997.

Kirch's dowry also included its sports TV channels, prized decoder technology and a huge library of Hollywood films and output rights to most major U.S. studios.
"Through the merger Premiere would achieve a dominant position on the market for pay-TV in Germany," the
Commission said in a statement.

"The combination of the important programme resources of Kirch and CLT-Ufa and the subscription base of Premiere would prevent the development of any additional broadcasting and marketing platform in the German pay-TV market," it added.

Both Kirch and Telekom said after the ruling they were prepared to go back to the negotiating table but Bertelsmann appeared to have decided to go it alone, warning that the decision would delay the development of digital TV in Germany.

"Premiere will continue to be the centre of focus," CLT-Ufa CEO Michael Dornemann told Reuters. "But we will have to make a smaller effort."

Dornemann also sharply rejected the allegation that Bertelsmann/CLT-Ufa were to blame for the deal's collapse.
"It is certainly clever to put the blame on us after making unacceptable demands," said Dornemann.

Van Miert did not rule out other possible projects in the German digital TV sector as a result of the ban. But he would not comment on the possibility of Kirch joining up with media baron Rupert Murdoch, who recently revived speculation about a tie-up.
"This leads to other possibilities. It is not for the Commission to favour one or other of these," he said. Bertelsmann's stance confirmed the feeling throughout the negotiations that the Kirch group, which was often
represented by Leo Kirch himself, was in much more need of the alliance and, therefore, more inclined to make
concessions.

The group, which is a power of its own in the southern state of Bavaria, became deeply indebted after it spent billions of marks to build up its huge film library and sports broadcasting rights and has threatened to close down DF1.

Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber criticised the Commission's decision, saying that it had overstepped its competence.

But the German Federal Cartel Office was one of the most vocal opponents of the deal and a panel of merger experts on Monday overwhelmingly backed Van Miert for the second time this month. Luxembourg was the only dissenting voice.

In the last few weeks the alliance partners agreed to sell 25 percent of Kirch's film rights to rival broadcasters, divest a 25 percent stake in BetaResearch and allow rival cable companies to distribute the Premiere digital bouquet in competition with Telekom.

Tuesday's failed compromise focused on the price that rival cable firms would be able to charge customers as well as the possibility for them to choose only certain channels, for example those offering films or regional programmes, and 'repackage' them with rival products.

The Commission in 1994 also blocked a deal between Kirch, Bertelsmann and Telekom to provide technical and administrative services such as customer billing to pay-TV.

FOCUS-EU gets tough, bans German pay-TV deal.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission on Wednesday wielded its rarely used power to ban big corporate mergers and blocked a proposed alliance in Germany's pay-television market.

The Commission's antitrust chief Karel Van Miert said he had agreed a compromise with German media tycoon Leo Kirch and Deutsche Telekom, two of the partners in the deal, but that  Bertelsmann AG, the third key player, had rejected making any further concessions to win  EU approval.
"The Commission has just unanimously decided to ban the venture of Deutsche Telekom, Bertelsmann and the
Kirch group. That means a formal decision has today been taken," Van Miert told a special news conference.

"A final attempt was made to try and reach a solution...that would meet our concerns regarding competition. I went as far as to make a verbal proposal that was agreed by Mr Kirch, but totally refused by Bertelsmann," he added.

Kirch and Bertelsmann last year agreed to pool forces in pay-TV to get digital television off the ground in Germany after years of bitter rivalry, but the Commission had contested the deal on the grounds that it would create a market monopoly.

"We wanted to find a solution that allowed the market to remain open (to other competitors)," Van Miert said, adding: "We've been very flexible in trying to find a solution."

The Commission has only blocked eight mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for mergers and takeovers affecting the 15-nation EU market, but it has often set strict conditions on other deals before allowing them to go through.

Van Miert earlier met with Leo Kirch, Michael Dornemann, the head of Bertelsmann's entertainment division, and Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, chief executive officer of Bertelsmann's CLT-Ufa television subsidiary, in a last-ditch bid to squeeze further concessions from the companies.
But the deal foundered when Bertelsmann confirmed to Van Miert that it could not move any further. Van Miert did not, however, rule out other possible projects in the German digital TV sector.
"Deutsche Telekom is free again, so to speak. This leads to other possibilities. It is not for the Commission to favour one or other of these," he said.
Kirch, who controls two powerful free television channels, has threatened to close down his DF1 digital pay-TV
company if the Commission blocked the alliance.

Van Miert, Kirch and Telekom had earlier appeared to agree a compromise over the price that cable operators other than Telekom would have been able to charge customers to distribute the Kirch/Bertelsmann digital platform in parallel with the two partners, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters.

Bertelsmann stands by Premiere, warns of delay.

BONN, May 27 (Reuters) - A  Bertelsmann board member in charge of television activities said on Wednesday the European Commission's rejection of its pay TV alliance with Leo Kirch would delay deployment of digital TV in Germany.

Michael Dornemann told Reuters in a telephone interview that  Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media group, would concentrate efforts on its Premiere pay TV channel, but that it would no longer be possible to make a broad digital launch.

"Premiere will continue to be the centre of focus," said Dornemann from his Munich office. "But we will have to make a smaller effort."

"Developments will be set back, that is sad," he said, adding that Bertelsmann had already invested just under one billion marks in Premiere.

The European Commission said earlier that it had rejected a planned pay TV alliance between Bertelsmann, Kirch, the Bavarian media tycoon, and phone giant Deutsche Telekom fearing the tie-up would create a monopoly.

Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert blamed Bertelsmann for the failure of the deal, saying the company was not willing to accept compromise proposals.
But Dornemann sharply rejected the allegation, saying the company had made a number of concessions but that
Van Miert went too far by demanding that Premiere allow other cable TV operators to market its programming.
"It is certainly clever put to put the blame on us after making unacceptable demands," said Dornemann. Premiere's digital package contains a mixture of sports, feature films, soft pornography, documentaries and talk
shows.

Cable TV operators, however, did not want to deliver Premiere's programming as a complete digital package, or bouquet in industry jargon, but to pick and choose the best programmes and repackage them with other programmes.

"The most aggravating point is that not only were we asked to concede the distribution and marketing of our product by others, but that they make a profit by doing so and we make a loss," said Dornemann.

"They would have been able to package programmes themselves and, using our programme as the locomotive, come up with a better offer to compete against us. That was not acceptable to us," he said.

Dornemann added that Kirch had given the Commission the impression that its demands were acceptable but had not consulted Bertelsmann first.

He said that Bertelsmann would continue to invest "quite a bit" in Premiere, but not at the same pace or volume as in the past, which would also have an impact on programming for the consumer.
"The programme will no longer be as broad and the volume of investment will not be as high," he said.

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's decision on Wednesday to block a proposed alliance in Germany's pay-television market was only the ninth time it has banned a merger since 1990.
The Commission blocked a deal involving Bertelsmann , the Kirch group and  Deutsche Telekom ,
Commission anti-trust chief Karel Van Miert said.

The Commission has blocked eight other mergers since 1990, when it became the clearing house for large mergers and acquisitions affecting the 15-nation European Union, but it has set conditions on many others.

Following is a list of the blocked deals. - Oct 2, 1991: Takeover of Boeing Co's Canadian subsidiary De Havilland by France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia - Nov 9, 1994: MSG Media Service joint venture between Leo Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom to provide technical and administrative services for pay-TV such as customer billing - July 19, 1995: Nordic satellite TV joint venture between Norsk Telekom and TeleDanmark to transmit programmes to cable TV operators and households - Sept 20, 1995: Dutch TV joint venture Holland Media Group between TV companies RTL4 and Veronica and TV programme producer Endemol Entertaining - April 23, 1996: Merger of the platinum interests of South Africa's Gencor and British conglomerate Lonrho - Nov

BONN, May 27 (Reuters) - German phone giant Deutsche Telekom AG and Bavarian media tycoon Leo Kirch on Wednesday said they were prepared to make another offer to the European Commission for a planned pay television alliance.
"We will certainly make another try," a Telekom spokesman told Reuters.
The Kirch Group said in a statement that it was regretted the Commission's decision to reject its alliance with
Telekom and media group Bertelsmann AG and that it was ready to make a new offer together with its partners.

"The Kirch Group is prepared to make a new offer together with its partners on the basis of the most recent compromise that was negotiated," the Kirch Group said.

"This could be decided quickly since the Commission has indicated that it would have given its approval with a broad majority if all parties had supported the solution reached," Kirch said.

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert, explaining the decision by the European Union executive to reject the alliance, said a compromise reached with Kirch and Telekom had been rejected by Bertelsmann.

"The Kirch Group was of the opinion that this solution, despite all reservations, offered an acceptable basis for the digital development of Premiere," Kirch said.

The spokesman for Deutsche Telekom said the company wanted to reach agreement soon on making another offer.
"We want to sit down with all parties involved and try to find a solution. We will not give up," the spokesman said. (C) Reuters Limited 1998.

Bertelsmann wins, Kirch loses in EU merger block.

27 May 1998

BRUSSELS, May 27 (Reuters) - The European Commission's decision on Wednesday to block the planned German pay-TV alliance between Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom is probably the best solution for Bertelsmann, EU and industry sources said.
While cash-strapped Kirch was willing to make sacrifices in order to win approval for the alliance,  Bertelsmann
evidently believed that the price required to allay the  Commission's monopoly fears was simply too high.
Bertlesmann already has joint control with Kirch of pay-TV company Premiere and a deal giving it access to
Kirch's coveted decoder technology and film rights.

The price for Commission approval for the alliance with cable operator Telekom would have included, at least, allowing rival cable TV firms to market Premiere, selling 25 percent of Kirch's extensive rights to Hollywood films and divesting 25 percent of BetaResearch, the Kirch-owned company that controls the decoders.

CLT-Ufa, a joint venture combining the television interests of Bertelsmann and Audiofina, said consistently in the last week that any further concessions would endanger Premiere's profitability.

European competition chief Karel Van Miert stressed at a news conference the intense involvement of CLT-Ufa in the last phase of the talks and later told reporters that the Luxembourg-based company did not want the deal with the strings that the EU executive wanted to attach.
It seems that Bertelsmann/CLT-Ufa may now be able to go ahead with its digital TV plans unimpeded.

CLT-Ufa's CEO Rolf Schmidt-Holtz said last week that if the Commission sank the alliance, Bertelsmann had agreed with Kirch to use its decoder boxes and to broadcast football matches using the same technology. That, he added, "had nothing to do with Brussels".

Van Miert said on Wednesday that "given that all the parties had decided for Kirch's d-box system, it's likely this will continue".

He told Reuters he was aware of Bertelsmann's deal with Kirch on film rights which, he said, followed Bertelsmann complaints in the past against Kirch for allegedly abusing its dominant position. But he declined to comment on whether it was valid, saying it had never been filed to the Commission for regulatory clearance.

Kirch is the leading provider of cinema films and television entertainment programmes in Germany. That plus its extensive broadcasting rights to popular sports events and the set-top box technology was its precious dowry in the marriage of the former German TV enemies.

If Kirch appears to be the real loser, EU and industry sources said it remains to be seen whether the Commission's decision, which was based on its duty to prevent creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the 15-nation bloc, will ensure that the German market remains open to competition.

Kirch has said that its digital pay-TV company DF1 will not be able to survive alone. Under the terms of the failed deal, DF1 would have been merged with Premiere.

Van Miert said it was "speculation" to say that Bertelsmann/CLT-Ufa would end up dominating the market, but he admitted that it would have been better if Bertelsmann had agreed to the compromise reached on Tuesday with Kirch and Telekom.

Hahn added that the Commission's decision would have financial consequences for the Kirch group, but would not impact its business as such.

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--European Union competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said he doesn't expect the decision to block a German digital TV alliance taken Wednesday to be the last such case he will have to examine.

"I would be surprised if this is the last digital TV deal I'll have to deal with," he told journalists, after announcing the Commission's decision to block the alliance between German broadcaster Kirch Group (B.KCH), Luxembourg broadcaster CLT-UFA (L.CLT) and German telecoms group  Deutsche Telekom AG (DT).
"There will be lots of talks now, not just in Germany, but also Italy and elsewhere," Van Miert said.

Conditional Yes To German TV Alliance  Seen As Worst Outcome

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--A senior source within the alliance of companies hoping to launch a digital TV platform in Germany said late Tuesday conditional approval for the deal would be "the worst of all results".

"If the  European Commission approves the deal but insists on concessions then the alliance (between Luxembourg-based broadcaster CLT-UFA, German TV company Kirch Group (G.KCH) and German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom) will be a new deal, not the one we planned, the source told Dow Jones on condition of anonymity.
"We can't accept major deviations from what we initially proposed," he said.

The source was present at a 1300 GMT meeting with competition commissioner Karel Van Miert Tuesday, at which the alliance didn't table any new concessions, he said.

"We want a result as soon as possible," the source said. "A 'yes' vote by the commissioners would be the best result, but a 'no' would be better than a 'yes but'", he said.
"We're not going to sign a deal we don't like. We have a responsibility for the future of CLT-UFA and Premiere
(the pay-TV joint venture jointly owned by Kirch and CLT-UFA). We should never accept a deal that won't fly."

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Luxembourg-based broadcasting group CLT-UFA (L.CLT) isn't interested in a compromise solution struck late Tuesday among the European Union Commission, German broadcaster Kirch Group (G.KCH) and German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom AG (DT), according to a source familiar with the negotiations.
The three companies are trying to set up an alliance to launch a digital TV platform in Germany.

"We aren't interested in this compromise," said a senior source at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian holding company that shares control over CLT-UFA with German media group Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT).

He told Dow Jones that the compromise by Kirch and Telekom includes allowing free access to the subscription list of the digital project, which will operate under the Premiere brand name. He added that a second concession the two partners accepted is to give access to the digital platform for other broadcasters.

"These concessions cost Telekom nothing, and Kirch's agenda and ours are quite different," the source said, explaining why CLT-UFA isn't agreeing to the compromise.


The source dismissed news reports that the CLT-UFA camp is calling for two days to consider the compromise.

German TV Pact Faces EU Vote In a Few Days

BRUSSELS -- The  European Union's top competition official refused to forecast Tuesday whether the  European
Commission will block the digital-television joint venture of Germany's Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG.

Speaking before the  European Parliament's Economics  Commission, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said "We'll have to wait and see" what transpires over the next few days. The 20-member  EU Commission is expected to discuss the Kirch/Bertelsmann venture today.

Mr. Van Miert castigated the German companies for waiting until the last minute before considering serious proposals that might allay the commission's competition concerns.
He also said the commission wouldn't be at fault if Kirch and Bertelsmann fail to gain clearance of the venture. "I
can't help it if the two main players are at loggerheads," said Mr. Van Miert, without elaborating.

He said the development of digital television in Germany, and in Europe generally, would "work much better based on a competitive framework and not a dominant position."
Mr. Van Miert's comments follow a meeting Monday of national EU competition experts who agreed by a vote of
14 to 1 that the commission should block the venture. Luxembourg -- the home of Bertelsmann television unit
CLT-Ufa SA -- was the lone dissenter.

A last round of talks between company executives and EU competition officials was under way in Brussels late Tuesday. But it remained uncertain how, or even whether, commissioners will reach agreement on the matter at their meeting today.

Commission President Jacques Santer said Tuesday that it's too early to say how he will vote today in the decision on the Kirch/Bertelsmann alliance.

With opinions apparently split among the 20 EU commissioners that vote on the deal, Mr. Santer's vote as commission president is considered key to the controversial decision. Asked on the fringes of an economic conference in Bonn how he would vote, Mr. Santer said "It's too early to say," and noted that the decision would come today or during the next week.

Mr. Van Miert, at the European Parliament, made reference to other European digital TV ventures to suggest ways in which the German companies might have broken the impasse with the commission.
He noted in particular the British Interactive Broadcasting venture between British Telecommunications PLC and
British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC, which is well on the way toward commission approval.
BT announced last week that it was willing to fulfill commission demands for third-party access to the
BIB-subsidized set-top boxes and related software, and for the sale of cable-TV franchises in Westminster and
Milton Keynes.

GERMANY: LAST MINUTE CONCESSIONS FAIL TO PREVENT THUMBS DOWN. EU TO BLOCK GERMAN PAY-TV ALLIANCE

A last-minute attempt by German media companies Bertelsmann/CLT- UFA and Kirch-Group to get approval for their planned pay-TV alliance from the European Commission has failed.

According to a report in weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, at a meeting last Tuesday Leo Kirch and Bertelsmann chairman Michael Dornemann weren't able to solve their differences with  EU Commissioner Karel van Miert who, as a consequence, cancelled a further meeting scheduled for the following Thursday. Instead, Van Miert has sent the two companies a letter in which he demands further concessions, in particular concerning the marketing and bundling of the channels and bouquets within their planned joint Premiere offering.

According to the report, Van Miert demanded that private cable companies and operators of competing digital platforms on satellite were granted the right to combine individual channels from Premiere's offering with their own multimedia and telephone services, thus creating their own independent packages for cable homes. However, Kirch-Group and Bertelsmann have written to Van Miert that they are not willing to agree with the demand, arguing that they wouldn't be able to comply with their business plan, according to Der Spiegel. In return, van Miert has informed the cartel offices of the EU member states that he is still recommending a ban of the alliance. According to sources at the German Bundeskartellamt, the other cartel offices from most EU states are against the collaboration as well. In an interview with news magazine Focus, Bertelsmann manager Dorneman said that the companies are not prepared to make further concessions, indicating that a ban is more than likely. Meanwhile, the EU Commission has decided to announce its final decision this Wednesday, several days before the probe's June 3 deadline.

CLT-UFA has already publicly stated that it intends to continue developing Premiere's digital offering, no matter how the EU Commission decides. At a press conference in Luxembourg last week chairman Rolf Schmidt-Holtz pointed out that Kirch-Group has agreed contractually to grant the Hamburg-based pay-TV channel some of the movie rights it bought in Hollywood even if the EU blocks the alliance. Therefore, Premiere can continue showing attractive blockbusters to its current 1.6 million analogue subscribers. In return, Bertelsmann/CLT-Ufa agreed to use Kirch's d-box decoder, despite having developed its own Seca/Mediaguard system together with Canal Plus. Schmidt-Holtz said that the EU probe has so far led to a loss of more than DM100 million. Last December the Brussels authority had ruled that Premiere had to stop renting d-box decoders to its subscribers until a decision about the collaboration with Kirch has been made.

Bertelsmann Rejects Pay-TV Compromise

Bertelsmann AG alone held out against a compromise that would allow the European Commission to clear the company's proposed pay-television alliance with Kirch Group and Deutsche Telekom AG, according to people familiar with last-minute negotiations aimed at salvaging the venture.

During talks in Brussels on Tuesday, Leo Kirch, owner and founder of Kirch Group, agreed to minimum concessions proposed by European Union antitrust chief Karel Van Miert that were also backed by  Deutsche      Telekom, the people close to the negotiations said. But  Bertelsmann's head of entertainment, Michael Dornemann, refused to sign up, they added. The outcome of the talks makes it likely that the 20-member commission today will threaten to block the alliance unless  Bertelsmann relents.

In a separate development, Deutsche Telekom said it will break up its cable television unit and open it up to outside partners. The German telecommunications giant plans to separate its cable business into at least six regional companies by Jan. 1, 2000. The company is hoping for other cable network operators, multimedia companies and investment banks to take stakes in the cable business, Deutsche Telekom said in a statement.

The announcement is an apparent effort to prevent regulatory action by EU antitrust guardians who oppose the idea of large phone companies also operating cable networks. Germany's other cable companies enthusiastically welcomed the move. They and other investors have anxiously waited for a chance to break into Europe's largest TV market.

"This will be a huge deal," said Robert Montgomery, managing director with Kagan World Media Ltd. in London. "Deutsche Telekom is the biggest cable operator in the world and it's splitting up. That's like AT&T breaking up in a small way. Deutsche Telekom's cable business has a primal position in the market, and a lot of people are lined up to participate in the business and finance it."

Meanwhile, the furious lobbying and negotiations surrounding the Bertelsmann-Kirch-Telekom digital-TV linkup look likely to continue down to the wire, with the commission obliged to rule on the case by June 3. "It's really high poker," said one commission official, who asked not to be identified.
He and others predicted that during today's weekly commission meeting, Mr. Van Miert will get approval for his
last-minute compromise offer from most, if not all, of the other 19 commissioners. Even those commissioners who
have been warning Mr. Van Miert not to block the venture seemed satisfied Tuesday that he had taken the
companies' concerns into account, the officials said.

Mr. Van Miert's decision to scale back his demands on the companies succeeded in reducing divisions within the commission, which surfaced on Monday. But it also raised questions about whether the antitrust chiefwas bowing to the strong political pressure from Germany and Luxembourg to clear the deal.

If Bertelsmann hasn't shifted its stance by today's meeting, the commission is likely to warn the company that the deal will be blocked. But a final decision could be postponed to give the company more time, the officials said.

It's unclear how Bertelsmann and its TV unit, CLT-Ufa, will react. A spokesman for Luxembourg-based CLT-Ufa said only that his company "made no further concessions" during Tuesday's talks. Commission officials have detected splits within the company on whether to persevere with the pay-TV venture with Kirch.

Deutsche Telekom's separate announcement that it would spin off its cable businesses sparked speculation that the company was trying to facilitate the commission's clearance of the pay-TV venture. But a Deutsche Telekom spokesman said the move was unrelated to the EU ruling on the alliance.

Deutsche Telekom has a vested interest in the deal getting the green light from Brussels. So far, the company dominates the cable network market throughout Germany, and it would be a nearly exclusive distributor of the digital-TV platform Kirch and Bertelsmann are hoping to create. In addition, cable TV has long been a financial burden for Deutsche Telekom. Last year, the group ran up cable-TV losses of 1.3 billion marks ($739 million). Faced with a possible regulatory ruling that could force it to lower monthly cable-TV rates, Deutsche Telekom said last week it would take a charge this year of up to 4.5 billion marks.

EC blocks  digital  TV joint venture

The European Commission blocked a planned German digital pay-TV venture yesterday, after  Bertelsmann
AG, one of the partners, refused to back a last-minute compromise that would have saved the deal.
"The European Commission has just decided unanimously to prohibit the joint venture," Karel Van Miert, the
European Union's competition commissioner, told a press conference yesterday.

The proposed deal involved merging DF-1, a money losing digital TV service run by Kirch Group, a German media company, with Premiere, an analogue TV service controlled jointly by Kirch and CLT-UFA.

Luxembourg media company CLT-UFA is jointly owned by Bertelsmann and the European holding company venture of Canadian financier Paul Desmarais and Belgium's Albert Frere.

The decision to block the deal threatens to delay by several years the introduction of digital TV in Germany and will increase speculation about the financial position of Kirch, which has accumulated substantial debt in order to buy rights to popular Hollywood films.
Kirch said yesterday the decision would not affect its ability to do business.
Brussels has only blocked eight deals since it was given wide-ranging powers in 1990 to vet large mergers. Bertelsmann's refusal to agree to a compromise meant the EC did not have to vote on the joint venture, avoiding
the possibility of embarrassing divisions between commissioners being made public. Other commissioners had
urged Van Miert to broaden the debate to take into account the industrial and cultural importance of the deal.

Van Miert said an acceptable solution had been within reach of the companies and the EC. Negotiations had continued until Tuesday and Van Miert had taken the "unusual" step of suggesting a last-minute compromise. "I made a verbal proposal, which was accepted by Kirch but turned down by Bertelsmann."
The companies had already made several sacrifices in an attempt to obtain clearance.

They were prepared to sell 25% of Beta Research, the company that controls the technology of decoder boxes necessary to view digital TV. They were also ready to sell some of their programs to regional cable firms, which could have broadcast them alongside their own.
Kirch, meanwhile, was willing to give competitors access to its extensive film library.

Van Miert's 11th-hour proposal included a demand for wider access for rivals to Premiere's programs, possibly on a pay-per-view basis.

The commissioner also suggested creating an ombudsman to ensure that prices at which competitors would buy films from Premiere were "reasonable."

The European Union Commission rejected a planned television alliance of Germany's Kirch Group, Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom AG, the country's dominant telephone and cable group. The ban sets back the companies, which had invested millions of dollars, and delays development of digital pay-TV in
Germany, Europe's largest market. The ruling is particularly painful for TV magnate Leo Kirch, the foremost figure in the effort to build a digital TV business. The European Commission decided to ban the alliance when Bertelsmann rejected a last-minute compromise offered by EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert and accepted by Kirch and Deutsche Telekom.

Brussels darkens digital  TV picture.

THE mass launch of digital television in Germany -  Europe's biggest TV market - suffered a setback yesterday when the European Commission blocked a pay-TV venture involving Kirch,  Bertelsmann and Deutsche            Telekom.

The block was imposed after  Bertelsmann - the Munich-based media group - spurned a last-minute compromise offered by competition commissioner Karel Van Miert which would have allowed competing cable companies access to digital technology and the venture's best programmes.

The German industry was awash with rumours that the collapse of the deal would open the door for Rupert Murdoch to realise his dream of finding a place in the German market where some predict a potential for digital sets in 25m TV homes.

BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Mr Murdoch has a 40% stake, has made two unsuccessful attempts to strike alliances with Kirch and Bertelsmann. Although analysts believe Mr Murdoch's ambitions remain intact, they suggested Sky is too preoccupied with this summer's launch of digital in Britain to divert its energies to the
German market.

The launch of digital TV in Britain is similarly complex, with Sky launching its satellite service in competition with the terrestrial version backed by ITV companies Granada and Carlton.

The Independent Television Commission has called upon the two sides to co-operate and avoid a technology war whereby consumers are forced to choose between rival decoding equipment to convert digital signals for ordinary analogue TVs.

Mr Van Miert, who in 1994 blocked an earlier pay-TV venture involving the same three companies, has warned that the latest deal would create a monopoly in the German pay-TV market.

The commissioner yesterday rejected suggestions that the ruling would lead to a monopoly in the German market anyway. Kirch has said it will close it DF-1 digital television service, which has 160,000 subscribers.

"What we will be seeing in Germany is developments similar to those in other member states," he predicted, citing France and Spain, where "there are two or three competitors". Kirch, which is saddled with billions of dollars in expensive film and sports programming rights as well as decoder boxes, immediately said it wanted to try to
revive the venture in a form acceptable to Brussels.

But Bertelsmann said it would stick with the Premiere pay-TV channel - which offers viewers a diet of sports, films, documentaries and soft pornography - which it owns with Kirch and Canal Plus.

Premiere had built up some 130,000 digital subscribers before the commission banned it from marketing the service late last year while it carried out a four-month inquiry into the planned tie-up with Kirch.

In a statement, Bertelsmann's head of entertainment, Michael Dornemann, said the commission had "blown a great chance". He added: "The real losers in this development are German television viewers who will have to forgo a broad range of digital pay television that has existed for a long time in other European countries."

Bertelsmann said Mr Van Miert's conditions would have made the venture economically unviable. The company accused Brussels of trying to force Premiere to share its programmes with competitors.

The European Commission on Wednesday blocked a proposed three-way pay-TV merger in Germany involving Bertelsmann AG, Kirch Group and  Deutsche Telekom AG, saying the deal would stifle competition, threaten technological development and hurt consumers.

Karel Van Miert, the  European Union's antitrust chief, said Bertelsmann had delivered a letter spurning a last-minute compromise offer even as the 20-member commission met here to discuss the issue.

The merger would have created a vertically integrated monopoly, Mr. Van Miert said, combining the digital pay-TV, cable and satellite decoding technology of the partners and making it difficult or impossible for other service providers to enter the German market.

Mr. Van Miert said, "We have to assure that access to the market is available in future, even if it is in monopoly hands in the short term." Reports this week said the commission was divided on the issue, but Mr. Van Miert said its decision was unanimous after a failed attempt Tuesday to find grounds for agreement.
"We were extremely flexible in trying to find an agreement perhaps too much so," he said.

While Kirch had accepted a proposed compromise, Bertelsmann rejected it, apparently because of its view that further concessions would have undermined the economic basis of the deal.
Kirch and Telekom said after the ruling that they were prepared to go back to the negotiating table. But
Bertelsmann said it would end its efforts to forge a digital-TV alliance and would focus on its Premiere channel.

"For us this was the last straw," Ulrike Gruenrock-Kern, a Bertelsmann spokeswoman, told Bloomberg News. "We made very painful concessions, but what was asked of us in the final days was just too much."

The commission said it considered digital TV to be "an important market of the future" with considerable growth potential. However, it said, "these potentials can only be fully exploited if the market is kept open and can evolve on a competitive basis."

The merger would have created a single digital pay-TV provider out of a complex web of Bertelsmann and Kirch interests. Bertelsmann is one of the world's largest multimedia and publishing empires, and Kirch is a provider of films and television entertainment programs in Germany.

EU/COMPETITION - THE BERTELSMANN ALLIANCE
887 words
28 May 1998

AGEU

AS LATEST SUGGESTIONS BY MR VAN MIERT WERE REJECTED BY BERTELSMANN, EUROPEAN COMMISSION UNANIMOUSLY PROHIBITS ALLIANCE BETWEEN BERTELSMANN/KIRCH/DEUTSCHE TELEKOM (DIGITAL TV AND PAY TV).

Brussels, 27/05/1998 (Agence  Europe) - On Wednesday, the European Commission unanimously decided to prohibit the operation whereby CLT-UFA (belonging to Bertelsmann) and Kirch would acquire joint control of the German pay-TV channel Premiere as well as Beta Digital. At the same time, there is prohibition of the joint takeover of BetaResearch by Bertelsman, Kirch (which currently hold exclusive control) and  Deutsche Telekom. The latter is said to have provided the technical platform for digital broadcasting of pay-TV programmes. The alliance planned comprised many other elements.

As indicated in yesterday's EUROPE, discussions continued during several more hours in the search for a compromise. During Tuesday evening, Karel Van Miert had suggested on behalf of the Commission that certain adjustments should be made to the project to make it acceptable. Kirch had given his oral acceptance of the clauses requested, but Bertelsmann stated during the same evening that it rejected them, and this rejection was confirmed on Wednesday morning in writing. Under such circumstances, the Commission considered, at a proposal by Mr Van Miert, that it served no purpose to prolong discussions until the end of the time allowed, and it took its final negative decision.

Karel Van Miert explained in a press conference the reasons for the Commission's attitude and responded to certain observations or criticisms made, above all in Germany, towards it

1. Commission objectives. In Mr Van Miert's opinion, the main thing was that the market for digital television and pay television should remain open in Germany. It was therefore necessary for the arrangements of the operation to safeguard the possibility of a future competitor eventually being able to move onto the market.. This possibility should not be a theoretical one but a concrete one and therefore the financial, technical and other conditions should be such to allow the viability of an eventual competitor. During the long negotiations that followed
notification of the operation, viable solutions had been defined for many aspects, mainly for the technical side. But the search for a solution failed as far as the programme aspect was concerned.

2. Latest suggestions by Mr. Van Miert. On the eve of the decision, the European Commissioner for competition asked the parties whether they were prepared to essentially agree to the following clauses: a) participation by Deutsche Telekom in broadcasting programmes of a possible rival (otherwise, the alternative would not be technically viable); b) placing at disposal, by Premiere, of part of its rights over sports events and part of its film stocks (a competitor would not be viable if it could not offer sport and fiction); c) the setting of reasonable prices for sporting rights and for Premiere films, with an arbitration procedure in case of disagreement.

Kirch agreed to the clauses orally, as well as to the principle according to which each station would deal with its own customers. Bertelsmann rejected them. Mr. Van Miert is said to have considered a revision clause for the aforementioned clauses possible too.

3. Taking into consideration industrial and cultural aspects. Mr. Van Miert recalled that Germany had always refused to allow rules on mergers and concerted agreements being used for industrial policy purposes or any other policy; they must only serve questions of competition. It would be odd that someone in Germany should change their opinion according to the nationality of the project. Having said this, Mr. Van Miert added that the Commission had always taken a broad view of competition policy, but not to the extent of neglecting the essential goal, which is to guarantee that markets remain open.


Page 57 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
4. Bertelsmann's attitude. Did Bertelsmann "torpedo" the project, having changed its mind about its interest? Mr. Van Miert refused to comment on this, while stating that for some time now, Bertelsmann had announced that the Commission would prohibit the operation. Internal influences in the Bertelsmann group may have played a role.

5. Possible future developments. While refusing to speculate on the future, Mr. Van Miert considered that the technical agreements over the D-box decoder could stand, and observed that now Deutsche Telekom had its hands untied to envisage other alliances. For now, Kirch and Bertelsmann remain on the market; it is not the Commission's role to seek out competitors, it has simply to guarantee that the market remains open should competitors present themselves.

Mr. Van Miert, moreover, observed that this case (and some others that had preceded it) had convinced him that part of the present procedures needed changing. The companies concerned wait for the last minute to say what they are prepared to accept, for tactical reasons, whereas the Commission is tied by imperative deadlines. Mr. Van Miert suggested that the Commission should indicate its position, one month before the final deadline for deciding, so that the interested parties may be aware of it; negotiations would then be over. The Commissioner concluded by expressing his appreciation for Kirch had conducted itself, having sought a solution that conformed to European competition rules right up to the last minute, and his regrets over Bertelsmann's rejection.

Pro Sieben To Attract  Scrutiny After E.U. TV Veto >G.PRO

BONN (Dow Jones)--Germany's Pro Sieben Media AG (G.PRO) will face scrutiny at its annual press conference on Friday about its future after the European Union Commission's veto Wednesday of the pay-TV merger between Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT).

Speculation that the Brussels veto could force Kirch Group into liquidity problems which force the sale of directly or indirectly held assets hit the Pro Sieben share price on Thursday. Nevertheless, at 1350 GMT, shares were DEM3.50 or 4.1% higher at DEM88.50 while the Xetra DAX was 0.2% higher at 5480.04 points.

Pro Sieben is legally a separate entity from the Kirch Group, but the man holding 58.4% of the company's voting stock is Thomas Kirch, son of Kirch Group owner, Leo Kirch.

'Pro Sieben says there's a strict separation (between it and Kirch Group), but of course there's speculation,' said an analyst at a German bank on condition of anonymity.
Not that the company's recent performance gives reason for being downhearted. Pro Sieben in March boasted a
42.7% rise in pretax profit to DEM254 million in 1997 and a sales rise of 10.1% to DEM1.86 billion.

With a strong focus on the 14-49 age-group, which sends advertising executives salivating, the company's Pro 7 channel is only one of two private German TV channels to make any money. (The other is RTL, owned by Bertelsmann's TV-subsidiary CLT-Ufa.)

Thomas Kirch won't sell, says Michael Schatzschneider, analyst at BHF Bank AG in Frankfurt. 'Pro 7 is profitable. Why should I sell what is a pearl in the TV business?'

Tatters remain as Commission blocks  Bertelsmann/Kirch deal.
By Peter Chapman

GERMANY'S digital TV market is on the brink of a fresh round of wheeling and dealing after the  European           Commission unanimously agreed this week to block a key alliance between  Bertelsmann and Kirch Group.

Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said the decision to block the deal yesterday (27 May) came after Bertelsmann refused to follow the Kirch Group's pledge to sign up to his last-minute proposals for further concessions which would have made it possible to approve the deal.

"I myself took some extraordinary steps. I went as far as to make a late proposal that would meet our concerns. It was agreed by Mr Kirch, but was totally rejected by Bertelsmann," said Van Miert. "We can say that the Commission tried its best to find a solution."

The competition chief revealed he had called on the partners in the venture to allow rival TV operators to offer parts of the joint Bertelsmann/Kirch Premiere digital package directly to their own customers.

Under the Van Miert formula, rivals would have paid the Premiere partners a fee for the privilege of offering its programme package, allowing them to make a profit.

Rivals would also have been able to add their own free programmes, as well as pay-per view sport and film once they had acquired the rights they needed.
Bertelsmann's rejection of these proposals proved the key stumbling block which resulted in this week's
Commission decision - only the ninth time it has blocked a merger since 1990.
Kirch and its set-top box development venture Beta Research had agreed to give rival companies access to their
'd-box' decoder technology, while Deutsche Telekom had agreed to open up its huge cable TV network to
potential investors.

Van Miert said the decision to block the venture increased the possibilities for further frantic activity in the German TV market. He added that Deutsche Telekom's pledge to break up its cable TV unit into six regional divisions by January 2000 and open it up to outside partners including other cable operators paved the way for new developments.

"Deutsche Telekom is free again, so to speak. This leads to other possibilities. But it's not up to the Commission to favour one or other possibility," said the Commissioner.

He warned that any new venture would have to ensure it was open to competitors, even if it created a monopoly in the short term.
However, Michael Dornemann, the Bertelsmann director in charge of the company's TV activities, said the
Commission's decision would put back the development of digital TV in the EU's biggest potential market.
"Developments will be set back, which is sad," he said, adding that Bertelsmann had invested half a billion ecu in
Premiere.

He said the "most aggravating" of Van Miert's demands was his insistence that other cable companies should be allowed to market Premiere.

Is Murdoch  waiting  in the wings for Kirch?
By William Boston

28 May 1998

BONN, May 28 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's decision to block an alliance of Germany's most powerful media groups could leave Bavarian media tycoon Leo Kirch looking elsewhere, and some analysts say Rupert Murdoch is waiting in the wings.
The Commission's ruling blocking the digital pay TV alliance of Kirch,  Bertelsmann AG and phone giant
Deutsche Telekom sends the players back to square one and opens the door for new actors to take the stage.

After years of wheeling and dealing, it now appears that Premiere, currently controlled by Bertelsmann's CLT-Ufa group, will remain the dominant player in the market and Kirch will shut down his rival DF1 digital channel.

But while it is clear that there is no one in sight ready to put up the cash to challenge Premiere's hold on the German pay TV market, the Commission's ruling unravels a complicated deal over control of the channel, raising the possibility that new partners could emerge.

"We will sit down soon with Kirch and consider who will take over how much or whether to take on a new partner," said Matthias Wulff, CLT-Ufa spokesman.
Currently, Bertelsmann and Canal Plus each hold 37.5 percent of Premiere and Kirch holds 25 percent.

But under a deal agreed last June, Kirch is about to receive shareholder control of Premiere by purchasing the stake held by Canal Plus, which initially gives him 62.5 percent of Premiere.

But in a second step he has committed himself to transfer 12.5 percent to Bertelsmann, giving each company equal holdings.

"It is contractually settled that Kirch cannot obtain a majority stake in Premiere," said Wulff. "We are interested in working co-operatively with the Kirch group."
CLT-Ufa said it has not held any discussions with prospective partners.

Industry analysts said rejection of the alliance has taken Kirch by surprise, he was under enormous financial pressure, and there were signs the Australian-born media baron Murdoch was showing new interest in Germany.

Murdoch, speaking recently at a media conference in Britain, said he now regretted his decision last year not to take a stake in Kirch's DF1.

It was Murdoch's decision to bail out of DF1 that led to a deal with Bertelsmann and the agreement to merge DF1 with Premiere.
So would Murdoch now take a stake in Premiere?
Industry observers are not so sure. They suggested he was far more interested in Kirch's 40 percent stake in Axel
Springer Verlag, publisher of the best-selling tabloid Bild.

Springer's chief executive is Gus Fischer, who also happens to be a former Murdoch man as a longtime executive at Murdoch's News Corp.



Page 62 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Kirch has denied speculation he was under pressure to sell his Springer stake to undo the damage from DF1, in which the company has already invested over one billion marks.
"We did not and do not intend to sell our Springer stake," Kirch executive Dieter Hahn told Reuters.

But one industry observer suggested that Kirch's willingness to make concessions to the European Commission on the pay TV alliance was an indication that he was under enormous financial pressure.
"Kirch could become more flexible now," the source said.

The Bavarian mogul Kirch, whose successful film empire is based on a 1950s gamble when he bought the German rights to Federico Fellini's then unknown classic "La Strada", has spent around 1.5 billion marks on the DF1 fiasco.

With less than 100,000 subscribers, DF1 is far behind expectations and its rival Premiere, which has around 1.6 million subscribers to its analogue services and 120,000 customers in its digital TV pilot project.

DF1 was to be the 71-year-old Kirch's last great gamble and the sky was the limit when in 1996 he dropped $5 billion in Hollywood for the rights to blockbuster films for DF1.

But DF1 flopped and Kirch was forced to strike a deal with arch rival Bertelsmann. If the alliance had been approved, Bertelsmann would have borne some of Kirch's DF1 losses. But now Kirch is on his own.

The stalemate in German pay TV emerges from the market strength of Bertelsmann and Kirch. Kirch has huge stockpiles of films and rights to programming, while Bertelsmann has secured the rights to live pay TV broadcasts of first division soccer.

Together Kirch and Bertelsmann hold both key pieces of the pay TV puzzle, but neither is able to win alone, which makes it less likely that Kirch will again dash off on his own.

In addition to DF1, Kirch and his family have holdings in German commercial television stations Sat1, Pro Sieben, sports channel DSF, as well as massive film rights, film production facilities, and a stake in Springer.

CPlus stake sale stands despite EU German TV block.

PARIS, May 28 (Reuters) - Canal Plus's sale last year of its stake in German pay TV group Premiere to German media mogul Leo Kirch is "irrevocable", Canal Plus chairman Pierre Lescure told a shareholders' meeting on Thursday.


On Wednesday the
European Commission decided to block a German pay TV alliance between Kirch,
Bertelsmann AG  and Deutsche  Telekom .

"The sale of Premiere is irrevocable. The first payment was put through on January 1," he said, adding that Kirch is committed to paying the remaining $500 million for the stake before next December.
Kirch and Bertelsmann last year agreed to pool forces in pay TV to get digital television off the ground in
Germany, following years of bitter rivalry which left Kirch in need of cash.

The EU's decision prevents Kirch and Bertelsmann from reshuffling their Premiere shareholdings to give each of them 50 percent of the pay television group.
CLT-Ufa, which groups the media interests of Bertelsmann and Luxembourg's Audiofina , said Wednesday that
Premiere's future was assured in the long term.
CLT-Ufa owns 37.5 percent of Premiere, while Kirch Group holds the remainder following its purchase of Canal
Plus's 37.5 percent stake.
Canal Plus would have posted a net loss for 1997 without the profit on its sale of the Premiere stake.

It posted a net attributable profit of 1.5 billion francs, after an exceptional gain of 2.2 billion from the sale. ((Paris newsroom, +33 1 4221 5452, fax +33 1 4236 1072, paris.newsroom@reuters.com).

German watchdog regrets EU pay TV veto.

FRANKFURT, May 28 (Reuters) - The president of the council of German media regulators on Thursday said the European Commission's veto against a pay television alliance between Germany's major players would slow development in the sector.
The Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to block a digital pay television alliance of media group
Bertelsmann, Bavarian film tycoon Leo Kirch and phone giant  Deutsche Telekom.

"I simply cannot see where competition is now supposed to come from," said Reiner Hochstein, who holds the rotating presidency of the Conference of Directors of State Media Regulators (DLM), in an interview with Reuters.
Hochstein said the Commission's decision to block the alliance would prove to be counterproductive.
It would probably reinforce existing monopolies, such as Kirch's control of the basic digital decoder technology or
Bertelsmann and Kirch's continued cooperation in Premiere, Germany's only pay TV channel.
"I don't know whether anyone else will invest in this market after this decision," said Hochstein.

Bertelsmann holds 37.5 percent of Premiere and Kirch has a 25 percent stake. Under a deal reached last year, French pay TV group Canal Plus will sell its 37.5 percent stake in Premiere to Kirch, who will then sell a 12.5 percent to Bertelsmann to make the two German firms equal partners.

But with the Commission decision that deal must now receive approval from Germany's Federal Cartel Office before it can be completed.

German Digital TV Deal Is Blocked  by Regulators

Europe's antitrust regulators yesterday blocked an ambitious digital television alliance among three of Germany's most powerful media companies, marking a milestone in the growing power of the EuropeanCommission over events in individual countries.

After months of negotiations, the Brussels-based  European Commission rejected the proposed alliance among Bertelsmann A.G., Germany's giant publishing and media conglomerate;  Deutsche Telekom A.G., the nation's dominant telephone and cable television company, and the Kirch Group, the Munich-based company that owns the German rights to billions of dollars worth of television programs and movies.

The decision was a big setback for developers of advanced television services in Germany. Because Germany is by far the largest television market in Europe, the collapse of the venture could affect the balance of power
among Europe's other media conglomerates.

It also creates major problems for Leo Kirch, the secretive but highly successful founder of the Kirch Group. His privately held company has invested billions of dollars in digital TV, much of it by buying rights to Hollywood movies. But it lacks enough of its own customers to make the gamble pay off.

The three companies wanted to deliver a wide array of pay-TV services, including dozens of television channels as well as pay-per-view movies and live sports events.

Karel van Miert, Europe's powerful and pugnacious competition commissioner, has warned for months that the proposed pact would create an unacceptable monopoly and has demanded numerous changes in the deal that would give other companies a chance to compete.

Among Mr. van Miert's demands, Bertelsmann said, was that the companies make their system accessible to competing TV programmers and that they allow rivals to buy and resell their shows and movies at prices favorable to the competitors.

After a last-ditch meeting on Tuesday with Mr. Kirch and Michael Dornemann, a top Bertelsmann executive, Mr. van Miert announced that attempts to reach a compromise had failed and that the European Commission had formally rejected the alliance.

''We wanted to find a solution that allowed the market to remain open,'' Mr. van Miert said. ''I went as far as to make a verbal proposal that was agreed to by Mr. Kirch but totally refused by Bertelsmann.''

Mr. Dornemann, who oversees Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment group, confirmed that his company had finally decided against making any further concessions.

''They demanded a lot, and we agreed to several levels of concessions,'' Mr. Dornemann said in a telephone interview. ''I call their latest requests a demand to subsidize our competitors.''

Although Mr. Dornemann said that Bertelsmann was still open to discussions about other kinds of relationships with the Kirch Group, he added the current plans to merge their pay-TV ventures ''are over.''

Until recently, all three companies in the proposed alliance had been preoccupied with gaining an advantage over the others. Bertelsmann and Kirch both own stakes in Premiere, Germany's existing pay-television service that

delivers several channels of hit movies by satellite. Kirch owns DF-1, an ambitious digital television service that offers dozens of channels and elaborate pay-per-view services.

Deutsche Telekom is Germany's dominant cable TV operator, and most German households receive their television programming over cable rather than via satellite. It was trying to gain power as a programming packager and marketer.

Kirch's problem has always been a lack of customers -- it has about 30,000 subscribers, and industry analysts estimate that it needs at least 200,000 to break even. Kirch has wanted to combine DF-1 with Premiere, which has more than a million customers and would provide the core customer base. But Bertelsmann had long been against the idea, and holds a veto over major decisions at Premiere.

Last year, the three companies reached a precarious deal to work together. But Mr. Van Miert quickly raised objections, arguing that the three companies would have clear monopoly power unless there were major changes to the plan.

EU Slaps Ban/Digital Pay-TV -2: Brussels, Cos Compromise

The meeting's aim was to forge a compromise between Brussels and the companies over how to structure the alliance to avoid antitrust problems. But it ended in acrimony, with Kirch offering last-minute concessions that Bertelsmann wouldn't back.

In an interview,  Bertelsmann's Dornemann said his would-be partner's concessions - which he says took him by surprise - went back on a pact to present a united face to the  commission. "In his apparent desperation, Kirch broke our agreement not to give in on this point," he says. "We can only guess that Kirch was willing to break all agreements to ensure that we share his financial obligations." Under the proposed alliance,  Bertelsmann would have picked up part of the tab for Kirch's film purchases in Hollywood.

Kirch executives are more polite - but no less disappointed. "It's legitimate for Bertelsmann to reject the commission's offer," says Kirch's Hahn. "But Kirch's move was also legitimate. At that moment, the issue wasn't loyalty (to a partner) to the end; the issue was what's the position of a 50% shareholder who will help carry the project."

He adds: "We had a very difficult time making the substantive concessions that we did. But at the very end, there was an offer on the table that required only small compromises, not new, major ones. At a moment like that you have to ask yourself whether those are worth killing a huge business deal."

Adds Hahn: "We can't reproach Bertelsmann for rejecting the deal on the table. But at that point the case was lost. It had no way of going through the way it was."

Politics had been an issue throughout - with several German politicians lobbying the commission to clear the merger, for the sake of a vibrant German TV sector. Hahn says that throughout the crucial meeting, Van Miert was contacting cabinet chiefs of his fellow commissioners. The word from them: If Bertelsmann won't accept a compromise, the commission should oppose the merger.
The next morning, it was all over. The commission's vote to block the merger - only its ninth such veto since 1990
- was unanimous. At a packed news conference later Wednesday in Brussels, Van Miert told journalists that he
had taken "extraordinary steps" to find a solution that would have allowed the merger to take place and an open
market for new digital-TV entrants to flourish."
The commission's thundering verdict ends another dramatic episode in Kirch's long struggle to build a digital
pay-TV business in Germany, Europe's largest market. That business took off with great fanfare on a sweltering
July day in 1996 when Kirch launched DF-1 as the country's first digital TV platform.

"DF-1 isn't a new channel; DF-1 is the new television," Kirch executives boasted that day, proudly displaying the outfit's many channels in a tent besides the Hockenheim racetrack in southern Germany. A giant wall of flickering TV screens beamed images from the German Grand Prix race held there from five different camera angles. Scantily clad young women poured champagne and ice water. It was a humiliating day for Bertelsmann, whose TV officials sat sour-faced in the back. And it was a triumph for Kirch.

EU Slaps Ban/Digital Pay-TV -4: No Further Concessions

Both companies say they had agreed to give no further concessions to Van Miert to win clearance of the merger. But Kirch offered what he considered minor, further compromises: that Premiere would allow other operators to show pay-per-view programs in addition to Premiere programming, and show Premiere only in specific regions. And Kirch said Premiere would pass on information on its own customers to competing companies, a commission demand that Kirch and  Bertelsmann long rejected.

In addition, Kirch showed willingness to accept another commission demand that said cable companies should pay a "suitable margin" to Premiere for being allowed to sell Premiere programs to the cable customers. Before Tuesday's meeting, the commission and the companies were at odds about the size of those payments. If the margin is too low, both Bertelsmann and Kirch said originally, competitors would have an unfair advantage. They would be allowed to operate profitably, they argued, while Premiere still has to stomach huge start-up losses.

Van Miert blames Bertelsmann for the collapse in negotiations, hinting that some of the company's executives were unenthusiastic about the deal. But Bertelsmann squarely rejects the accusation. "It wasn't our fault," says Dornemann. "If Van Miert is raising the bar to a point that makes the deal unprofitable for us, we have no choice but to reject it. But it is Van Miert who is wasting a chance for a functioning market.

Bertelsmann is now hoping to double its 37.5% stake in Premiere by buying out a partner, French pay-TV group Canal Plus; Kirch still owns a 25% stake. Under the terms of the failed merger, Kirch and Bertelsmann wanted to split Canal Plus's stake in a way that would leave each owning one half of Premiere. Kirch says the two sides must negotiate Premiere's future shareholder structure.

It is the Munich-based Kirch Group that is hit hardest by the commission's ruling. The EU's prohibition means that its investment in DF-1 is lost. More important, it leaves Kirch with billions of dollars in obligations to U.S. movie studios who have sold him the programming for DF-1. The Bavarian entrepreneur will be able to sell some of this programming to Premiere and other TV operators. But it is uncertain whether he can sell all of the rights, and whether he can recoup the high prices that he paid for them last year.

But Kirch officials insist that's no problem. Says Hahn: "Kirch will offer programming, and Premiere will buy it. They need programming. And I'm assuming that we'll have no problem agreeing on normal market conditions.'

Still, Bertelsmann executives remained deeply divided about the merits of the deal. After years of efforts and months of talks with Kirch, Dornemann was eager to see the agreement go through. Thomas Middelhoff, the designated chairman of the company, remained skeptical of the deal's merits. The divisions within the company remained up to the last minute and could have played a crucial part in the company's unwillingness to yield to Van Miert's demands.

But Bertelsmann shrugs off any suggestions that its plans with Kirch were half-hearted. "Our decision isn't directed against Kirch," says Bertelsmann spokesman Manfred Harnischfeger. "We wanted to do this with Kirch, but we can't do it at any price. If he can't keep his head above the water, that's no reason for us to act irrationally."

Pro Sieben To Attract  Scrutiny After E.U. TV Veto >G.PRO

BONN (Dow Jones)--Germany's Pro Sieben Media AG (G.PRO) will face scrutiny at its annual press conference on Friday about its future after the European Union Commission's veto Wednesday of the pay-TV merger between Kirch Group (G.KCH) and Bertelsmann AG (G.BRT).

Speculation that the Brussels veto could force Kirch Group into liquidity problems which force the sale of directly or indirectly held assets hit the Pro Sieben share price on Thursday. Nevertheless, at 1350 GMT, shares were DEM3.50 or 4.1% higher at DEM88.50 while the Xetra DAX was 0.2% higher at 5480.04 points.

Pro Sieben is legally a separate entity from the Kirch Group, but the man holding 58.4% of the company's voting stock is Thomas Kirch, son of Kirch Group owner, Leo Kirch.

"Pro Sieben says there's a strict separation (between it and Kirch Group), but of course there's speculation," said an analyst at a German bank on condition of anonymity.
Not that the company's recent performance gives reason for being downhearted. Pro Sieben in March boasted a
42.7% rise in pretax profit to DEM254 million in 1997 and a sales rise of 10.1% to DEM1.86 billion.

With a strong focus on the 14-49 age-group, which sends advertising executives salivating, the company's Pro 7 channel is only one of two private German TV channels to make any money. (The other is RTL, owned by Bertelsmann's TV-subsidiary CLT-Ufa.)

Thomas Kirch won't sell, says Michael Schatzschneider, analyst at BHF Bank AG in Frankfurt. "Pro 7 is profitable. Why should I sell what is a pearl in the TV business?"

EC slaps down digital  deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Commission blocked the proposed digital pay TV union between German broadcasters KirchGroup and Bertelsmann AG, exercising its anti-monopoly powers for the ninth time.
The decision, after months of wrangling, was formally announced Wednesday at a press conference by  EC
competition commissioner Karel van Miert.
But German phone giant Deutsche Telekom AG- another partner in the co-venture - and KirchGroup owner Leo
Kirch said Wednesday that they are prepared to make another offer to the EC for a planned pay TV alliance.
"We will certainly make another try," a DT spokesman said.

The KirchGroup said in a statement that it regretted the commission's decision and that it was "prepared to make a new offer together with its partners on the basis of the most recent compromise that was negotiated."

"This could be decided quickly since the commission has indicated that it would have given its approval with a broad majority if all parties had supported the solution reached," Kirch said.

Under the terms of the initial proposed alliance, Premiere, Bertelsmann's joint venture with France's Canal Plus and Kirch, would have become a multichannel digital pay TV service by incorporating Kirch's loss-making DF-1 digital platform, and using Kirch's d-box set-top decoders.

Until now, digital TV has been available in Germany only over satellite or through a few regional cable systems. Premiere sells digital programming to about 1.6 million customers by satellite. Kirch's DF-1 channel, which the company introduced in 1951, has 160,000 subscribers.

Van Miert said there had been "unanimous" agreement among the 20 commissioners to block joint control of Premiere by Kirch and CLT-UFA, the Luxembourg-based group that is Europe's largest broadcaster and combines the TV interests of Bertelsmann and Belgium's Audiofina.
A merger, the EC said, would create a pay TV monopoly in the German-speaking market

A parallel joint venture, involving Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom's joint ownership of BetaResearch - the company providing the access technology - was also blocked.

Van Miert said that despite a compromise reached with media tycoon Kirch and DT late Tuesday, the agreement was ultimately killed when the commissioners received written confirmation that Bertelsmann had ruled out any further concessions.

"Therefore, a final decision has been taken, "van Miert said. "Bertelsmann clearly confirmed in writing that there was no further possibility (of compromising), so there's not much point in waiting anymore."
The commission had until June 3 to reach a final decision on the case.

Although the deal essentially collapsed because of differences between the partners over what could be conceded and still keep the project commercially viable, van Miert indicated he would have preferred to clear the merger with conditions.

A CLT-UFA spokesman said the next move would be to negotiate with the KirchGroup again to secure a quick relaunch of Premiere's digital service.
The spokesman said that left two possibilities - the first that Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA increases its holding in
Premiere. "The second is that we are going to get a new partner, but we don't know who, to be honest"

Van Miert said, "We have to ensure that access to the market should be available in the future, even if in the immediate future it leads to a monopoly."

He added that at a hurriedly arranged meeting Tuesday with Leo Kirch, Michael Dornemann, the head of Bertelsmann's entertainment division, and Roll Schmidt-Holtz, CLT-UFA's CEO, had taken the "extraordinary step" of proposing a solution that would permit the commission to dear the deal.

Van Miert also rejected charges that the decision would set back the development of digital TV in Germany for years to come.

"That's not true. Things will still progress. The question was whether you need the market to be completely foreclosed for the future," he said.

EC president Jacques Santer is believed to have come under political pressure from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is close to Kirch, to approve the deal in order to avert the risk of major job losses at the group in the run-up to German elections.

KirchGroup said Wednesday that its finances would not be hit by the EC's decision. Manager Dieter Hahn said it would not compel Kirch to sell its 40% stake in publishing group Axel Springer.

The DF-1 service, which already operates at a loss, has been threatened with closure by Kirch if the merger were blocked.
Wednesday's ruling was only the ninth time that the commission has blocked a merger outright since it won the
European Union power to do so in 1990.

Three of the previous cases involved media concentrations: another Kirch-Bertelsmann-DT joint-venture, MSG Media, which was blocked in 1994; a Nordic Satellite joint-venture, and Holland Media Group, which were both banned in 1995.

Plans for Digital TV in Germany Suffer Setback As EU Commission Blocks  Bertelsmann Alliance

The European Union Commission rejected a planned television alliance of Germany's Kirch Group,
Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom AG, the country's dominant telephone and cable group.

The ban sets back the companies, which had invested millions of dollars, and delays development of digital pay TV in Germany,  Europe's largest market. The ruling is particularly painful for TV magnate Leo Kirch, the foremost figure in the effort to build a digital-TV business.

The European Commission decided to ban the alliance when Bertelsmann rejected a last-minute compromise offered by EU antitrust chief Karel Van Miert and accepted by Kirch and Deutsche Telekom. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Van Miert said he had taken "extraordinary steps" to find a solution.

The commission's decision is the latest jolt in the scramble to launch digital TV in Germany. Without Bertelsmann, which would have helped foot the bill, Mr. Kirch will be unable to build a digital-TV business in the near future. Under severe financial strain already, Kirch Group said it will shut DF-1, its ailing digital service, after yesterday's ban on merging DF-1 with Premiere, Germany's biggest pay-TV channel. Kirch owns 25% of Premiere; an additional 37.5% is held by CLT-UFA, which is jointly owned by Bertelsmann and Belgian media concern
Audiofina SA. It is unclear what will happen to the remaining 37.5% stake previously held by French pay-TV
group Canal Plus SA.

"We are not willing and able to keep carrying DF-1's losses," said Dieter Hahn, managing director of Kirch, in a telephone interview. "We can cope with losing what we have invested in DF-1 so far, but we can't cope with more."

Bertelsmann says it will turn Premiere into a digital channel. But its digitalization will be slower and on a smaller scale than intended because Premiere will lack Mr. Kirch's programming resources and the theme channels that DF-1 would have brought. Both the brouhaha surrounding the deal and the halt in decoder sales ordered by the commission while the case was pending have added to consumer uncertainty about digital TV.

By rejecting the merger, the commission asserts itself as a tough antitrust authority willing to face down political pressure. Four of nine mergers prohibited by the commission so far have been in the media field, including an earlier linkup between Kirch, Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom. Mr. Van Miert blamed Bertelsmann for the collapse in talks, but Bertelsmann has rejected the accusation.
"If Van Miert is raising the bar to a point that makes the deal unprofitable, we have no choice but to reject it," said
Michael Dornemann, who heads Bertelsmann's electronic-media unit.

For Munich-based Kirch Group, the prohibition means its investment in DF-1 is lost. It also leaves Kirch with large obligations to U.S. movie studios. Kirch says it can sell the programming rights to Premiere.
"We have always paid our bills in Hollywood, and we will pay them now," Mr. Hahn said. Document j000000020010917du5s00c0h

Euro competition: BT will sell off its Westminster and planned Milton Keynes franchises to appease  EU competitive concerns seeking the  Commission's green light for its involvement in British Interactive Broadcasting (BIB). Other BIBettes are BSkyB, the Midlands Bank and Matsushita Electric. Meanwhile  EU watchdog Karel Van Miert says the  Bertelsmann/Kirch Group's digital TV venture has run out of time to do the right thing to avoid stifling German digital competition.  Bertelsmann unit CLT-Ufa's president Rolf Schmidt-Holtz says his company has "bent over backwards and can't go further." The  Commission wants CLT-Ufa and Kirch to assume joint control of Premiere and roll Kirch's DF1 into the service.

Both Stream and Via Digital have selected OpenTV's software for the delivery of their interactive services to DBS and cable homes in their respective markets. Hallmark (dubbed in Czech and Slovak) will be added to Cable Plus' enhanced Klasik tier tomorrow. HEN will replace the Cable Plus Film Channel. Antec has nailed a significant Euro deal, to supply UPC operations with HFC systems. Norwegian MSO Janco Multicom will be the first UPC affiliate affected, as it upgrades from 450 to 870 MHz plant. The Norwegian part of the deal is valued at $9mln over 5 years. In Chinese hardware deals, Nortel won a contract from the Hebei Province Bureau of Radio, Film and TV, and Ericsson sold its multimedia platform to the Dalian Cable TV Company.

People: Bob Frost has stepped down as chief executive of the UK's Cable Communications Association. Mauricio Gerson's now Managing Director, Universal Studios Networks Latin America and Brasil. He, Cesar Sabroso and the gang are headed down Miami-ways as the networks consolidate operations and programming with ad and affiliate sales. Damaris Valero will add the ad and affiliate sales duties to her current roles in reporting to Gerson. Greg Armstrong is officially (finally) TINTA's Managing Director/Latin America. Canal+ Chairman Pierre Lescure, quoted in Les Echos: "Anything that can prevent Polygram Films from falling under American control is worth backing." He was referrring to Canal+'s possible bid for Polygram's lensing unit, following the Seagram's acquisition.

One more reason to watch you say and do in Singapore: Following an accident in which 3 women waiting at a bus stop were run down and killed by a car salesman who became distracted during a mobile phone call, Singapore's police authorities have vowed to confiscate the phone of anyone seen using it while driving. Currently, there is only a $100 fine applicable.

Attention Superbowl, World Series and NBA widows: You are not alone. European wives and sweethearts are taking matters into their own hands during the upcoming World Cup by forming "anti-foot" cells, dedicated to the resistance to, ridicule of and escape from World Cup fever sweeping the continent. In France, football-free zones have been declared, and women are wearing t-shirts that say "I'm free tonight, there's football on the telly" and "Exploit an idiot: Rent a room to a football fan." On the anti-foot web-site, the World Cup rooster mascot is shown impaled on a spit, and in a spirited show of defiance, Parisian women have rented the Elysee Montmartre Theatre for a femmes- only evening with the lads from Chippendale's. Alternatives aside, here's Steve the Tout's prediction: Brasil and Germany in the final.

Zap! EU Slaps a Ban On German Venture In Digital Pay-TV --- Veto by Commission Foils Plans by
Bertelsmann, Kirch, Deutsche Telekom --- Cliffhanger With a Moral
By staff reporters Cacilie Rohwedder in Bonn and Julie Wolf in Brussels

Germany's longest-running TV drama came to a climax Wednesday as the  European Commission vetoed a planned alliance among three of the country's biggest media powers. Next comes the denouement -- and it's likely to be grim viewing.
The commission's cliffhanger decision, following months of closed-door talks, scuttled plans to pool the
digital-television interests of  Bertelsmann AG, the country's biggest media conglomerate;  Deutsche Telekom
AG, the dominant German phone and cable-TV company; and Kirch Group, the country's biggest provider of
television programming.

It's bad news for all three -- but especially for Leo Kirch, the enigmatic 71-year-old founder of Kirch Group and the foremost fighter in the drawn-out struggle to build a digital TV business in Germany. Without a partner in Bertelsmann, which would have helped foot the bills in a team effort, Mr. Kirch's ambitions in digital-TV may
wither; his firm had already spent heavily to line up new Hollywood programming for the digital-TV venture. Indeed, immediately after the commission's decision was announced, Kirch Group said it will shut down DF-1, its existing, loss-making digital service.

Ensuing industry talks -- which analysts speculate could include Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. -- may produce new plot twists. But for now the commission's decision is a body-blow.

"We are not willing and able to keep carrying DF-1's losses," said Dieter Hahn, managing director of Kirch. "We can cope with losing what we have invested in DF-1 so far, but can't cope with more. We can handle the one billion marks ($579 million) we have paid in the past, but we couldn't handle an additional one or two billion."

But the decision also raises broader questions about how digital television -- widely touted as the next generation of broadcasting -- will evolve in Europe. Will it become a market populated by a handful of interlinked multinationals, or as a more-fragmented -- and potentially slower growing -- sector? For Germany, analysts say, the commission's veto may delay digital-TV's growth, as the protoganists take time to regroup.

Yet Wednesday's veto was the commission's fourth in the European media sector in recent years, as the executive body has repeatedly frowned on the efforts of the Continent's media giants to meet the high start-up costs of their new ventures by combining, rather than competing. "We've got to ensure that {the digital TV market} remains an open market," said Karel Van Miert, the European Union's feisty competition commissioner at a news conference Wednesday. He predicted that he will probably see more such merger cases coming his way.

But the tale of how this deal got vetoed is the stuff of soap opera -- and instructive to anyone trying to piece out the future of this industry. After months of increasingly acrimonious bickering between commission officials and the German partners, it all came to a head Tuesday in a Brussels meeting among Mr. Van Miert and two of the German protagonists -- Mr. Kirch and Michael Dornemann, chief of Bertelsmann's electronic media business.

The meeting's aim was to forge a compromise between Brussels and the companies over how to structure the alliance to avoid antitrust problems. But it ended in acrimony, with Kirch offering last-minute concessions that Bertelsmann wouldn't back.

In an interview, Bertelsmann's Mr. Dornemann said his would-be partner's concessions -- which he says took him by surprise -- went back on a pact to present a united face to the commission. "In his apparent desperation, {Mr.} Kirch broke our agreement not to give in on this point," he says. "We can only guess that {Mr.} Kirch was willing to

Page 80 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
break all agreements to ensure that we share his financial obligations." Under the proposed alliance, Bertelsmann would have picked up part of the tab for Mr. Kirch's film purchases in Hollywood.

Kirch executives are more polite -- but no less disappointed. "It's legitimate for Bertelsmann to reject the commission's offer," says Kirch's Mr. Hahn. "But Mr. Kirch's move was also legitimate. At that moment the issue wasn't loyalty {to a partner} to the end; the issue was what's the position of a 50% shareholder who will help carry the project." He adds: "We had a very difficult time making the substantive concessions that we did. But at the very end, there was an offer on the table that required only small compromises, not new, major ones. At a
moment like that you have to ask yourself whether those are worth killing a huge business deal."

Adds Mr. Hahn: "We can't reproach Bertelsmann for rejecting the deal on the table. But at that point the case was lost. It had no way of going through the way it was.

Politics had been an issue throughout -- with several German politicians lobbying the commission to clear the merger, for the sake of a vibrant German TV sector. Mr. Hahn says that throughout the crucial meeting, Mr. Van Miert was contacting cabinet chiefs of his fellow-commissioners. The word from them: If Bertelsmann won't accept a compromise, the commission should oppose the merger.
The next morning, it was all over. The commission's vote to block the merger -- only its ninth such veto since
1990 -- was unanimous. At a packed news conference later Wednesday in Brussels, Mr. Van Miert told journalists
that he had taken "extraordinary steps" to find a solution that would have allowed the merger to take place and an
open market for new digital-TV entrants to flourish."

The commission's thundering verdict ends another dramatic episode in Mr. Kirch's long struggle to build a digital pay-TV business in Germany, Europe's largest market. That business took off with great fanfare on a sweltering July day in 1996 when Mr. Kirch launched DF-1 as the country's first digital TV platform.

"DF-1 isn't a new channel, DF-1 is the new television," Kirch executives boasted that day, proudly displaying the outfit's many channels in a tent besides the Hockenheim racetrack in southern Germany. A giant wall of flickering TV screens beamed images from the German Grand Prix race held there from five different camera angles. Scantily clad young women poured champagne and ice water. It was a humiliating day for Bertelsmann, whose TV officials sat sour-faced in the back. And it was a triumph for Mr. Kirch.
That high soon turned into a hangover. Kirch had hoped for 200,000 subscribers to its new service by the end of
1996. But even after the lucrative Christmas season, DF-1 had a mere 30,000 digital customers. In February
1997, Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. canceled plans to take a stake in DF-1. Kirch was left alone with his struggling
service, mounting cost and financial woes reportedly threatening its very existence.

The rescue came in June 1997. After months of haggling and political pressure to make up for the sake of the German TV market, Kirch and Bertelsmann struck a truce and agreed to join forces -- combining Kirch's DF-1 with Premiere, Germany's largest pay-TV venture and a Bertelsmann-controlled project. A joint news conference in September 1997 was the exact reverse of the day in Hockenheim: This time, Kirch's Mr. Hahn sat under a large Premiere logo, listening to Bertelsmann executives gloating about being right all along. Gottfried Zmeck, the head of DF-1, sat in the back, looking as pale and tired as a man who has lost a battle.

But they hadn't counted on Mr. Van Miert. In 1994, he had blocked a first attempt by the three companies to join forces in digital TV. His inquiry into the new alliance plan got off to a bad-tempered start last November when he threatened to fine the companies if they went ahead with their venture without first seeking clearance from him, as he maintained EU merger regulation required. Relations deteriorated in December, when the commission forced Bertelsmann and Kirch to stop marketing their digital-TV decoder boxes, pending the outcome of his merger inquiries.

When the commission opened an in-depth four-month inquiry into the case last January, it issued an unusually blunt press release saying that the combined Premiere-DF-1 would have a monopoly on the German pay-TV market. "It must be feared that after the merger, Premiere could become permanently the only pay-TV broadcasting and marketing platform in Germany, which would be in a position to determine the conditions under which other broadcasters could compete," it said.

During the past two months, Kirch and Bertelsmann officials and lobbyists have been frequent visitors at the commission's Brussels headquarters. German politicians also used meetings with commissioners to plead in favor of the companies. Wolfgang Clement, governor of German state Northrhein-Westphalia -- Bertelsmann's home base -- brought up the case during talks on other issues in Dusseldorf earlier this month with EU Regional

Page 81 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies. German media reported that foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called his countryman, EU Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, asking for support in the case.

The last few days of negotiations mirrored the frantic activity that led up to the commission's decision last July to clear the merger between Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. This time, however, there was no late-night deal on the eve of the commission's weekly meeting. After talking among themselves Tuesday at Bertelsmann's office in an art nouveau townhouse in Brussels, Messrs. Kirch and Dornemann moved on to a mid-afternoon session with Mr. Van Miert.

Both companies say they had agreed to give no further concessions to Mr. Van Miert to win clearance of the merger. But Mr. Kirch offered what he considered minor, further compromises: that Premiere would allow other operators to show pay-per-view programs in addition to Premiere programming, and show Premiere only in specific regions. And Mr. Kirch said Premiere would pass on information on its own customers to competing companies, a commission demand that Kirch and Bertelsmann long rejected.

In addition, Mr. Kirch showed willingness to accept another commission demand that said cable companies should pay a "suitable margin" to Premiere for being allowed to sell Premiere programs to the cable customers. Before Tuesday's meeting, the Commission and the companies were at odds about the size of those payments. If the margin is too low, both Bertelsmann and Kirch said originally, competitors would have an unfair advantage. They would be allowed to operate profitably, they argued, while Premiere still has to stomach huge start-up
losses.

Mr. Van Miert blames Bertelsmann for the collapse in negotiations, hinting that some of the company's executives were unenthusiastic about the deal. But Bertelsmann squarely rejects the accusation. "It wasn't our fault," says
Mr. Dornemann. "If {Mr.} Van Miert is raising the bar to a point that makes the deal unprofitable for us we have no choice but to reject it. But it is {Mr.} Van Miert who is wasting a chance for a functioning market.

Bertelsmann is now hoping to double its 37.5% stake in Premiere by buying out a partner, French pay-TV group Canal Plus; Kirch still owns a 25% stake. Under the terms of the failed merger, Kirch and Bertelsmann wanted to split Canal Plus's stake in a way that would leave each owning one half of Premiere. Kirch says the two sides must negotiate Premiere's future shareholder structure.

It is the Munich-based Kirch Group that is hit hardest by the Commission's ruling. The EU's prohibition means that its investment in DF-1 is lost. More importantly, it leaves Mr. Kirch with billions of dollars in obligations to
American movie studios who have sold him the programming for DF-1. The Bavarian entrepreneur will be able to sell some of this programming to Premiere and other TV operators. But it is uncertain whether he can sell all of the rights, and whether he can recoup the high prices that he paid for them last year.

But Kirch officials insist that's no problem. Says Mr. Hahn:"Kirch will offer programming, and Premiere will buy it. They need programming. And I'm assuming that we'll have no problem agreeing on normal market conditions.'

Still, Bertelsmann executives remained deeply divided about the merits of the deal. After years of efforts and months of talks with Kirch, Mr. Dornemann was eager to see the agreement go through. Thomas Middelhoff, the designated chairman of the company, remained skeptical of the deal's merits. The divisions within the company remained up to the last minute and could have played a crucial part in the company's unwillingness to yield to Mr. Van Miert's demands. But Bertelsmann shrugs off any suggestions that its plans with Kirch were half-hearted. "Our decision isn't directed against Kirch," says Bertelsmann spokesman Manfred Harnischfeger. "We wanted to do this with Kirch but we can't do it at any price. If he can't keep his head above the water, that's no reason for us to act irrationally."

The European Commission will block the proposed German digital pay-TV alliance between Kirch and
Bertelsmann, despite last minute efforts from competition commissioner Karel van Miert to find a solution.

Speaking at a Brussels press conference on Wednesday (27 May), van Miert said a deal struck on Tuesday, to extend access to the joint-venture's digital pay-TV platform, Premiere, to regional cable operators, was approved by Kirch but not by  Bertelsmann.
Once the commission heard Bertelsmann's reply it voted unanimously to prohibit the joint-venture. See page 13.

Having rejected the planned pay-TV alliance of two of Germany's media giants, the  European Commission is expected to this week outline proposals to ensure greater competition in the country's fledgling digital TV market.
The proposed alliance between media mogul Leo Kirch and  Bertelsmann AG would have provided digital TV
using cable operator  Deutsche Telekom AG, Germany's largest phone company.

The commission's decision, which ruled out the alliance on the grounds that it could create a monopoly, could now pave the way for other groups move into the market.

Kirch seen scrambling to undo pay TV damage.

BONN, May 29 (Reuters) - German media tycoon Leo Kirch may be preparing to sell his 40 percent stake in Axel
Springer Verlag, publisher of the tabloid Bild newspaper, to pay off digital TV debts, media reports said on Friday.
Kirch has denied he wants to sell the stake in Springer, but the European Commission's veto of a digital pay TV
alliance with Bertelsmann and phone giant Deutsche Telekom leaves him scrambling to pay off huge debts.

The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel reported Friday that Kirch's DF1 digital pay TV channel lost 900 million marks ($505.8 million) from 1996 to the end of last year.

Citing figures received from CLT-Ufa, Bertelsmann's television unit, it said additional losses of around 400 million marks were expected in the first half of this year.

The Berliner Zeitung daily newspaper reported that Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, has agreed to come to the aid of the Bavarian media mogul.

It said Deutsche planned to take over Kirch's liabilities from the Bankgesellschaft Berlin, estimated at over one billion marks.

Kirch reportedly failed to secure an extended credit line at the bank, even after putting up his Springer shares as collateral, because of the digital TV losses and a pending investigation into his finances by Munich prosecutors for alleged tax evasion.

The move seemed to be aimed at returning control over the shares to Kirch. Citing Frankfurt banking sources, the Berliner Zeitung said Deutsche wanted to prevent Kirch from "reacting hastily" should he decide to sell the Springer shares.

"Kirch and his new partner will have full control over all of the Springer shares with the transfer of the billion mark credit from Bankgesellschaft Berlin," Berliner Zeitung said.

The Berliner Zeitung said Kirch has booked the Springer shares at 1.225 billion marks, while their current market value was over two billion.
Deutsche Bank and Bankgesellschaft Berlin declined comment.
"We do not comment on rumours about our credit activities," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said. Kirch is not required to publish details of his finances and was not available for comment.
The commission's veto of the pay TV alliance was a serious blow to the Bavarian's film empire, according to Der
Spiegel.

Had the alliance been approved, it said, Bertelsmann would have paid Kirch 600 million marks as a result of merging Kirch's DF1 with their jointly owned Premiere pay TV channel. Premiere would also have paid Kirch 1.7 billion marks for films from Kirch's deals with Hollywood studios.
"This injection of cash is now missing," wrote Der Spiegel.

German television - Karel's service.

EUROPE'S biggest television market, Germany, has been thrown into confusion by the  European Commission's veto on May 27th of an alliance involving two German media giants,  Bertelsmann and the Kirch group, plus Deutsche Telekom. The companies had wanted to create a new digital pay-TV venture by merging Premiere, a pay-TV operation jointly controlled by Kirch and CLT-Ufa, a Luxembourg-based firm 49%-owned by  Bertelsmann, with Kirch's own DF-1 pay-TV channel.  Deutsche Telekom, which is the biggest cable-TV operator in Germany, was to have joined the two media groups as part-owner of the necessary set-top decoders.

Karel Van Miert, the EU's competition commissioner, had all along declared that the commission was ready to block the merger plan because it would create a monopoly in German digital-TV, which newcomers would be unable to challenge thanks to the three firms' control of the set-top box. The commission had blocked a previous joint proposal in 1994; last year, pending its decision on the merger, it stopped the firms from distributing the decoders. Yet Bertelsmann and Kirch still seem to have believed that political pressure might save the deal.

The German government became involved - Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a friend of Leo Kirch's, even warned the commission that a veto would spell war. And through CLT-Ufa, a big employer in Luxembourg, Bertelsmann also lobbied Jacques Santer, the Luxembourger who is the commission's president. Rumours spread that his fellow commissioners might outvote Mr Van Miert, arguing that to block the deal would hold back Europe's nascent digital-TV industry, making it even more vulnerable to Rupert Murdoch and Hollywood.

All to no avail. The ruling, Mr Van Miert emphasises, was unanimously approved by the 20-strong commission. Only further big concessions over the ownership of the set-top technology or of Kirch's extensive film rights could have won the commission's approval. At the last minute, according to Mr Van Miert, both Kirch and Deutsche Telekom seemed ready to make concessions. But Bertelsmann refused, arguing the terms would make the new venture unprofitable. "We would have to subsidise our competition," complained Michael Dornemann, the head of Bertelsmann entertainments. "That is asking too much."

The result is something of a triumph for Mr Van Miert, who has again shown, as he did last year over the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, that the commission is a competition authority not easily intimidated by politicians. But it leaves Germany's pay-TV market in disarray. After the decision, Kirch said it would close DF-1, which has failed to catch on in Germany and is losing money - leaving the profitable Premiere alone in the market (this may explain why Bertelsmann, its part-owner, was ready to let the deal die). Mr Van Miert is unruffled: the important thing, he says, is not to prevent transient monopolies from being created, but to ensure that the future market is genuinely open to newcomers.

What next? Mr Van Miert says he expects to see new proposals from Germany within the next 12 months. No doubt Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom are ready to try again. Through Premiere, Bertelsmann still has access to Kirch's movie and sports programmes, including gems like the World Cup in 2002 and 2006. However, Mr Dornemann says Bertelsmann will scale back the DM3 billion ( $1.7 billion) investment planned in digital TV over the next three years.

The bigger question is over Kirch. Having invested DM1.5 billion in the joint venture - a third more than the much larger Bertelsmann - and paid a fortune for rights to what is Europe's biggest catalogue of sports and movies, Kirch is perilously short of cash. As well as facing a pile of debt, the group is labouring under a tax investigation. Closing down DF-1 may not be much help. Kirch has spent a lot building up its programming for DF-1 on the assumption that it could recoup the investment in subscriptions that were never taken out.

The venture was designed to overcome that problem. Now that it has been rejected, Kirch is left with a 25% stake in Premiere, Germany's only pay-TV group apart from DF-1. But Premiere is chiefly an analogue station and numbers only 1.6m of Germany's 33m TV viewers among its subscribers. Without Bertelsmann's cash or control

of a pay-TV station, Kirch's prospects look dull. Kirch could sell its rights, but there are few likely bidders apart from Premiere. It will also be hard to renegotiate contracts with the Hollywood studios. Mr Van Miert may have succeeded, where many critics of Leo Kirch have failed, in thoroughly undermining the German media mogul's empire.

Pay dirt.

The European Commission unanimously blocked a German pay-television merger on competition grounds, throwing the emerging industry there into confusion. Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, reached a compromise with two members of the alliance, Kirch and  Deutsche Telekom, but a third,  Bertelsmann, balked. Trinity, Britain's largest regional newspaper group, withdrew from the fray after Germany's largest newspaper publisher, Axel Springer, declared it was interested in Mirror Group, publishers of the mass-market Daily Mirror, and valued at some Pounds sterling
1.1 billion ( $1.8 billion). Mirror Group's share price shot up.

Vendex International is to merge its food division with De Boer Unigro to create a Dutch supermarket group second only to Ahold. The merger will take the form of an equity swap to be fixed in July; shares in both soared, giving a total market value of close to 5 billion guilders ( $2.5 billion).

The Federal Trade Commission was reported to be preparing an antitrust action against Intel, accusing the chip maker of abusing its monopoly strength to deter competitors. After the Justice Department's case against Microsoft, this would be a second big assault on the "Wintel" PC standard.

Netscape Communications reported higher revenues than expected in the quarter to end-April. But year-on-year figures for January show that the firm's share of the Internet browser market has continued to slide, from 63% to
54%; Microsoft's rose from 21% to 39%.

Might that change? A new way of selling PCs was announced by Gateway, one of the three biggest producers dealing directly with customers. For a fixed fee per month, buyers will get a PC, unlimited access to the Internet and - a blow to Microsoft - a choice of Microsoft Explorer or Netscape Navigator.

The Russian oil industry buckled under the strain of low oil prices. Two big integrated oil firms, Yukos and Sibneft, said they were calling off a planned merger. And an auction for the last big state-owned oil firm, Rosneft, attracted no bidders willing to pay the asking price of at least $2.1 billion.

Usinor took a large stake in Brazil's steel market. The French steel maker takes control of Acesita with the purchase of a 30% stake for 720m reals ( $626m). Indirectly, it also gains a 16% stake in CST, a small maker of steel slabs thought to have potential.

The money-losing New Yorker magazine, owned by S.I. Newhouse's Advance Publications, replaced its president, Thomas Florio, with his brother, Steven.
Healthcare firms had a string of successful operations in America. Tyco International bought U.S. Surgical for
$3.3 billion. McKesson, an American medical supplier signed a $5 billion deal with hospital chain Columbia/ HCA.
United Healthcare has acquired Humana, another American health-care provider, for $5.5 billion.

The battle for Britain's More Group continues. A bid from Decaux of France has been referred to the monopolies commission on the ground that the new group would control too much of the bus-shelter and billboard market. Then America's Clear Channel made a better offer. Decaux said it would pay #522m ( $851m) if the commission allowed it rebid, topping Clear Channel's #475m.
Japan's giant Toshiba, maker of everything from chips to nuclear power stations, declared a profit of Y 7.3 billion (
$59.5m) in the year to end-March, a fall of 89% from the Y 67 billion earned the year before. The company
blamed the Asian crisis, vigorous competition in PCs and depressed consumer demand.
Page 89 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Border-hoppingA Dutch bank, ABN Amro, launched an unsolicited bid for Generale de Banque, raising the possibility of a bidding war for Belgium's biggest bank. Its offer of 24.5 billion guilders ( $12.2 billion) tops that of Fortis, a Belgo-Dutch insurance and banking group, which might be tempted to bid again.

Japan's banks continued the Augean task of clearing out their bad loans, declaring vast losses (and a few tiny profits) in the process. The country's top 18 banks declared a collective loss of Y 4.35 trillion ( $35.4 billion), with provisions totalling Y 10 trillion. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, the world's biggest, announced a stunning pre-tax loss of Y 918 billion - close to $7.5 billion. Moody's cut its ratings and those of four other banks, and put four more under review.

The Polish government announced terms for an initial public offering of 15% of Pekao. It values the country's largest commercial bank at as much as 6.2 billion zlotys ( $1.8 billion).

London's futures exchange, LIFFE, will introduce all-day electronic trading by second quarter next year, earlier than planned. The announcement ends speculation that the exchange would buy an existing system to start
all-day electronic trading immediately.
At opposite ends
Industrial output in Japan dropped in April by 1.1%, a fall of 6.2% on a year earlier, and the yen sank to a
seven-year low against the dollar. But the OECD said that Japan's new fiscal-stimulus package, if enacted quickly
enough, could avert a serious recession and even bring growth of 1.5-2% this fiscal year. America's economy
keeps on growing: new figures showed that GDP in the first quarter rose by an annualised 4.8%.

DIGITAL TV - COMMISSION BLOCKS GERMAN MERGER DEALS.
804 words
30 May 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
Despite eleventh-hour attempts to meet regulatory concerns over the double merger deal through which media groups Kirch and Bertelsmann were planning to link up with telecoms giant  Deutsche Telekom to provide digital pay-TV in German-speaking Europe, the European Commission finally decided on May 27 to block the venture. Announcing the Decision to the Brussels press corps, EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert explained that the twenty Commissioners had reached a unanimous position on the case after  Bertelsmann management had been unable to agree extra concessions to ensure an open market in the sector in years to come. This is only the ninth merger deal to be categorically disallowed by the  EU competition watchdog since the  EU Merger Regulation came into force in September 1990.
Unusual step.

Karel Van Miert explained he had made every effort to find a solution and had taken the unusual step of outlining to company management on May 26 a set of conditions that would enable him to recommend approval for the German digital TV alliance. The Commission's habitual stance is that its job is to examine remedy offers tabled by the parties involved, not vice-versa. The planned alliance would have involved joint ownership of the Premiere
pay-TV business by Bertelsmann-run CLT-Ufa and Kirch - currently the only two companies offering digital television packages in the Federal Republic - plus joint ownership of technical services provider BetaDigital and a three-way deal with Deutsche Telekom to run network software developer BetaResearch (for full details of the partners' plans see European Report N degrees s 2317, 2316, 2287 and 2283).
Parties split.

The parties had already agreed to sell off around 25% of the film and sports rights held by Kirch, license out the Premiere subscription programme package to rival cable operators, and allow other firms to take stakes in BetaResearch. However, Mr Van Miert - who was still concerned that the link-up would enable the partners to achieve the sort of dominance in the markets for digital pay-TV and technical services for pay-TV in Germany
(both satellite-and cable-borne) that would effectively bar rivals from entering the business in future - wanted them to inter alia allow the Premiere package to be broken down for pay-per-view purposes. The Commissioner was also unhappy that Premiere intended to maintain direct sales links with customers while cable operators who bought the package would not have this contact and he further wanted to ensure the package would be made available at a reasonable price, with provisions for independent commercial arbitration. Kirch was prepared to make this final concession to open competition, but Bertelsmann management demurred, following up with a written rejection of the condition on May 27.

Since the Decision was announced, the Kirch team has let it be known it is still working for an agreement along the lines suggested by Mr Van Miert. Bertelsmann, on the other hand, has insisted there is no commercial logic in a merger on Mr Van Miert's terms, which would mean "subsidising competitors" who have not shouldered the burden of developing digital TV, but would have the way into the business made smooth for them.
More deals to come?

For his part, the Commissioner paid respect to Leo Kirch for his strenuous efforts to keep the merger deal on the road, while castigating the parties in general for "wasting a lot of time" before coming to grips in a serious manner with his objections. The EU competition supremo said he would have preferred to see the deal go ahead under appropriate terms, as the development of digital television is an important area for the European Union economy. "I'm sure there will be other alliances on the table shortly", he said, referring inter alia to the five-company Italian project, details of which are still eagerly awaited by the Commission's competition officials.
German inquiry soon.

Although Bertelsmann and Kirch will not now be allowed to fuse their separate digital TV businesses, and Kirch's DF1 channel is quite likely to fold under the weight of its accumulated debts, the two companies continue to be joint owners of pay-TV enterprise Premiere. French-based Canal+ has confirmed its plan to sell its stake in Premiere to Kirch, which will take the Munich-based firm's share to 62.5%, triggering an antitrust investigation by German monopolies office the Bundeskartellamt. A spokesman for Bertelsmann said on May 28 that the two companies would have to sit down together shortly and thrash out the question of future ownership of Premiere. If DF1 does go under, Premiere may then be able to snap up the film rights held by Kirch at bargain prices, some commentators have suggested.

Murdoch  and Germany's  Kirch reportedly talking  TV link-up

BONN, May 31 (AFP) - Media magnates Rupert Murdoch and Germany's Leo Kirch are believed to be negotiating a pay-TV alliance, Die Welt daily reported Sunday.
The move comes after the  European Commission vetoed a proposed link-up between German media groups
Kirch and Bertelsmann in a major television deal.

Kirch spokesman, Johannes Schmitz, declined Sunday to comment on the reported negotiations stating: "We don't comment on speculation."

Schmitz said that the group was still hoping to make a fresh proposal for the deal rejected by the EU whereby Kirch's DF1 channel would merge with Premier, a joint venture owned by Kirch, Bertelsmann and the French Canal plus television channel.

According to Die Welt, Schmitz denied that Kirch was negotiating with Murdoch to sell parts of the private Sat 1 channel and the Springer publishers that it owns, in order to clear losses at DF1.
Kirch is believed to be in difficulty, after start-up losses of its DF1 digital television venture soared to just under
900 million marks (505.6 million dollars) between the launch in mid-1996 and the end of last year, or 15 times as
much as sales.
It then booked additional losses of some 400 million marks in the first half of this year.

Had the pay-TV merger with Bertelsmann come about, Kirch would have received 600 million marks in compensation. Furthermore, the joint pay-TV channel Premiere would have paid 1.7 billion marks to Kirch for films from Kirch's deals with Hollywood studios and programmes from its archives.
Following the EU's decision to block the merger, this cash injection for Kirch will no longer be forthcoming. lal/awb/jly

Kirch in talks with Murdoch  on pay TV - paper.

HAMBURG, May 31 (Reuters) - Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch is in talks with Rupert Murdoch about renewing their cooperation in the German digital pay television market, the weekly Welt am Sonntag newspaper said on Sunday.

The newspaper said Kirch and Murdoch began talks immediately after the European Commission last week rejected Kirch's planned digital TV alliance with phone giant Deutsche Telekom and media group Bertelsmann.

Kirch is reportedly interested in selling some or all of his 43 percent holdings in television station SAT1 or his 40 percent stake in Axel Springer Verlag , publisher of Die Welt, Welt am Sonntag, and best-selling tabloid Bild.
The newspaper quoted Kirch executive Dieter Hahn, who declined to comment, and Murdoch spokeswoman Jane
Reed.
"I can provide no information about that," said Reed.

Murdoch bailed out of a digital TV alliance with Kirch's DF1 channel early last year, but said recently that he now regretted the decision.
Kirch set up DF1 in 1996 to compete against Premiere, the Hamburg-based pay TV channel in which Kirch holds
25 percent. Other shareholders are Bertelsmann and French pay TV group Canal Plus .

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM - The  European Commission last week rejected a proposed merger of German
digital-satellite platform DF.1, which is run by The Kirch Group, and pay TV operation Premiere, which is owned
by CLT-Ufa and Kirch.

EC antitrust commissioner Karel van Miert said the  EC rejected compromise proposals because  Bertelsmann AG, part-owner of CLT-Ufa, refused a compromise suggested by the  EC. Bertelsmann board member Michael Domemann explained that this compromise would have destroyed Premiere's branding because cable operators would have been allowed to unbundle Premiere services into their own bouquets.

EC COMMISSIONERS GERMAN VOTE: VETO IT
760 words
1 June 1998
European Media Business & Finance
EUMB
Vol. 8, Issue: 11
English
(c) 1998 Phillips Business Information, Inc.
Amidst a wailing and a gnashing of teeth (Leo Kirch) and an indifferent shrugging of the shoulders (Bertelsmann), the 20 members of the  European Commission unanimously voted to veto the planned merger of Premiere and DF1 to create a one-size-fits-all digital service for the whole of Germany.
Kirch already has announced that he is seeking permission to reapply, but Bertelsmann chairman Michael
Dornemann indicated that his company is no longer interested in seeking EC approval.

"These delays have already placed Premiere in a precarious financial position and has caused a massive back-log of much needed investment," he said. "Any further delay would destroy our Christmas season...

"Pay-TV and the creation of a new digital service remains at the heart of our new-media strategy," Dornemann continued. "But we have had to make enough concessions. Any more and the whole project is doomed to fail."

This uncompromising stance, plus the fact that Bertelsmann failed to make 11th hour concessions (which Kirch was prepared to make) have brought out the conspiracy theorists who believe Bertelsmann was not genuinely interested in getting the project off the ground. Instead, speculation has Bertelsmann using the negotiations as a vehicle to draw arch-rival Kirch out on a financial limb. Indeed, had the merger gone ahead, Bertelsmann would have paid Kirch DM500 million ($280.58 million) for the development of the d-Box decoder.
"It would have been a catastrophe if the merger would have gone ahead," RTL boss Helmut Thoma said.

The EC's competition commissioner Karel van Miert pointed his finger squarely at Bertelsmann for killing the deal. Van Miert said Dornemann's refusal to make concessions brought the final vote up to last week (May 27), a week earlier than necessary.
Two days before the May 27 vote, 19 of the 20 members of the EU Commission voted to veto with only
Luxembourg dissented. Just 11 commissioners were needed to ban the merger.

Brussels was the scene of intensive lobbying both for and against imposing a ban. A first vote still gave Kirch and CLT-Ufa five commissioners supporting the merger. That may not be many, but the group included EU Commission President Jacques Santer, Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Infrastructure Commissioner Monika Wulf-Matthies.

Santer and other commissioners are said to have been approached by the German Chancellor Helmuth Kohl, as well as leading members of the German SPD opposition party, all seeking support for the merger. The German politicians pointed to the British and U.S. markets (which are in the process of introducing digital television) arguing that - once again - Germany would be left behind in the introduction of new technology.

Chancellor Kohl stated, "The timely introduction of digital television is of immense technological and economic importance."

Thus far the digital revolution has been decidedly underwhelming in Germany. Premiere has 1.6 million subscribers and has not yet made an operating profit. The DF1 digital service has just 160,000 subscribers after one year of operation and is reported to have cost Kirch DM1 billion ($561.1 million) to set up. Kirch also is reported to have commitments worth a further DM6 billion to DM7 billion ($3.37 billion to $3.93 billion) over the next eight years for Hollywood film rights.

Private telephone company o.tel.o (a joint venture between power companies Veba and RWE) also submitted an alternative proposal to the EU in which the backbone cable system, the local supplier and the programme supplier would be three separate bodies.


Page 97 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The o.tel.o model sees the d-Box being used jointly by Deutsche Telekom and o.tel.o to provide a national digital network that would be marketed by 10 to 15 local cable suppliers. In return, DT would drop plans to co-operate with Kirch and Bertelsmann.

Commissioner van Miert is said to favour a forced separation of cable and telephone by insisting that DT sell its cable system. Although in the past DT chairman Ron Sommer has turned down any idea of a sell-off, DT's multimedia board member Gerd Tenzer admitted that DT has had to adjust its books as the result of having to create a massive DM4.5 billion ($2.53 billion) reserve to accommodate a forced sale. He told journalists that this would be the amount DT would loose in the event of a sale.

DT has already begun to re-organise its broadband and cable divisions into a new company called BK to prepare for a sell-off.

After weeks of tough talking and brinkmanship from both sides (CI No 3,335) the European Commission's competition authorities have blocked the prospective digital pay-TV joint venture between Bertelsmann AG, Kirsch Gruppe and CLT-Ufa. An agreement had seemed likely (CI No 3,410) but negotiations were scuppered when Bertelsmann walked out of talks this week. The move was precipitated by commissioner Karl Van Miert, with his 20 member commission, demanding that the German giant allow independent operators to offer their own pay-TV packages alongside or including those offered by the venture.

Bertelsmann gets approval  for US$1.3b Random House union.
By SHEEL KOHLI in London.
511 words
1 June 1998
South China Morning Post
SCMP
English
(c) 1998
Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media group, has received the go-ahead to create the world's largest publisher of
English-language books, through a US$1.3 billion merger with Random House of the United States.
The Federal Trade  Commission, the US antitrust regulator, which had been strongly lobbied by the US-based
Author's Guild to block the merger, approved the deal at the weekend.
"We are pleased that the combination ... poses no regulatory competitive concerns," said Peter Olson, head of
Bertelsmann's English-language trade book operation.
He said work was proceeding "productively and on schedule" to complete the deal by mid-summer.

The deal comes as a relief to the firm after it was told last week by the European Commission that it would not be allowed to create a 2.5 billion deutschemark (about HK$10.83 billion) German digital television group with Kirch Group.

Bertelsmann and Kirch had planned to fold their television interests into a third company, Premier, to create a formidable force in the emerging digital market.

In its ruling, however, the EC said the deal would ruin competition, and despite the "considerable growth potential" for digital television, it could "only be fully exploited if the market is kept open and can evolve on a competitive basis".

The Bertelsmann-Random House deal will give the two groups about 10.9 per cent of the English language books market, but the Author's Guild, which counts famous writers such as Joseph Heller, Erica Jong and Carl Bernstein among its membership, disputes this.

They said point-of-sales data showed the two groups would control 35 per cent of the adult hardback fiction market, 33 per cent of adult trade paperback fiction, and 40 per cent of adult mass-market paperback fiction.

Random House is closely controlled by Advance Publications, owned by the US-based Newhouse family, which is thought to have chalked up $1.1 billion in sales last year.
That would put it ahead of Penguin/Putnam with $890 million of sales, and Bantam Doubleday Dell - owned by
Bertelsmann - which generated sales of $650 million last year.

Random House is among the leading publishers in the US and boasts on its roster of authors the likes of Michael Crichton, Norman Mailer, Pope John Paul II, John Grisham, and the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature winner Toni Morrison. The deal was first announced almost two months ago, but has been undergoing regulatory scrutiny.

Bertelsmann was particularly attracted to Random House's range of publishing strengths and valuable list of published titles.

It owns imprints such as Alfred A Knopf, Ballantine, Crown Fawcett, Fodor's travel guides, Pantheon and Times books, but the group has signalled its intention to concentrate on magazines and newspapers.

Bertelsmann has been signalling for some time a more aggressive move into the publishing market, and has recently started an on-line book selling business to compete with the fast-growing Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.

Bertelsmann Reportedly Sees Expansion With Kirch Despite EC Decision

BONN -(Dow Jones)- German media group Bertelsmann AG plans to expand its pay-TV Premiere venture with Kirch Group AG this year, despite a veto by the European Commission last week on a proposed digital venture, according to a German magazine.

Bertelsmann wasn't immediately available to confirm the report.

"We will further develop our mutual pay-TV channel, although not as extensively as planned," Bertelsmann Executive Board Member Michael Dornemann said in an advance summary of an article to be published by the German weekly Stern Thursday. "But there will be new channels," Dornemann added.

Bertelsmann will conduct intensive negotiations with Kirch in order to be ready for the 1998 Christmas business, Dornemann said.
"Our goal must be to be able to launch a full offensive for 1998 Christmas business," Dornemann said.

The two companies have agreed that Premiere will be able to buy 75% of the movies Kirch acquired in Hollywood regardless of Brussels' veto, according to Dornemann.

"I even hope that we will get 100% (of the movies)," Dornemann said. "Moreover, we should try as soon as possible to buy the rights for the Fussball-Bundesliga (Germany's premier football league) to be able to offer as many live matches as possible," Dornemann said.

Last week, the European Commission scuttled plans to pool the digital-television interests of Bertelsmann, Germany's biggest media conglomerate; Deutsche Telekom AG, the dominant German phone and cable-TV company; and Kirch, the country's biggest provider of television programming.
Bertelsmann's plans would be good news for Kirch, which has the most to lose following last week's decision. Without a partner in Bertelsmann, analysts said Kirch's ambitions in digital-TV could wither. The firm, owned by
the reclusive media magnate Leo Kirch, has already spent heavily to line up new Hollywood programming for the
digital-TV venture.

Indeed, immediately after the commission's decision was announced, Kirch Group said it will shut down DF-1, its existing, loss-making digital service.

The merger, which could have combined Premiere, DF-1 and CLT-UFA, Bertelsmann's broadcasting arm, would have had a monopoly on the German pay-TV market, the EU feared.

Meanwhile Tuesday, Luxembourg-based broadcaster CLT-UFA said it wants to buy 12.5% of Premiere from the legal owner of the shares, French pay-TV group Canal Plus SA.
CLT-UFA said it is sticking to the original plan it drew up with Kirch to raise its 37.5% stake in Premiere to 50%. "Nothing has changed. We still want to own 50% of Premiere, even though the commission has blocked our
digital alliance with Kirch," said a spokesman with CLT-UFA.

CLT-UFA and Kirch originally planned to convert Premiere from an analog to a digital pay-TV system, and to share ownership 50-50.



Page 102 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The CLT-UFA spokesman said his company didn't want to exceed 50% ownership of Premiere. He also said "the most probable way" CLT-UFA would get those shares was directly from their legal owner Canal Plus.
However, he refused to comment on whether CLT-UFA is involved in direct talks with Canal Plus.
A question mark over the ownership of a 37.5% slice in Premiere was raised last week at the time the
commission was deciding on the digital-TV alliance. Canal Plus told its shareholders at last week's annual general
meeting that it has agreed to sell these shares to Kirch.
However, it added that Kirch has still to pay $500 million - the lion's share of the value of the stake. "The sale of the stake to Kirch is irreversible," said a spokeswoman at Canal Plus.
Kirch currently owns 25% of Premiere in its own right. Under the deal cut with CLT-UFA, Kirch would have acquired the 37.5% Canal Plus stake, then sell on 12.5% to CLT-UFA.

FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR GERMAN PAY-TV ALLIANCE

As expected, the European Commission has unanimously decided to ban the pay-TV alliance planned by German media companies Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA and Kirch-Group. The 20 commissioners also banned the plans by Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom to become shareholders in Beta Research, the company responsible for the licensing and development of the d-box technology, owned 100 per cent by Kirch- Group.  EU Commissioner Karel van Miert said at a press conference last Wednesday that the collaboration would be blocked because it would hinder competition in the pay-TV market of the German language countries. He added that the Brussels authority had done everything possible to grant approval. There had been talks with all players involved, including  Deutsche Telekom, until the last minute, he said. "I have acted in an unusual way and made a proposal myself in order to reach a solution," van Miert pointed out.

While Kirch had agreed immediately on Tuesday, Bertelsmann on Wednesday morning in a written statement made it clear that the company refused to make further concessions. Consequently, the EC decided to ban the alliance completely.

In a statement, Kirch-Group said that it was disappointed about the Commission's negative decision because an approval would have brought competition into the new digital market. The Munich-based company underlined that it is still willing to propose a new application based on the recent compromises to the Commission. In what seems a veiled criticism of Bertelsmann, Kirch pointed out that the EC's decision was able to be made very quickly as the Brussels authority had indicated that it would have approved the alliance if the partners had agreed to van Miert's proposal.

Kirch-Group confirmed that it will close DF1 down unless a new partner is found, adding that the company isn't able to continue financing the loss-making DF1 bouquet on its own. However, no closing date for DF1 has been announced. Kirch-Group has lost more than DM1 billion from DF1 during its first 20 months existence. There are rumours that Rupert Murdoch, who is to visit Germany in mid-June, is interested in entering the German pay-TV market, maybe through DF1.

Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA said in a statement that it was disappointed but not surprised about the Commission's decision. It says the concessions the Brussels authority had demanded would have distorted competition in Germany completely. "We would have been forced to subsidise our competitors," Michael Dornemann, head of Bertelsmann's TV activities, said. He added that, as announced earlier, CLT-UFA, which owns 37.5 per cent in Premiere, will continue extending the channel's digital offering. Also, Kirch has confirmed its support for Premiere by selling most of the movie rights it bought from Hollywood studios, originally for DF1, to Premiere in order to keep the channel attractive to subscribers.

Both Bertelsmann and Kirch publicly confirmed that they are willing to continue co-operating in the development of their jointly owned pay-TV channel Premiere despite the Commission's ban of the planned 50:50 ownership.

Canal Plus chairman Pierre Lescure has indicated that he still intends to pull out of Premiere completely, making the future shareholder structure of the Hamburg-based channel unclear. According to a CLT-UFA spokesman it is not possible for Premiere to take over DF1's subscribers after the EC's ban of the merger. DF1 currently has
160,000 subscribers, Premiere's digital bouquet counts 120,000 subscribers. According to a report in weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, Bertelsmann wants to prevent Rupert Murdoch from entering the German pay-TV market by giving support to Kirch-Group, even offering financial support to Kirch amounting to several million DM.
Premiere would continue using the d-box technology developed by Kirch and Nokia for its digital offering. Document insp000020010917du630005y

Marketing & Media
Television: Italian Digital-TV Firms Face a Risky Terrain --- Competition, High Expense Add to List of
Obstacles

ROME -- For a preview of the blurred picture facing  European television, tune in to Italy.

The European Commission's decision to block a digital TV alliance between the Kirch Group and  Bertelsmann AG last week came just a couple of months after Brussels warned Italian participants against forming a venture that was similarly aimed at mitigating the huge costs involved in a digital launch.

The subsequent split of the major Italian players into two camps will likely make the development of the new service riskier and more expensive, industry observers say. Further, unique obstacles present in the Italian market raise additional questions as to when the contenders can hope to realize a profit from both digital TV and related interactive services.

"The payback on the entire undertaking will be longer in coming than it might have been," says Guido Vannucchi, deputy director general for Italian state broadcaster RAI.

Italy's leading media companies have been grappling with identifying a money-making strategy for the potentially rich digital-TV sector, while still holding down the enormous costs involved.

As a consequence, talks started last year to form a single digital platform that would have united RAI, private broadcaster Mediaset SpA, Telecom Italia SpA, Italy's leading film producer and distributor Cecchi Gori Group and Telepiu, the Italian satellite TV group that is 90%-controlled by Canal Plus SA and 10%-controlled by Mediaset. The goal was to reach an agreement to prevent a debilitating split in technological standards and to present a united front in convincing Italians of the wonders of digital television.

But as the parties worked this winter at resolving the considerable difficulties in bringing together so many major participants, Brussels torpedoed the talks when it warned in March that the five were treading on thin ice, explictly citing its opposition to pay-TV pacts in Germany and Spain.

"The final blow was the letter from the EU, saying (the single platform) would have been monopolistic," Mr. Vannucchi says. "We also knew they were preparing an injunction for Germany as well."
The result wasn't long in coming, as the participants quickly split into two camps. In April, Telecom Italia and RAI
agreed to establish their own platform to compete with Telepiu, which had been the only provider of digital
satellite television in Italy. Telecom and RAI are now looking to bring in other partners, and are in talks with Canal
Plus's French rival, Television Par Satellite, or TPS. Meantime, Telecom's multimedia and television unit, Stream,
will fire the opening shot in the new rivarly when it launches two digital satellite channels this month over the new
platform.

Meanwhile, Telepiu has beefed up the marketing of its digital service and plans a stock-market listing late this year to replenish its coffers, which have been depleted by the soaring costs of getting its pay-TV unit off the ground. Indeed, the difficulties in building the digital-TV business in Italy have been such that Telepiu was forced in September to start renting decoders in order to drum up new subscribers. The move has been successful in pushing the number of digital customers to 300,000, but at a considerable cost to Telepiu, which is operating in the red and doesn't expect to realize a profit before the end of next year.

And now observers agree the split in the market will likely heighten the pressure on both sides and raise the risks for all, particularly given special barriers present in the Italian market. Italy boasts a richer offering of free television than elsewhere in Europe, thus raising the marketing costs involved in coaxing viewers into paying for digital TV, analysts say. Further, Italians lag far behind the rest of Europe in personal computer and Internet usage, accentuating the doubts as to when the much-heralded convergence between TVs and computers will make interactive services a viable business.

"The existence of two platforms complicates the consumer-market message," says Adam Daum, a senior consultant with Inteco market research. "You duplicate the problem of educating the market about digital services."

As both sides gear up, analysts say it is too early to predict who will arrive first at the break-even point, which some say requires around two million subscribers. The Telecom-RAI alliance couples the telecom group's abundant cash flow, brand name and technological experience with the broadcaster's production expertise, while a new partner, such as TPS, would add expertise in pay-TV and interactive services. However, insiders say protracted management problems within Telecom are making it difficult to work out a business plan, while the potential for multimedia services in Italy is far from certain.

In the other camp, Telepiu enjoys strong backing from Canal Plus's pay-TV experience as well as its firm foothold in Italy as the only existing digital TV participant until now. However, analysts say Telepiu's financial weakness
will weigh on its strategy, particularly at a time when content prices are being bid up.

"In one camp, you have a savvy operator with a proven track record and in the other, a player with a ton of money," says Robert Montgomery, managing director of media consultancy Kagan World Media. "It's all about deep pockets and a lot of guts."

Digital TV plan may go forward-regulator.

BERLIN, June 5 (Reuters) - The digital pay-TV alliance of Bavarian tycoon Leo Kirch and German media group Bertelsmann may go forward nearly as planned despite its rejection last week by the  European Commission, a German media regulator said on Friday.

Hans Hege, director of the media authority in Berlin and the neighbouring state of Brandenburg, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the two allies are likely to push forward with their plans to link up on pay-TV service Premiere.

"Bertelsmann and Kirch could now try to do what they were blocked from doing in Brussels, a sort of 50-50 merger, but not formalised in the way it would have been in the original proposal," Hege said.
He added, however, that the merger would ultimately hinder the development of digital television in Germany. "I hope the companies learn something from Brussels and open the market to more competition - this is a
pre-requisite for success," he said.

"In the short run, the Brussels decision slows the development of digital pay-TV, but it is a positive development in the long run. A monopoly is never particularly efficient or creative."

The European Commission blocked the two companies from merging Kirch's digital TV channel DF1 with Premiere, but both companies announced last week that they would move to increase their holdings in Premiere to 50 percent each.

Bertelsmann and French pay-TV group Canal Plus each hold 37.5 percent of Premiere and Kirch has a 25 percent stake. Last week, Canal Plus affirmed it plans to sell its stake and allow Kirch and Bertelsmann to become equal partners in Premiere.
The move is likely to trigger a cartel investigation in Germany, company officials and the Berlin-based Federal
Cartel Office said.

Hege said he hoped the two German media giants would recognise the benefit of opening the digital TV market to other participants in the interest of faster development.

"Bringing Kirch and Bertelsmann together on digital TV would be like trying to merge Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen or AT&T and IBM. If you had a merger between AT&T and IBM, you probably would have never had the Internet," he said.
Hege said the German television market did not sufficiently encourage competition and cited the decision of
U.S.-based children's station Nickelodeon last week to pull out of the German market as a cautionary tale.

"The example of Nickelodeon shows how difficult it is to finance programming exclusively with advertising," Hege said. "In the U.S., for example, children's channels like Nickelodeon have the benefit of cable fees and cable operators are allowed to market their programming."

The director of Nickelodeon Europe, Karen Flischel, issued a terse statement last week blaming the channel's demise in Germany on unfair competition from public networks, a surplus of advertising slots and limitations in cable distribution.

Page 112 of 137 Â© 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Hege agreed that the extraordinary concentration of cable networks, in which telecommunications giant Deutsche
Telekom controls half of the country's cable network, restricts technical access of stations in the market.

Most German regional markets have more than 30 channels available over standard cable television, but only two commercial channels are profitable.

Hege said programming variety could be maintained, but with a U.S.-style system in which channels - in particular special-interest stations - could receive cable fees as well as advertising income.

"Thirty channels can survive in the German market, but you need to develop better financing methods with a mix of cable fees and advertising revenues. Otherwise, it is like trying to support a newspaper just with ads. It doesn't work."

German media mogul Leo Kirch is reported to have approached Rupert Murdoch with a view to establishing a new digital joint-venture, writes Andrew von Gamm.

Kirch's latest move follows the European Commission's decision, announced last week (Broadcast, 29.5.98), to veto the proposed merger of Kirch and Bertelsmann's German digital TV interests.

Kirch and Murdoch are said to have discussed linking general entertainment channel Sat1 and sports service DSF with ailing digital channel DF1, to create a range of services similar to the BSkyB package in the UK. Both sides declined to comment.

Meanwhile, German chancellor Helmut Kohl is understood to be looking at setting up a government body to oversee the introduction of digital television.

Deutsche Bank steps in to help Kirch.

BERLIN, June 8 (Reuters) - German media magnate Leo Kirch dismissed reports on Monday that he intended to sell his shares in commercial television station SAT1 to raise capital as Deutsche Bank AG said it would extend him a large loan.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the size of the loan to Kirch, who is believed to be under financial pressure after the  European Commission blocked his plans for a digital TV alliance with media giant Bertelsmann.

The bank said Kirch's 40 percent stake in Axel Springer Verlag AG, publisher of the best-selling tabloid Bild, would serve as collateral.

The news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Deutsche Bank would take over Kirch liabilities from the Bankgesellschaft Berlin totalling around 900 million marks ($500 million) as well as provide an additional 400 million in fresh money.
Bertelsmann chairman Mark Woessner, Kirch's rival and would-be partner in pay-TV service Premiere, heads
Deutsche Bank's advisory committee.
The EU in May rejected Kirch and Bertelsmann's plans to merge their digital TV activities.

Kirch invested millions in programming rights in an effort to boost the commercial value of his digital TV services. The extent to which he can profit from those rights now appears diminished.
The Spiegel report said Deutsche had worked out a reorganisation plan for Kirch's media empire.
It said part of the plan envisaged Kirch selling his 43 percent stake in loss-making TV channel SAT1 to Pro
Sieben Media, whose largest shareholder is Kirch's son Thomas Kirch.

The deal would give Kirch cash to develop pay TV and his programming business and Pro Sieben would be able to take advantage of tax credits from SAT1 losses.

Pro Sieben chairman Georg Kofler said recently that he would be interested in taking over SAT1 if Kirch put it up for sale.

Deutsche declined to comment but a Kirch spokesman told Reuters Kirch had no plans to sell his SAT1 shares and still planned to increase his holdings in the station.
"We have informed the Federal Cartel Office about these plans and it will be decided there," the spokesman said. Kirch holds 43 percent of SAT1 and Springer owns 40 percent. The Holtzbrinck group, which publishes the
business daily Handelsblatt newspaper, controls 15 percent of the shares, which it has agreed to sell to Kirch.

A ProSieben spokesman, commenting on reports that the group would buy shares in SAT1, said: "That is and remains speculation."
He added that ProSieben was not holding talks on SAT1, nor had it conducted such talks. The spokesman said
ProSieben would review any offers as it received them. ($ = 1.775 German Marks).

EU official expects new German pay TV deals.

(c) 1998 Reuters Limited
BERLIN, June 8 (Reuters) - A top aide to  European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Monday he expected Bertelsmann and Kirch to try again to receive  European Commission approval on their blocked pay-TV alliance.

"New projects will be announced without a doubt, and probably sooner rather than later," said Alexander Schaub, director-general in the antitrust office, said from Brussels via a satellite hook-up with journalists in Berlin.
The EU last month blocked a plan by German media giants Bertelsmann and Leo Kirch to merge their pay-TV
operations. Schaub said he expected the companies to present new plans for a joint venture in some form.
He said the EU was currently reviewing a number of complaints in connection with pay-TV in Germany.

One was brought by Otelo Communications GmbH, a leading cable TV operator, which has objected to a deal between its rival Deutsche Telekom and Bertelsmann. Another involves further cooperation between Kirch and Bertelsmann.
Schaub said he could not predict how the EU would decide on the complaints.

When asked about the de facto monopoly pay-TV service Premiere had developed in the German market, Schaub said there was little the EU could do to stop it because its dominance had developed from the service's own growth and not through a joint venture.
Under the deal the EU rejected, Bertelsmann and Kirch would have merged their digital pay-TV operations with
Premiere, the analogue pay TV channel they own jointly.

Germany's  Premiere to push forward  with digital  TV.

HAMBURG, Germany, June 10 (Reuters) - Premiere, the pay-TV service at the centre of German media giants Bertelsmann and Leo Kirch's plans for digital TV, plans to push forward with its digital service in the wake of a European Commission rejection.
The EU last month blocked  Bertelsmann and Kirch's attempt to merge their digital TV activities. Premiere said on
Wednesday it had now filed new applications for digital broadcasting licences.
"Premiere reacts with this application to the European Commission's rejection of the plans to merge Premiere and
(Kirch pay-TV service) DF1," it said in a statement.
It said the application was based on the current investor structure in which French pay-TV service Canal Plus and
Bertelsmann TV unit CLT-Ufa each hold 37.5 percent and Kirch owns 25 percent.
Canal Plus has announced its plans to sell its share.

Premiere chief executive Ferdinand Kayser said he expected the application review to go quickly and hoped to have 15 digital programmes approved for the Munich and Hamburg markets in time for the Christmas shopping season.
He said it would continue to use the d-box decoder system, developed by Kirch, as Premiere's technical platform. Premiere said it currently has 1.65 million subscribers, 120,000 of whom receive its digital service. ((Frankfurt

GERMANY: KIRCH CONFIRMS DF1 SHUTDOWN UNLESS NEW PARTNER IS FOUND BERTELSMANN TO INCREASE STAKE IN PREMIERE DESPITE EC BAN

Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA has stated publicly that it intends to increase its stake in Premiere despite the  EU             Commission's ban on its pay-TV alliance with Kirch-Group. CLT-UFA's manager Ewald Walgenbach said in a newspaper interview that the company wants to increase its stake in the Hamburg-based pay-TV channel to 50 per cent, adding that he doesn't think that the country's cartel offices will block the acquisition.
As part of the merger between DF1 and Premiere, which the Brussels authority banned, CLT-UFA and
Kirch-Group were planning to increase their stakes in Premiere to 50 per cent each. Currently CLT- UFA owns
37.5 per cent, Kirch holds 25 per cent. Former 37.5 per cent shareholder Canal Plus is currently in the process of
pulling out.

Premiere has announced that it will market its digital package to consumers again from 15 June. The EU Commission had blocked the renting of Kirch's d-box decoders through Premiere last winter until it had reached a decision on its investigation of the planned alliance with Kirch-Group. The pay-TV channel said that a sufficient number of d-box decoders will be available in the shops from 15 June. "We will continue extending our attractive digital offering," Premiere's managing director Ferdinand Kayser said. The channel's digital bouquet currently consists of the main analogue channel, three time-shifted multiplexed versions, four pay-per-view channels and
an electronic programme guide.

According to Kayser further pay-per-view services, thematic channels and interactive applications are planned for the future. Recently there had been rumours that erotic channel Playboy TV plans to launch a German affiliate using Premiere's platform. Currently Premiere has 1.65 million subscribers of which 200,000 receive the digital package.

It came as no surprise when the European Commission two weeks ago unanimously decided to ban the pay-TV alliance. The commissioners also banned the plans by Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom to become shareholders in Beta Research, the company responsible for the licensing and development of the d-box technology, 100 per cent owned by Kirch-Group. EU Commissioner Karel van Miert said at a press conference that the collaboration would be blocked because it would hinder competition in the pay-TV market of the German language countries. He added that the Brussels authority had done everything possible to grant approval. There had been talks with all players involved, including Deutsche Telekom, until the last minute, he said. "I have acted in an unusual way and made a proposal myself in order to reach a solution," van Miert pointed out. While Kirch had agreed immediately, Bertelsmann made it clear that the company refused to make further concessions.

Kirch-Group confirmed that it will close DF1 down unless a new partner is found, adding that the company isn't able to continue financing the loss-making DF1 bouquet on its own. However, no closing date has been announced. Kirch-Group has lost more than DM1 billion from DF1 during the first 20 months of its existence.

Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA said in a statement that it was disappointed but not surprised about the Commission's decision. It said the concessions the Brussels authority had demanded would have distorted competition in Germany. "We would have been forced to subsidise our competitors," Michael Dornemann, head of Bertelsmann's TV activities, said. Kirch has confirmed its support for Premiere by selling most of the movie rights it bought from Hollywood studios, originally for DF1, to Premiere in order to keep the channel attractive to subscribers.

According to a CLT-UFA spokesman it is not possible for Premiere to take over DF1's subscribers after the EC's ban of the merger. DF1 currently has 160,000 subscribers, while Premiere's digital bouquet counts 120,000 subscribers.

COMPETITION Commissioner Karel van Miert said this week that he was "rather confident" the  European            Commission could "sort things out" in relation to WorldCom Inc's proposed take-over of rival US telecoms operator MCI Communications Corp. But the anti-trust chief said the companies must do more to divest facilities used to carry Internet traffic. MCI has already sold much of its Internet infrastructure to the UK's Cable and Wireless in a bid to address anti-trust concerns.

GERMANY's spurned digital TV partners Kirch Group and Bertelsmann are likely to launch another attempt to win EU approval for their pay-TV alliance, according to a top Commission official. "New projects will be announced without a doubt, and probably sooner rather than later," said Alexander Schaub, director-general of the Commission's anti-trust unit.

ALCATEL, Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale have won EU approval for plans to pool their satellite businesses in a newly created company. The deal is part of a broader agreement under which Alcatel bought part of
Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics arm of French state-owned Thomson SA, which was approved by the Commission at the end of last month. The Commission said the companies had proposed steps to meet its concerns over Thomson's position in the components market.
ECONOMIC confidence in the new 11-nation euro-zone fell in May compared to April, according to a new
Commission index. The May index stood at 104.9 compared with 105.0 in April. The index started the year at
103.3.

CLOSER competition cooperation between the EU and US was sealed during Van Miert's visit to Washington. The new 'positive comity' deal calls for the best-placed competition authority to take the lead in investigating cartels and abusive use of market power, with the other providing back-up support.

A 20-year extension of Autostrada's concession to operate around half of Italy's motorways breaks European public procurement rules, according to Commission sources. An official said a restructuring to remove construction work and privatise Autostrada, a subsidiary of state holding company IRI, in a transparent and open manner would solve the problem.

GOLD prices have been hit by remarks from the European Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg suggesting that bullion would make up only 10-15% of the bank's reserves. That figure is below market expectations and helped push gold down to $293 (266 ecu) an ounce. Dealers fear national banks in euro-zone countries will downgrade their own gold reserves, flooding the market with cheap gold.

THE subsidised grain sale which has soured EU-US relations was "more or less an accident", Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said this week. He added that the sale of 30,000 tonnes of Finnish feed barley to a California grain dealer was a private deal which the EU had not been looking to promote.

LOW-cost airlines easyJet and Virgin have called on the Commission to look into British Airways' stake in a consortium to run the Eurostar high-speed rail link using the Channel Tunnel. They claim BA could link rail services with its airline routes between London, Paris and Brussels, and thereby reinforce its market position. "Allowing British Airways to operate the Eurostar is like putting King Herod in charge of a kindergarten," said easyJet.

AN AGREEMENT between Belgian telephone company Belgacom and sellers of its equipment which demands that the latter do not market rival products is being probed by the Commission's competition staff.

Bertelsmann tells cartel office it wants to up stake in Premiere to 50 pc

BERLIN, June 12 (AFP) - The German communications group  Bertelsmann has told the Federal Cartel Office that it wants to raise its stake in the pay-TV channel Premiere to 50 percent by buying the 12.5 percent held by French Canal Plus, a cartel office spokesman said on Friday.

Bertelsmann informed the office, which is Germany's competition watchdog, on Tuesday and the office has since contacted the  European Commission, the spokesman, Markus Lange, said.

It must now be decided whether the case comes under the jurisdiction of the European or German authorities, Lange said. If the German cartel office were responsible, it would have four months to make a decision.

Bertelsmann currently holds 37.5 percent of Premiere. German media magnate Leo Kirch holds 25 percent and is set to buy the 37.5 percent held by Canal+ as part of an agreement with the French group signed in July 1997.

Kirch will then sell 12.5 percent to Bertelsmann, as part of an agreement between the two German groups to hold equal stakes in Premiere.
At the end of May, the European Commission blocked plans by Kirch and Bertelsmann to merge their digital TV
activities under the umbrella of Premiere.

"Any future developments regarding Kirch, Bertelsmann and the shareholdings in Premiere will be examined in the light of this ban," Lange said.

"There can be no question of Kirch and Bertelsmann installing step by step a structure similar to the banned project," he said.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM DETAILS CABLE SPIN OFF

Deutsche Telekom has detailed plans for splitting up its extensive cable television operations - an expected precursor to talks with potential partners, including investment banks, in at least six new regional cable operators.

By spinning off its cable activities into a new wholly-owned subsidiary, and then splitting this into regional operations,  Deutsche Telekom is hoping to put the loss-making cable business on a sounder economic footing. It denies that the move, which was first announced in November last year, is being made to pre-empt any action by European Commission regulators, who have expressed concern about Telekom's dominant position.

Deutsche Telekom is by far the biggest cable operator in Germany with some 17 million subscribers. Nonetheless, this side of its business lost more than DM 1 billion ($566 m) last year.

CLT-UFA has a 37.5% stake in Premiere, while Kirch now holds 25%. German regulators, concerned about potential antitrust issues, said they plan to look closely at the two companies plans.

In May, German regulators rejected plans to merge Premiere with Kirch's pay TV service DF1 because it would be anticompetitive.

BONN, June 17 (Reuters) - Germany's top competition watchdog on Wednesday said he has asked the European Commission to accept jurisidiction in ruling on changes in shareholdings at the Hamburg-based pay TV group Premiere.

Dieter Wolf, president of the Berlin-based Federal Cartel Office, told Reuters that he was prepared to let Brussels rule on whether Bertelsmann and Leo Kirch should be able to raise their stakes in Premiere.
The European Commission recently rejected a planned merger between Premiere and Kirch's digital pay TV
channel DF1.
Following the rejection, Bertelsmann and Kirch said they would go forward with plans to raise their stakes in
Premiere to 50 percent each when the third shareholder Canal Plus leaves the group.
Wolf said that since the Commission ruled on the merger it should also deal with the subsequent developments. Bertelsmann and Canal Plus each hold 37.5 percent of Premiere and Kirch owns 25 percent.

BERTELSMANN/KIRCH FACE FRESH EURO PROBE.

Not Available for Re-dissemination.
German media giants  Bertelsmann and Kirch Group are to face another  European Commission probe, following the unveiling of plans to expand pay-TV operation Premiere into a 15 channel digital service.

News of the move came as Bertelsmann subsidiary CLT/Ufa applied to the Kartellamt - Germany's equivalent of the Monopolies & Mergers Commission - to increase its share of Premiere from 37.5 per cent to 50 per cent. A similar application is now expected from Kirch, in line with the buyout agreement on Premiere signed last year with the third shareholder in the service, Canal+.

The Kartellamt now plans to hand over the investigation of change of ownership in Premiere to the EC, given the expansion plans and the controversial history of the joint digital plans hatched by Bertelsmann and Kirch. The EC finally blocked their plans for an alliance after months of wrangling over the future of Kirch's DF1 digital platform (Broadcast, 29.5.98).

Reacting to Bertelsmann's application for an increase share in Premiere, a Kartellamt spokesman said: 'We must ensure that this purchase and the extension of the Premiere service is not a manoeuvre to circumvent the Commission's veto on the merger with DF1.'.

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission Tuesday announced it has cleared the Wind
Italian telecommunications joint venture known as Wind, which is owned by Italian electricity producer ENEL SpA,
Germany's  Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom SA.

The Commission said the venture's plans to offer a full range of domestic and international telecom services to business and residential customers "won't create or strengthen a dominant position, nor will it lead to anticompetitive co-operation between the parent companies."

The Commission noted that Wind is already licensed to install public fixed telecom networks, provide fixed-line services, resell capacity, and provide packet-switched data transmission.
Wind also recently became a licensee for mobile telephone services using DCS 1800 technology.

The Commission noted that none of the parent companies have until now been active in the Italian markets for domestic and international voice and data telecom services, mobile telephony, or enhanced services.

23/06/1998 (Agence  Europe) - The European Commission has authorised the creation of a cooperative joint venture (to be known as Wind Telecomunicazoni) between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and ENEL for the provision of telecommunications services in Italy. Far from creating a monopoly, the new entity will increase competition in relation to established suppliers (ENEL, a producer of electricity, is not currently active in the telecoms sector).

COMMISSION APPROVES ITALO-FRANCO-GERMAN WIND TELECOM VENTURE.
306 words
24 June 1998
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 1998 European Report.
Following an investigation under  EU Merger Regulation procedures and in the light of Article 85 anti-trust rules, the European Commission has given the go-ahead for Italian electricity distributor ENEL to set up Wind Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. in partnership with French and German telecommunications operators France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Announcing clearance on June 23 for the Wind joint venture - classified under the
re-vamped Merger Regulation as a "full-function cooperative joint venture" - the  Commission stressed its
findings that the deal would neither create a dominant position in the telecommunications market or the market for
the resale of transmission capacity, nor lead to anti-competitive collusion between the parent companies in this
instance. The  EU executive underlined that incumbent telecom operators may be allowed to grow by investing in
new markets in line with the application of  European competition law.

However, this Decision does not prejudge the separate investigation which is taking place under Article 85 (Regulation 17) into the overall scope of the cooperation existing between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.

Wind, a new entrant on the markets, will offer a full range of domestic and international telecommunications services to business and residential customers located in Italy, combining mobile and fixed-line telecommunications activities. ENEL, the main provider of electricity in Italy, already operates a telecoms network along its electricity grid. Wind - which is already licensed to install public fixed telecom networks, provide fixed-line telecom services, resell capacity and provide packet-switched data transmission, and provide mobile telephony services using the DCS 1800 technology - is to lease the ENEL network, which will be upgraded. Except for a limited presence in the enhanced services market, none of the parent companies has been active in these
markets in Italy to date.

PREMIERE TO LAUNCH 15 NEW CHANNELS

Kirch-Group's loss-making digital package DF1 is to continue broadcasting until the future of pay-TV operator
Premiere has been determined. As long as the situation with Premiere remains unclear, the bouquet, with
160,000 subscribers, won't be scrapped, Kirch- Group's managing director Dieter Hahn said at a media
conference in Cologne, adding that the Munich-based company will continue to extend Premiere's digital offering,
in which it has a 25 per cent stake. Both  Bertelsmann/CLT-UFA, which owns 37.5 per cent, and Kirch intend to
increase their stakes in Premiere to 50 per cent each by taking over the shares of Canal Plus. However, the
German cartel office has already indicated that it might block the sale. Dieter Wolf, president of the
Bundeskartellamt, said in an interview that he doesn't see any difference between the recent plan and the one
banned by the EuropeanCommission. Wolf revealed that the case might be forwarded to Brussels again.

Premiere continues with its plan to expand its digital offering despite the EC's ban on the planned merger. The Hamburg-based channel has applied for licences to launch 15 thematic digital pay-TV channels at the media authorities Bayerische Landeszentrale fur neue Medien (BLM) and Hamburgische Anstalt fur neue Medien (HAM). The channels are: Premiere Adventure, Premiere Blockbuster, Premiere Science- Fiction, Premiere Kids, Premiere Romance, Premiere Erotica, Premiere Sport, Premiere Sport Plus, Premiere Golf, Premiere Fun TV, Premiere Crime TV, Premiere Golden TV, Premiere Comedy, Premiere Infokanal, Premiere Pay-per-view and Premiere Multiplex.

Most of the channels are currently available within the DF1 offering, but under different names. Premiere's managing director Ferdinand Kayser said he hopes the licences will be granted quickly because of their importance for the future of digital in Germany. He confirmed that Kirch-Group's d-box technology would remain the set- top-box standard and that other channels are invited to join the platform. Kayser said that Premiere will, for the first time, offer its subscriber management services to other, independent channels.

EC probes European telcos'  extended venture

The European Commission is investigating a plan by France Telecom and  Deutsche Telekom to exchange shares and directors.

The investigation was opened earlier this year when the companiesannounced the director swap and was revealed today when the  Commission cleared another venture by the two companies, the Wind consortium with ENEL in Italy.

"We are looking at the share exchange. All it means is that it has been notified. The problem is that they might coordinate beyond what was approved in the Global One case," a Commission source said.

The Global One joint venture between the two telcos and Sprint of the US was cleared in July 1996 after the partners agreed to divest some activities, to limitthe scope of their cooperation and to avoid cross subsidising with their main activities.

The EC sources said the companies had kept within the Global One conditions andsupplied quarterly non-audited reports and six-monthly audited statements on the venture's activities.

Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom will extend the scope of the venture from value added services as liberalisation comes in, but have agreed not to offer public voice services in their home markets.
The Commission is unlikely to complete its investigation before thesummer break starts at the end of July. Document vnun000020010919du6o000g8
