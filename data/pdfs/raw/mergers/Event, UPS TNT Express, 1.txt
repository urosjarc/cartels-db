UPS modifies TNT Express bid to get EU approval

The Hague, Dec. 31 -- US delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) said on November 30 it had amended its multi-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm  TNT Express to meet EU conditions and close the deal by next year.
It added, however that the revised bid "does not change the terms and conditions of the offer by  UPS for TNT
Express."

A statement said, "UPS and TNT announce that in line with Dutch disclosure requirements, remedies have been submitted to obtain competition clearance from the European Commission for the acquisition."

It added, "The proposed remedies aim to address the EC's concerns regarding the competitive effects of the intended merger on the international express small package market in Europe."

In June, UPS launched a 5.16-billion-euro (US$6.71 billion) takeover bid for TNT Express, but European Commission competition authorities announced a month later they would investigate how the deal could affect the European market.

At the time, the EC said it was worried that the proposed merger would reduce the number of so-called integrators from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services.

UPS and TNT Express are major players in the sector for delivery of small packages and are two of four firms with a comprehensive air and road delivery network on the continent.
Others present in Europe are DHL, owned by Deutsche Post, and FedEx, a US-based company.

The deal is expected to put UPS ahead of its two competitors as it would strengthen its position in Europe and globally.

UPS and TNT Express said that the proposed adjustments "comprised the sale of business activities and assets in combination with granting access to air capabilities" but declined to give further details.

"UPS and TNT Express continue to be fully committed to the merger and are working closely with the EC to gain competitive clearance allowing the completion of the transaction in early 2013," it said.
"As part of the approval process, the EC will market-test the remedies on a confidential basis," it added.

TNT Express is a global player operating in more than 200 countries and maintains a leading role in the road freight network in Europe.
UPS is the world's biggest package-shipping group, with annual revenues last year of US$53.1 billion and
400,000 employees.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Bangladesh Monitor.

Belgium  airport  fears TNT departure,  eyes FedEx deal

Belgium's Liege airport, one of Europe's busiest freight hubs, hopes to entice US parcel delivery firm FedEx away from Paris airports should Dutch firm TNT Express depart for Germany.

The head of the Liege airport board, Jose Happart, told daily newspaper La Libre on Saturday that the airport was eyeing a deal with FedEx should the Dutch company go as the result of a looming tie-up with US delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS).
UPS launched a 5.16-billion-euro ($6.71 billion) takeover bid for TNT Express last year.

If approved by EU anti-trust authorities, UPS could well decide to move the Dutch firm's Liege operations -- involving some 2,000 jobs -- to its own UPS hub in Cologne, in order to streamline services and management.

"If TNT goes there is another big company, FedEx, which is currently based in Paris," said Happart. "We will try to attract it here in part."
But he added that "if TNT were to leave Liege Airport, it would likely not be a total withdrawal."

UPS said in November that it had amended its multi-billion-euro bid for TNT Express to meet EU conditions and close the deal by next year.

UPS' (UPS) last-ditch efforts to win  EU approval for its proposed takeover of  TNT Express (TNTEY) have been complicated by FedEx (FDX), which would not engage in serious talks to buy a package of  TNT assets unless a bigger package was offered, according to Financial Times, citing people involved in the clearance talks. The report added that France's DPD remains as the lone contender to buy the  TNT assets in question.

FedEx reportedly turns down UPS approach  over TNT assets

FedEx is not interested in buying some  TNT businesses so that  UPS can gain EU approval for its planned €5.16 billion acquisition of the Dutch express company, according to an unconfirmed media report today.
The Financial Times reported that FedEx had “rebuffed informal approaches” from  UPS to acquire some TNT
assets and would not engage in serious talks without these covering “a bigger slice of the  TNT business”.
UPS and TNT Express have officially proposed disposing of some TNT businesses to overcome the European
Commission’s concerns about the impact of their merger on competition in the European express market.

FedEx declined to comment on the report. “As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on corporate development matters nor those of our competitors,” a FedEx spokesperson told CEP-Research. UPS and TNT are also not commenting on the issue.

According to the FT, this now leaves DPD, the subsidiary of France’s La Poste, as the only potential buyer of TNT business activities. But the European Commission wants assurances that DPD would be a credible express delivery competitor if it had to use airlift capacity of other companies, including UPS (and TNT) in future.

The European Commission is due to decide by February 5 whether to approve the UPS-TNT merger under certain conditions or whether to officially block it.

MERGERS : UPS-TNT: FEDEX PLAYS SPOILSPORT

United Parcel Service (UPS), the world's leader in express deliveries, seems to have failed to convince its American competitor FedEx to take over part of the assets of the Dutch firm  TNT Express, with which it has been working on a merger deal since last March. According to The Financial Times of 8 January, their informal talks
are believed to have foundered because FedEx refuses to enter into firm discussions unless the offer concerns a larger share of TNT's activities. For now,  TNT subsidiaries in 16 EU member states, including Spain and Portugal, are concerned. Analysts interpret FedEx's refusal as its way of preventing the merger between  UPS and the number two in small parcel delivery in  Europe, worth an estimated €5.16 billion.
This development does not bode well for the European Commission's verdict on the deal, due in February. On 20
July 2012, the EU executive opened an in-depth investigation into the UPS takeover bid on TNT (see Europolitics
4471) due to its concerns over competition problems for international express services, where the parties would
have a very large combined market share. It suspects that this excessive concentration would be detrimental to
direct customers and ultimately to European consumers. For the Commission, the market in question is made up
of only four firms that control a global air and ground network for small parcel delivery in Europe and beyond:
UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. A merger by two of these companies could stifle competition by cutting the number
of players down to three. Given FedEx's small market share in Europe, DHL would be the only really credible
competitor on this market.

UPS challenges this view, arguing that the European market is made up of tens of competitors, including parcel delivery firms, forwarding agents and national express delivery firms. However, to dispel the EU executive's fears and in response to the objections it spelled out last November (4515), UPS and TNT announced their intention to sell certain assets, stipulating that some could not be bought by FedEx or DHL.

If FedEx is not interested in these terms, the French firm DPD, a La Poste subsidiary, is still a contender for buying TNT's assets, according to the British financial daily, which cites sources close to the talks. UPS is said to have offered competitive rates to DPD for air delivery services for a period of five years as part of its concessions. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is believed to object to this hypothesis, however, because DPD does not have an air transport network and would still depend on UPS or DHL.

What the Commission wishes to see is the emergence of a serious competitor. According to certain economic commentators, it may push UPS to make further concessions, which would work to FedEx's advantage.

EC expresses  concerns over UPS takeover of TNT

11 January 2013 - The  European Commission (EC) is concerned about the planned takeover of Dutch express delivery company TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT) by US peer United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), the Financial Times said, citing  European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

According to Almunia, the deal poses serious competition problems, which are not easy to solve.  UPS has to find an alternative player that combines ground and air transport like  TNT, he said, adding that French La Poste SA’s DPD unit, to which the US firm is trying to sell certain  TNT assets, has no air transport of its own and is therefore not an equivalent.

On the other hand, the EC believes that a possible sale to US delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) could be a simpler alternative as the group has its own airline and a more developed network in Europe.

UPS agreed to take over TNT in March 2012 via a deal valuing the Dutch firm at some EUR5.16bn (USD6.8bn), to be funded with existing cash and new debt. Last November the companies proposed to offload certain assets amid worries voiced by the European regulator in relation to the acquisition. The assets cover units of TNT in at least 16 EU states.

Brussels wants strong  express competitor to replace TNT

The European Commission wants a strong new competitor to emerge in the  European express market, likely to be La Poste-owned DPD, as the key condition for approving  UPS’ €5.16 billion acquisition of  TNT Express, the latest comments by  EU competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia have made clear.

Almunia told reporters in London today: “We need to substitute the  TNT role as integrator with an equivalent player one way or another.” The competition commissioner had previously told the Financial Times that “the elimination of competitors such as  TNT, that is an integrator, requires… an alternative integrator or someone who will play the same role from the competition point of view with equivalent competitive pressure.” He added: “What
I have told  UPS, what you have to present is an equivalent.”

The Commission is still evaluating whether the remedies presented by UPS and TNT will be sufficient to create “the same kind of competitive pressure in this market”, Almunia added. The two companies have offered to sell TNT businesses in numerous European countries and to provide access to the future UPS air network at competitive rates for five years so that the new player could compete effectively in the air express business.

Intensive talks are taking place with La Poste-owned parcels operator DPD, which is the only buyer following FedEx’s rejection of an informal approach by UPS. According to the Financial Times, Brussels wants a binding UPS-DPD agreement before approving the TNT acquisition. DPD is being asked to provide assurances on how it plans to use the TNT assets and on its long-term plans to challenge UPS and DHL in express delivery.

The European Commission is due to decide on the UPS-TNT merger by February 5. Almunia told reporters today that he did “not see the conditions in this case” for stopping the clock in order to give the involved parties more time for their negotiations.

UPS and TNT have repeatedly said they are committed to sealing the agreed deal, which was first announced last March.

Should the Commission approve the UPS takeover of TNT, including the disposal of TNT businesses to DPD, the future European express market would be headed by DHL Express and UPS with DPD and FedEx as the other two major players. The other major pan-European delivery company GLS focuses on ground-based parcel deliveries while other express companies in Europe are domestic or small regional operators.

UPS Bid for TNT Hangs in the Balance
By Vanessa Mock
707 words
11 January 2013

Dow Jones News Service
DJ

United Parcel Service Inc.'s (UPS) $6.8 billion takeover bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express NV (TNTEY, TNTE.AE) is in the balance as the U.S. delivery company tries to convince  European Union regulators that a credible new competitor in the industry can emerge.

The French government has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to recognize the potential of France's state-controlled DPD as a strong player in the sector, according to people in Amsterdam and Brussels who are familiar with the negotiations.

Were DPD to buy assets from UPS and gain access to its air network, it could alleviate regulators' concerns about shrinking competition while elevating DPD's position as a European parcel shipper.
A French government official didn't respond to requests for comment. An official at La Poste, France's
state-owned postal-services company which via its wholly owned Geopost Group parcels unit is DPD's controlling
shareholder, declined to comment.
DPD, based in Germany, is 83.32%-owned by Geopost. Its other shareholders are privately held German firms
DPD Systemlogistik GmbH with 10.47% and DPD Zeitfracht GmbH with a 6.21% stake.

DPD finds itself in the limelight as UPS has sought to sell it a raft of assets in Europe in order to boost DPD's potential as a so-called integrator--a delivery firm with a geographical and logistical reach wide enough to offer express services across the continent with the help of in-house airlines.

UPS, TNT, Deutsche Post's (DPSGY, DPW.XE) DHL unit, and FedEx Corp. (FDX) are the four main integrators, and that number would drop to three if UPS's bid succeeds.
"We need to substitute TNT's role with an equivalent player," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said
Friday. "Talks are still ongoing."

One obstacle is that DPD doesn't have its own airline. To address that concern, UPS is now putting together a deal that would guarantee DPD access to its air network for a number of years, according to several industry experts.

Meanwhile, TNT has agreed to sell its in-house airlines to a rival cargo specialist to meet EU rules prohibiting foreign control of EU-based carriers, though that deal hinges on UPS completing its acquisition of the Dutch company. Dublin-based ASL Aviation Group bought TNT Airways and the smaller Pan Air Lineas Areas SA for an undisclosed sum in November.
UPS's move is part of a broader contract that the U.S. group hopes to draw up with DPD ahead of the EU
regulatory deadline on Feb. 5. in a so-called fix-it-first approach.

Several people have confirmed that UPS is continuing to enhance its package of concessions, even at this late stage. Haggling over the deal, agreed to last March by UPS and TNT, has dragged on in the face of deep antitrust concerns.

Mr. Almunia has continued to make tough comments on UPS's chances of clinching the takeover of TNT, which has helped keep the Dutch company's share price well below UPS's offer price. But it wouldn't be the first time that he showed little sign of bending during a merger review before finally giving the green light.

Mr. Almunia was similarly blunt ahead of approving Universal Music Group's acquisition of rival British music label
EMI in a transaction that was criticized by other market players on the grounds it would stifle competition.

"Mr. Almunia appears to be drumming up pressure to get the maximum remedies he can get, with a view to clearing the deal," said a person involved in the talks.

It isn't clear how much harder UPS is willing to be pressed before throwing in the towel. One person at the firm said it wouldn't go ahead with a "bad transaction."

The commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, may send a preliminary indication of its final verdict to UPS in the coming days.

UPS Bid for TNT Hangs in the Balance

United Parcel Service Inc.'s (UPS) $6.8 billion takeover bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express NV (TNTEY, TNTE.AE) is in the balance as the U.S. delivery company tries to convince  European Union regulators that a credible new competitor in the industry can emerge.

The French government has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the  European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, to recognize the potential of France's state-controlled DPD as a strong player in the sector, according to people in Amsterdam and Brussels who are familiar with the negotiations.

Were DPD to buy assets from UPS and gain access to its air network, it could alleviate regulators' concerns about shrinking competition while elevating DPD's position as a European parcel shipper.
A French government official didn't respond to requests for comment. An official at La Poste, France's
state-owned postal-services company which via its wholly owned Geopost Group parcels unit is DPD's controlling
shareholder, declined to comment.
DPD, based in Germany, is 83.32%-owned by Geopost. Its other shareholders are privately held German firms
DPD Systemlogistik GmbH with 10.47% and DPD Zeitfracht GmbH with a 6.21% stake.

DPD finds itself in the limelight as UPS has sought to sell it a raft of assets in Europe in order to boost DPD's potential as a so-called integrator--a delivery firm with a geographical and logistical reach wide enough to offer express services across the continent with the help of in-house airlines.

UPS, TNT, Deutsche Post's (DPSGY, DPW.XE) DHL unit, and FedEx Corp. (FDX) are the four main integrators, and that number would drop to three if UPS's bid succeeds.
"We need to substitute TNT's role with an equivalent player," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said
Friday. "Talks are still ongoing."

One obstacle is that DPD doesn't have its own airline. To address that concern, UPS is now putting together a deal that would guarantee DPD access to its air network for a number of years, according to several industry experts.

Meanwhile, TNT has agreed to sell its in-house airlines to a rival cargo specialist to meet EU rules prohibiting foreign control of EU-based carriers, though that deal hinges on UPS completing its acquisition of the Dutch company.

EU Almunia: Talks Ongoing  in UPS/TNT Merger
By Carolyn Henson and Vanessa Mock

The European Union competition chief Friday reiterated his demands that a new competitor in Europe's express delivery sector needs to emerge before he can give the green light to United Parcel Services Inc.'s (UPS) acquisition of Dutch rival  TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE).
"We need to substitute  TNT's role with an equivalent player," the  EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia said in
London Friday. "Talks are still ongoing."

The comments come as UPS is scrambling to convince EU regulators that it can sell off enough of its assets to France's DPD to enable it to become a so-called "integrator", a firm with a geographical and logistical reach wide enough to offer express services across the continent. There are currently four integrators in Europe that combine air and ground transport, a number that will decrease to three after the merger. UPS currently competes with TNT and Germany's DHL, with FedEx seen as a distant fourth rival.

The U.S. parcel company is understood to be trying to seal its asset sale to La Poste's DPD before regulators give their verdict on the merger Feb. 5.

Speaking on the sidelines of a conference at London's Kings College, Mr. Almunia would not pre-empt the final outcome of the case, and he also refused to comment on specific details. Mr. Almunia added that talks with UPS have been "friendly" and "cooperative".

Mr. Almunia added that although a process known as "stop the clock" to gain more time was possible, he saw no reason to invoke it at this stage. "I don't see that the circumstances [are there] in this case," he told reporters.

Despite recent comments by Mr. Almunia pointing to the difficulty of the merger, both firms have said they remain committed to the proposed EUR5.2 billion deal revealed last April.

AMSTERDAM--Dutch logistics company  TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE) has taken notice of comments from European Union antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia about the proposed takeover by  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and said both firms remain committed to the deal.

"We have taken notice of the interview with Commissioner Almunia reflected in the Financial Times. We will however not comment on comments or speculation made in the media," a  TNT spokesman said in an emailed statement.

"With UPS, TNT Express is involved in discussions with the European Commission that are ongoing. The companies remain committed to the transaction," he said.

The Financial Times late Thursday reported Mr. Almunia as saying the proposed deal raises serious competition problems that are "not easy" to overcome. He added that the commission views a potential sale of assets to FedEx Corp. (FDX) as a simpler option, the FT reported.
UPS is talking to DPD of France about selling a package of assets to satisfy the commission's concerns. The FT
said that the commission would require assurances from DPD on how it plans to use the assets and on its
long-term plans to challenge the likes of UPS and DHL in express delivery.

"The elimination of competitors such as TNT, that is an integrator, requires an alternative integrator or someone who will play the same role from the competition point of view with equivalent competitive pressure," Mr. Almunia is quoted as saying by the paper.
TNT declined to comment on whether it still expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2013. Write to Robin van Daalen at robin.vandaalen@dowjones.com

EU Almunia  says concerns about TNT Express buy not easy to overcome

(SeeNews) - Jan 11, 2013 - The proposed takeover of Dutch express delivery firm  TNT Express (AMS:TNTE) by US-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) raises competition concerns that are "not easy" to overcome,  EU Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told business daily Financial Times.

Earlier this week, it appeared that  UPS would possibly not succeed in the planned sale of units to US competitor FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX).  UPS is now expected to try to sell certain businesses to  European express parcel delivery company DPD.

However, Almunia doubts whether a deal with DPD would satisfy the antitrust concerns. The EU Commissioner in charge of competition issues pointed that DPD does not have air transport operations and could therefore not
play the role so far fulfilled by TNT Express.

UPS Bid for TNT Hangs in Balance

United Parcel Service Inc.'s $6.8 billion takeover bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express NV hangs in the balance as the U.S. delivery company tries to convince  European Union regulators that a credible new competitor in the industry can emerge.

The French government, for its part, has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the  European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, to recognize the potential of France's state-controlled DPD as a strong player in the sector, according to people in Amsterdam and Brussels who are familiar with the negotiations.

Were DPD to buy assets from UPS and gain access to its air network, it could alleviate regulators' concerns about shrinking competition while elevating DPD's position as a European parcel shipper.

French government officials didn't respond to requests for comment. An official at La Poste, France's state-owned postal-services company which via its GeoPost Group parcels unit is DPD's controlling shareholder, declined to comment.

DPD, based in Germany, is 83.3%-owned by GeoPost. Its other shareholders are closely held German firms DPD Systemlogistik GmbH with 10.5% and DPD Zeitfracht GmbH with a 6.2% stake.

DPD finds itself in the limelight as UPS has sought to sell it a raft of assets in Europe in order to boost DPD's potential as a so-called integrator—a delivery firm with a geographical and logistical reach wide enough to offer express services across the continent with the help of in-house airlines.

UPS, TNT, Deutsche Post's DHL unit, and FedEx Corp. are the four main integrators, and that number would drop to three if UPS's bid succeeds.
"We need to substitute for TNT's role with an equivalent player," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquín Almunia, said on
Friday. "Talks are still continuing."

One obstacle is that DPD doesn't have its own airline. To address that concern, UPS is now putting together a deal that would guarantee DPD access to its air network for a number of years, according to several industry experts.

Meanwhile, TNT has agreed to sell its in-house airlines to a rival cargo specialist to meet EU rules prohibiting foreign control of EU-based carriers, though that deal hinges on Atlanta-based UPS completing its acquisition of the Dutch company.

Dublin-based ASL Aviation Group bought TNT Airways and the smaller Pan Air Lineas Areas SA for an undisclosed sum in November.

UPS's move is part of a broader contract that the U.S. group hopes to draw up with DPD ahead of the EU regulatory deadline on Feb. 5 in a so-called fix-it-first approach. UPS is continuing to enhance its package of concessions, even at this late stage, people familiar with the matter said.

Haggling over the deal, agreed to last March by UPS and TNT, has dragged on in the face of deep antitrust concerns. Mr. Almunia has continued to make tough comments on UPS's chances of clinching the takeover of TNT, which has helped keep the Dutch company's share price well below UPS's offer price.

But it wouldn't be the first time that he showed little sign of bending during a merger review before finally giving the green light.
Mr. Almunia was similarly blunt ahead of approving Universal Music Group's acquisition of rival British music label
EMI in a transaction that was criticized by other market players on the grounds it would stifle competition.

"Mr. Almunia appears to be drumming up pressure to get the maximum remedies he can get, with a view to clearing the deal," said one person involved in the talks.

It isn't clear how much harder UPS is willing to be pressed before throwing in the towel. One person at the company said it wouldn't go ahead with a "bad transaction."

The commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, may send a preliminary indication of its final verdict to UPS in the coming days.

TNT, UPS reaffirm  commitment to deal despite EC concerns

11 January 2013 - Dutch express delivery company TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT) said today that it together with its suitor, US peer United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), remained committed to their planned combination despite the concerns voiced by European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

The Financial Times cited earlier Almunia as saying that the deal posed serious competition problems, which were not easy to solve.

In an emailed statement to the Wall Street Journal, a TNT spokesman said that the companies would not comment on comments or media speculation. He added that the pair was continuing its talks with the regulator.

According to Almunia, UPS has to find an alternative player that combines ground and air transport like TNT. He also told the Financial Times that French La Poste SA’s DPD unit, to which the US firm is trying to sell certain TNT assets, has no air transport of its own and is therefore not an equivalent. On the other hand, the European Commission (EC) believes that a possible sale to US delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) could be a simpler alternative as the group has its own airline and a more developed network in Europe, Almunia said.

UPS agreed to take over TNT in March 2012 via a deal valuing the Dutch firm at some EUR5.16bn (USD6.8bn), to be funded with existing cash and new debt. Last November the companies proposed to offload certain assets amid worries voiced by the European regulator in relation to the acquisition. The assets cover units of TNT in at least 16 EU states.

Status: Agreed Financing group: Financing: Cash & Debt Financing: Existing resources Type group: Type: Corporate acquisition Buyer: United Parcel Service Inc
Country: Netherlands
Deal size (USD): 6.8bn
Sector: Road Transport/Freight Transport
Target: TNT Express NV

As the EC reviews the proposed remedies suggested by  UPS (UPS) to allay concerns raised by its proposed takeover of  TNT Express (TNTEY), including the potential sale of some  TNT assets to France's DPD,  EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia told Financial Times that finding a remedy to the elimination of an integrator like  TNT is "not easy" and will require  UPS to present at least an offsetting "equivalent competitive pressure."

TNT takeover problematic, says EU chief.

UPS’s attempted takeover of  TNT Express poses serious competition problems that are “not easy” to resolve, the EU competition chief has said, while leaving open the door to an 11th-hour solution to save the proposed deal from being blocked.

The US delivery group is trying to sell France’s DPD a swath of  TNT assets that are sufficient in quality and scope to convince Brussels that competition in the express delivery market is maintained.

The proposed remedies are still being reviewed by the European Commission. But Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, made plain the difficulties of compensating for the takeover of one of Europe’s four integrators, which combine ground and air transport.

“The elimination of competitors such as TNT, that is an integrator, requires . . . an alternative integrator or someone who will play the same role from the competition point of view with equivalent competitive pressure,” Mr Almunia said.

The commission sees a potential sale to FedEx as a simpler option, because the US group has its own airline and a more developed network in Europe.

Shares in TNT Express fall 3 percent on renewed worries  United Parcel Service may not get approval to buy the
Dutch delivery group after statements from the  European Union's competition chief.

European Commissioner Joaquin Almunia tells the Financial Times competition problems due to  UPS' planned takeover of the Dutch delivery group are "not easy" to solve.

"We expect the deal to go through but it has become a bit more uncertain than half a year ago," says a Dutch analyst who declines to be named.
The Financial Times says UPS is trying to sell some TNT Express assets to French mail group DPD, owned by
La Poste , to maintain competition in the European express delivery market. Almunia wants assurances DPD can
be a competitor.

"Everybody who knows this market is convinced today DPD is not an equivalent. It depends how this situation can be changed but it will not change just for saying I want change. We need to receive assurances," Almunia is quoted as saying in the paper.

Corporate  News: UPS Bid for TNT Is Still Up in the Air
By Vanessa Mock
586 words
12 January 2013

United Parcel Service Inc.'s $6.8 billion takeover bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express NV hangs in the balance as the U.S. delivery company tries to convince  European Union regulators that a credible new competitor in the industry can emerge.

The French government, for its part, has been lobbying hard in Brussels for the  European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, to recognize the potential of France's state-controlled DPD as a strong player in the sector, according to people in Amsterdam and Brussels who are familiar with the negotiations.

Were DPD to buy assets from UPS and gain access to its air network, it could alleviate regulators' concerns about shrinking competition while elevating DPD's position as a European parcel shipper.

French government officials didn't respond to requests for comment. An official at La Poste, France's state-owned postal-services company which via its GeoPost Group parcels unit is DPD's controlling shareholder, declined to comment.

DPD, based in Germany, is 83.3%-owned by GeoPost. Its other shareholders are closely held German firms DPD Systemlogistik GmbH with 10.5% and DPD Zeitfracht GmbH with a 6.2% stake.

DPD finds itself in the limelight as UPS has sought to sell it a raft of assets in Europe in order to boost DPD's potential as a so-called integrator -- a delivery firm with a geographical and logistical reach wide enough to offer express services across the continent with the help of in-house airlines.

UPS, TNT, Deutsche Post's DHL unit, and FedEx Corp. are the four main integrators, and that number would drop to three if UPS's bid succeeds.
"We need to substitute for TNT's role with an equivalent player," the EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said on
Friday. "Talks are still continuing."

One obstacle is that DPD doesn't have its own airline. To address that concern, UPS is now putting together a deal that would guarantee DPD access to its air network for a number of years, according to several industry experts.

Meanwhile, TNT has agreed to sell its in-house airlines to a rival cargo specialist to meet EU rules prohibiting foreign control of EU-based carriers, though that deal hinges on Atlanta-based UPS completing its acquisition of the Dutch company.

UPS's move is part of a broader contract that the U.S. group hopes to draw up with DPD ahead of the EU regulatory deadline on Feb. 5. UPS is continuing to enhance its package of concessions, even at this late stage, people familiar with the matter said.

Haggling over the deal, agreed to last March by UPS and TNT, has dragged on in the face of deep antitrust concerns. Mr. Almunia has continued to make tough comments on UPS's chances of clinching the takeover of TNT, which has helped keep the Dutch company's share price well below UPS's offer price.

"Mr. Almunia appears to be drumming up pressure to get the maximum remedies he can get, with a view to clearing the deal," said one person involved in the talks.

It isn't clear how much harder UPS is willing to be pressed before throwing in the towel. One person at the company said it wouldn't go ahead with a "bad transaction."

UPS calls off €5.16bn takeover of TNT Express
UPS, TNT, CEP-Research

UPS today called off the €5.16 billion takeover of  TNT Express after the  European Commission told the two companies it was working towards prohibiting the planned deal.

The pullout follows clear public comments by  European Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia last week that Brussels would only approve the deal if the two companies were able to present a “replacement” for  TNT Express in the  European express market by disposing of a large number of  TNT businesses to a single buyer.

UPS will now pay TNT Express the agreed €200 million transaction termination fee and each company said in separate statements that they will now focus on their own individual growth strategy.

UPS announced that the European Commission (EC) “has informed UPS and TNT Express that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNT Express”. UPS said it submitted an initial remedies proposal on Nov. 29, 2012 and subsequently revised the proposal twice.UPS began the competitive review process with the EC in March 2012 following its takeover offer for the Dutch express company.

Scott Davis, UPS Chairman and CEO, said: "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position.We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction.The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."
Upon prohibition by the EC, the Offer Condition relating to EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and UPS
will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of €200 million and will withdraw the Offer, the US company added.

UPS said it would make further announcements once the European Commission has issued its formal decision which is expected to be adopted in the coming weeks. Brussels had been due to decide on the UPS offer for TNT by February 5.

Davis added: "I would like to thank TNT Express for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made over the past year.
"Looking ahead, our company focus will be on the continued execution of our growth strategy.While we viewed
the acquisition as a compelling growth platform, our financial strength allows UPS to capture future opportunities."

In a separate statement, TNT Express said that it and UPS met with the European Commission’s (EC) case team investigating the proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS on Friday (11 January 2013) and the case team informed the companies that on the basis of UPS’s current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision.

Subsequently, UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis. Formal termination of the Merger Protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision from the EC, which, based on the above, TNT Express deems inevitable.

TNT Express said it “regrets this situation, having believed the merger was feasible and beneficial for all stakeholders”.

Looking ahead, the Dutch company said its Executive Board and Supervisory Board recognise the protracted merger process has been a distraction for management. Therefore, management will now solely focus on
Page 34 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
reassuring customers of TNT Express’ commitment to providing industry-leading services, ensuring the engagement and commitment of employees, and strengthening its strategy, including further steps to improve profitability.

TNT said the company management “will provide an update on its strategy in due course”. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of TNT Express acknowledge the great value of the company’s operations, people and commercial proposition, and are confident its strategy will bring value to shareholders, it added.

CNN International: Quest Means Business
CNNQMB
English

RICHARD QUEST, HOST: President Obama raises the roof about the Republicans' refusal to raise the debt ceiling.
From plastic fantastic to a diamond deal. Swatch switches to luxury.
And Heathrow's busiest year on record. Its CEO tells me the airport's a microcosm for the global economy. I'm Richard Quest, of course, the start of a new week, and I mean business.
Good evening. Barack Obama says America is not a deadbeat nation, and the president says that the country needs to pay the debts it has already racked up.

In the final news conference of his first term in office, Mr. Obama warned of downgrades, default, and global financial disaster. Three Ds if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling. And he said the failure to so do would put the US on the edge of recession.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It would be a self- inflicted wound on the economy. It would slow down our growth, might tip us into recession and, ironically, would probably increase our deficit.

So to even entertain the idea of this happening, of the United States of America not paying its bills, is irresponsible. It's absurd. As the speaker said two years ago, it would be -- and I'm quoting Speaker Boehner, now -- "a financial disaster not only for us, but for the worldwide economy."
(END VIDEO CLIP)

QUEST: A disaster, irresponsible, and calamitous for the worldwide economy. Maggie Lake is in New York this evening. Disaster and irresponsible. So, Maggie, why aren't they just raising the ceiling?

MAGGIE LAKE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Because, Richard, Republicans are trying to use this as leverage for their negotiating position with the president over the -- the effort to sort of tackle the budget. They're linking the two. The president taking great pains today to try to say you can't do that, that shouldn't be the case, that it's historically never been the case.

This is not new spending. This is spending you already voted on. Those two should not be linked. He said we're welcome to try to sit down, come to a bipartisan agreement on the budget, but we shouldn't be putting the credit rating of the US at risk.

And Richard, if he said that once, he said it about ten times, because there is some confusion among the American public because these two issues are tied together again, just like they were last year. A lot of people think when they hear "debt ceiling" --
QUEST: Right.

LAKE: -- that this is about our spending and that we overspend. And of course, the two are separate. So the president really trying to drive that point home today, very tough language.

Page 36 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
QUEST: And the analogy is often made that the debt ceiling is like having a limit on your credit card that -- to stop yourself from spending. I know our mutual colleague Ali Velshi would lose his hair if he had any at the mere question -- or analogy of that. But isn't as -- is it as false as it sounds?
LAKE: I do think it's false, because when you have a credit limit, you look at that in the future. This is already
been spent, so if it's a credit limit, it's one that doesn't work very well. The analogy the president was trying to use
instead --
QUEST: All right, but --

LAKE: -- this is like eating at a restaurant and running out before you pay your bill. That's the more appropriate one according to President Obama that we should be looking at, and I do think that it is a little bit of a mischaracterization.

QUEST: OK. So, how do we get out of this, or how does the US get out of it, and if the US doesn't get out of it, then the rest of us are all in it because, Maggie, time is short.
We've already got Tim Geithner at the moment literally almost doing a shell game moving the money around to
see where the $200 billion is at any given moment. So, he can only do that until maybe the end of February, when
they've got -- so what happens next?

LAKE: Yes, in between February 15th and March 1st, that's when they're going to run out of levers to pull to try to keep moving things around. So you're right, time is really of the essence.

And unfortunately, we have been here before. This is an exact repeat of what we went through, and remember how much of a fallout we saw in stocks. Big swings. We were down at the New York Stock Exchange every day reporting on it, so time is of the essence.

What needs to be done is that they have to get together and Congress just to raise it, separate it out from this other issue, which is the budget negotiation, and then get down to tacks on that, which needs to be done, as well, to try to -- to agree on some spending cuts, which is going to be hard work.

The president has said there's no negotiating on it. There is no Plan B. Republicans seem to be that there is going to be one, but so far, that's the decision of the White House --
QUEST: I --
LAKE: You raise it, it's not connected, end of story.

QUEST: Stay where you are Maggie. Stay where you are in -- at CNN New York. Alison Kosik's at the New York Stock Exchange. Alison, you've heard what Maggie was saying. So, is the market now getting angst and anxious about debt ceiling?

ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: No. No, not just yet. Not just yet. I mean, look, it's a flat day, quiet day. What's really in focus is earnings. You look at the VIX, it's up a little bit, it's up one and a third percent. Not getting anxious yet.

But you know what? As time goes by, as we get closer to that new deadline, expect more volatility, because the market will continue to react to that, as we saw it happen at the end of last year, when the fiscal cliff concerns were coming into play.

And the interesting thing with the markets, Richard, is that the market could wind up pushing the hand of Congress if investors decide to start selling off big time, that could wind up pushing Congress's hand to do something faster, Richard.

QUEST: So, of all the ones -- of all the issues out there -- debt ceiling, sequestration, and continuing resolution -- is it the debt ceiling, from the market point of view, that's most worrying at the moment?
LAKE: It is the debt ceiling that is the bigger -- that is the bigger worry, even beyond the spending cuts. But
Richard, it is -- spending cuts are a close second. They're almost neck-and-neck with the debt ceiling.

Because spending cuts -- I'll start with the second placeholder, spending cuts are a big deal to Wall Street because that has that sort of ripple effect to companies, that if companies don't know whee spending cuts are


Page 37 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
going to be made, in the big picture, how is that going to trickle down to companies. So, that's why Wall Street would be affected by the spending cuts.

Now, then, we talk about the debt ceiling. We saw what happened last summer with the debt ceiling, right? Got down to the wire. There was the S&P downgrade. There is the worry that if Congress continues with its shenanigans of dragging their feet on the debt ceiling that we could see a replay, and there could be yet another downgrade, Richard.
QUEST: Just remind us where the Dow stands tonight or what the market's doing at the moment. KOSIK: The Dow is flat, up 18 points at 13,507. S&P is down only a mere 2 points, Richard.
QUEST: My -- your point is made. Alison's at the Exchange. Back to Maggie. Maggie, Dow's flat, markets are yawning, the president's berating, and you and I are none the wiser about where this goes.

LAKE: That's right. Listen, the market is like that because they think that despite all the noise that nobody is going to want to force a default, that would be disaster, or a downgrade or shutting down the government, which are the options.

So, despite that fact, they don't like it, with their backs up against the wall, the market's betting the Republicans cave and raise it. But there are -- there is a core contingent on the Republican side who think let's do it.
QUEST: Right.

LAKE: Let's force this issue. If they feel like that is gaining traction and Boehner does not have control of those House Republicans, you will start to see more market fallout. And Allison is right. The markets will then drive what happens in Washington.

QUEST: Alison's at the Exchange, Maggie is at CNN New York, and we thank you both. Now, Apple shares -- well, Apple shares are currently trading at their lowest level in almost a year. That's after reports that demand for the iPhone 5 has slowed down.

According to the Nikkei News Service, Apple has cut back on some orders for components of its flagship phone, and that suggests Apple was expecting stronger demand. The shares are down more than 3 percent as competitors like Samsung are making ground on its dominance of the SmartPhone sector. Apple recently shot down rumors that it was developing a cheaper version of the iPhone.

Factor it into the markets and Europe had already closed by the time the president spoke and by the time we got the news from Apple or the speculation on Apple. Very modest gains for the major markets. The SMI moved to a fresh three year and a half high. SocGen and Agricole helped lift the CAC 40 into the black. Banks saw their outlooks upgraded by Credit Suisse.
(RINGS BELL)

QUEST: QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. After the break, diamonds by Swatch. The world's biggest watchmaker swoops on the jeweler to the stars.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

QUEST: UPS, the parcel delivery service, has failed to deliver in its $7 billion quest to buy the rival TNT in Europe. It's after the European Commission said it would block the deal, which has been rumbling on for the best part of a year.

Jim Boulden is with us. Jim, extraordinary. This is going on for a long time, they've made many concessions, so why did the commission finally decide no.
(RINGS BELL)

JIM BOULDEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It seems the commission never liked this deal, and I'll tell you why. A combined UPS-TNT would have controlled around 17 percent of Europe's express package market. That would've been before any sell-offs enforced by the European Commission.
But in this space, mergers are preferred, as it's expensive to grow overnight delivery and to build up hubs. UPS
says it's extremely disappointed that the European Commission has told it that it will block this deal.

Page 38 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Now, this is what's happened to TNT shares. You see down 41 percent in Amsterdam's trading today. But TNT will get a breakup fee from UPS. It's interesting -- UPS will have to pay a $265 million feel once the deal is formally blocked.

You might have thought there wouldn't be a breakup fee because it's being blocked. However, TNT will get some money for that. However, that did not help the share price.

Let's look at this market. The big four of these companies control around 87 percent of the international express delivery market. If the merger had taken place, this would've been sold off. Interestingly, FedEx said no thank you.

There was lots of talk that FedEx would buy some of this in order to help the European Commission decide yes to have this deal go through. But it could also have helped some of the privatized postal services here in Europe get bigger, because few other companies would have been interested in the parts of TNT.

As, of course, this deal didn't happen, it leaves these big four as is and it leaves TNT suffering to try to find a new strategy, Richard.
QUEST: Right. Now, here's the point, here, Jim. Let me come over and join you -- in the library. Here's the point:
does TNT need to do a deal to replace that which it's lost?
BOULDEN: I think it does because it -- like I said, it just takes forever to build up organically. They say they can
do it organically, but then why would they do the deal to begin with? But you have only four of these, and then you
have much smaller deals. So, maybe they can buy some of the privatized postal services in Europe and try to
build up that way.

QUEST: And briefly, wider ramifications. It was a European and an American. So, is it likely to have wider ramifications? In other words, political fallout?
BOULDEN: No, no. We've seen this before. We saw them block GE- Honeywell, we saw them block the New
York Stock Exchange with the Deutsche Bourse. Just another example of the European Commission saying no to
a deal like this.

QUEST: Jim, thank you. All right. As we move on, staying in the world of acquisitions, mergers, and doing deals, square-shaped or pear- shaped, Swatch says diamonds are its new best friend. The world's biggest watchmaker has offered a billion dollars or so for Harry Winston, the jewelers immortalized in the song by Marilyn Monroe. The deal excludes the mining operations.

Swatch already owns Omega, allegedly, the watch of choice of James Bond. Harry Winston's acquisition will bring it into direct competition with the luxury market leader, Cartier.

Now, Harry Winston began the trend of lending actresses jewels for special events in 1943. Since then, the generations of leading ladies from Jennifer Lopez to Marilyn Monroe to Madonna have worn them on the red carpet. Join me over at the super screen and you'll see.

Jessica Alba wore a Winston diamond necklace. Rather splendid little beauty. It's worth 5.8 -- get in there and look at those jewels properly. Jessica Chastain was decked in $3 million worth of Harry Winston Jewels -- $3 million -- to collect her Best Actress award for her role in "Zero Dark Thirty." And -- that's the --
(LAUGHTER)

QUEST: You don't get many of those for the price of a cup of tea. The Best Actor winner, Hugh Jackman, wore Harry Winston cuff links. They gave him cuff links and you can't even see them, but they are in there somewhere. And so did the director Steven Spielberg.

What's the difference, then, between a Swatch and a Harry Winston? Not much, if you're strolling the hundred yards or so between the stores in London. Tens of millions if you go inside.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

QUEST: These are the famous multicolored Swatch watches from the eponymous group, the Swatch group. They are the watches that gave the company its fame and flavor. But it's not all that Swatch is about. There's Tissot, Longines, and Omega at the higher end of the Swatch range.

Page 39 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And now, to add to these plastic and somewhat cheap $50 watches, throw in Harry Winston, half a mile away.
Talk to me, Harry Winston.
From the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street to the luxury and boutiques of New Bond Street.

Chopard, Bugari, Piaget -- it was to join this upper echelon of of jewelers that Swatch decided it needed an upper brand.
Feast your eyes on these beauties.
QUEST (voice-over): Beauty celebrated by none other than Marilyn Monroe, who called out for Harry Winston in

MARILYN MONROE AS LORELEI LEE, "GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES" (singing): Black Star, Frost, Gorhom, talk to me Harry Winston, tell me all about it!

QUEST (on camera): So, the Swatch will cost you $50, the Harry Winston will cost you $50,000. And that's before you've bought the bracelet. They both tell the right time.
(END VIDEOTAPE)

QUEST: Harry Winston and Swatch coming together. Now, before we go any further, just to point out that there are reports that -- there are reports in the market that Dell computer shares have been halted by NASDAQ after price move circuit breakers were triggered.

We are efforting to confirm and to bring you the exact -- according -- the current price down -- or the current price movement of Dell shares was about -- was 17 percent. What -- and still counting. Whether that was higher or lower, we're still just looking on the screens to see the way in which --

But anyway, the shares have been halted by the NASDAQ after at least a 10 percent price move circuit breaker was triggered.

Now, when it comes to Dell computers, of course, a vast company. So for any form of -- movement of that magnitude, 15, 16, 17 percent, would be worth -- well, it's more than worth talking about. But we need to tell you we'll find out more details. We'll have Alison Kosik back with us to give us some more information in a moment or two.

Swatch and Harry Winston all about time, which it's time for today's Currency Conundrum. This is a 2004 commemorative coin of time, featuring the clock face on the reverse. Which eurozone hopeful issued this distinctive memento? Is it Latvia, Lithuania, or Luxembourg? The answer later in the program.

Now to the currency rates this evening. The US dollar is holding steady. It's gaining a third of one percent against sterling, down a fifth up against the yen. Those are the rates --

QUEST: The British prime minister David Cameron has brought forward his long-awaited speech on the UK's position in the European Union. That speech, now, takes place in the Netherlands on Friday. The location that the British government says is entirely appropriate because it was a founding member of the EU.

The speech was previously expected on January the 22nd. It would have clashed, then, with the anniversary of -- the 50th anniversary of France and Germany's post-war reconciliation.

Factories in the eurozone turned out far fewer goods than expected towards the end of last year. Industrial production in the zone fell by three tenths of one percent in November from October. That's according to Eurostat.

And this is worrying because economists were expecting a rise. Year- on-year, down 3.7. The sharpest declines, in Slovenia, Spain, and Portugal. The output in Germany, France, and the Netherlands actually increased.

Ken Wattret is the chief eurozone economist for BNP Paribas. Despite this setback, he says the worst of Europe's troubles are already behind us.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

KEN WATTRET, CHIEF EUROZONE ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS: The announcement by the ECB in the summer of last year that it would buy unlimited amounts of sovereign debt under certain conditions, that really
took away the main tail risk event, I think, for the eurozone. So, in that context, I would say the worst is behind us.

But we have had periods before where the tensions in markets and the impact on the economy comes back very quickly, and we know there is some problems still with the level of debt, the level of budget deficits, political uncertainty, social unrest. So it would be unrealistic to think that all the problems have gone away.

But probably the most acute period of stress in markets and the risk of that spilling over, I would think, was behind us on the basis of what the ECB is now willing to do.

QUEST: Talk of Greece exit and the most extreme possibilities, which was where the speculation was rampant last year, to some extent, off the table?

WATTRET: Greece still faces major challenges economically and financially, but there has been a willingness in the core countries of the euro area, particularly Germany, to buy some time for Greece, and I think that change of political mood is equally important as what the central bank is willing to do.

QUEST: If the immediate, serious, disastrous, catastrophic, whatever adjective we want to use -- if that has gone away, we are left with a mind- numbingly grinding -- periphery trying to get things growing again, where unemployment across the zone is 11 percent plus. So, we're far from out of the woods.

WATTRET: I think that's a fair assessment. Normally the way an economy adjusts to one of these shocks is you have a major exchange rate adjustment, which generates improved competitiveness, and you export your way out of a crisis.

We know for the euro area countries, that option isn't available, so there is a more prolonged, gradual adjustment through an internal devaluation, as we would call it. Costs come down and competitiveness comes back, and slowly but surely, the economy gets on an even keel.

But the timetable for that in a monetary union is much longer than when you have sufficient exchange rate flexibility.

QUEST: The president's going to be talking about and has been talking about the debt ceiling. Do you -- from your vantage point, do you see the debt ceiling debate and debacle as being a serious worry that could send everything over the edge again?

WATTRET: Well, potentially it is, depending on how the politicians handle it. I think markets for the moment take a relatively constructive view, and the reason is, history tells us when push comes to shove, the politicians in the US make a decision to raise the debt ceiling if necessary to avoid the painful consequences on public spending, employment, and so on.

So, I think it's reasonable to assume that the same thing will happen, but there is a longer-term issue here. The US is still running a very large budget deficit and the public sector debt to GDP ratio is rising, and it's rising pretty rapidly. So, the medium-term problem of consolidating the public finances and the impact that has on the economy hasn't gone away at all.

QUEST (voice-over): French warplanes (inaudible) the Islamist militant targets in Mali for the fourth day. Meanwhile the rebels have mounted a counteroffensive into the government controlled south. France says rebels have captured the town of Diabaly north of the capital.

Thousands of protesters are descending on Pakistan's capital right now demanding that the government resign. They're following an outspoken cleric who says he wants a caretaker government to ensure this brings national elections are honest and fair. Security in Islamabad remains strict. Authorities have cordoned off the president's house and parliament with shipping containers.

This YouTube video purports to show the devastation in Damascus suburbs today moments after a Syrian government airstrike. A new report of a major refugee agency says entire neighborhoods in Syria are decimated. Health care is difficult to find and sexual assault is rife.
(Inaudible) outside the country the civil war has created a staggering refugee crisis.

In Italy, the exotic dancer at the center of a sex case involving the former prime minister Silver Berlusconi appeared in court on Monday. Karima El Mahroug was not called to testify. She's been nicknamed "Ruby the Heart-Stealer." Prosecutors say Berlusconi paid her for sex when she was 17, although both say they were never together.

Livestrong has confirmed to CNN that its founder, Lance Armstrong, has apologized for the charity's staff. It comes ahead of an interview with Oprah Winfrey today, where it is rumored that the disgraced cyclist may admit to doping.

QUEST: So earlier in the program I told you that Dell's share price had risen very sharply indeed, currently up just to nearly 10 percent, maybe 11 percent. It is bouncing around quite considerably. But look at how the day has done for Dell's price. And you could just look at that. That's very sharp.

Now for a mature stock, a major stock in the Nasdaq to have something like that going on tells you there's something going on.
Alison Kosik back with us from New York.
As always, Alison, I tell you, when there's something to report, we need you back. What is going on?

ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So there are reports of a possible equity buyout which means Dell is considering going private. Dell has reportedly been in talks with two different firms. Keep in mind; this is reportedly in the very early stages. These firms would still need to shore up financing for the wheels to really get moving.

You know, Dell's had a rough ride of it lately. It struggled to hold onto its personal computer market share. More people have been shifting to tablets and smartphones. You know, I talked with one analyst who said, you know, Dell kind of lost its way.

It was really this sort of cost -- it lost its way from its core, meaning its laptop and its PCs and it went on to try to make printers, even TVs. It kind of lost its way. And we certainly saw that in its stock price of late. It's really just been down in the dumps compared to where it used to be. You know, this analyst, Richard, equated Dell as the Apple of the 1990s.

But he said this move, if true, could be a good move for Michael Dell. It could let him, of course, be more creative. He said, "This could be Michael Dell's born-again moment," Richard.
QUEST: Alison Kosik in New York, one that we will watch very closely in the days ahead as that comes.

Page 42 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And Alison is quite right, of course. There's never any guarantee that these deals happen.
Alison, thank you.

Dell Computers say they refuse to speculate on market rumors of this nature. But, clearly, a share price up 10 percent, 12 percent, 14 percent, 16 percent at the opening of a session, that tells us that something is going on.

From busy share prices to busy airports and 2012 was the busiest year in history for London's Heathrow Airport. Almost 70 million passengers flew in and out of the U.K.'s biggest hub. And their destinations tell us a lot about the state of the global economy.

Heathrow is particularly important because it is the world's busiest - - the world's busiest international airport. Some like Atlanta, Beijing, Chicago have more passengers overall. But if you're talking about cross- border traffic, then it is London Heathrow. And what it shows, not surprisingly, is, for example, the BRIC countries.

The planes are flying more and more to Russia, to India and to Brazil. And not surprisingly -- look at Brazil. Traffic up 21.6 percent. The best BRIC nation, and it is getting more flights left and right.

But back to Heathrow, those are the regions that are growing that we can see -- not surprising. Again, it's in Southeast Asia. It is in parts of the Gulf and the Middle East and even parts of North Africa. And way over in Asia, in Japan, where, of course, you'll see certain numbers, services up 6.2 percent in East Asia.

Now that is because traffic has stabilized as a result since the tsunami. The Middle East, of course, is because of the Arab Spring and again shows the picture that where there is the growth, the airlines are starting to fly. And of course, the reverse of that is the south of Europe, where of course, Greece still prices down, flights down 7.3 percent; Italy off 7 percent; Portugal and Spain fall, too.

Putting it all together, I was joined by the CEO of Heathrow, Colin Matthews, who says, "Look at the map and look at where the planes are flying," and you can study the numbers and see what's happening in the economy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

COLIN MATTHEWS, CEO, HEATHROW: Well, I think Heathrow does give a good picture of global economic activity. If a market is growing strongly, then the traffic to and from that market grows strongly.

So in total, if you look at our numbers, they're up a little bit. Obviously our capacity is constrained. So even relatively small increases, like the ones we're announcing today, are good news. And as you say, you can see trends within global economic activity within the numbers.

But let me say, the thing I'm most pleased about for the year is that our passenger scores have gone up, in terms of the quality of the experience they have here at Heathrow, that's not just about a great Olympic period, but it's about improvements we've made through the year.

QUEST: If we look at the numbers, the BRICs are up; Germany was up; North America was up. Those are all parts of the world where economies are growing and yet obviously southern Europe, the periphery was down.
I'm surprised at the nimbleness of the aviation and tourism world to be able to shift capacity quite so succinctly. MATTHEWS: Well, airplanes move very quickly from one market for another. They're free to do so. Airlines can
reallocate different aircraft onto different routes, different sizes, to adjust, as you say, very quickly to changes in
economic circumstances.

So if you look at some of the more troubled economies in Europe, they were down; but France and Germany up a little bit. So net in total for us, European traffic just a fraction up compared to equivalent period last year. But not
as strongly as the North Atlantic was up and then other markets in East Asia, elsewhere in Asia and Brazil, for instance, which was strongly up.

QUEST: And if we look to this year, because obviously, your company forecasters, one runway is a runway's length, but it doesn't really matter, you know, you put one plane down it, where do you expect more growth? Where would you like to see more growth on those runways going to which parts of the world?
MATTHEWS: Well, of course, we'd like to see growth to markets which are growing into the future. So we'd love
to see more connections to China, mainland Chinese cities, which are growing very fast and which are developing
routes around the world.

Page 43 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We want the best of those routes to be here to London so the U.K. economy can flourish. Trade with the U.K. can flourish. That'll be good for the U.K. and, of course, good for our business. So we want to see those routes
develop equally. We've always had strings from Heathrow to North Atlantic, of course. We want that to continue to be strong.

We'd love to have more capacity which would allow us to provide more links. As it is, we make absolutely the best we can with every square centimeter of capacity we've got.

QUEST: Now if you met your match on match.com and caught someone's eye on Plenty of Fish or find love on eHarmony, you are not alone. January is the time when people turn to the Internet to find a partner.

Online dating has not only become this huge industry, it's also become largely socially acceptable, at least by perhaps the younger generation. Isa Soares met two people who've tried it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TONY CONAGHAN, ONLINE DATER: The story of our life so far, isn't it?
ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The album is a reminder of how they met. CONAGHAN: That's where we had our first meal.
SOARES (voice-over): Photo after photo of memories that recount their first meeting all of three months ago. CHARLOTTE HOGG, ONLINE DATER: (Inaudible)?
CONAGHAN: Yes, that's me first present, wasn't it? Vulgar.

SOARES (voice-over): Charlotte and Tony met via dating website Lovestruck. For Tony, going online gave him flexibility.

CONAGHAN: I was an aircraft engineer and I'm going to do shift work at an airport. It was very hard for me to get the weekends off. So you kind of like fit into my lifestyle because I could actually meet people when it suited me.
SOARES (voice-over): Online they had similar interest. In the real world, however, there was no connection. HOGG: I thought Tony was short and had a rather large nose and was going a little bit bald. (Inaudible) go, no,
I'm not interested. And I had to be fair. (Inaudible) pictures that (inaudible) very favorable light. And obviously he
was (inaudible) since I'd posted the pictures, I'd probably eaten quite a few chocolate bars and aged a bit.

Page 44 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sorry.

SOARES (voice-over): That's the reality of online dating. But more and more of us are logging on with some sites around the world reporting a 350 percent increase in signups in the past two months.

BRYN SNELSON, MARKETING DIRECTOR, EHARMONY U.K.: If you're thinking of looking on for a relationship online, now's a great time to be doing it. At eHarmony, we've seen a four times' increase in singles coming to our site looking for a relationship.

SOARES: Last year, nearly 30 percent of all relationships in the E.U. were formed online. The British held the fort with an annual turnover of $280 million. But online dating sites aren't the only ones (inaudible) at the simple click of a mouse. I may not be looking for love. But singles here in the U.K. contribute $5.5 billion to the economy.

SOARES (voice-over): With any luck, Charlotte and Tony may not need to browse online dating sites again. But with a dress and a wedding still to come --
HOGG: What do you think?
SOARES (voice-over): -- there's plenty of love for the economy to go around -- Isa Soares, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST: And I've been reading some of your views on Twitter about that.

We'll get maybe -- if we've turned tonight, some of your views about whether you -- @RichardQuest, is it now a generational thing, those of us over 40 and 50 are slightly more -- not embarrassed, but slightly more reserved about saying whether we would do online dating? Those at the 20s and 30s are -- have no problem with it all the time.
All right. (Inaudible) hazardous air pollution is causing widespread disruption in China. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
QUEST (voice-over): Several flights to and from Beijing have been canceled and some of the city's factories and construction sites have agreed to either reduce work or stop entirely until the air clears.
Tom Sater's at the World Weather Center.
Why now, Tom? What's going on meteorologically?
TOM SATER, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Meteorologically -- (CROSSTALK)
QUEST: Yes, yes; you try spelling it.

SATER: It's actually a lot to do with the weather, Richard. You're absolutely right. But I've got good news. I think the pattern that has really been acting as a lid on a jar is going to break down. And we may actually see some stirring of the atmosphere, which could disperse this smog and this pollution.

Eastern, northeastern areas of China, you can see it here. We have a little storm system. It's weak in nature. It's not going to produce any rain or snowfall. I mean, it's pretty cold right now. But it is going to stir up the atmosphere. To give you an idea, weather is a big culprit with this. This is all smog you see here. The mountains, the topography really act like the lip of a jar.

And when you have high pressure and that air descends, it just traps everything. The winds are light; there's no stirring of the atmosphere. There's no blowing around of the pollutants. So that lid is tight. And as the days roll on and the longer high pressure hangs around, the pollutants build. And we've seen the worst of it, I think, over the weekend.

In fact, take a look at the numbers for you, again, anything above 500 they consider it beyond the levels, 500. On Saturday, we had levels near 900. The U.S. embassy on Sunday reported 720. At 3:00 am in the morning, Monday morning, it dropped down to 515 and I think it's getting better.


Page 45 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the long- and short-term effects health wise, that's the big problem. Obviously, we've had disruption of travel and delays. Schools are closed as well.

But, Richard, you know, there's two CEOs that may be looking at global expansion, they're looking at Beijing, too, because if this problem continues, the long-term corrosion of those particles in the air can really do some damage to the infrastructure. But this is the latest 24-hour period. Typically at night, the winds are even lighter. I mean, they're not stirring up much during the day.

But we do have a filtered sunshine. And the number's at 515 (inaudible) 3:00 am, started to drop and look what happens here. We have now levels into the orange rate. It's still unhealthy for sensitive groups. But overall, it's improving and I think the reason for that really is going to have to do with this little frontal system.

Again, it's extremely dry front; it really doesn't matter. The weak winds will be replaced. And maybe we'll get improving numbers in the days ahead. Richard, I wouldn't -- I got to give you justice here and pay tribute to the little snowfall that dusted your fair city. There it is, a little bit of the white stuff. The radar showed it. It started out as some light snow, changed at times to a little mix.

We're still going to have some accumulation I think on the coast. But, again, it's not just in London. Paris, 0 degrees; snow is falling. I've got to show you this picture here, too. This is a live picture. Earthcam.com, if you look closely, you'll see a few dark specks kind of hit the screen here. Yes, it is snowing -- and there is it. It's snowing in London. (Inaudible) Paris right now.
You had a little bit of a break and it looks like there will be more. In fact, Paris, take a look at this. In the next, oh,
24-48 hours, maybe, 6.8 centimeters. Hope you enjoyed it today, Richard.

QUEST: Tom Sater with the -- well, we've got the snow; you've got the details about why. We thank you, Tom, for that.

When we come back after the break, we will put some more perspective on Dell Computers. The halt in trading that took place and the current state of Dell shares and what might be behind this (inaudible). In a moment, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, good evening.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
QUEST: Dell shares are soaring on the talk the computer firm's looking to go private. Maggie is in New York.

I was just saying to you, Maggie, in the break, this came out of -- it just shows you; you start your average Monday and the next thing you know, Dell shares are up 12 percent and trading's halted -- or was -- for five minutes.

MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. It was briefly halted, Richard. And you're right. The Dell's specific news is a surprise. But I have to tell you, this is part of a trend that we talked about at the end of last year and that is the fact that PCs are in decline as more and more people move on to tablets and phones.
Last year was the first year that PCs declined for the year, purchases declined for the year in over a decade.
And Richard, before we get into it, I just want to tell you, I talked to Michael Dell just a couple of months ago when
Microsoft launched Windows 8 and I asked him specifically about those who were saying that the PC's dead.
Have a listen to what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL DELL, CEO, DELL COMPUTERS: Now this year there will be about 400 million PCs sold. I remember hearing that when there were 100 million PCs sold a year. So they've been doing this for a while. So you know, that's been going -- there's been discussion of that for a long time. But there seem to be more and more PCs being sold.

There are about a billion and a half PCs in the world and so, you know, if you go out in the real world and look at how business is done, how people get, you know, productive work done, you see a lot of PCs. It's not to say there's not a role for smartphones and tablets. What really interesting is -- interesting, of course, about this announcement is now we have tablets that are also full PCs.

Page 46 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LAKE: Right. And this clearly is geared, this overhaul is geared to work across that, right/
Steve, I mean, what is your response to is the PC dead?

STEVE BALLMER, CEO, MICROSOFT: I'd say the PC's never been dead, it never will die. (Inaudible). It moves on. We started with desktops, for gosh sakes. And then, boom, PC gets reimagined in the big (inaudible). And then laptops and then light notebooks and then ultrabooks. And now we have PCs as tablets. And the number of form factors.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

QUEST: That was an announcement, of course, from earlier in the year, Maggie. And it's (inaudible) Ballmer when they announced the tablets. But, Maggie, fundamentally, why would -- why would Michael Dell, as owning
15 percent or so of the company, why would he want to take it private?

LAKE: Because he wants to redirect the company, despite those words. He understands the business is going someplace else. He has already been focusing more on services, on enterprise, kind of trying to redefine and in a similar way that IBM did. But maybe he wants to do it off the radar of Wall Street. Investors want quarter on quarter profits. Stocks -- Dell's stock lost a third of its value last year.

So it may be that he just wants more time to execute. He doesn't want to have to do it with the short-term pressures of being a public company. But we'll have to see. Again, this is not confirmed; it is just speculation at this point, Richard.
QUEST: Speculation and of course there's no guarantee it will happen. Maggie is in New York for us this evening. While we're talking technology, whether it be Dell, Microsoft or Apple, Java has a bug and a patch isn't good
enough. Well, when I heard about this -- you know me -- I almost -- I started to wonder what on Earth was
happening. Anyway, join me in the superscreen, the nerve center.

Let's start with the basics. You all know, of course, many of you, that Java is the programming language. It's widely used. And it is used particularly because it is ambidextrous. It can be used -- it has a billion uses across multiple platforms, Windows, Mac and Linux, all can use it as well.
It's in everything from DVD players, mechanical -- medicinal machines, you name it, it's in all of them. But the problem is -- the problem is that one doesn't want to work.
So the problem is that a flaw has been found. Users are advised -- have been advised to disable the software because apparently the flow in Java allows hackers into your computer and we all know what can happen after that.

Apparently this is in all versions according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and they say disable the Java. But Oracle has issued a patch and the patch can be found at Java.com. You can download it and it - - use it from the Oracle website.

Well, that should all be good enough and all nice, hunky-dory. Not so fast, young man, because Java says it will actually work, we don't -- well, rather, one expert says, "We don't dare to tell users that it's safe to enable Java again." So putting it simply, you have to decide whether to elect disable, take the risk or wait. "Profitable Moment" next.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
QUEST: Tonight's "Profitable Romantic Moment": our report about online dating explains the revolution and shows just how it's taking place. Well, ask around your office. Anyone under 30, when it comes to online dating has either tried it, is going to try it or certainly knows someone who has tried it.

There's a new generation that's no longer embarrassed to be open about finding partners online. Maybe those of us over 50 are a little more reserved about going online. But remembering the newspaper back page ads that offered dating agencies, trying to match the unmatchable? Today it seems everyone is at it. And if the office gossip is anything to go by, they're having a good time, too.

UPS drops $7 billion bid for TNT Express
By Mark Thompson

LONDON (CNNMoney) -- Delivery company  UPS has dropped its $7 billion bid for  TNT Express after  European
authorities said they would block it on grounds that it would stifle competition.

European Commission officials told  United Parcel Service and TNT Express on Jan. 11 they were planning to veto the deal because their proposals to address competition concerns were inadequate.  UPS was not prepared to amend the terms any further, so it announced Monday it was dropping the acquisition.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

The European Commission began its review last March. UPS proposed remedies in November, and revised those proposals twice, it said. The companies were prepared to sell some operations and provide rivals with access to the combined network.
Atlanta-based UPS said it would pay TNT Express €200 million as a termination fee once the European
Commission confirms formally that it will block the deal -- which is expected early next month.

The deal would have been the biggest in UPS' history. A UPS-TNT combination would have created a significant competitor to European market leader DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post.

Collapse of the proposed acquisition leaves TNT scrambling to come up with a new standalone strategy in the face of weak demand in Europe, and without a chief executive -- Marie-Christine Lombard resigned in September to pursue opportunities outside the industry.
TNT shares fell as much as 51% to €4.05 before recovering slightly. UPS had offered €9.50 per share.

TNT acknowledged that the protracted merger process had been a distraction for management. It promised an update on its strategy "in due course".

UPS walks away from $6.9 billion takeover of TNT Express;  TNT shares plummet  50 per cent

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ United Parcel Service Inc. has ditched its (euro)5.2 billion ($6.9 billion) takeover of
TNT Express NV after learning that European regulators would reject the deal in its current form.

Though TNT will receive a (euro)200 million ($265.5 million) break fee, it faces an uncertain future on its own. Its shares plummeted 50 per cent to (euro) 4.083 in the first minutes of Monday trading in Amsterdam following the bid's failure.

UPS had offered to buy struggling TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, in May, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. But regulators said in October that the deal would lead to
over-concentration in the sector.

In response, UPS offered to sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets but after meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved _ and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

In its last earnings report, for the third quarter of 2012, TNT lost (euro)3 million on sales of (euro)1.8 billion. Former CEO Marianne-Christine Lombard quit the company in September mid-takeover, in a move that was criticized as ``unethical'' by TNT's chairman, Antony Bergmans, and interpreted by some as a sign the deal was in trouble, since she stood to gain a (euro)2.6 million bonus for seeing it through to completion.
She was replaced on an interim basis by CFO Bernard Bot.

In a statement, TNT conceded that the ``protracted merger process has been a distraction for management'' and that it would now focus on reassuring customers, encouraging employees and making money.
``Management will provide an update on its strategy in due course,'' the company said.
UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was ``extremely disappointed'' with the stance taken by regulators.

``We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction,'' he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth ``particularly in Europe.''
The European Commission will publish its review of the deal within several weeks.
Before UPS's bid for TNT Express, some analysts thought rival FedEx might make a bid for the company, but
FedEx executives said _ in March 2012 at least _ they had no plans to do so.

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Shares in package delivery company  TNT Express NV were knocked as much as
50 per cent lower Monday on news that  United Parcel Service Inc. has ditched its (euro)5.2 billion ($6.9 billion)
takeover of the struggling Dutch company, citing objections from  European regulators.

Though TNT will receive a (euro)200 million ($265.5 million) break fee, it faces an uncertain future on its own. The drop in share price wiped off nearly (euro)2 billion from its market value. At one point, the shares had plunged by
50 per cent before recovering somewhat to be trading 42 per cent lower at (euro)4.762.

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. But regulators said in October that the deal would hurt competition by reducing the number of companies in the sector.

In response, UPS offered to sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets. But after meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved _ and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

In its last earnings report, for the third quarter of 2012, TNT lost (euro)3 million on sales of (euro)1.8 billion. Former CEO Marie-Christine Lombard quit in September _ mid-takeover _ in a move that was criticized as
``unethical'' by TNT's chairman, Antony Bergmans, and suggested the deal was in trouble, since she stood to gain a (euro)2.6 million bonus for seeing it through to completion.
She was replaced on an interim basis by CFO Bernard Bot.

In a statement, TNT conceded that the ``protracted merger process has been a distraction for management'' and that it would now focus on reassuring customers, encouraging employees and making money.
``Management will provide an update on its strategy in due course,'' the company said.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was ``extremely disappointed'' with the stance taken by regulators on what would have been his company's largest-ever acquisition.

``We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction,'' he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth ``particularly in Europe.''
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

Before UPS's bid for TNT Express, some analysts thought rival FedEx Corp. might make an offer for the company, but FedEx executives said in March they had no plans to do so.

SNS Securities analyst Geert Steens said European regulators have signalled they would not view a takeover by FedEx or _ less likely_ DPD, a unit of France's La Poste, as problematic. But there is little guarantee either will bid for TNT in the current climate.

Page 51 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Steens said TNT is worth around (euro)4 per share as an independent company, and some observers thought
UPS was overpaying at (euro)9.50. TNT's largest shareholder _ the former Dutch national mail company PostNL
_ will likely keep angling for a takeover as it needs to cut its debt.
Shares of PostNL fell 34 per cent to (euro)1.88.

TNT's assets in Asia and Latin America are part of the reason for its attractiveness as a takeover target, but the company's Brazilian operations ran into severe problems in 2010-2011 and were still loss-making in the third quarter of 2012.

UPS scraps $6.9 billion takeover of TNT Express, faced likely rejection from EU regulators

UPS scrapped plans to grow in  Europe through the acquisition of Dutch delivery company  TNT Express because
European regulators were getting ready to reject the $6.9 billion deal.
It would have been the largest acquisition in  UPS history.

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. Regulators objected, saying the deal would reduce competition in the market for express delivery of small packages in Europe.
UPS said Monday that it had proposed ``tangible remedies,'' but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, the
Atlanta company told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday that he was ``extremely disappointed'' with the stance taken by regulators. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc., the world's largest package delivery company, rose 1.7 per cent to close at $79.24 Monday.

Analysts said UPS could still pursue smaller acquisitions and also might boost its dividend or take some other action to reward shareholders.

TNT shares plunged in Europe. Although it will receive a $265.5 million ((euro)200 million) breakup fee from UPS, TNT faces an uncertain future on its own. The 42 per cent drop in its share price wiped off nearly (euro)2 billion from its market value.
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

UPS had earmarked $5 billion in cash for the purchase of TNT. Sterne Agee analyst Jeffrey Kauffman said he expected the company to now use some of that for dividends or share buybacks. He said UPS could also pursue smaller acquisitions, especially in Asia.

Jim Corridore, equity analyst for S&P Capital IQ, said UPS can still ``build a stronger network in Europe through smaller acquisitions and internal growth.''

Before UPS jumped in, some analysts thought rival FedEx Corp. might make an offer for TNT, but FedEx executives said in March they had no plans to do so.

U.S. analysts don't expect FedEx to reconsider in the near-term because it's in the midst of a major restructuring of its Express air cargo service.
FedEx declined to comment. Its shares rose $1.02 to close at $98.42. Koenig reported from Dallas. Sterling reported from Amsterdam.

Planned UPS-TNT Express merger fails to materialize

Dutch parcel delivery company  TNT Express has announced that a planned merger with  UPS will not materialize. The US firm has shied away from the takeover as  EU regulators have voiced their misgivings.

Parcel delivery firm  TNT Express of the Netherlands said on Monday hopes for a merger with  UPS in the US had been buried. It reported the American company had walked away from a $6.8-billion (5.2-billion-euro) acquisition of the Dutch company.

In March of last year, UPS offered to buy the struggling TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, with a view to better competing with the continent's giant in the sector, Deutsche Post's DHL of Germany.
UPS CEO Scott Davis said "he was disappointed" at the failure to take TNT Express on board and cited EU
regulators who had revealed their resolve to reject the takeover deal.
Quo vadis TNT?

As early as October last year, EU anti-trust authorities said the deal would most likely lead to over-concentration in the sector which saw UPS offering to sell parts of the company's small-package operations and airline assets.

But after a meeting with regulators last Friday, UPS hinted it saw no hope the deal would be approved and added it was not interested in further concessions.

TNT Express is to receive a $200-million break-free compensation from UPS for the withdrawal of the takeover bid, with the ailing Dutch company facing now facing an uncertain future.

UPS, TNT Deal Falls Apart

AMSTERDAM--United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Monday it has abandoned its protracted, $6.8 billion bid to take over smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company  TNT Express NV (TNTEY), after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission's antitrust regulator.

Despite months of negotiations, UPS said it expects the Commission to block the proposed acquisition after a meeting with the antitrust body of the European Union's executive arm last Friday.

UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal after a first phase review, but the process dragged on, highlighting the Commission's concerns about future competition in the market for overnight deliveries of parcels in Europe. The acquisition, which would have been the biggest in UPS's 105-year history, was announced in March last year.

The U.S. firm had offered remedies on Nov. 29, and revised its proposal twice to overcome the Commission's concerns, it said.

Negotiations with the Commission continued into the new year, with UPS's hopes increasingly riding on whether it could convince the regulator that sales of UPS and TNT assets to DPD, a small parcel-delivery firm controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, might create a credible new European competitor to meet competition concerns.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis.

UPS had offered 9.5 euros ($12.67) a share for the Dutch firm, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target for its U.S. rivals. After UPS had announced its bid for TNT, shareholders speculated on a counter bid from FedEx Corp. (FDX), which didn't emerge.

The Commission's tough stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes a similar position it took in objecting to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext (NYX) early last year largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in a particular segment of financial services, the
exchange-trade derivatives market. For UPS, the Commission's concerns focused on the lack of competition in the overnight parcel-delivery segment if it acquired TNT.
Still, in between its objections to the big securities exchanges and logistics deals, the Commission did approve
Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion of EMI Group PLC's recorded music division last July.

UPDATE: UPS-TNT Deal Fails to Deliver

AMSTERDAM--United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Monday it will abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($7.0 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV (TNTEY) after greater-than-expected objections from the European Union's antitrust watchdog.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in UPS's 105-year history. The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is due to announce is decision on Feb. 5. UPS pre-empted that, saying after a meeting with the regulator on Friday, that it expects Brussels to block the proposed acquisition.

Once the Commission's decision is announced, UPS said it would pay TNT a EUR200 million termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the TNT deal, announced last March, after a preliminary antitrust review.

UPS revised its takeover proposal three times to overcome the commission's concerns that the overnight parcel-delivery market would become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG (DPSGY). Brussels also worried other parcel delivery firms, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp. (FDX), could be shut out of the market. DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal being approved.

UPS was hoping that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, to DPD, a parcel-delivery firm controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, may have created a new competitor.

The Commission's stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes its objection to the $17-billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext last year--largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.
It did approve Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion of EMI Group Ltd's recorded music division in September. "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis said in a
statement. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the
transaction,"

UPS and TNT officials said they were surprised by the Commission's position. UPS may have appeased Brussels by selling European assets to FedEx. The U.S. rival showed no interest.
UPS offered EUR9.5 a share for the Dutch firm, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL NV (PNLYY)
under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target.
PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder with a near 30% stake, said it plans to sell it, assuming the deal with UPS
doesn't proceed.

TNT's shares plunged on the Amsterdam stock exchange after news of UPS's decision to call off its takeover attempt.
PostNL shares also slumped.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand alone strategy which we presented in February," TNT's CEO Bernard Bot said in a telephone interview Monday.
Neither FedEx nor commission officials were immediately available to comment.

UPS Expects Commission to Block  TNT Express Deal

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Monday it will abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($7.0 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV (TNTEY) after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history. The  European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, is due to announce its decision on Feb. 5.  UPS pre-empted the decision, saying after a meeting with the regulator on Friday that it expects Brussels to block the deal.

Once the commission's decision is announced, UPS said it will pay TNT a EUR200 million termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal, which was first announced last March, following a preliminary antitrust review.
UPS revised its takeover proposal three times in a bid to overcome the commission's concerns that the
overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business
and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG (DPSGY). Brussels also worried that other parcel delivery firms, including
U.S. rival FedEx Corp. (FDX), could be shut out of the market. Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal
being approved.

UPS was hoping that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, to DPD, a parcel-delivery firm controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European
overnight-parcel delivery competitor, or integrator.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here, while UPS and TNT see a wide spectrum of service providers competing and putting competitive pressure on the merging parties and others in the market."

The commission's stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes its objection to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext last year, largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.

But it approved Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion takeover of EMI Group Ltd.'s recorded music division in September, before giving the conditional go-ahead to the $32 billion mining-industry merger involving Glencore International PLC and Xstrata PLC in November.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction,"

0750 GMT [Dow Jones]--The  European Commission is set to block  United Parcel Service's (UPS) proposed
$6.8 billion acquisition of  TNT Express (TNTE.AE),  UPS confirmed Monday. This will result in heavy losses for
TNT Express when it opens Monday, says a trader, predicting losses of up to 50%, from Friday's EUR8.24 close.
UPS had offered EUR9.5 a share for  TNT Express, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL (PNL.AE)
under pressure from shareholders that argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target for
its US rivals, something that seems to have been thwarted by the  EC. (peter.nurse@dowjones.com)

0832 GMT [Dow Jones]  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) slumps 49% to EUR4.24 after  UPS (UPS) and TNT confirm the EC is set to block  UPS' proposed EUR9.50 per share bid. Kepler Capital Markets says TNT can live on as results in recent years show, but some decisions will have to be made on the non-European parts. In its view Brazil can be repaired in time, but for China it thinks  TNT is simply too small. Adds, Fedex (FDX) is now aggressively expanding its European network on its own, but it cannot be fully excluded as a white knight. Cuts  TNT Express target price to EUR6.50 from EUR7, and rates the shares at reduce. (robin.vandaalen@dowjones.com)

0838 GMT [Dow Jones] The cancellation of  UPS's (UPS) proposed merger with  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) puts TNT back into play, SNS Securities says. Any new deal could potentially happen at a lower valuation, SNS says. SNS slashes its price target to EUR4 from EUR9.50. It expects, PostNL (PNL.AE),  TNT's largest shareholder, to look for a quick exit. According to SNS, the  European Commission has made it clear that it would worry less in the case of a deal with Fedex (FDX) or France's DPD, than it would have in the case of a tie-up of  TNT Express and UPS. Recommendation on  TNT Express stock is hold. It trades 42.5% lower at EUR4.72. PostNL stock is down 35% at EUR1.85 (robin.vandaalen@dowjones.com)

Cheuvreux also cites the ongoing problems at  TNT's Brazilian operations. The broker maintains its underperform rating and cuts target to EUR6 from EUR7. Shares down 43% at EUR4.72.

0951 GMT [Dow Jones] PostNL (PNL.AE) slumps 36% to EUR1.81, after  UPS (UPS) says that its proposed acquisition of  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) is likely off the table. PostNL has a 29.9% stake in  TNT, and aimed to use the proceeds of the  UPS deal to reduce debt and bolster its pension fund. "The failed bid...comes as a clear blow to PostNL, which will not only see a de-rating as a result of the lower 'possible' proceeds, but it could also dent its business and investment case," KBC Securities says. The broker rates PostNL at hold, and lowers its target price to EUR2.2 from EUR2.9. (maarten.vantartwijk@dowjones.com)

HEARD ON THE STREET: Failed UPS Delivery Leaves TNT in Lurch
By Andrew Peaple
A DOW JONES COLUMN

14 January 2013

Returned to sender. United Parcel Services has abandoned its plan to buy TNT Express for $6.8 billion, thanks to objections from the  European Commission's competition authorities. The EC was demanding concessions including selling assets to build up another freight rival, making an already expensive-looking deal unviable:  UPS will now pay a EUR200 million break fee to  TNT. That is small comfort for the Dutch company, whose shares plunged 43% on Monday. Unless  TNT can quickly find a convincing new strategy, there could be more falls to come.

The EC's deal rejection might seem short-sighted: Europe's sluggish economy is in need of inward investment. But the regulator was worried the deal would reduce the number of major companies offering both air and ground parcel deliveries in Europe from four to three - DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx. UPS had agreed this month to sell some assets to help build up a potential fourth rival, France's DPD. Even so, the EC remained unconvinced DPD would have the capacity to be a major competitor.

Cutting its losses after nine months of negotiation seems sensible for UPS. Its EUR9.5 per share offer was already a near-50% premium to TNT's pre-deal share price: UPS shares rose 1.2% in early trading. The real problems lie with TNT. Led by interim chief executive Bernard Bot, the company has delayed plans to cut costs and find partners for its ailing Brazilian and Chinese businesses, pending the UPS tie-up. Its operating income fell by 26% in the first nine months of 2012. Lower prices have put pressure on its European business, where it
makes two-thirds of its revenue.

An alternative bidder seems unlikely. FedEx is going through its own cost saving programme and may not want to run the EC competition gauntlet. That leaves more potential downside for TNT. Analysts have been slow to
update earnings forecasts for TNT given little company guidance: its earnings per share could be EUR0.18 in
2013 compared with current consensus at EUR0.32, RBC Capital Markets says. At a 14 times earnings multiple,
in line with its peers, that would value TNT at around EUR2.50, a further 47% fall. That's not the kind of parcel
investors like to find on their doormats.

MARKET COMMENT: Europe Slips Ahead of Bernanke;  TNT Plunges

MADRID (MarketWatch)--European stock markets ended lower Monday as investors awaited a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while shares of  TNT Express NV plunged after  United Parcel Service Inc. said European regulators would block its proposed acquisition of the Dutch package-delivery company.
The Stoxx  Europe 600 index fell 0.4% to close at 286.01. The index posted a 0.3% loss last week.

Coloring the trading in Europe, stocks traded mixed on Wall Street, with shares of Apple Inc. under pressure after news reports said the company had cut orders for components used in its iPhone 5 due to weaker-than-expected global demand.

Shares of TNT Express plunged more than 41% and PostNL plummeted nearly 36%, upended as UPS said the European Commission would refuse to approve the U.S. logistics group's proposed $6.8 billion buyout of TNT Express over competition concerns. PostNL has been attempting to dispose of its nearly 30% stake in TNT.

In Paris, shares of Societe Generale SA rose 3.8% and Credit Agricole SA added 3%. Credit Suisse upgraded the French banks to overweight, citing positive effects of 2012 asset disposals and inexpensive valuations relative to peers.

Credit Suisse analysts also said they were positive on Credit Agricole's strategy of refocusing on its core franchise.
The banking-sector gains helped the French CAC 40 index eke out a 0.1% rise to 3,708.25.

Also higher in Paris, shares of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA rose 0.4%. The company said Ardagh Glass Ltd. has made a "binding and irrevocable" offer valued at $1.69 billion for the French conglomerate's North American unit, which makes glass bottles and jars.

In other deal news, shares of Swatch Group AG rose 4.1% after the Swiss watch company said it paid $750 million for the jewelry and watch brand of Harry Winston Diamond Corp. of Toronto. Swatch also assumed as much as $250 million of pro forma net debt.
European stocks got an early boost after comments from Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago. Media reports said Evans predicted the U.S. economy will grow by 2.5% in 2013, improving to a 3.5%
growth rate for gross domestic product in 2014.

Coinciding with the close of U.S. trading on Monday, Fed chief Ben Bernanke will give a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., with a question-and-answer session to follow.

Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said equities in Europe can attribute some recent gains to hopes that all central banks, but crucially the Fed, will "remain tilted toward intervention," as growth in developed economies remains tepid.

"If the sense that they will stay engaged is perceived then the expectation that investors will achieve their desired rates of return on capital deployed then we will see steady gains as carefully selected 'risk-on' assets dominate the early 2013 asset allocation decisions," Pope said in emailed comments.

"Be wary of fast-moving stocks that over the medium term are unable to be price makers," he said. "Bottom line is going to be vastly more important in 2013 than top line. Cost control [and] liquidity will still dominate."

Among other regional indexes, the DAX 30 index rose 0.2% to 7,729.52 in Frankfurt, led by shares of German chemicals group BASF SE, up 1.1%. Deutsche Bank said BASF remains its top pick in this space, rated a buy. Linde AG also ranks among its top picks, with a buy rating. Linde rose 1.6%.

Shares of Volkswagen AG gave up an earlier gain to lose 0.1%. Societe Generale said it believes the auto maker will continue to outperform in all major markets, but it did reduce earnings forecasts on the group. Volkwagen's
2013 earnings before interest and taxes forecast was cut to EUR14.4 billion from EUR15.8 billion.

In London, the FTSE 100 index lost 0.2% to finish at 6,107.86. Broker action also commanded much of the action for the index.

Shares of Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. PLC traded 3.5% higher. Credit Suisse analysts upgraded its rating to outperform from neutral, saying they believe that downside risks are now limited and that there are potential
re-rating catalysts this year.

Heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline PLC fell 0.7%. The pharmaceutical said Monday that it submitted a diabetes drug candidate for scrutiny before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

UPS Expects European Commission to Block  TNT Express Deal
By Robin van Daalen

AMSTERDAM--U.S. logistics group  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) expects the  European Commission to
block its proposed $6.8 billion acquisition of Dutch company TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE) following a meeting with
the antitrust body of the  European Union's executive arm last Friday.

UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal after a first phase review, but the process dragged on, highlighting the commission's concerns about future competition in the market for overnight deliveries of parcels in Europe. The acquisition, which would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105 year history, was announced in March last year.

The U.S. firm had offered remedies on Nov. 29, and revised its proposal twice to overcome the commission's concerns, it said.

TNT in a separate press release said UPS informed TNT Express after meeting the commission on Friday that UPS sees no realistic prospect that clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis.

UPS had offered EUR9.5 a share for the Dutch firm, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL under pressure from shareholders that argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target for its
U.S. rivals. After UPS had announced its bid for TNT, shareholders speculated on a counter bid from FedEx Corp, which didn't emerge.
To satisfy the commission's concerns UPS was trying to sell a package of assets to France's state-controlled
DPD.

AMSTERDAM--United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Monday it will abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($7.0 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV (TNTEY) after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history. The  European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, is due to announce its decision on Feb. 5.  UPS pre-empted the decision, saying after a meeting with the regulator on Friday that it expects Brussels to block the deal.

Once the commission's decision is announced, UPS said it will pay TNT a EUR200 million termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal, which was first announced last March, following a preliminary antitrust review.
UPS revised its takeover proposal three times in a bid to overcome the commission's concerns that the
overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business
and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG (DPSGY). Brussels also worried that other parcel delivery firms, including
U.S. rival FedEx Corp. (FDX), could be shut out of the market. Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal
being approved.

UPS was hoping that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, to DPD, a parcel-delivery firm controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European
overnight-parcel delivery competitor, or integrator.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here, while UPS and TNT see a wide spectrum of service providers competing and putting competitive pressure on the merging parties and others in the market."

The commission's stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes its objection to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext last year, largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.

But it approved Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion takeover of EMI Group Ltd.'s recorded music division in September, before giving the conditional go-ahead to the $32 billion mining-industry merger involving Glencore International PLC and Xstrata PLC in November.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction,"
UPS and TNT officials said they were surprised by the commission's position. UPS could have appeased
Brussels by selling European assets to FedEx, but the U.S. company showed no interest.

UPS offered EUR9.5 a share for TNT, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target.

PostNL (PNLYY), TNT's biggest shareholder with nearly 30%, said it plans to sell its stake, assuming the deal with UPS doesn't proceed.

TNT's shares plunged on the Amsterdam stock exchange after news of UPS's decision to call off its takeover attempt. PostNL shares also slumped.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand-alone strategy, which we presented in February," Chief Executive Bernard Bot said in a telephone interview on Monday.
Neither FedEx nor commission officials were immediately available to comment.

UPS drops takeover bid for TNT Express over EU objection

Berlin (dpa) - US package delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) said Monday it was abandoning it's
5.2-billion-euro (7-billion-dollar) bid for Dutch-based TNT Express after  European competition authorities said
they would likely reject the deal.

"We are extremely disappointed with the  EC's position," said  UPS chief executive Scott Davis in a statement released in Atlanta.

He said UPS, which is the world's biggest delivery service, had made several changes to its takeover plan in an attempt to overcome competition concerns, which included a reduction in the number of competitors in the market from four to three.

But EU anti-trust authorities warned that the takeover could result in concentration in the European market for express delivery, as a result dashing UPS's hopes to boosting its presence in Europe.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular," said Scott.
The news that UPS was dropping the bid sent shares in TNT Express down 40 per cent in early trading in
Amsterdam.

Kepler says TNT Express can continue on a standalone basis

(SeeNews) - Jan 14, 2013 -  TNT Express (AMS:TNTE) can live on as a standalone company, analyst Andre Mulder of Kepler Capital Markets said Monday, after US-based  United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) withdrew its takeover bid for the Dutch express delivery firm.

TNT Express said Monday UPC has decided to abandon its takeover bid on anticipated prohibition of the deal by the European Commission (EC).

The analyst argued TNT Express made good results last year. Mulder believes the Dutch group will be able to expand its operations in Brazil but it is too small for the market in China. If TNT Express has to sell operations, its first choice must be China, according to Mulder. According to him a bid by US FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) is not very likely.
Investors reacted very negatively on the derailed deal and shares in TNT Express had nosedived more than 40%
to EUR 4.94 at 1220 CET in Amsterdam on Monday.

(SeeNews) - Jan 14, 2013 - Dutch express delivery firm  TNT Express (AMS:TNTE) said Monday US-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) had abandoned its takeover bid on an expected ban by the  European Commission (EC).

The European competition authorities started investigating the EUR-5.2-billion (USD 7bn) deal in June. The Dutch group said the two companies met on Friday with the  EC's case team investigating the proposed acquisition and they were informed that on the basis of  UPS's current remedy proposal the team is working towards proposing a prohibition decision.
The US company has confirmed to TNT Express payment of the agreed EUR-200-million termination fee. TNT Express said its management will provide an update on its strategy in due course.
Shares in TNT Express had nosedived to less than half of the cash price of EUR 9.50 apiece, proposed by UPS. The share traded at EUR 4.73, down 42.6%, at 1020 CET in Amsterdam on Monday.

UPS to drop €5.2bn bid for TNT Express;  US delivery  giant United Parcel Service is pulling out of its
multi-billion bid for Dutch firm TNT Express after EU competition authorities said they would probably block the deal.

"UPS informed TNT Express that  UPS sees no realistic prospect that  EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that  UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," UPS said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands.

The decision is despite an attempt by  UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its €5.16bn bid.

EU competition authorities had warned that the takeover as constructed would result in damaging concentration in the European market for express delivery.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision."

UPS then told TNT it would not continue chasing the deal and that "formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision of the EC, which...TNT Express deems inevitable," it said.

In June, UPS launched a bid to take over TNT Express, but the EU competition authorities announced a month later that they would investigate the deal.

The EU said it was worried that the proposed merger would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services on the European continent.

The deal was expected to put UPS ahead of its two competitors as it would strengthen its position in Europe and globally.

A look at corporate deals the EU has ruled on

United Parcel Service Inc. has walked away from a proposed $6.9 billion takeover of the Netherlands  TNT Express NV, claiming European Commission regulators had demanded too many concessions for the deal to remain viable.

The Commission, the executive arm of the 27  EU countries, reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts.
Here is a glance at some of the major decisions made by the Commission's competition authority:
-In 2001, the Commission blocked General Electric Co. from buying another U.S.-based multinational, Honeywell
International Inc.

-In 2004, it demanded that Sony Corp. sell its Japanese music unit as a condition of the merger of its music business with that of Bertelsmann AG. The deal created Sony BMG.
-In 2007, the Commission blocked Irish budget airline Ryanair from buying smaller the national carrier Aer Lingus.
-Also in 2007, it approved Universal Music's takeover of BMG Music Publishing, which was not part of the Sony
BMG deal in 2004. Universal is owned by France's Vivendi SA.

-The same year, it allowed the carve-up of ABN Amro NV - the largest takeover in banking history - by a consortium led by RBS PLC and including Belgium's Fortis SA and Spain's Santander, with Bank of America as a side-player. The deal turned out to be a disaster for all the acquiring banks when the financial crisis struck just months later.
-In 2008, Mining giant BHP Billiton PLC abandoned an attempted takeover of rival Rio Tinto PLC after the
Commission raised concerns it would hurt competitiveness in Europe.
-In February 2012, Google Inc. won unconditional approval to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.

-Also in February, the Commission blocked a merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, saying it would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives.
-In September, the Commission approved Universal Music Group's takeover of EMI Music, on condition that
Universal, the largest global music company, sell about a third of EMI's assets.

-In December, the Commission approved the merger between commodities trader Glencore and Xstrata, a major mining group, but only on the condition that it sell its stake in Nyrstar NV of Belgium, the world's largest zinc producer.
-The Commission is due to announce later this week on a new offer by Ryanair to buy Aer Lingus. Document VENTCS0020130115e91e0000f

Failed UPS Delivery Leaves TNT in Lurch
By Andrew Peaple

Returned to sender. United Parcel Services has abandoned its plan to buy  TNT Express for $6.8 billion, thanks to objections from the  European Commission's competition authorities. The commission was demanding concessions including selling assets to build up another freight rival, making an already expensive-looking deal unviable: UPS will now pay a €200 million ($266.9 million) break fee to  TNT. That is small comfort for the Dutch company, whose shares plunged 43% on Monday. Unless  TNT can quickly find a convincing new strategy, there could be more falls to come.

The commission's deal rejection might seem shortsighted: Europe's sluggish economy is in need of inward investment. But the regulator was worried the deal would reduce the number of major companies offering both air and ground parcel deliveries in Europe from four to three: DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx. UPS had agreed this
month to sell some assets to help build up a potential fourth rival, France's DPD. Even so, the commission remained unconvinced DPD would have the capacity to be a major competitor.

Cutting its losses after nine months of negotiation seems sensible for UPS. Its €9.50-a-share offer was already a near-50% premium to TNT's pre-deal share price: UPS shares rose 1.6% in early trading. The real problems lie with TNT. Led by interim Chief Executive Bernard Bot, the company has delayed plans to cut costs and find partners for its ailing Brazilian and Chinese businesses, pending the UPS tie-up. Its operating income fell by 26% in the first nine months of 2012. Lower prices have put pressure on its European business, where it makes
two-thirds of its revenue.

An alternative bidder seems unlikely. FedEx is going through its own cost-saving program and may not want to run the commission's competition gauntlet. That leaves more potential downside for TNT. Analysts have been slow to update earnings forecasts for TNT given little company guidance: Its earnings per share could be €0.18 in
2013, compared with the current consensus at €0.32, RBC Capital Markets says. At a 14 times earnings multiple, in line with its peers, that would value TNT at around €2.50, a further 47% fall. That isn't the kind of parcel investors like to find on their doormats.

AMSTERDAM (AP) - Shares in package delivery company  TNT Express NV were down sharply today on news that United Parcel Service Inc. has ditched its $6.9 billion takeover of the struggling Dutch company, citing objections from European regulators. UPS had offered in March to buy  TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. But regulators said in October that the deal would hurt competition.

UPS calls off merging  plans with TNT Express

THE HAGUE, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- American package delivery company  UPS has called off its plans to merge with Dutch peer TNT Express after the  European Commission indicated it would block the deal, local media reported on Monday.

The news sent  TNT's shares down 49 percent in the Amsterdam trading during early morning trading on Monday, marking one of the biggest transactions that the commission has ruled against. Post NL, which owns nearly 30 percent of  TNT's shares, was down 34 percent.
The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around in a weak
European market.

"TNT Express regrets this situation, having believed the merger was feasible and beneficial for all stakeholders," the Dutch firm told local media.

UPS agreed to pay 5.16 billion euros (6.9 billion U.S. dollars) or 9.50 euros (12.7 U.S. dollars) a share for Dutch group TNT Express in March 2012. TNT Express was spun off when TNT Post split into its express arm and PostNL in 2011.
However, objections from Brussels, which fears the new group would have a dominant position in several
European countries leaving customers with little choice.
Brussels has only blocked 22 mergers and acquisitions deals since the introduction of merger control rules in
1989.

Collapse of UPS deal to buy TNT seen as vindication of FedEx strategy

Jan. 14--Analysts deemed it unlikely FedEx Corp. would move to buy  TNT Express in the wake of rival  United     Parcel Service's withdrawn bid for  Europe's No. 2 delivery company.

The collapse of the UPS-TNT deal, while removing a cloud from  UPS' profit outlook, added luster to FedEx's approach of growing European business organically and through strategic acquisitions, they said.

"I think it vindicates the FedEx management team completely," said analyst Donald Broughton, who covers the parcel delivery industry for Avondale Partners LLC.

"FedEx has said for years that there's nothing in the TNT Express franchise that they could not build for less than it would cost them to buy," Broughton added. TNT's falling share price since the acquisition announcement
proves that point.

Helane Becker, analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co., said in a research bulletin, "FedEx is one of the few companies with the balance sheet to pull off a deal, but in the past stated it did not want to participate in the transaction."

She added, "We do not expect FedEx to pursue TNT Express at this time as management is focused on tuck-in acquisitions in Europe. In addition, management is working on its $1.7 billion cost reduction program."

Since UPS announced plans to buy TNT last year, FedEx has closed purchases of delivery companies in France and Poland. TATEX is a leading French business-to-business transportation company. Opek Sp. z o.o. operates a domestic ground network in Poland.

FedEx also added stations in Europe, opened new FedEx Trade Networks freight forwarding offices and invested in new aircraft to serve Europe better.
Broughton didn't think the timing of the acquisitions was related to the UPS-TNT deal.

"FedEx continues to make the investments they make and the acquisitions they make based on their own internally driven strategy, not based on anything the UPS guys may or may not be doing," he said.
"They've had this point of view on (TNT) for a decade, and this completely vindicates this point of view." As a result of UPS dropping the bid, Broughton upgraded UPS stock from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating. Analysts had criticized the UPS-TNT deal as unrealistic given Europe's regulatory and economic climates.
"UPS has spent the last six months focused on trying to get this done, and now they've got to pay a $265 million penalty of shareholder wealth they might as well have flushed down the toilet," Broughton said.

FedEx share prices have kept pace with the larger market's gains since last summer, while UPS shares have lagged, he said.
The UPS-TNT deal began to unravel after European regulators said in October it would lead to
over-concentration in the sector and UPS tried unsuccessfully to sell off parts of the small package operations
and airline assets.

After meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved -- and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators on what would have been his company's largest-ever acquisition.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth "particularly in Europe."
The European Commission will publish its review of the failed deal within several weeks. Includes information from The Associated Press.

United Parcel Service announced the European Commission, or EC, has informed  UPS and TNT Express that
it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNT Express. UPS submitted an initial remedies
proposal on November 29, 2012 and subsequently revised the proposal twice. UPS began the competitive review
process with the  EC in March 2012. Upon prohibition by the  EC, the Offer Condition relating to  EU Competition
Clearance will not be fulfilled and  UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of EUR 200M and will
withdraw the Offer.

Funds Nurse Heavy Losses in UPS-TNT Deal Collapse
Reuters
663 words
14 January 2013
HedgeWorld News
HDGWR
English
(c) 2013
LONDON (Reuters)—United Parcel Service's decision to abandon its €5.2 billion ($6.9 billion) bid for  TNT Express has left hedge funds nursing potential losses of more than $700 million, as the Dutch delivery firm's shares slid.

So-called merger arbitrage funds — which make money betting on the outcomes of corporate events including takeovers — are estimated to have owned around 30 percent of  TNT shares before Monday's [Jan. 14] news European anti-trust regulators would veto it, several sources familiar with the sector said.

With TNT shares losing half their value when the market opened and ending the day down 41 percent, funds collectively could have lost more than €540 million.

"This was one of the only large, liquid, all-cash deals in Europe right now. It's going to have been really painful across the street," one merger arbitrage manager who owned TNT shares before selling them on Monday morning told Reuters.

Funds had been buying shares in TNT ever since UPS made a €5.2 billion play for the company last February. But UPS and TNT said European Union officials had told the companies that the E.U. executive Commission would veto the deal, leaving them no choice but to drop it.

It is impossible to calculate exactly how many shares were held in the hands of hedge fund because Dutch regulations stipulate that investors must only detail a stake larger than 5 percent in a company.

Among the biggest hedge fund holdings in TNT was Water Island Capital's. According to Thomson Reuters data, the $3 billion U.S.-based firm owned almost 14 million shares, or 2.56 percent of TNT, in September, making it the Dutch firm's fifth biggest shareholder.

Merger arbitrage funds have struggled in recent years amid a sharp slowdown in the deals they thrive on, as companies hold off from spending their cash until the euro zone debt crisis eases and the economic recovery looks to be on firmer ground. The UPS-TNT deal was among the top five biggest plays for merger arbitrage funds in the last six months, along with commodities trader Glencore's $33 billion takeover of miner Xstrata.

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France's DPD expand its challenge.

Funds were convinced that because the Commission was remedy testing DPD as a third rival in the market, the deal would most likely go ahead, resulting in some hedge funds switching out of short bets in the last month or so, one source told Reuters.

This week's losses also highlight the risk for merger arbitrage funds in betting on deals subject to huge regulatory and political risks for which managers are often unprepared.

"In what has been a time of very few deals, funds have been driven towards this one," one London-based prime broker said, asking not to be named.

Last year the average merger arb fund gained less than 3 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research, less than half the average fund's 6.16 percent.

Several merger arbitrage funds said that while losses were big, some funds had mitigated the damage by reducing their positions in TNT late last year amid growing worries Brussels would intervene in the deal. A common way to hedge against the risk of a failing deal was to short — bet on a falling price — shares in PostNL, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay investors a dividend and is TNT's biggest shareholder.

PostNL shares closed down a whopping 36 percent, but this was less than TNT's and means even hedge funds who hedged their position are likely to have lost money.

EC Opposition Scuttles  UPS' Proposed  Purchase Of TNT

UPS (UPS) said it's dropping its $7 billion bid for  Europe's TNT Express in the face of opposition by the
European Union.

The world's largest package delivery company said it had revised its proposal for Netherlands-based  TNT twice since March to make it more palatable to regulators at the  EU's European Commission regulatory agency.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement, adding, "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

The purchase would have made UPS, already the world's largest package delivery company by revenue, one of the top carriers in Europe.
UPS shares climbed 1.5% in Monday midday trading.

The company's revenue and earnings have declined over the past four quarters. Earnings per share decelerated from 21% to 10%, 7% and -3% last quarter amid high U.S. unemployment and global economic uncertainty.
UPS is in the Transport Air-Freight group, ranked a near-worst 190 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups.

Also in that group is No. 2 U.S. package carrier FedEx (FDX). Its sales and profit have also eased in recent quarters. Shares were up about 1%.

The strong opposition by the EU is the latest in a series of blocks of possible mega-mergers. For example, a year ago EU regulators panned the planned $11.2 billion merger of NYSE Euronext and Germany's Deutsche Boerse, saying it could create lack of competition in the derivatives market.

Still, the EU block was unexpected. When the deal was announced in March, it was thought there would be little opposition because TNT has virtually no presence in the U.S. and is just one of a group of companies, led by No.
1 European shipper Germany's DHL Express, vying for share in Europe.

The closely related Transportation-Rail group is ranked a healthy 43 on the list as budding housing and industrial recovery have boosted shipments.

The largest railroad in that group by market capitalization, Union Pacific (UNP), rose 0.4%. Union Pacific's stock has a 93 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 93% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit.

Canadian National (CNI), which operates 20,000 miles of routes spanning Canada and mid-America, edged up fractionally.

Similarly, CSX (CSX) operates 21,000 miles of railway in the U.S., District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its shares were down slightly Monday midday.

UPDATE 3-UPS to drop TNT Express bid after European Commission veto
By Sara Webb and Anthony Deutsch

(Adds analyst comment)
AMSTERDAM, Jan 14 (Reuters) -  United Parcel Service Inc
said it would drop its 5.2 billion euro ($7 billion) bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express on the expectation of an
EU veto, a sharp blow that halved the value of TNT's shares within minutes.

U.S.-based UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, had sought to buy the Dutch firm to gain access to its European network and business in fast-growing Asia and Latin America.

The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market and will have trouble regaining market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS. The plunge in its share price wiped more than 2 billion euros off its value.

UPS would also have to adjust to the loss of opportunity, said Philip Scholte at Rabobank: "This is going to make it hard for UPS to increase its position in Europe on its own."

UPS and TNT Express said the European Commission, the EU's executive body, had told the two firms it was working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, leaving them no choice but to abandon it.

"UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of 200 million euros and will withdraw the offer," once the formal decision is taken, UPS said on Monday.

The European Commission declined to comment. EC competition policy spokesman Antoine Colombani said the decision would be taken in "due time" with a deadline of Feb. 5.

TNT Express has been forced to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in Brazil, and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer.
TNT Express shares fell to 4.051 euro, compared with the UPS offer price of 9.50 euro per share.

"This is a big disappointment of course. The market had discounted the shares slightly below the offer price, but everyone had thought they would be able to work something out in the end," said Rabobank's Scholte.

After focusing on the deal for nearly a year, TNT Express will have to find a new chief executive and set out a new business strategy. The deal had initially been expected to close in the third quarter of 2012.

"Now TNT will have to continue alone. TNT's management will have to roll up their sleeves, come up with a plan and get down to work," Scholte said. TNT Express said it would give an update on its strategy in due course.

A new merger seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Its closest European rival, Deutsche Post's DHL is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get European approval for an acquisition.

"America's FedEX is the only other option and they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid," said analyst Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro.
COMPETITION

The U.S. delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive said in a statement, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular," Davis added.

Shares in PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay investors a dividend, also plunged a third on the news. ($1 = 0.7493 euros)

By Sara Webb and Anthony Deutsch

AMSTERDAM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - UPS is dropping its $7 billion bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express after European anti-trust regulators said they would veto it, leaving TNT's future in doubt and almost halving the value of its shares.

Shares in U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc gained 1.2 percent on Monday after the world leader in the sector said in a statement that European Union officials told it the EU executive Commission would veto the deal. An EU source confirmed that and said the decision could be made public as early as next week.

UPS wanted to buy the smaller firm for its European network and assets in fast-growing Asia and Latin America. While the collapse of the 5.2 billion euro takeover means a rethink at UPS, the impact is far greater on TNT, which is struggling in a weak European market and lacks a strategy for developing on its own after nearly a year of negotiations on the merger.
Investors wiped nearly 2 billion euros off its value as the share price dived 42 percent to 4.750 euros.
The two companies offered to sell some operations to ease concerns about competition in Europe, where rivals
FedEx Corp

and DHL had lobbied the Commission to block the deal, a banking source said. But UPS and TNT failed to find buyers and planned asset sales were not enough to satisfy EU officials.

"It's more than a minor setback" for UPS, said Kurt Hoefer, research analyst at portfolio manager Golub Group in San Mateo, California, which holds UPS shares. "It would have been a nice addition to have TNT's domestic routes as part of the UPS system."

Having been blocked in its attempt at a large takeover, UPS will likely return to its prior strategy of pursuing strings of small deals on the continent, Hoefer said, adding, "I don't think they have any alternative but to grow it organically."
UPS will pay TNT a termination fee of 200 million euros.
Shares in U.S.-based FedEx were slightly firmer, up 0.3 percent, while those of DHL's German parent Deutsche
Post were slightly firmer, up 0.3 percent, while those of DHL's German parent
were down by a similar margin. Deutsche Post's finance chief told Reuters the company had no interest in buying
TNT nor any other express delivery business.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Page 107 of 144 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
TNT faces an uncertain future. It has had to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in Brazil and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer in March.

TNT had been partially split from Dutch postal operator PostNL in May 2011 in an attempt to profit from express operations as traditional mail business declines. But its weak performance quickly prompted activist shareholders to push for a management shake-up or an outright sale.

"Now TNT will have to continue alone," said Philip Scholte, an analyst at Rabobank. "TNT's management will have to roll up their sleeves, come up with a plan and get down to work."

TNT, which reports annual results on Feb. 18, said it would update investors on its strategy in due course. Shares in PostNL, its biggest shareholder, plunged by over a third.

A new merger proposal for TNT seems unlikely, at least in the short term. Its closest European rival, DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get EU competition approval.

"FedEx is the only other option," said analyst Maarten Bakker at ABN Amro. "And they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid."
Others suggested TNT would be a poor fit with FedEx.

"They seem to be committed to faster-growing regions, and adding a thoroughly unionized European Union entity to the FedEx mix would certainly be a shock to that culture," said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker, who noted that few FedEx employees are unionized.
A FedEx spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue a bid for TNT. COMPETITION POLICY
Any bid from an existing operator will face questions from an EU Commission concerned about prices being pushed up and wary of mergers that shrink any market to three players from four, as would have happened had UPS faced only FedEx and DHL.

Competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week that UPS would need to create an equivalent rival to TNT before he would approve the deal. In the end, the U.S. firm seemed not to have done enough to help France's DPD expand its challenge.

UPS had offered to sell warehouses and customer bases in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, and discussed divesting other assets, including some to FedEx, according to media reports. But FedEx and DPD did not take up offers of assets.

"FedEx's heavy lobbying against the deal didn't help either, and more generally the lack of bidders was a problem," said a source familiar with the deal. "FedEx didn't offer to buy any of the assets on the block. La Poste-DPD were very close to buying the international express unit but it didn't happen in the end."

UPS CEO Scott Davis voiced his disappointment: "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," he said in a statement.
The European Commission, however, was left unimpressed.

In other anti-trust rulings recently, Almunia vetoed a $7.4 billion financial exchange merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse in February, saying the deal would have given the new company a lock on European futures trading.

This month Hutchison Whampoa overcame his concerns that its purchase of Orange Austria would reduce competition in the Austrian telecoms market only by agreeing to help other companies break into the market.

Universal Music Group staved off an EU veto on its $1.9-billion plan to buy EMI's recorded music unit in September only after promising to sell some of the British firm's most valuable labels, to get its market share below 40 percent. ($1 = 0.7493 euros)

EU regulators to block UPS, TNT deal - source

BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The  European Commission has informed national competition regulators in the European Union that it will block a 5.2 billion euro takeover of  TNT by U.S. delivery company  UPS, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

UPS and TNT announced earlier on Monday that they intended to call off their merger after the Commission told them it was likely to be blocked.

"The proposed decision is for a prohibition," said the person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, referring to a Commission block of a deal.

"The Commission has called for an advisory committee meeting on Friday," the person added, saying that national regulators would meet in Brussels to hear the Commission's reasoning.

The regulators' committee, which is made up of competition experts from the EU's 27 member states, typically endorses the Commission's recommendation.
The EU antitrust authority is expected to announce its definitive decision as early as next week. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Luke Baker)

The European Commission is working on a decision to prohibit shipping company  United Parcel Service Inc.’s
(NYSE: UPS) proposed €5.16 billion (U.S. $6.88 billion) acquisition of  TNT Express (NYSE: TNTE).
Atlanta-based  UPS proposed its original deal on March 19 and has revised the proposal twice.

“The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry,” says Scott Davis, UPS’ chief executive and chairman.

The European Commission has not yet issued a formal decision but has informed UPS and TNT that it is working on one.

The purchase price would have been $12.67 per TNT share. UPS planned to pay $3 million in cash and finance the rest. If the deal had worked out, it would have increased UPS’ European shipping services.

TNT, a shipping company headquartered in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, delivers almost 1 million packages per day and had revenues of $9.67 billion in 2011.

EC informs UPS, TNT of plans to rule against merger

14 January 2013 - US package delivery group  United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) on Monday said the European Commission (EC) had notified it of plans to block its tie-up with Dutch express delivery company  TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT) and will announce its formal decision in the coming weeks.

UPS, which agreed in March last year to take over  TNT in a deal valuing the Dutch firm at some EUR5.16bn (USD6.9bn), said today that once the  EC formalises its ruling against the deal, it will withdraw its offer for  TNT and pay the Dutch target a EUR200m termination fee.

The US group proposed initial concessions on the transaction to the European regulator on 29 November 2012 and revised them twice since then. Its chairman and CEO Scott Davis said the proposed remedies were significant and tangible, while the merger would have transformed the logistics sector, providing important benefits to consumers and customers globally, supporting growth in Europe in particular.
Last week, the Financial Times cited EC’s commissioner Joaquin Almunia as saying that the planned merger of
UPS and TNT posed serious competition problems, not easy to solve.

According to him, UPS needed to sell TNT assets to a player that could be an equivalent for TNT and had ground and air transport. French La Poste SA’s DPD unit, to which the US firm was trying to sell certain TNT assets, has no air transport of its own and therefore could not be an equivalent, Almunia has told the paper.

UPS, which planned to cover the TNT deal with existing cash and new debt, said today it would make further announcements regarding the transaction once the EC publishes its formal decision.

PostNL to shed TNT stake if UPS drops bid

14 January 2013 – Dutch parcels delivery firm PostNL NV (AMS:PNL) said today it would offload its stake in local company TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT) if the latter's planned acquisition by US package delivery group  United    Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) fails to go through.

Earlier today, the US company said the  European Commission (EC) had notified it of plans to block the proposed takeover of  TNT. In its statement,  UPS added it would withdraw its offer, which values the Dutch business at EUR5.16bn (USD6.9bn), once the regulator formalises its ruling against the transaction. This is expected to happen in the coming weeks, as noted by the  EC, and would force  UPS to pay a termination fee of EUR200m to TNT.

In response, PostNL’s chief executive Herna Verhagen said his company would seek to monetise its interest in TNT over the medium term to create value for shareholders. He also mentioned that the tie-up between the two companies would have maximised the value of PostNL’s stake in TNT. PostNL is TNT's largest shareholder.

UPS to Withdraw  $6.9 Billion Bid for TNT Express

UPS today said it will withdraw its $6.9 billion offer to acquire Dutch shipping company  TNT Express, after competition authorities at the  European Commission informed UPS that it would block the arrangement.

The deal, which would have boosted  UPS’ presence in European markets, was first announced in March 2012. UPS said it will pay TNT a termination fee of 200 million euros (about US$267 million) once the  EC formalizes its prohibition.

WHAT'S NEXT FOR TNT?

European officials feared the takeover would hamper competition,  The New York Times reported. UPS had agreed to sell a number of business units and grant access to some of its airline network to rivals, but the concessions were deemed insufficient.

“We are extremely disappointed with the EC’s position,” said Scott Davis, UPS chairman and CEO, in a written statement. “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction.”

With UPS Deal Dead, What's Next for TNT?

UPS’s withdrawal of its $6.9 billion offer to buy  TNT Express likely will lead to a “fire sale” of the Dutch shipping company’s Asian and Latin American ground networks, health care supply-chain operations, and  European road and parcel assets, a senior analyst for research firm Transport Intelligence said on Monday.
“TNT is more valuable in parts than as a whole,” Cathy Roberson said.

UPS on Monday pulled back on plans to buy TNT after the European Commission, hinting the acquisition would reduce competition in the European parcel market, said it would block the deal. UPS archrival FedEx isn’t expected to try to buy TNT in the short term, largely because it’s not clear the acquisition would fit into the carrier’s network, Jeffries & Co. wrote in a research note. The Memphis, Tenn.-based company also is focusing on improving its U.S. express network, Jefferies noted.

TNT’s road network in Latin America links Brazil, Argentina and Chile, and the company’s Asian network connects China with Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Both networks would be attractive to other shipping companies because are door-to-door, day-definite networks are in regions not known for such services.

Despite the  attractiveness of the Latin American network to multinational shippers, the operations have consistently lost money for TNT. FedEx and UPS could use the Asian road network to  leverage their newfound ability to provide domestic parcel services to a total of eight Chinese cities, Roberson said.

Clinical Express, TNT’s pharmaceutical transportation division, is also an attractive potential acquisition because of the burgeoning health care industry. FedEx and UPS could be attractive in the pharmaceutical-focused division because it would help them fill cargo planes, Roberson said.

TNT’s European assets could be sold whole or piecemeal, and global firms, excluding UPS, could bid on the cross-border road network and parcel delivery assets.

Roberson sees Dynamic Parcel Distribution, a parcel shipper, as a likely bidder, considering it’s an EU “darling” and was going to buy some TNT assets, as part of UPS’s aim to satisfy European regulators’ worries over the now-dead acquisition. But DPD’s parent company is GeoPost, a subsidiary of French postal company LaPoste, and that also could raise EU regulators’ eyebrows, Roberson said.

How TNT sold its Indian domestic road operations in 2011 could provide its shippers with a clue on the route ahead. TNT sold the operations to a logistics subsidiary of India Equity Partners and then made the company its preferred partner for domestic road delivery in India.

US delivery giant  United Parcel Service (UPS) will drop its multi-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm  TNT Express after the European Commission said it planned to block the deal,  TNT Express announced on Monday.
"UPS informed TNT Express that  UPS sees no realistic prospect that  EC clearance can be obtained and that
UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," it said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands.

US delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) said on Monday that it was pulling out of its multi-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm TNT Express after EU competition authorities said they would probably block the deal.

"UPS informed TNT Express that  UPS sees no realistic prospect that  EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that  UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," UPS said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands.
The decision is despite an attempt by UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its
5.16-billion-euro ($7.03 billion) bid.

EU competition authorities had warned that the takeover as constructed would result in damaging concentration in the European market for express delivery.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision."

UPS then told TNT it would not continue chasing the deal and that "formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision of the EC, which...TNT Express deems inevitable," it said.

In June, UPS launched a bid to take over TNT Express, but the EU competition authorities announced a month later that they would investigate the deal.

The EU said it was worried that the proposed merger would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services on the European continent.

The deal was expected to put UPS ahead of its two competitors as it would strengthen its position in Europe and globally.

US delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) abandoned on Monday its 5.0-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm  TNT Express because of objections from EU competition authorities,  TNT Express said and TNT shares immediately lost half their value.

TNT also said that  UPS had agreed to pay it a termination fee of 200 million euros, but the price of  TNT Express shares crashed by just over 50 percent in initial trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange.
By mid-morning it had recovered slightly to about 4.6 euros ($6.1) a share.

"UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," TNT Express said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands.
The decision is despite an attempt by UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its

UPS then told TNT it would not continue chasing the deal and that "formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision of the EC, which...TNT Express deems inevitable," TNT Express said.

The Dutch group however said it regretted UPS's announcement, with spokesman Cyrille Gibot telling AFP: "We thought the merger was possible."
"UPS was leading the process -- we did everything we could to support UPS to get clearance," he said.

He said TNT would now focus on a "standalone strategy" but that "the goal was clearly to complete the merger," adding more details would be announced later.

"I can't say much more, but obviously the priority is to reassure customers," of the company's commitment to providing leading services in the industry, Gibot added.

In June, UPS launched a bid to take over TNT Express, but the EU competition authorities announced a month later that they would investigate the deal.

The EU said it was worried that the proposed merger would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services on the European continent.

UPS and TNT Express are major players in the sector for delivery of small packages and are two of four firms with a comprehensive air and road delivery network on the continent.
Others present in Europe are DHL, owned by Deutsche Post, and FedEx, a US-based company.

TNT Express is a global player operating in more than 200 countries and maintains a leading role in the road freight network in Europe. It employs some 77,000 people.

UPS is the world's biggest package-shipping group, with annual revenues last year of $53.1 billion and 400,000 employees.

United Parcel Service(UPS)abandoned on Monday a huge bid for Dutch  TNT Express bending to  EU anti-trust pressures, ending a drive to create the biggest  European delivery group and boost its global position.

The decision to end the 5.16-billion-euro ($7.03 billion)takeover, announced by target company  TNT Express, immediately slashed nearly two billion euros from  TNT's capitalisation of 4.481 billion euros late on Friday to about half the value of the  UPS offer.

Both companies said that UPS had agreed to pay a cancellation fee to TNT of 200 million euros, after EU competition authorities had warned them that it was set to block the deal because it would have unduly restricted competition in Europe, even though UPS had amended its terms in an attempt to satisfy the European Commission.

The value of TNT Express plunged from 4.481 billion euros ($5.9 billion) on Friday to 2.56 billion euros on Monday morning, or to 4.10 euros per share at opening compared with the bid terms of 9.5 euros per share, but recovered to about 4.9 euros a share by mid-day.

TNT Express made clear in a statement that it had worked hard to help the deal go through, but the biggest loser from the cancellation stands to be the biggest shareholder in TNT, the Dutch postal delivery company PostNL.
PostNL owns 29 percent of TNT and hoped to use the proceeds of the takeover to reduce debt, an analyst said. The Dutch group TNT said it regretted the announcement by UPS and spokesman Cyrille Gibot told AFP: "We
thought the merger was possible."
He said: "UPS was leading the process -- we did everything we could to support UPS to get clearance."

He said TNT would now focus on a "stand-alone strategy" but that "the goal was clearly to complete the merger," adding that more details would be announced later.

TNT Express said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands: "UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis."

UPS, based in Atlanta in the United States, said separately: "Upon prohibition by the EC, the offer condition relating to EC competition clearance will not be fulfilled and UPS will pay a termination fee in the amount of 200 million euros and will withdraw the offer."
The decision is despite an attempt by UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its bid.

EU competition authorities had warned that the takeover as constructed would result in damaging concentration in the European market for express delivery.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision," TNT Express said.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry," he added.

Nico van Geest, an economic analyst at the Amsterdam-based Keijser Capital said the biggest loser was Dutch postal company PostNL, which hoped the deal would help it pay off its debts in the market.

TNT however "remains strong in Europe and is rising in upcoming markets. It does not have any debt and is busy with its own cost-saving programme," Van Geest added.

United Parcel Service(UPS) abandoned on Monday an attempt to create the biggest  European group in the fight for the global parcel market, pulling out of a giant bid for Dutch  TNT Express which immediately lost about half its value.

UPS walks away from $6.9 billion takeover of TNT Express;  TNT shares plummet  50 percent

AMSTERDAM (AP) - Shares in package delivery company  TNT Express NV lost almost half their value Monday after that  United Parcel Service Inc. had decided to ditch its (EURO)5.2 billion ($6.9 billion) takeover of the struggling Dutch company, citing objections from  European regulators.

Though TNT will receive a (EURO)200 million ($265.5 million) break fee, it faces an uncertain future on its own. The drop in share price wiped off nearly (EURO)2 billion from its market value. At one point, the shares trading in Amsterdam had plunged by 50 percent before closing 42 percent lower at (EURO)4.84.

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. But regulators said in October that the deal would hurt competition by reducing the number of companies in the sector.

In response, UPS offered to sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets. But after meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved -- and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

In its last earnings report, for the third quarter of 2012, TNT lost (EURO)3 million on sales of (EURO)1.8 billion. Former CEO Marie-Christine Lombard quit in September -- mid-takeover -- in a move that was criticized as "unethical" by TNT's chairman, Antony Bergmans, and suggested the deal was in trouble, since she stood to gain a (EURO)2.6 million bonus for seeing it through to completion.
She was replaced on an interim basis by CFO Bernard Bot.

In a statement, TNT conceded that the "protracted merger process has been a distraction for management" and that it would now focus on reassuring customers, encouraging employees and making money.
"Management will provide an update on its strategy in due course," the company said.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators on what would have been his company's largest-ever acquisition.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth "particularly in Europe."
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

Before UPS's bid for TNT Express, some analysts thought rival FedEx Corp. might make an offer for the company, but FedEx executives said in March they had no plans to do so.

SNS Securities analyst Geert Steens said European regulators have signaled they would not view a takeover by FedEx or -- less likely-- DPD, a unit of France's La Poste, as problematic. But there is little guarantee either will bid for TNT in the current climate.

Steens said TNT is worth around (EURO)4 per share as an independent company, and some observers thought UPS was overpaying at (EURO)9.50. TNT's largest shareholder -- the former Dutch national mail company PostNL -- will likely keep angling for a takeover as it needs to cut its debt.
Shares of PostNL fell 35.9 percent to (EURO)1.82.

TNT's assets in Asia and Latin America are part of the reason for its attractiveness as a takeover target, but the company's Brazilian operations ran into severe problems in 2010-2011 and were still loss-making in the third quarter of 2012.

A brief glance at key merger and acquisition deals the EU Commission has ruled on

United Parcel Service Inc. has walked away from a proposed $6.9 billion takeover of the Netherlands  TNT Express NV, claiming European Commission regulators had demanded too many concessions for the deal to remain viable.

The Commission, the executive arm of the 27  EU countries, reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts.
Here is a glance at some of the major decisions made by the Commission's competition authority:
--In 2001, the Commission blocked General Electric Co. from buying another U.S.-based multinational, Honeywell
International Inc.

--In 2004, it demanded that Sony Corp. sell its Japanese music unit as a condition of the merger of its music business with that of Bertelsmann AG. The deal created Sony BMG.
--In 2007, the Commission blocked Irish budget airline Ryanair from buying smaller the national carrier Aer Lingus.
--Also in 2007, it approved Universal Music's takeover of BMG Music Publishing, which was not part of the Sony
BMG deal in 2004. Universal is owned by France's Vivendi SA.

--The same year, it allowed the carve-up of ABN Amro NV -- the largest takeover in banking history -- by a consortium led by RBS PLC and including Belgium's Fortis SA and Spain's Santander, with Bank of America as a side-player. The deal turned out to be a disaster for all the acquiring banks when the financial crisis struck just months later.
--In 2008, Mining giant BHP Billiton PLC abandoned an attempted takeover of rival Rio Tinto PLC after the
Commission raised concerns it would hurt competitiveness in Europe.
--In February 2012, Google Inc. won unconditional approval to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.

--Also in February, the Commission blocked a merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, saying it would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives.
--In September, the Commission approved Universal Music Group's takeover of EMI Music, on condition that
Universal, the largest global music company, sell about a third of EMI's assets.

--In December, the Commission approved the merger between commodities trader Glencore and Xstrata, a major mining group, but only on the condition that it sell its stake in Nyrstar NV of Belgium, the world's largest zinc producer.
--The Commission is due to announce later this week on a new offer by Ryanair to buy Aer Lingus.

UPS scraps $6.9 billion takeover of TNT Express, faced likely rejection from EU regulators

UPS scrapped plans to grow in  Europe through the acquisition of Dutch delivery company  TNT Express because
European regulators were getting ready to reject the $6.9 billion deal.
It would have been the largest acquisition in  UPS history.

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. Regulators objected, saying the deal would reduce competition in the market for express delivery of small packages in Europe. UPS said Monday that it had proposed "tangible remedies," but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, the Atlanta company told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday that he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators. Shares of United Parcel Service Inc., the world's largest package delivery company, rose 1.7 percent to close at $79.24 Monday.

Analysts said UPS could still pursue smaller acquisitions and also might boost its dividend or take some other action to reward shareholders.

TNT shares plunged in Europe. Although it will receive a $265.5 million ((EURO)200 million) breakup fee from UPS, TNT faces an uncertain future on its own. The 42 percent drop in its share price wiped off nearly (EURO)2 billion from its market value.
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

UPS had earmarked $5 billion in cash for the purchase of TNT. Sterne Agee analyst Jeffrey Kauffman said he expected the company to now use some of that for dividends or share buybacks. He said UPS could also pursue smaller acquisitions, especially in Asia.

Jim Corridore, equity analyst for S&P Capital IQ, said UPS can still "build a stronger network in Europe through smaller acquisitions and internal growth."

Before UPS jumped in, some analysts thought rival FedEx Corp. might make an offer for TNT, but FedEx executives said in March they had no plans to do so.

U.S. analysts don't expect FedEx to reconsider in the near-term because it's in the midst of a major restructuring of its Express air cargo service.
FedEx declined to comment. Its shares rose $1.02 to close at $98.42.

UPS/TNT decision \"a blow to free markets\"

The lack of clarity over the future of TNT Express, UPS in Europe or indeed the European express market appears to owe much to the European Commission (EC) following its decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS.

What appeared to be a straight-forward - if rather large - deal to acquire  TNT Express was made much more complicated by the behaviour of the  European competition authorities, not least in the nature of their communications. That  UPS has abandoned the bid, despite the hurdle of a €200m (Dh979m) termination fee, illustrates the magnitude of the obstacles that  UPS perceived it was faced with to make the takeover work.

The pivot of the negotiations revolved around the competition authorities of the European Commission. The logic of its objections appeared to focus on the number of competitors in the marketplace. The Commission hinted that the removal of TNT Express would reduce the level of competition in the express parcel market. In suggesting remedies for this problem, they were drawn into dismembering the TNT and UPS network, a task which was doomed to fail as such assets are only worth anything as part of a network. It was unclear if the EC truly grasped this point. It was also unclear if they fully understood the complexities of express market, composed of several different markets with only limited interdependence. All of this was compounded by poor communication and a severe lack of transparency.

Joel Ray, Head of Consultancy at Transport Intelligence, commented: "It is hard to see what the EC sought to achieve through the negative stance they took to this deal. Their decision making process looks flawed, caused by a fundamental lack of understanding of the industry. It seems to have been driven by a desire to engineer a
market structure through political motivations. European shippers would have gained from the acquisition through a strong new road and air based player. This decision has set the market back many years, and risks reducing competition, not increasing it."

Of the main market players, TNT Express is now in the most uncomfortable position. The company stated today that it will concentrate on the "execution of strategy". However, it has tacitly admitted that its businesses outside Europe have poor prospects and its core European business will have to work hard just to sustain its already squeezed margins. Normally it might be suggested that TNT Express would be vulnerable to takeover, however for TNT Express the problem is the reverse. What investor or trade buyer would want the company now?

One possible candidate would be FedEx. It may be quietly happy that its rival's strategy has been frustrated, yet the prospects of a bid for TNT Express, possibly at a lower price than that of UPS, might also seem obstructed by the same logic that terminated the UPS offer.

UPS, in contrast, has received a set-back to its corporate strategy, although it is hardly a serious one. The company has huge financial fire power and will be able to consider alternative acquisitions in Europe should it wish to do so. Assuming this is regarded as a worthwhile prospect, the potential targets include GLS, which has a smaller, yet not dissimilar, road network to TNT Express. Yet, some people at UPS may be regarding the failure
of the bid a relief, with middle management in Atlanta and elsewhere nervous about the prospect of integrating
TNT Express.

The European express market is now left with a series of smaller, comparatively weak players, two strong yet frustrated players in FedEx and UPS and a very powerful pan-European and intercontinental competitor in the form of DHL. Indeed it is DHL which is probably the big winner out of this. The prospect of UPS creating a strong capability in DHL's home market can never have been welcome and now it appears to have gone for good.

EC to block TNT's $6.85-bn acquisition by UPS

United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) today said it would abandon its 5.2-billion ($6.85 billion) takeover bid of its
Dutch rival TNT Express as the European anti-trust regulator has indicated that it is inclined to reject the deal.

The Atlanta-based company said that the  European Commission (EC) has informed it and  TNT Express that it is working on a decision to block the proposed acquisition.

Scott Davis, UPS chairman and CEO said, "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular." (See: UPS offers concessions to complete TNT Express acquisition (http://www.domain-b.com/industry/Logistics/20121201_complete.html)).

UPS will pay TNT a termination fee of 200 million and will withdraw the offer once the formal decision is taken, UPS said in a statement.

In March 2012, UPS, the world's largest package delivery and logistics company raised its bid to buy TNT Expressfor $6.85-billion, from $6.43 billion first offered in February 2012. (See: UPS to acquire European rival TNT Express for $6.85 billion (http://www.domain-b.com/industry/Logistics/20120319_smaller_rival.html))
The potential acquisition would have been UPS's largest in its 105-year history after it purchased Overnite Corp in
2005 for $1.2 billion.

Buying the Netherlands-based company would have given UPS a stronghold in Europe, China, Russia, Brazil and India, most of which have high growth potential. It would put UPS on par with Europe's market leader DHL, a unit of Germany's Deutsche Post AG.

TNT, whose name derives from the post-war Australian company Thomas Nationwide Transport, holds a 9.6-per cent market share in Europe, while UPS holds 7.7 per cent, and a merger would have given the combined entity a
17.3-per cent stake, and nearly on par with DHL's 17.6 per cent market share.

Moreover, the acquisition would have increased UPS's international sales to around 36 per cent from 26 per cent to over $60 billion (45 billion).
In June 2012, the EC launched a preliminary review and broadened its investigation into the deal in July. Deutsche Post had opposed the deal saying that the merger would create a powerhouse in Europe's small
package delivery sector's limited market, mainly in the UK.

In December, UPS offered concessions to the EC by agreeing to divest certain business units and grant access to some of its airline network to rivals.

TNT has fully-owned operations in 65 countries and delivers documents and parcels to over 200 countries. The company has a fleet of 26,000 trucks, 47 cargo planes and has a worldwide network of more than 2,400 depots and hubs. TNT Airways was ranked the 38th largest cargo carrier in the world in 2011, based on cargo volume and distance carried, according to the International Air Transport Association.

TNT had agreed to sell TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas to ASL Aviation Group on condition that the sale will become effective immediately prior to completion of its proposed merger with UPS (See: TNT Express to sell airline operations if EU approves UPS merger.

Under the EU rules, a non-European company cannot own a majority stake in an European carrier.

Neither UPS or TNT gave reasons as to why the EC is planning to block the deal, but UPS said that it will make further announcements once the EC has issued its formal decision. The decision is expected to be adopted formally in the coming weeks.

Report: UPS to withdraw TNT Express deal

Atlanta-based  United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:  UPS) has been informed that the European Commission is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of Dutch peer and European market leader TNT Express.

Scott Davis,  UPS chairman and chief executive officer, said Monday  in a statement, "We are extremely disappointed with the  EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the  EC's concerns with the transaction. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in  Europe in particular."

The statement said that, "Upon prohibition by the EC, the Offer Condition relating to EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of EUR 200 million and will withdraw the Offer."
The U.K.'s  The Guardian reported Monday that UPS said it was unrealistic to hope that the European
Commission would give clearance, after the authorities said on Friday they were likely to prohibit the deal.

UPS and TNT Express  said in November that they had offered numerous concessions to the European Commission to help seal the deal. The remedies included "the sale of business activities and assets in combination with granting access to air capabilities."

UPS' Davis said Monday, "I would like to thank TNT Express for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made over the past year.

"Looking ahead, our company focus will be on the continued execution of our growth strategy. While we viewed the acquisition as a compelling growth platform, our financial strength allows UPS to capture future opportunities."

World's biggest package-delivery company, United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is planning to scrap its plans to acquire TNT Express NV following the negative response from the European Union regulators.

UPS had announced a $6.9 billion or 5.16 billion-euro bid for  TNT Express but the deal ran into troubles after the regulators in Europe expressed reservations on the deal. Following its decision to scrap the deal, USP will pay a termination fee of 200 million euro to the Netherlands based delivery company.

The deal was cancelled after the European Commission said in a formal issue that it has not accepted the proposed combination of the two companies. The acquisition would have been the biggest for UPS in its history of more than a century.

UPS Chief Executive Officer Scott Davis said, "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry."

The Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based company said in a statement that TNT regrets the situation as it believed that the merger was feasible and beneficial for all the stakeholders. TNT Express said that the deal will be formally terminated after the company receives the prohibition decision.

The shares of TNT fell 4.15 euro to 4.10 euro and were trading about 49 percent lower at the time of reporting this morning.

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -  TNT Express NV says that United Parcel Service Inc. has walked away from a
$6.8 billion acquisition of the Dutch company after learning that European regulators would reject the deal in its
current form.

UPS had offered to buy the struggling  TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, in May, to better compete with Europe's largest delivery company, Deutsche Post's DHL.

In October, regulators said the deal would lead to over-concentration in the sector, and UPS offered sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets.

But after meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no hope the deal would be approved and it wasn't interested in further concessions.
TNT will receive a (euro)200 million ($265.5 million) break fee and now faces an uncertain future. (The Associated Press)

United Parcel Service Inc.'s ongoing effort to acquire Dutch competitor  TNT Express NV appears to be over.

As The Wall Street Journal reported, UPS is dropping its $6.8 billion bid for  TNT as a result of continued objections by the  European Commission related to antitrust concerns.
The acquisition, which was announced in March 2012, would have been the largest in UPS's (NYSE: UPS)
history. It was expected to close before the end of the year but dragged on because of EC challenges.

Atlanta-based UPS is the largest private-sector employer in Louisville, where it bases its UPS Airlines division and operates Worldport, its largest sorting hub.

A $7 billion bid by  UPS to buy TNT Express has been derailed by  European antitrust concerns.
Forbes reports the  European Commission will not approve the sale of the Dutch air courier to UPS.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," Scott Davis, UPS (NYSE: UPS) chairman and CEO, said in a statement. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."
Investors didn't seem as disappointed as Davis. UPS's stock was trading up about 1.5 percent in mid-day trading
Monday to $79.03 per share.
FedEx's stock hit a new 52-week high Monday morning of $98.74, but pulled back to $98.14 mid-day.

UPS to drop bid for TNT Express after EU refusal plan
293 words
14 January 2013
Middle East North Africa Financial Network (MENAFN)
MENAFI
English
Copyright 2013. Middle East North Africa Financial Network Inc.
(MENAFN - AFP) US delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) said on Monday that it was pulling out of its multi-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm TNT Express after EU competition authorities said they would probably block the deal.

"UPS informed TNT Express that  UPS sees no realistic prospect that  EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that  UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," UPS said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands.
The decision is despite an attempt by UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its
5.16-billion-euro ($7.03 billion) bid.

EU competition authorities had warned that the takeover as constructed would result in damaging concentration in the European market for express delivery.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision."

UPS then told TNT it would not continue chasing the deal and that "formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision of the EC, which...TNT Express deems inevitable," it said.

In June, UPS launched a bid to take over TNT Express, but the EU competition authorities announced a month later that they would investigate the deal.

The EU said it was worried that the proposed merger would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services on the European continent.

The deal was expected to put UPS ahead of its two competitors as it would strengthen its position in Europe and globally.

(MENAFN)  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS), the world's largest package delivery company, said it would give up its USD7 billion bid for Dutch delivery firm TNT Express if the  European Commission rejects the deal, Reuters reported.
The company had aimed to own the  TNT Express to expand its business in  Europe and fast-growing Asia and
Latin America.

A failure to close the deal will particularly hurt TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around amid weak European market, and will be harder for it to regain market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS.

The announcement also halved the value of TNT's shares within minutes, erasing more than USD2.67 billion of its value.

Another  Deal Bites the Dust: UPS Calls Off TNT Acquisition

Roughly 10 months after a deal was first announced that Dutch express delivery company  TNT express had agreed to be acquired by parcel delivery giant  UPS for $6.8 billion, a long litany of objections by the  European Commission has led UPS to just call the whole thing off. Believing that the  EC plans to prohibit the acquisition, UPS has announced that it will withdraw its offer to purchase  TNT. In the process,  UPS will pay a €200 million (US$267 million) termination fee.

“We are extremely disappointed with the EC’s position” says Scott Davis, UPS’ chairman and CEO, in something of an understatement. “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular.”

UPS had submitted an initial remedies proposal back in November 2012, and then revised the proposal twice, ultimately to no avail.

According to Joel Ray, head consultant at Transport Intelligence, “It is hard to see what the EC sought to achieve through the negative stance they took to this deal. Their decision-making process looks flawed, caused by a fundamental lack of understanding of the industry. It seems to have been driven by a desire to engineer a market structure through political motivations. European shippers would have gained from the acquisition through a strong new road- and air-based player. This decision has set the market back many years, and risks reducing competition, not increasing it.”
The combined UPS/TNT would have been a global $60 billion company.

TNT’s fallback position, for now, will be to concentrate on reassuring its existing customer that it will continue to provide logistics services, while aiming to engage and reenergize its employees who are understandably going to be somewhat shellshocked by the news.

UPS, meanwhile, will continue to execute on its growth strategy, Davis notes. While acknowledging that the TNT offered “a compelling growth platform,” he nonetheless expects UPS will be able to capture other opportunities. What those might be, however, he left unsaid.

Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said equities in Europe can attribute some recent gains to hopes that all central banks, but crucially the Fed, will “remain tilted toward intervention,” as growth in developed economies remains tepid.

“If the sense that they will stay engaged is perceived then the expectation that investors will achieve their desired rates of return on capital deployed then we will see steady gains as carefully selected ‘risk-on’ assets dominate the early 2013 asset allocation decisions,” Pope said in emailed comments.

“Be wary of fast-moving stocks that over the medium term are unable to be price makers,” he said. “Bottom line is going to be vastly more important in 2013 than top line. Cost control [and] liquidity will still dominate.”
