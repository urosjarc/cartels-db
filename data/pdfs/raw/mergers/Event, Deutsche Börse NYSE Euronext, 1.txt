Brussels set to object to NYSE and Boerse merger

FRESH concerns have been raised over the approval of the  merger between NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche      Boerse as the European Commission prepares to publish its recommendation on the $9bn (£5.8bn) deal.

NYSE and Boerse have been attempting to convince regulators that merging to create the world's largest exchange operator will not stifle competition in derivatives and clearing.
However, it was reported by Bloomberg this weekend that EU officials told the companies at a meeting in
Brussels last month that the concessions they offered did not go far enough to allay their concerns. The European
Commission team examining the case is said to have indicated that it is likely to propose prohibiting the deal.

It is thought that European officials may publish a recommendation as soon as this week on the planned tie-up. The last day the commission can rule on the deal is February 9 and its advice is non-binding.

American regulators agreed last month that the merger could go ahead so long as Boerse sells its 31.5pc stake in another US equity market, Direct Edge.

But scrutiny has been greater in Europe, where the merger would unite the region's two biggest derivatives exchanges, NYSE's Liffe and Boerse's Eurex. European anti-trust officials had previously signalled that the companies would have to divest an entire derivatives business such as Liffe or Eurex. Both Boerse and NYSE have indicated they will not pursue the merger if they are asked to divest either of those exchanges.

Instead, they are said to have offered to cap fees on derivatives trading and clearing for three years, sell the Liffe single-stock derivatives business and license the Eurex trading system to a third party.

Mergers between bourses have stumbled in the past year, with the London Stock Exchange failing to buy TMX, owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Both NYSE Euronext and the European Commission declined to comment. Document STEL000020120101e8110001m

9:47 (Dow Jones) Encana (ECA) may face another tough year in 2012 after losing 1/3 of its market value last year as warm winter weather is lowering demand for natural gas. BMO downgrades ECA to market perform, saying it needs natural-gas prices above $4/million cubic feet to be an attractive value. Current prices are at $3, with record levels of natural gas in storage due to low heating demand during an unusually warm winter in North America. BMO says weak demand through 2012 could limit ECA's ability to enact its strategy of moving into liquids-rich gas, and lead to lower production growth. Shares are down 2.5% at $18.74. (edward.welsch@dowjones.com)

9:42 (Dow Jones) The streaming-video content land grab continues, with LOVEFiLM, a UK online-video business owned by Amazon.com (AMZN), signing deals with the BBC and commercial broadcaster ITV. The agreements, which include titles such as the hit nature documentary series Planet Earth, follow Netflix (NFLX) saying last year that costs from its push into the UK would contribute to quarterly losses. NFLX said it was halting further international expansion to amass the cash needed to support further growth. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)
9:40 (Dow Jones) The ECRI US future inflation gauge increased only a bit in December. The USFIG edged up to
98.6 from 98.4 in November. "With the USFIG ending 2011 near the lows of the year, underlying US inflation
pressures remain subdued," says Lakshman Achuthan, ECRI director. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

9:38 (Dow Jones) Winter has yet to really arrive in Chicago, with streets clear of snow and temperature seen at a balmy 54 degrees Friday. But CME is aiming to build out its lightly traded market in snowfall futures as next
month it will add contracts linked to snowfall levels at airports in New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio and Colorado. There's already a slate of instruments designed to hedge against, or speculate on, the severity of winter. Instruments will be available for electronic trade on Feb. 13, according to a CME trader notice. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

9:35 (Dow Jones) Forest Oil (FST) is getting a big lift from Stifel Nicolaus' upgrade to buy and setting of a $20 price target. "We believe that the potential for additional positive well results in Eagle Ford and Granite Wash in late February, a potential Eagle Ford JV concluding in 2Q and its Wolfcamp acreage being firmed up throughout the year with six wells will provide the key positive drivers" for the company. It also says this year's 25-50% production-growth forecast by FST could be raised. FST is up 5.5% to $14.76, which was conclude a very strong opening weak for the stock after losing half its value last year as it focuses on natural gas and liquids. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

9:26 (Dow Jones) Declines in the US for implantable defibrillators should slow this year, says Bernstein, after demand weakened in 2011 amid concerns of overuse and a Justice Department investigation. The investment banks sees the market for the devices--sold by the likes of Medtronic (MDT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude (STJ)--shrinking 5% this year. But that compares to the 13% drop it's projecting for the just-completed 4Q. (anjali.athavaley@dowjones.com)

9:22 (Dow Jones) The payrolls report was strong on many accounts, but Treasurys are now higher on the day. "Those were good numbers across the board, but the US bond market is again shrugging it off," said Michael Materasso, co-chair of Franklin Templeton's fixed-income policy committee. He says the overhanging fear about Europe continues to pump bids into Treasurys, and only relief from that side of the pond will enable investors to react more consistently to good US data. Ten-year yields could "very possibly" rise up to 3% when that eventually happens, he said. For now, there are also fears about the sustainability of these positive US indicators. Investors saw good US data in early 2011 only to be burned with a wave of disappointing reports later in the year. They want to see more proof that the US recovery is for real, Materasso said. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

9:21 (Dow Jones) While Goldman Sachs (GS) shares bested many other financials in 2011, Wells Fargo says the company is vulnerable to continued deterioration in the global economy and disruption within capital markets, potentially cutting into revenue generation and returns. It downgrades GS to market perform as it slashes 4Q EPS estimates for big banks in general by an average 31% due to challenging December markets and impacts from tightening credit spreads. The latter should hit Morgan Stanley (MS) the most. Wells also lowers 2012-2013 EPS estimates for the group by some 11% to reflect a cautious outlook for investment banking and trading activity
amid a slowing economy and regulatory risks. GS down fractionally premarket to $94.25 as Wells cuts its stock-price estimate $10 to $95-105. (brett.philbin@dowjones.com)

9:13 (Dow Jones) The Treasury bond market, already recovering from on buyers on dips, gets an extra boost on NY Fed chief's comments on rates outlook. Dudley, one of the biggest Fed doves, says the central bank must continue to evaluate need for stimulus. That inspires buyers looking for possible QE3. In recent trade, the 10-yr note was 5/32 higher to yield 1.974%. The yield falls from a session peak of 2.049% hit right after the payrolls report. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

9:11 (Dow Jones) While F1Q same-store sales and EPS at Family Dollar (FDO) were solid, William Blair is raising a caution flag about the future as it cuts EPS estimates and notes gross margin was weaker than anticipated. It adds the 10% per-store inventory jump "is a concern." Notable gains in stocks has been a worry for investors for some time, so it's no surprise that FDO shares would be down 3.4% premarket to $56.01, especially after a nearly
30% jump the prior 5 months. William Blair also notes all of FDO's latest-quarter sales growth was in consumables, compared with widespread gains the past two years. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

9:04 (Dow Jones) Hansen Natural (HANS) is finally fully embracing its Monster Energy drink brand, changing its corporate name to Monster Beverage next week and will begin trading under the ticker symbol MNST. It's quite an evolution for a company that the Hansen family started with selling fresh juice in the 1930s and whose corporate identity was mostly owed to natural sodas made using cane sugar. Monster Energy can hardly carry that all-natural torch, but it's clearly been driving the ship for HANS. Its direct-store-delivery segment, which primarily includes energy drinks, makes up more than 94% of sales and nearly all the growth. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

NYSE, Deutsche Boerse Prepare Lobbying Push To Save Merger
By Jacob Bunge

NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE) are going back to the basics of their deal as executives plan a final push to overcome regulatory opposition to their planned  merger by touting its merits directly to  European Union commissioners.

EU antitrust officials are widely expected to recommend blocking the deal on the grounds it would crate a monopoly in listed derivatives trading in the region, with a draft recommendation anticipated in the coming days.

The two exchange operators are now focusing resources on the 27 EU commissioners who will meet to discuss the deal on Feb. 1, with a final decision required by Feb. 9.

The companies' effort will involve challenging the analysis of the antitrust examiners, and attempting to kindle support among commissioners by highlighting the potential benefit to the broader European banking system and the EU's new regulatory regime for the trading industry.

"There's a month of intense activity ahead that could drive this thing either way," said one person familiar with the deal.

At stake is the biggest deal in a wave of consolidation that has gripped the exchange industry over the past year, though many of the highest-profile efforts ultimately fell apart amid regulatory and nationalistic objections.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext agreed last February to combine their businesses into a new, as-yet unnamed entity that would preside over the world's biggest listings market and dominate stock and derivatives trading in Europe.

From the start the market operators trumpeted the economic benefits of their deal. Combining Europe's two biggest exchange companies would consolidate EU oversight of the increasingly borderless business of trading securities, creating a counterweight to marketplaces in Asia that have grown faster and are more lightly regulated, exchange officials have said.

Unifying the groups' trade-clearing operations would free up an estimated EUR3 billion in collateral for the exchanges' biggest users, a potential source of relief for beleaguered European banks facing stricter capital requirements. Consolidating trade-clearing functions could also further regulators' aims of shifting more
off-exchange derivatives business onto more-transparent venues, according to exchange officials.

These arguments have fallen by the wayside during nine months of exhaustive negotiations with the antitrust case team evaluating the deal. Regulators remain troubled by the companies' combined power in listed futures and options, where the combined market share has been estimated at above 90%.

The exchanges have offered to divest all of NYSE Euronext's single-stock derivatives markets in Europe -- a sector where both companies compete -- and grant rivals limited access to their combined clearinghouse. This has not been enough to satisfy antitrust examiners, who have raised the prospect of divesting either company's European futures exchange in whole, a step executives of both firms have said would undermine the logic of the deal.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, in talks with EU Commissioners in the coming weeks, will point out perceived flaws in the antitrust examiners' review. Key is the market definition; the EU Competition Commission case team has limited its scope to the European futures and options market, determining that the much-larger

market in privately traded derivatives does not represent competition. Foreign-based exchanges like CME Group
Inc. (CME), which dominates trade in U.S.-listed derivatives, similarly have not been seen as competitors.

The exchanges will promote the efficiencies of their deal, which must be taken into account under EU merger law. They will also point out that many customers surveyed by antitrust examiners, such as investment banks, represent competitors due to their investments in competing exchanges like Chi-X Europe and clearing facilities such as LCH.Clearnet SA.

EU commissioners in the coming days will receive the Competition Commission's draft recommendation, and have the opportunity to offer changes. The matter will be discussed at the Feb. 1 meeting, and if a consensus is reached, a ruling on the deal would come then.

If enough commissioners express reluctance to block the deal, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia may return to the exchanges and work out a final arrangement acceptable to lawmakers ahead of a final meeting on the matter slated for Feb. 8.

Both exchange groups have been meeting with EU commissioners regularly over the past five months, according to persons involved in the situation, and at least five commissioners are seen harboring some reservations
around the antitrust examiner's approach to the matter.
Separately the national antitrust authorities of the EU Commission states will meet on Jan. 17 and are expected
to issue an opinion on the exchange tie-up, though this is non-binding for the broader EU decision. Meetings have
also been held between the merger candidates and these officials, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commissioners have broken with EU competition authorities in the past. In 2010, antitrust examiners proposed blocking Oracle's (ORCL) $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems after an in-depth review, but the European Commission ultimately allowed that deal to move forward.

The exchanges will not withdraw their effort prior to the final EU ruling, according to people close to the matter. No decision has been made on pursuing the matter further in court should the EU block the deal, though people involved in the process said that this course is unlikely due to the long timeframe of such cases.

The grueling antitrust review has weighed on investors' sentiment, with shareholders in both exchange companies currently seeing the merger more likely to collapse than go forward.

NYSE Euronext  Exec: Expects More Clarity On D. Boerse Tie-Up Soon

AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) will soon detail how they aim to soothe competition concerns about their planned merger, an Amsterdam-based NYSE Euronext executive said Friday.

"We are in a phase where [the  European Commission] made a technical assessment. The focus is on the clearing and derivatives activities," Cees Vermaas, the head of  NYSE Euronext Amsterdam, said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires ahead of the exchange's annual New Year's event.

Vermaas said he is currently participating in talks with the competition authorities. He declined to elaborate on the possible outcome, but said he expects more clarity soon. "It will become clear in the coming weeks," he said.

The planned $17 billion tie-up between the two global exchange operators is under scrutiny by the European Commission. The E.U.'s executive arm fears the merger would create a monopoly in regional derivatives trading, as it would get a combined market share in listed futures and options of more than 90%. In the next few days, the Commission will send its antitrust report to EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, who will make a recommendation to an advisory committee. In early February, all 27 EU commissioners will vote on the deal.

Vermaas said European policymakers should realize that the creation of a pan-European exchange operator is "very important," also in light of the current crisis in the euro zone. "It's good for the Netherlands and Europe to make it happen. It is a chance for the euro zone to get a grip on the market," he said.

However, the Dutch government could also turn out to be a dealbreaker. The government has threatened to block a sale of some parts of the Amsterdam exchange's derivatives business on concerns that it would hurt the Netherlands' position as a financial hub, a person familiar with the matter said last month.

Vermaas declined to comment on that, but said the merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse will also benefit the Amsterdam market. NYSE Euronext includes the New York Stock Exchange and the exchanges in the Amsterdam, Paris, Lisbon and Brussels
The merged entity would have a major position in Europe, and it could strengthen economic ties between the
Netherlands and Germany, Vermaas said.

NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE) are going back to the basics of their deal as executives plan a final push to overcome regulatory opposition to their planned  merger by touting its merits directly to  European Union commissioners.

EU antitrust officials are widely expected to recommend blocking the deal on the grounds it would crate a monopoly in listed derivatives trading in the region, with a draft recommendation anticipated in the coming days.

Pivetta sold 10.65% of Vanguarda's shares to BTG Pactual, of the total 10.87% that the bank said it has acquired. But a company official confirms that Pivetta remains the leading shareholder in Vanguarda, and BTG Pactual says it has no intention of altering the firm's controlling hierarchy. Vanguarda's thinly traded shares recently up 12.5% at 0.36 Brazilian real ($0.20). (paul.kiernan@dowjones.com)

1:03 (Dow Jones) After not having done so since mid-October and embarking on a 5-week, 14% slide, Apple (AAPL) shares are back in never-before-seen territory as investor anticipation builds for a rumored new-product rollout, be it a flat-screen TV, a new version of its tablet or a lower-priced iPad for budget-conscious customers. It's not unusual for AAPL shares to rise ahead of an expected announcement. In addition, Apple shares are benefiting from positive comments Monday from Goldman Sachs, which raised its stock-price target $30 to $550 on strong iPhone sales, and from Forrester Research. It says businesses are expected to spend $19B this year on iPads and Macs, a big jump from 2011. AAPL climbs 0.4% to $424.04. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

1:01 (Dow Jones) Credit Suisse expects US regional banks to post an average of 3% loan growth in their 4Q reports, which start next week, a rate that would exceed expectations for many. The firm expects Huntington (HBAN) to record 10% growth, benefiting from the comparatively strong Midwest. Growth in commercial & industrial loans as well as auto loans is why firm has HBAN its top pick for 2012. While some concerns have been raised on the return HBAN is getting for those loans, firm thinks margins will stabilize. That may help reverse 19% drop in shares last year.

Firm lowers its MSFT fiscal 2012 (ending in June) EPS estimate to $2.78, down 8c, and 2013 estimate to $3.11 from $3.21. Windows Phone also is part of the entertainment and device division.

12:52 (Dow Jones) AT&T (T) may be behind Verizon Wireless in rolling out its high-speed mobile broadband network, known as 4G LTE, but the carrier contends users should stick with them because theirs is faster. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, technology chief John Donovan says download speeds for T are up to three times faster because their backup HSPA+ network has more zip than Verizon's 3G network. T last year brought 4G LTE to more than 70M Americans, compared with more than 200M at Verizon Wireless. The carriers are racing to bring out new devices to support the pricey networks, including a slate of
$300 phones at Verizon. (greg.bensinger@dowjones.com)

12:44 (Dow Jones) Georgia's governor recently approved a state task force report that suggests ways the state can address its long-term water supply challenges, a good thing for its local governments' credit, Moody's says. The approval means cities and towns will have access to $300M of general-obligation bonds for water projects, as well as guidance throughout the process. Still, Moody's cautions the road ahead may not be easy, as "local governments must overcome a lengthy and complex process when developing water supply projects," including permitting and construction, and any projects may "require significant investment years before any revenue is generated."

12:41 (Dow Jones) Barclays Capital says truckload carriers appear poised to benefit from a positive
supply-demand equation in 2012, with the potential to boost transport rates amid limited fleet growth and a
recovering US economy. "While we share the market's concerns on the global economic outlook, we believe the
relative health of domestic US demand for transportation makes the [truckload] sector appealing." Barclays calls
Werner (WERN) its top focus, saying "pricing traction" should drive margin expansion while "market expectations
remain relatively low" for the company, fueling the potential for gains. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)

12:38 (Dow Jones) US stocks sprinted higher to start the year last week, "but the price action still shows the winter blahs - no strong conviction on the move as volume remains relative light," writes BofA/Merrill technical analyst Mary Ann Bartels. "We still believe investors should be more focused on strong stocks than the overall market because choppy trading is expected to continue in 1Q12," she says. Bartels notes several "technical concerns" in 1Q, including increased complacency in investor sentiment, and "European banks remain weak and risk getting weaker." S&P 500 up 1 at 1279.

12:29 (Dow Jones) Demand from individual investors for muni bonds was strong in December, despite the holiday season, according to BondDesk data. Average number of investor buy trades per day was 14,399, down from November's 15,936, but more than the lows seen during the summer season. Likewise, median muni yields fell consistently during the month, largely due to increased demand in the mutual fund market, BondDesk says. Per usual, wealthy states were the most actively traded issues, firm says, with California accounting for 14.6% of all general obligation bond purchases. (kelly.nolan@dowjones.com)

12:24 (Dow Jones) Goldman Sachs upgrades Ralph Lauren (RL) to its conviction buy list and boosts its price target to $190 from $154 as it sizably increases EPS estimates on the coming 2 years and says the stock should "revert back to their 1-year average multiple of 20." RL shares have been weak since the F2Q report 2 months ago amid demand concerns. But Goldman sees 4Q being "a turning point for margins & EPS growth" at the clothing company. RL is up 4.2% today at $146.67, making it one of the S&P 500's biggest gainers, and has climbed 37% the past year. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

Exchanges  Take Case Directly to EU Commission
By Jacob Bunge

NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse AG are going back to the basics of their deal as executives plan a final push to overcome regulatory opposition to the planned  merger by touting its merits directly to  European Union commissioners.

EU antitrust officials are expected to recommend blocking the deal on the grounds it would create a monopoly in listed derivatives trading in the region.

The two exchange operators now are focusing resources on the 27 EU commissioners who will meet to discuss the deal on Feb. 1, with a final decision required by Feb. 9. Commissioners have broken with EU competition authorities in the past, including Oracle Corp.'s 2010 acquisition of Sun Microsystems.

The exchange companies' effort will involve challenging the analysis of the antitrust examiners and attempting to kindle support among commissioners by highlighting the potential benefit to the broader European banking system and the EU's new regulatory regime for the trading industry. "There's a month of intense activity ahead that could drive this thing either way," said one person familiar with the deal.

At stake is the biggest deal in a wave of consolidation in the exchange industry over the past year, though many of the other efforts ultimately fell apart amid regulatory and nationalistic objections. Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext agreed last February to combine their businesses into a new, as-yet-unnamed entity that would preside over the world's biggest listings market and dominate stock and derivatives trading in Europe.

From the start the market operators trumpeted the economic benefits of their deal. Combining Europe's two biggest exchange companies would consolidate EU oversight of the increasingly borderless business of trading securities, creating a counterweight to marketplaces in Asia that have grown faster and are more lightly regulated, exchange officials have said. Unifying the groups' trade-clearing operations would free up an estimated 3 billion euros ($3.84 billion) in collateral for the exchanges' biggest users, a potential source of relief for European banks facing stricter capital requirements. Consolidating trade-clearing functions could also aid regulators' aims of
shifting more off-exchange derivatives business onto more-transparent venues, they argue.

Regulators remain troubled by the companies' combined power in listed futures and options, where the combined market share has been estimated at above 90%.

The exchanges have offered to divest themselves of all of NYSE Euronext's single-stock derivatives markets in Europe -- a sector where both companies compete -- and grant rivals limited access to their combined clearinghouse. Antitrust examiners have raised the prospect of divesting either company's European futures exchange in whole, a step both firms have said would undermine the logic of the deal.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, in talks with EU Commissioners in the coming weeks, will point out perceived flaws in the antitrust review. Key is the market definition; the EU Competition Commission case team has limited its scope to the European futures and options market, determining that the much-larger market in privately traded derivatives doesn't represent competition.

Both exchange groups have been meeting with EU commissioners regularly over the past five months, according to people involved, and at least five commissioners are seen as harboring some reservations around the antitrust examiners' approach to the exchanges' tie-up.

Insiders  say EU regulators leaning toward blocking NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Boerse merger

By GABRIELE STEINHAUSER AP Business Writer

BRUSSELS (AP) -  European regulators will push to block the planned $10 billion  merger of the New York Stock
Exchange and its German counterpart, two people close to the  merger said Tuesday.

Antitrust regulators fear that the combined company, which would be the largest operator of stock exchanges in the world, would unfairly dominate trading of financial tools called derivatives in  Europe, one of the people said.

The European Union's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, is set to recommend blocking the deal, between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse, at a meeting with fellow commissioners Feb. 1, this person said.

The second person said it appeared the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, was "working toward a prohibition." Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential.

The negative opinion of the regulatory team working on the deal will probably set off several weeks of intense lobbying, with the two companies trying to persuade other commissioners to support the merger.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse say the merger would strengthen mainland Europe as a financial center and cut costs for banks and other financial firms that would use the combined exchange.

Opponents of the deal, such as the Nasdaq OMX market and the parent company of the London Stock Exchange, will seek to convince commissioners that it could destroy other companies trying to move into derivatives trading.

Derivatives are complex financial products that allow investors to place bets on bet on interest rates, stock indexes or commodity prices -- or even nontraditional variables like the weather.

The two exchanges are believed to control more than 90 percent of the trading of some of the most popular derivatives products in Europe.

To stop the deal, a majority of the EU's 27 commissioners must vote to block the deal. A final decision must come by Feb. 9. It is rare for recommendations from the competition commissioner to be overturned.

European antitrust regulators have examined the planned merger since last early summer. Their concerns have crystallized around the two companies' strong derivative trading operations, NYSE's Liffe and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex.

The commission has asked that the companies sell one of the two platforms, the first person said -- a demand that the two companies rejected.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse argue that the commission should take into account that the vast majority of derivative trades don't happen on regulated exchanges but directly between banks and other financial firms.

They also argue that the commission should not only focus on Europe, but see derivative trading as a global market.
NYSE and Deutsche Boerse said in a statement that they had not yet received a decision from the commission. A
spokeswoman for Almunia also said there had been no final decision on the merger.

NYSE Euronext stock climbed $1.22, or 4.6 percent, at $27.79. Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill, said the stock would be worth $25.38 if the merger took place today, but he said NYSE Euronext by itself is worth
$29 to $30 per share.

The New York exchange, with its famed Corinthian columns at the corner of Wall and Broad streets in Manhattan, dates to 1792, when 24 brokers and merchants gathered to trade stocks under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street.

But its trading floor is relatively empty these days, save as a backdrop for TV coverage. So is the floor of Deutsche Boerse's exchange in Frankfurt. Most trading now takes place on computers that can match thousands of orders a second.

"The average investor isn't going to see any difference whether the deal goes through or not unless they happen to own shares in either company," said Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities.

The exchanges would probably keep looking for partners if the deal were scuttled because that is where the industry is heading, said Kenneth Marlin, a managing partner at Marlin & Associates, a boutique investment bank.
"Everybody wants to be a Ford or a Toyota," he said. "No one wants to be Studebaker."

But Schack said he doubts another buyer for NYSE would step up to replace Deutsche Boerse. Other exchange operators would likely run into the same problems with antitrust authorities, he said.
The past year was strewn with failed deals. The Nasdaq and the IntercontinentalExchange withdrew a competing
$11 billion bid for the NYSE last May after the Justice Department said it would block the deal. A deal between
the London Stock Exchange and the group that operates the Toronto Stock Exchange failed in part because of
regulatory concerns.

The Justice Department said last month that it would allow the deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to go through if the German company sold its stake in Direct Edge Holdings, the fourth-largest exchange operator in the United States.

The Striking Price
Home
How to Profit From a Busted Stock-Exchange Merger
By Steven M. Sears
564 words
10 January 2012
Barron's Online
BON

It is time to prepare for  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse to announce the cancelation of their star-crossed
merger plan.

The securities exchanges recently extended the deal termination date to March 31 in what is likely a final effort to win European approval. The U.S. Justice Department has approved the deal that was initiated in February 2010, but European regulators are concerned the deal may stifle competition in  European derivative markets. The delays are potential negatives.

"People are coming to the realization that this thing is unlikely to occur," a senior trader at a major options market-making firm said.

No matter what happens, shares of NYSE Euronext (ticker: NYX), which owns the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, are worth owning. At about $27, the stock isn't particularly expensive on an earnings basis, but investors can improve upon the price by selling put options.

Richard Repetto, a Sandler O'Neill analyst who follows exchange stocks, says NYSE Euronext seems undervalued at 9.7 times his 2012 earnings-per-share estimate.

He believes the discount reflects the uncertainty about the Deutsche Börse merger. If the deal is approved, Repetto thinks NYSE benefits. The same is true if the deal falls apart.
Repetto, a widely respected exchange-sector analyst, has told clients that NYSE Euronext is his top stock idea for
2012. He sees shares hitting $42 this year.

"On a standalone basis, NYX shareholders should benefit from the strong capital position and ability to generate additional capital through balance sheet leverage," Repetto wrote in an advisory released to clients on Friday.
Moreover, NYSE Euronext may increase its stock dividend, buy back shares, or buy another exchange if the
Deutsche Börse deal falls apart.

If the merger plan collapses, NYSE Euronext's stock will likely edge lower, but will likely soon recover as risk arbitragers exit the stock and a new class of investor, perhaps dividend-hungry ones, enter.

Shares of NYSE Euronext pay a hefty 4.4% dividend yield, which is extremely attractive to many investors who are actively looking for ways to enhance the return of stocks since the Standard & Poor's 500 index ended 2011 near the place that it began.

Investors interested in owning NYSE Euronext can use the half-and-half options strategy to establish a position. Rather than buying 200 shares, for example, an investor would buy 100 shares, and sell one June $26 put for
$1.63. If the stock price declines below $26 – it was recently at about $27 – investors buy another 100 shares. If the stock advances – either because the merger is approved in Europe, or the failure of the merger is viewed as a positive outcome for NYSE Euronext – investors can keep the money received for selling the put.

At current levels, NYSE Euronext's stock is attractive. Shares are down about 14% in the past year and trading about $5 higher than their 52-week low, and right around book value. If the deal suddenly wins approval, no harm is done.

If the deal collapses, investors own a stock that pays a hefty dividend and whose price could increase with any uptick in U.S. stock and options trading volumes.

European Union regulators have preliminarily rejected a proposed  merger between the  NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino reported Tuesday, citing people close to the NYSE.
The regulators have indicated to NYSE that they will not approve the deal, Gasparino said. The EU
commisssioners have yet to rule on the proposed merger in what is a two-step approval process, he said.

12:56 (Dow Jones) Coinstar (CSTR) is continuing to reverse last week's slide as the Redbox DVD kiosk owner could issue 2012 EPS guidance a good bit above consensus estimates, says Northland Capital. It contends that other analysts may not be "accurately reflecting the real potential impact of the DVD pricing increase, interchange fee increase and one-time billing software workaround." Northland's Street-high profit target is 28% higher than consensus, and while the fee increase will hurt profitability as most of its users pay by debit card, most--if not
all--of that will be offset by the price increase. Meanwhile, the billing change should boost 2H EPS. CSTR is up
3% today at $44.48, putting the week's advance at 8.5%. But it's still down 2.5% for the month.

12:54 (Dow Jones) After holding under the flatline for much of the session, Treasurys recently turned higher despite $32 billion of three-year supply hitting the market. Perhaps giving the market a push up, some Fed officials seemed to remain open to the idea of further easing action. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said there's a case for action if the economic data deem it necessary. Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto said, on balance, she remains open to further efforts. Benchmark 10-year notes up 1/32 to yield 1.958% and
30-year bonds up 5/32 to yield 3.020%. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)
12:52 (Dow Jones) Illumina (ILMN) shares trip a circuit breaker as the company unveiled its new
gene-sequencing system that is able to sequence an entire genome in about 24 hours. ILMN said the new system
costs $50,000 to upgrade from a previous model. As ILMN presented the news at the JPMorgan healthcare
conference, ILMN shares quickly spiked to $33.84 and tripped a circuit breaker. After the break, the stock settled
back and recently flat at $31.82. ILMN's news comes as Life Technologies (LIFE) shares rise 8.3% on news it will
sell a machine that can map an individual's entire genetic makeup for $1,000 by year's end.

12:47 (Dow Jones) An ongoing challenge for medical-device makers selling big-ticket implants, such as Medtronic (MDT) or Zimmer (ZMH), is declining influence over surgeons as hospitals buy out physician practices. Well, that trend is likely to continue, according to the nation's biggest for-profit hospital chain, HCA. CEO Richard Bracken notes HCA's roster of physician employees has "grown dramatically" to 3,000 in recent years. Company doesn't want to employ every doctor, but this will be "a growing piece of the business," Bracken says at JPMorgan conference. HCA up 1.7% at $22.01. (jon.kamp@dowjones.com)

12:43 (Dow Jones) KKR spent nearly $10B recently buying oil producer Samson and Internet company Go Daddy, but those deals should lift 4Q results with the fees they brought the private equity firm, Wells Fargo says. Firm estimates transaction fees for the quarter will be around $197M, up from $98.6M in 3Q. That, a strong performance from KKR's publicly traded holdings, including Dollar General (DG) and Nielsen Holdings (NLSN), and what the firm suspects was strong performance from other KKR portfolio companies, should yield an investment gain of nearly $370M, up from a $688.5M loss in 3Q. KKR up 0.6% to $13.67. (ryan.dezember@dowjones.com)

12:42 (Dow Jones) Hospital operator HCA expects more industry consolidation, though its own deal-making may be modest this year after a busy 2011, says CEO Richard Bracken during a JPMorgan conference. In general,

hospital companies have been snapping up individual hospitals or smaller systems as the industry deals with pressure from the economy and government-funded health plans. For its part, Bracken noted HCA is a "picky" acquirer, but can swing into action when needed. The biggest US for-profit hospital firm has a "chassis that is made for growth" and "a balance sheet that will allow us to take advantage" of deal opportunities. Shares are up
1.2% at $21.90. (jon.kamp@dowjones.com)

12:31 (Dow Jones) Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) shares up 10% to $1.76 on news that FDA accepted company's resubmitted new drug application for weight-loss drug lorcaserin. News probably isn't a surprise to investors but enough to lift ARNA's low-priced, beaten-down stock. Weight-loss drugs have a high-bar for FDA approval, though. (anjali.athavaley@dowjones.com)

12:31 (Dow Jones) After a December swoon, shares of Vasco Data Security (VDSI) have jumped today on an upgrade to buy at Wunderlich. It cites "an attractive entry point" following the recent stock weakness "and increased confidence in the company's enterprise business trends." The company isn't changing estimates or its
$8.25 price target for now "but have increased confidence in our outlook for VDSI." Its shares have been crushed the past 6 months amid the bankruptcy of a business acquired a year ago and the company's exposure to the European banking sector. On a good note, VDSI is exposed to last month's launch of the "Star Wars" multiplayer online video game, of which more than 2M copies has been sold. Shares climb 13% to $7.78. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

12:23 (Dow Jones) Three-years are unchanged in price, yielding 0.366%. If sold at the current market rate, the upcoming sale would offer the third-lowest yield in the history of three-year auctions. Prices in the market have erased overnight losses, with buyers returning to scoop up Treasurys on the cheap. The 30-year bond is the first to turn higher, up 2/32 in price to yield 3.024%. (cynthia.lin@dowjones.com)

12:23 (Dow Jones) Higher prices explain a significant part of Brazil's growth in exports and imports last year--not volumes--which is the opposite of what happened in 2010, notes Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, export prices look "less favorable" this year, so the trade surplus should fall to $22B from $30B, the investment bank predicts. Last year, export prices rose 23% while volumes increased 3% as raw-materials prices rose 31% and those on
semi-manufactured products jumped 21%. Import prices, on the other hand, increased a more-modest 14%. "Unlike 2010," when import-volume growth "accounted for almost all of the rise in imports, the prices of imported products were a more significant driver" to growth last year.

12:22 (Dow Jones) The $2.8B in asset-backed securities set for sale this week, led by $2B of auto ABS, are seen pricing cheaper than secondary markets due to the heavy supply, according to a dealer's note. Auto deals, including Ally Financial's $1.08B in ABS, may yield 15-19 bps over eurodollar synthetic forward rates for one-year debt, or about 5-8 bps cheaper than today's levels, according to price guidance.

UPDATE: NYSE-Deutsche Boerse Merger Seen Rejected By EU Regulators

(Updates with comments from Deutsche Boerse and NYSE spokesmen, additional background and share prices beginning in the 1st paragraph.)
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to media reports Tuesday.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates had not yet received any decision by the EU on the deal. Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino reported the finding Tuesday, citing people close to the NYSE.

The ruling by the European Union Competition Commission case team is not the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.
NYSE Euronext shares climbed 2.9% to $27.33 following the reports, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as
well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in
recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.

Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to media reports Tuesday.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates hadn't yet received any decision by the EU on the deal. Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino reported the finding Tuesday, citing people close to the NYSE.
A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined comment.

Executives of both firms will meet Wednesday to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger plan in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The ruling by the European Union antitrust case team isn't the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.
NYSE Euronext shares climbed 2.9% to $27.33 following the reports, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as
well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in
recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.
A report from Sander O'Neill said that the share price movements Tuesday reflect investors' growing belief that
NYSE Euronext is worth more on a standalone basis. Sandler estimated the company on its own was worth about
$30 per share.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to a senior European Union official.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates hadn't yet received any notice of a decision by the EU on the deal. A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined comment.

Executives of both firms will meet Wednesday morning in New York to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger plan in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The ruling by the European Union antitrust case team isn't the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

But odds are now heavily against the deal. Only about 10% of mergers that undergo an in-depth EU probe survive a recommended block by antitrust examiners, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.

NYSE Euronext shares climbed 4.4% to $27.76 Tuesday afternoon, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.
A report from Sander O'Neill said that the share price movements Tuesday reflect investors' growing belief that
NYSE Euronext is worth more on a standalone basis. Sandler estimated the company on its own was worth about
$30 per share.

5:42 (Dow Jones) Sooner or later exchange companies are likely to run out of  merger partners, says Chicago Board Options Exchange CEO Bill Brodsky, as deals either get done or are blocked by regulators. "With every group of M&A deals, there are fewer potential deals left out there," says Brodsky, speaking at a CBOE Holdings (CBOE) event Tuesday. Sector's biggest tie-up--merger between Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and NYSE Euronext (NYX)--in limbo after  EU antitrust regulators recommend disallowing the deal. Mergers among exchanges in Asia, Canada and UK have also fallen apart, while BATS Global Markets secured a rare win closing its acquisition of Chi-X  Europe. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

5:27 (Dow Jones) Stryker's (SYK) preliminary 4Q sales show growth in the market for replacement hip and knees is still sluggish. SYK says revenue in the quarter was $2.2B, up 11% on strong sales in neurotechnology and spine. But company's reconstructive joint business grew just 0.7%, excluding currency. Patients have been
putting off such surgeries amid a weak economy. Nonetheless, SYK shares up 2% to $53.31 in after-hours trading as company offered a bullish earnings outlook for 2011 and 2012. (anjali.athavaley@dowjones.com)

5:15 (Dow Jones) Analysts eagerly anticipating potential shift of 9M "dual eligible" people in US -- meaning they get both Medicaid and Medicare benefits -- onto managed-care plans. Humana (HUM) is heavily involved in Medicare-based plans, and not so much Medicaid, but wants to be involved, CEO Michael McCallister says at JPMorgan conference. He notes Humana may partner with other firms to address opportunity and says "there's a chance we'll have some smaller acquisitions" as well. The dual-eligible issue gets a lot of attention, but "I don't think it's over-hyped," McCallister says. (jon.kamp@dowjones.com)

5:02 (Dow Jones) Wooing developers to write Windows apps has become a motif for Microsoft (MSFT) executive speeches. "We think we have an incredible opportunity for developers," Tami Reller, who heads finance and marketing for Windows, told a Las Vegas CES audience. The Windows app store, opening soon, will return 70% of the first $25,000 in revenue to the developer and 80% there after, which Reller told her audience was "an incredible opportunity to get return on investment." There are currently 50,000 Windows Phone apps, one-tenth the number of apps for Apple (AAPL) devices. (steve-d.jones@dowjones.com)

5:01 (Dow Jones) California's December revenue came in $165.2M below projections in the governor's proposed FY13 budget, and when compared with the state's adopted 2011-2012 budget, revenues were $1.4B below estimates, state Controller John Chiang's office said. "Coupled with higher spending tied to unrealized cost savings, these latest revenue figures create growing concern that legislative action may be needed in the near future to ensure that the State can meet its payment obligations," Chiang said. (kelly.nolan@dowjones.com)

4:57 (Dow Jones) Kodak (EK) aims its patent arsenal at the tablet market with its new lawsuits against Apple (AAPL) and HTC (2498.TW). EK's strategy of going after big-ticket patent settlements from smartphone makers has yielded big results in the past, such as nearly $1B in payments from LG and Samsung. EK's defenders have argued the company's IP stable could also allows it to sue the manufacturers of tablets--and most other devices with a camera, for that matter. EK calls out the iPad and iPod and HTC's tablets in a press release about the latest litigation Tuesday. EK up 5% after-hours. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

4:41 (Dow Jones) All the disasters that damaged the bottom line of insurers in 2011 covered up an important underlying problem: the lines of coverage that have nothing to do with property protection aren't doing all that well either, according to executives speaking at the Property/Casualty Insurance Joint Industry Forum in New York. David Long, CEO of insurer Liberty Mutual, reminded attendees that some lines, such as worker's compensation, are "just fundamentally underpriced." James Kennedy of Ohio Mutual agreed. "It's not just about [catastrophes]," he said. "If that's the only thing we have our eye on," the insurance industry is going to have a problem, he said. (erik.holm@dowjones.com)

4:33 (Dow Jones) Urban Outfitters (URBN) shares off 13% to $25.60 after hours following resignation of CEO Glen Senk. Senk, 55, CEO since 2007, "plans to pursue another opportunity," the company said. URBN's new CEO is 64-year-old Richard Hayne, who has been board chairman and president since 1976, suggesting he's kept a tight watch over the company he co-founded. (karen.talley@dowjones.com)

4:30 (Dow Jones) Kodak (EK) really on the offensive today. EK says it's suing Apple (AAPL) and HTC (2498.TW), accusing the mobile device makers of infringing digital imaging patents. The move comes as the ink was barely dry on the company's announcement it is realigning its business into two segments -- one focused on commercial and the other on consumer products and patents. EK says certain AAPL iPhones, iPad and iPods, as well as some HTC smartphones and tablets, infringe on its patents on a technology for transmitting images. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

4:30 (Dow Jones) Muni triple-A benchmark yields hit new all-time lows in several spots today, according to Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data, and at least by one measure, there's not much to stop that trend from continuing. MMD says it's hearing primary supply could stay "sluggish" until February. "Certainly the holiday shortened week next week could discourage supply but even in the last full week of January supply may be very manageable," firm says. This week's $4B to $5B calendar is highlighted by Wednesday's $800M competitive sale from Illinois, fresh off a downgrade from Moody's. (kelly.nolan@dowjones.com)

4:22 (Dow Jones) Oracle's (ORCL) standing as a technology bellwether is growing. It missed revenue expectations last quarter and now Software AG is reporting a similar miss because of weak financial sector sales and customer's reluctance to invest. ORCL attributed its miss to a longer sales cycle and CEO's meddlesome reviews. The focus shifts next to Microsoft (MSFT) which reports 2Q earnings Jan 19 and SAP (SAP), which reports 4Q earnings Jan 25. ORCL traded down 0.4% to $26.91 for the day, SAP was down 1.6% to $53.85 and MSFT was up 0.3% at $27.84. (steve-d.jones@dowjones.com)

4:12 (Dow Jones) With the traditional Jan 1 reinsurance renewal season now in the rear view mirror, CEO James Kennedy of Ohio Mutual Insurance told attendees at Tuesday's Property/Casualty Insurance Joint Industry Forum his company's just-completed effort to buy reinsurance was perhaps "the most difficult and challenging renewal we've ever had." Tornadoes that plagued with Midwest in 2011 caused prices to rise. But reinsurers should take note of how Ohio Mutual responded to the increase in disasters: they used the Jan 1 renewals to "raise our threshold of what we considered a creditworthy reinsurer," Kennedy said. That meant some reinsurers the company previously did business with no longer qualified. (erik.holm@dowjones.com)

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to media reports Tuesday.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates had not yet received any decision by the EU on the deal. Fox Business Network's Charles Gasparino reported the finding Tuesday, citing people close to the NYSE.

The ruling by the European Union Competition Commission case team is not the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.
NYSE Euronext shares climbed 2.9% to $27.33 following the reports, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as
well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in
recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.
NYSE Euronext shares climbed 2.9% to $27.33 following the reports, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as
well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in
recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.
A report from Sander O'Neill said that the share price movements Tuesday reflect investors' growing belief that
NYSE Euronext is worth more on a standalone basis. Sandler estimated the company on its own was worth about
$30 per share.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to a senior European Union official.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates hadn't yet received any notice of a decision by the EU on the deal. A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined comment.

Executives of both firms will meet Wednesday morning in New York to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger plan in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The ruling by the European Union antitrust case team isn't the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

But odds are now heavily against the deal. Only about 10% of mergers that undergo an in-depth EU probe survive a recommended block by antitrust examiners, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.

NYSE Euronext shares climbed 4.4% to $27.76 Tuesday afternoon, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.
A report from Sander O'Neill said that the share price movements Tuesday reflect investors' growing belief that
NYSE Euronext is worth more on a standalone basis. Sandler estimated the company on its own was worth about

Responding to an earlier rumor from FOX Business Networks' Charlie Gasparino the  EU has "nixed" the deal between NYSE Euronext (NYSE: NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse, Bloomberg now reporting on an e-mailed statement from Deutsche Boerse.
The company has said it has not yet received any  EU decision related to the  NYSE merger. Deutsche Boerse
reiterated the  EU final ruling will be on February 9th.

EU sees NYSE-DeutscheBoerse tie-up as unacceptable: source

European regulators consider a  merger between stock market operators  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext to be unacceptable, a source said Tuesday, as the  European Commission approaches making a final decision next month.

The services of Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia still have reservations and objections to a  merger which would see Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm, a source familiar with the review told AFP on condition of anonymity.

"It is not certain the Commission could accept" the merger when it considers the deal on February 1 or 9, added the source.
The European Commission declined to comment.
Last month the source told AFP that the merger "is difficult for the Commission to accept in its current state."

The Frankfurt and New York exchange operators both indicated Tuesday they had received no information about the Commission's position, and would not comment on speculation.
They said they had been told a final decision on the proposed merger would be taken on February 9.

In September they received from the Commission a "Statement of Objections" regarding the merger, essentially regarding a potential domination of the equity derivatives trading and clearing segment.

In November they proposed NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse would each sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay the Commission's concerns.

The source said that the Commission's competition experts, which had estimated the combined exchanges would dominate 90 percent of the derivatives market in Europe, had tested their proposals but were not satisfied.

"We have also proposed substantial and tangible concessions that address the EC’s competition concerns," NYSE Euronext said in a statement.
The proposed merger has sparked controversy in the US because it would hand over the New York Stock
Exchange to foreign owners and create a powerful force in 24-hour global trading of shares and derivatives.
The value of the combined company would be $17 billion, according to Dow Jones Newswires. csg/rl/fz

E.U. Antitrust Chief to Block  NYSE-Deutsche Boerse Deal: Report
Reuters

FRANKFURT, Germany (Reuters)—European Commission antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia told  Deutsche          Boerse and NYSE Euronext he plans to block their $9 billion deal, the Financial Times said in its online edition on Tuesday [Jan. 10].

Mr. Almunia, the  European competition commissioner, has told the  merger parties that he plans to prohibit the bid to create the world's biggest exchange group, the Financial Times said, without citing sources.

Asked to comment on the report, a spokesman for the European Commission said: "The decision concerning this proposed merger is due to be taken by the Commission before 9 February. Until the decision is taken, we cannot comment, confirm and/or deny anything."

Mr. Almunia's case team have drafted an official recommendation to disallow the deal because it will create a dominant player in European exchange traded derivatives markets, the Financial Times further said, citing two people involved in the process.
An E.U. source said it is likely that a draft proposal on the decision is out now.

Reuters reported last month that European Commission antitrust officials showed no sign of being swayed by last-ditch arguments to save the deal, forcing Deutsche Boerse and NYSE to lobby European Commissioners, including Almunia directly.

Deutsche Boerse on Tuesday said: "Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have not received yet any decision by the European Commission regarding the requested merger of both companies. The Commission has announced that it will make its final ruling on whether to clear the proposed merger by February 9, 2012. As a matter of
policy, we cannot comment on speculation."

Placing a stop on exchange mergers
Stephen Bartholomeusz
864 words
11 January 2012
Business Spectator
NBSPEC
English
2012 © Business Spectator Pty Ltd. All rights reserved.
The likely block of a  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext highlights policymakers' unease with stock exchange consolidation and that won't change anytime soon.

It is possible to lump the European Commission’s looming recommendation to block the proposed  merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext – a deal that would form the world’s largest securities exchange – in with the string of similar failed stock exchange deals around the world last year.

On that interpretation the long journey towards consolidation of the world’s bigger exchanges has effectively ended because regulators have come to the conclusion that they don’t want any further concentration.

Last year, we saw the attempt by Singapore Stock Exchange to merge with the ASX blocked by Wayne Swan on national interest grounds, the London Stock Exchange forced to abandon its planned merger with Canada’s TMX Group after a parochial backlash and the emergence of a counter-bid from local banks and pension funds, and a hostile bid by Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange for NYSE Euronext stopped by the US Justice Department.
In total, deals between exchanges that had a face value of more than $35 billion failed.

The attempted mergers were driven by similar motivations. Incumbent traditional stock exchanges have seen their market share, volumes and profitably undermined by new competitors and trading platforms.

Cash equities, the traditional staple for exchanges, are now a shrinking, low-margin, commodities product, causing a push into derivatives trading and creating incentives for mergers to extract synergies and drive down costs to enable the exchanges to compete with the new electronic platforms.

There is a particular reason, one which has no relevance to the failure of the ASX/SGX or TMX/LSE mergers, for the European Commission’s opposition to the Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext transaction.

If they merged, the combination of their derivatives businesses would give the new entity a near-monopoly on trading in some segments of European futures trading. It would dominate European exchange-traded derivative markets.

According to the Financial Times, the EC would allow the merger to go ahead if one of the derivatives exchanges were sold, but the companies aren’t prepared to contemplate that, presumably because it is the central appeal of the proposal. They have argued that the market for exchange-traded derivatives is global and that there is also competition from over-the-counter derivatives activity.
In any event, the EC position is driven by competition policy issues, as was the Justice Department’s opposition
to the bid for Nasdaq OMX. Another concern about creating dominant derivatives markets is the potential threat to
systemic stability in the event of a major financial crisis if most derivative trading is being cleared and settled
within a single entity.

The ASX/SGX and TMX/LSE deals failed, not on competition grounds, but because of parochialism, the fear of a loss of sovereignty and some concerns, particularly in the case of the ASX/SGX proposal, about the potential for threats to the integrity of the local market and its clearing and settlement systems in the event of a financial crisis. Swan has stated that he isn’t opposed in principle to a merger of ASX and another exchange.



Page 64 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Since that merger was blocked, competition has been introduced to the Australian exchange-traded securities market with the launch of Chi-X’s platform. There are other ‘new age’ platforms interested in entering the market, too.

The ASX’s interest in the SGX merger wasn’t just about, or even mainly about, the value it would release for its shareholders, but was rather driven by its concerns that it would lose value and relevance in a more consolidated and significantly more competitive environment.

Even if the tide of global consolidation has now peaked, those concerns would remain. The tie-up with SGX offered synergies but more particularly would have linked ASX and Australia far more directly into the rapidly growing regional capital flows within Asia and would have produced a very powerful regional derivatives business. There was a fundamental logic to the deal beyond synergies and scale.

That logic remains, even if it is improbable that a link with SGX will be contemplated again any time in the foreseeable future, as does the increasing pressure being exerted on exchanges like ASX from the new platforms.

Whatever the logic, however, it is apparent that regulators and politicians don’t like exchange mergers of any real scale and import, whether it is for political reasons or on competition grounds.

The continuing financial crisis and its politicisation of anything to do with finance, the fear of derivatives and any concentration of activity in them, and narrow and arguably outdated definitions of the boundaries of securities markets make it unlikely that any merger of significance will get past them smoothly any time soon. The era of exchange consolidation and the notion of global exchanges may not have ended, but it does appear to have paused. 11 Jan 2012 1:11 PM

NYSE CEO: EU Antitrust Review 'Fundamentally Flawed'
By Jacob Bunge
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

The chief executive of NYSE Euronext (NYX) said that  European Union antitrust regulators' analysis of his company's planned merger with Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) was "fundamentally flawed," after regulators recommended blocking the deal.

Competition authorities that have come to view a planned combination of the two exchange groups' futures markets as a monopoly on European futures and options trade have ignored competing markets in off-exchange derivatives and overseas platforms, NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer said in a video message to his employees.

"I have to tell you I think that's a conclusion that results from a fundamentally flawed technical analysis that ignores the realities of the marketplace that we live and work in every day," Niederauer said in the message, a transcript of which was reviewed by Dow Jones.

Niederauer said that the exchanges have not yet received notice of a formal decision from competition authorities, and based his comments on news reports Tuesday.
A representative for Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.

EU antitrust examiners have determined that the merger candidates compete with one another for futures and options trade carried out on exchanges, but not with the private market in swaps and other instruments, or foreign-based derivatives exchange operators like CME Group Inc. (CME), which controls an estimated 90% of U.S. futures trade.

Those regulators Tuesday issued a recommendation that the EU not allow the merger to go ahead, according to a senior EU official, but members of the European Commission will have a final say on the matter. NYSE and Deutsche Boerse executives plan to focus resources on lobbying these lawmakers over the coming weeks, with a final ruling on the deal scheduled to come by Feb. 9.

"[O]ver the next few weeks we're going to continue to press our case directly with various Commissioners in the EU, both to highlight the serious flaws in the case team's core argument, and to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," Niederauer said.

EU set to axe Deutsche and NYSE merger;  CAPITAL MARKETS

THE HEADS of  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are set to hold urgent talks today to try to stop reS gulators ripping up their $9bn (£5.81bn) merger. Duncan Niederauer and Reto Francioni, the respective chief executives, are expected to meet in New York after it appeared the  European competition commissioner would veto the deal to create the world's largest exchange group Regulator Joaquín Almunia has reportedly told  NYSE and Deutsche he will only allow the  merger if they perform a U-turn and agree to sell one of their main derivatives businesses.

The two firms have been engaged in frantic lobbying since the deal was agreed in February because of fears the merged entity would have a monopoly in  European futures and options.

The EU antitrust case team and Almunia work together but it remains unclear whether Almunia shares the views of the team. An EU source said it is likely that a draft proposal on the decision is out now but the commission could not be contacted last night. Deutsche and NYSE said they have not received a decision from the European Commission and expect the final ruling by 9 February.

They added: "We have also proposed substantial and tangible concessions that address the EC's competition concerns and further contribute to the creation of a stable, regulated pan-European exchange infrastructure that would ensure Europe's competitiveness in an increasingly competitive global market, and deliver significant benefits to participants in the real economy."

Insiders  say EU regulators leaning toward blocking NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Boerse merger

BRUSSELS, Belgium _  European regulators will push to block the planned $10 billion  merger of the New York
Stock Exchange and its German counterpart, two people close to the  merger said.

Antitrust regulators fear that the combined company, which would be the largest operator of stock exchanges in the world, would unfairly dominate trading of financial tools called derivatives in  Europe, one of the people said Tuesday.

The European Union's competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, is set to recommend blocking the deal, between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse, at a meeting with fellow commissioners Feb. 1, this person said.
The second person said Tuesday that it appeared the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, was
``working toward a prohibition.'' Both people spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential.

The negative opinion of the regulatory team working on the deal will probably set off several weeks of intense lobbying, with the two companies trying to persuade other commissioners to support the merger.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse say the merger would strengthen mainland Europe as a financial centre and cut costs for banks and other financial firms that would use the combined exchange.

Opponents of the deal, such as the Nasdaq OMX market and the parent company of the London Stock Exchange, will seek to convince commissioners that it could destroy other companies trying to move into derivatives trading.

Derivatives are complex financial products that allow investors to place bets on bet on interest rates, stock indexes or commodity prices _ or even nontraditional variables like the weather.

The two exchanges are believed to control more than 90 per cent of the trading of some of the most popular derivatives products in Europe.

To stop the deal, a majority of the EU's 27 commissioners must vote to block the deal. A final decision must come by Feb. 9. It is rare for recommendations from the competition commissioner to be overturned.

European antitrust regulators have examined the planned merger since last early summer. Their concerns have crystallized around the two companies' strong derivative trading operations, NYSE's Liffe and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex.

The commission has asked that the companies sell one of the two platforms, the first person said _ a demand that the two companies rejected.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse argue that the commission should take into account that the vast majority of derivative trades don't happen on regulated exchanges but directly between banks and other financial firms.

They also argue that the commission should not only focus on Europe, but see derivative trading as a global market.
NYSE and Deutsche Boerse said in a statement that they had not yet received a decision from the commission. A
spokeswoman for Almunia also said there had been no final decision on the merger.

NYSE Euronext stock climbed $1.22, or 4.6 per cent, at $27.79. Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill, said the stock would be worth $25.38 if the merger took place today, but he said NYSE Euronext by itself is worth
$29 to $30 per share.

The New York exchange, with its famed Corinthian columns at the corner of Wall and Broad streets in Manhattan, dates to 1792, when 24 brokers and merchants gathered to trade stocks under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street.

But its trading floor is relatively empty these days, save as a backdrop for TV coverage. So is the floor of Deutsche Boerse's exchange in Frankfurt. Most trading now takes place on computers that can match thousands of orders a second.

``The average investor isn't going to see any difference whether the deal goes through or not unless they happen to own shares in either company,'' said Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities.

The exchanges would probably keep looking for partners if the deal were scuttled because that is where the industry is heading, said Kenneth Marlin, a managing partner at Marlin & Associates, a boutique investment bank.
``Everybody wants to be a Ford or a Toyota,'' he said. ``No one wants to be Studebaker.''

But Schack said he doubts another buyer for NYSE would step up to replace Deutsche Boerse. Other exchange operators would likely run into the same problems with antitrust authorities, he said.
The past year was strewn with failed deals. The Nasdaq and the IntercontinentalExchange withdrew a competing
$11 billion bid for the NYSE last May after the Justice Department said it would block the deal. A deal between
the London Stock Exchange and the group that operates the Toronto Stock Exchange failed in part because of
regulatory concerns.

The Justice Department said last month that it would allow the deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse to go through if the German company sold its stake in Direct Edge Holdings, the fourth-largest exchange operator in the United States.

THE planned  merger between stock exchanges  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse is hanging by a thread, after competition officials in Brussels signalled their opposition.

Heads of the two firms will meet in New York today to discuss how they can convince  European Commission regulators that the  merger, which would create the world’s largest exchange, would not also strangle competition in the trade of financial instruments such as derivatives.
Competitors such as London Stock Exchange (up 21.5p to 801p) are likely to welcome the intervention. Document DAIM000020120110e81b0000a

NYSE CEO: Reports Of Negative EU Recommendation On Merger 'Pretty Disappointing'
By Jacob Bunge

The chief executive of NYSE Euronext (NYX) said that  European Union antitrust regulators' analysis of his company's planned merger with Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) was "fundamentally flawed," after regulators recommended blocking the deal.

Competition authorities that have come to view a planned combination of the two exchange groups' futures markets as a monopoly on European futures and options trade have ignored competing markets in off-exchange derivatives and overseas platforms, NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer said in a video message to his employees.

"I have to tell you I think that's a conclusion that results from a fundamentally flawed technical analysis that ignores the realities of the marketplace that we live and work in every day," Niederauer said in the message, a transcript of which was reviewed by Dow Jones.

Niederauer said that the exchanges have not yet received notice of a formal decision from competition authorities, and based his comments on news reports Tuesday.
A representative for Deutsche Boerse declined to comment.

EU antitrust examiners have determined that the merger candidates compete with one another for futures and options trade carried out on exchanges, but not with the private market in swaps and other instruments, or foreign-based derivatives exchange operators like CME Group Inc. (CME), which controls an estimated 90% of U.S. futures trade.

Those regulators Tuesday issued a recommendation that the EU not allow the merger to go ahead, according to a senior EU official, but members of the European Commission will have a final say on the matter. NYSE and Deutsche Boerse executives plan to focus resources on lobbying these lawmakers over the coming weeks, with a final ruling on the deal scheduled to come by Feb. 9.

"[O]ver the next few weeks we're going to continue to press our case directly with various Commissioners in the EU, both to highlight the serious flaws in the case team's core argument, and to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," Niederauer said.

HEARD ON THE STREET: No Big Deal For Deutsche Boerse And NYSE
By Hester Plumridge
A DOW JONES COLUMN

Nice try, but no dice. The European competition authority has effectively scuttled a planned $17 billion  merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse, recommending the deal be blocked on antitrust concerns. That is a blow for both groups, which between them own the New York, Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges. But investors shouldn't lose sleep over it.

The deal always looked like a long shot: The combined group would have an estimated 94% share of  European derivative trading. The exchanges claimed this was irrelevant since derivative trading is a global business and most happens over the counter rather than on exchanges, but their argument was given short shrift. So, too, were their proposals to sell an equity-trading business, improve rivals' access to clearing services and freeze fees for two years.

Their best hope lay in the sale of one of either Eurex or Liffe, their prized derivatives-trading businesses. But neither was prepared to contemplate this step. The European Commission will make its final decision in February, but UBS now puts the deal's chances of success at 20%.

The deal's failure would be a relief for smaller rivals like the London Stock Exchange and ICAP and for some customers who were concerned about the group's pricing power, despite the promise of $3 billion in savings on collateral. It would cap a spate of failed sector deals, including plans last year to merge the Canadian exchange and LSE, and exchanges in Australia and Singapore.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse will forfeit synergies with an estimated capitalized value of EUR1.9 billion, and the prospect of a re-rating to the higher multiples enjoyed by more integrated trading and clearing groups. Still, their shares were already largely discounting the deal's failure--having reversed post-announcement gains of more than 10% on news of competition concerns last August--and were broadly flat on Wednesday.

But all isn't lost. Both groups now trade around 10 to 11 times forward earnings, well below the long-term average of 20 times for exchanges globally. Yet G-20 commitments to push standardized over-the-counter derivatives
onto exchanges and European proposals to force more derivatives through clearing aren't yet reflected in earnings estimates. Their shares may have further to roll.

--Regulators recommend prohibition of exchanges'  merger plan
--Deal still must be ruled on by  EU commissioners
--Exchanges concentrating efforts on lobbying commissioners
(Updates with sourcing to EU official, additional background, share price.) By Jacob Bunge and Stephen Fidler
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
Regulators of the European Union have preliminarily rejected the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext
(NYX) and Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE), according to a senior European Union official.

A recommendation to prohibit the $17 billion combination had been widely expected after EU antitrust officials continued to harbor concerns around the two exchange companies' combined power in derivatives trading despite several remedies proposed by the firms, including the spinoff of some overlapping contracts.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates hadn't yet received any notice of a decision by the EU on the deal. A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined comment.

Executives of both firms will meet Wednesday morning in New York to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger plan in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The ruling by the European Union antitrust case team isn't the final verdict. All 27 EU commissioners will review the examiner's preliminary report, as well as input from antitrust regulators of EU member nations, before issuing a final decision by Feb. 9.

But odds are now heavily against the deal. Only about 10% of mergers that undergo an in-depth EU probe survive a recommended block by antitrust examiners, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have already begun lobbying individual commissioners in an effort to dispute the antitrust examiners' analysis of the combination, which focused on competition in exchange-listed futures and options and did not take into account derivatives traded off-exchange.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.

NYSE Euronext shares climbed 4.4% to $27.76 Tuesday afternoon, as uncertainty around the deal's fate, as well as the possibility of added exposure to Europe's embattled financial sector, have weighed on NYSE shares in recent months. Deutsche Boerse shares, also seen weighed by deal uncertainty, were up 5.1% at EUR41.66.
A report from Sander O'Neill said that the share price movements Tuesday reflect investors' growing belief that
NYSE Euronext is worth more on a standalone basis. Sandler estimated the company on its own was worth about
$30 per share.

"A little bit of profit-taking this morning gives the bulls time to reflect on the decent start to 2012 for equity markets so far," said Simon Denham at Capital Spreads. The focus was on Thursday's rate announcement from the ECB and sovereign-bond auctions in Italy and Spain. Unilever was down 2.3% following a downgrade by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.  Deutsche Boerse was flat amid concerns that its proposed  merger with NYSE Euronext appears to have collapsed. On the upside, insurance and mining stocks were higher.

0748 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) shares could open stronger, traders say, after media reports that European Union regulators have rejected - on a preliminarily basis - the proposed  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). A spokeswoman for the  European Union antitrust division declined to comment. Such a development - if the reports prove to be correct - would not be a major surprise, traders say. However, given that Deutsche Boerse has continued to pursue the  merger plan to date, some market participants have ended up short, because they saw the proposed spin-off of parts of the derivative operations as negative, according to traders. "The squeeze is likely to continue," one market participant says. The stock closed Tuesday at EUR41.66. (herbert.rude@dowjones.com)

0815 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS cuts its target price for Deutsche Boerse (DBOEF, DB1.XE) to EUR56 from
EUR60. According to a senior  EU official, regulators have rejected--on a preliminarily basis--the proposed  merger
between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and Deutsche Boerse. UBS says commissioners rarely vote against the case
team's recommendation, and "the probability of the deal going through now drops to 20%." Regarding the
potential EU financial transaction tax, UBS thinks Deutsche Boerse's risk is limited. The brokerage adds the
Deutsche Boerse investment case is lifting. "The company is a core market-infrastructure company with high
earnings visibility compared to peers, yet trades at a 10% discount," it says. UBS keeps its rating on  Deutsche
Boerse stock at buy. Shares trade down 0.6% at EUR41.76. (nicky.redl@dowjones.com)

Merger of giant bourses  in doubt

THE proposed $11.2bn (£7.2bn)  merger of stock exchange giants  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse has been thrown into doubt amid opposition from  European regulators.

Competition officials, led by  European commissioner Joaquin Almunia, are understood to have informed the two bourses that they intend to block the mega  merger unless material concessions are made.

Mr Almunia is thought to have called on either NYSE or Deutsche Boerse to offload one of their major derivatives businesses, something neither group is thought willing to do.

Both stock exchanges are thought likely to launch major lobbying assaults in the hope of persuading Mr Almunia to reverse his position.
NYSE put out a statement last night in response to reports of the competition concerns.

"NYSE Euronext has not yet received any official decision by the European Commission regarding the requested merger of both companies," the group said.
"The Commission has announced that it will make its final ruling on whether to clear the proposed merger by
February 9."

A decision by Mr Almunia to block the merger would be seen as a victory for the London Stock Exchange which said that the merger would "eliminate competition" in the European–listed derivatives market.

With hindsight, it is hard to see how  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse ever thought they could get their proposed $9 billion merger past regulators. It does not matter that a combination of the pair would , in global exchange-traded derivatives, play second fiddle to CME Group.

The key test is in  Europe and you don't have to be the kind of rocket scientist that trades in derivatives to work out that a combination of DB's Eurex and  NYSE's Liffe, which last year accounted jointly for 97 per cent of all European stock futures trading and 93.7 per cent of all stock options trading, would have created something close to a monopoly.

It is to the credit of the EU's competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia that, having consulted market participants, he has not been swayed by concessions offered by the two sides — a cap on fees on trading European derivatives contracts for the next three years and the sale of Liffe's single stock equity derivatives business in some territories.

However, this deal — which many feel would weaken the City's position in global financial services — is not dead yet.

The danger now is that, with the two sides free to lobby commissioners from each EU country and with Angela Merkel arguing strongly in favour of it, it could be waved through by virtue of the anti-UK mood pervasive in Brussels.

Ever since the Prime Minister used his veto last month, the City has been waiting for a retaliation from the EU's heavyweights. This could be it.

London  thrown  a lifeline  as exchange merger is rejected

The European Commission has derailed a tie-up between  Deutsche Börse and the American  NYSE Euronext that would have left the London Stock Exchange trailing in the wake of a global trading superpower.

NYSE and Deutsche Börse thought they had secured clearance to merge last month when they offered to sell part of Liffe, NYSE's London-based derivatives trading business, and promised to make it easier for smaller exchanges to compete with them.

But, in a dramatic intervention, the EU Competition Commissioner told the two exchanges this week that he would block the deal unless they agreed to sell either Liffe or Eurex, Deutsche Börse's derivatives platform.

Duncan Niederauer, of NYSE Euronext, has ruled out such a sale as it would undermine the merger's rationale, so the deal appears certain to collapse unless Germany and France can muster the political muscle to force a
U-turn.

NYSE Euronext said last night: "We have not yet received any official decision by the European Commission regarding the requested merger," but it is understood that it will step up its lobbying efforts in Brussels and at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month. Reto Francioni, the Deutsche Börse chief executive, is flying to the US today to meet Mr Niederauer in the hope of salvaging the deal.

Joaquín Almunia, the commissioner, must consult the competition authorities from all 27 EU member states before making a final ruling. Although there are precedents for a change of heart during the political phase of a competition ruling, such reversals are rare.

Mr Almunia and his team disagree with NYSE and Deutsche Börse on the central question of how the market for stock exchanges should be defined. The exchanges tried to persuade the Commission that trading markets
should be regarded as global businesses, but it has restricted its decision to the impact solely on Europe's trading landscape. The definition is crucial because NYSE and Deutsche Börse dominate the European derivatives trading market with 95 per cent of the business between them.

Kay Swinburne, the Conservative spokesman on economic and monetary affairs in the European Parliament, welcomed the Commission's decision, saying it would ultimately mean greater competition and a more open market. Dr Swinburne, who has repeatedly questioned the proposed merger, said: "In the push to better regulate complex products, we must be certain to retain genuine competition to get the best deal for investors."

London market users had feared that the Commission's decision would lean towards the continental Europeans at the expense of the capital, which is Europe's dominant financial centre. The merger was also a grave threat to the London Stock Exchange, which has tried and failed to do a transatlantic tie-up with the Canadian TXM group.

The Commission will make its final ruling on February 9, but if the decision were changed it would have political ramifications in Britain, where the Government's desire to defend the City contributed to its veto of
Franco-German plans to tackle the sovereign debt crisis.

This could be payback time for the City

With hindsight, it is hard to see how  NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse ever thought they could get their proposed $9 billion merger past regulators. It does not matter that a combination of the pair would , in global exchange-traded derivatives, play second fiddle to CME Group.

The key test is in  Europe and you don’t have to be the kind of rocket scientist that trades in derivatives to work out that a combination of DB’s Eurex and  NYSE’s Liffe, which last year accounted jointly for 97 per cent of all European stock futures trading and 93.7 per cent of all stock options trading, would have created something close to a monopoly.

It is to the credit of the EU’s competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia that, having consulted market participants, he has not been swayed by concessions offered by the two sides — a cap on fees on trading European derivatives contracts for the next three years and the sale of Liffe’s single stock equity derivatives business in some territories.

However, this deal — which many feel would weaken the City’s position in global financial services — is not dead yet.

The danger now is that, with the two sides free to lobby commissioners from each EU country and with Angela Merkel arguing strongly in favour of it, it could be waved through by virtue of the anti-UK mood pervasive in Brussels.

Ever since the Prime Minister used his veto last month, the City has been waiting for a retaliation from the EU’s heavyweights. This could be it.
Riding roughshod

If you want to know why some grown-up investors still regard the Alternative Investment Market as the Wild West, look no farther than Environ, the support services tiddler.

Having sneaked out an announcement that it planned to delist from AIM 20 minutes before the markets closed for their four-day Christmas break, after which the share price cratered, Environ issued another statement on
Monday — after the market had closed, naturally — in which it revealed that it had agreed to sell 51 per cent of two subsidiaries for £1 apiece. And who should be the buyers at this knockdown price? Why, they’re Mark Sims, the Environ chief executive, and Paul Richardson, a non-executive director, who have grandly given Environ the option to buy back 20 per cent of the businesses for £500,000.

Unfortunately, both the AIM cancellation and the disposals look set to go ahead, because Environ’s present and former directors, who include Nigel Wray, that well-known dabbler in the small-caps sector, own more than 65 per cent of the company.

But the rights of minority investors, at least one of whom says the company refuses to speak to him, have been flagrantly trampled on.
The whole saga leaves a bad taste and has brought AIM into disrepute. Fed’s lesson in making money

Page 87 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
And the award for the most profitable fund manager goes, for the second year running, to: Ben Bernanke. The Federal Reserve, it was revealed yesterday, paid a bumper $76.9 billion to the US Government last year on top of the record $79.3 billion handed over in 2010.
The payout is the $83.6 billion interest income, less expenses, earned from the $2.9 trillion worth of assets,
mainly US bonds, acquired by the Fed since the start of the financial crisis. The 2011 dividend was down on 2010
because some of the most profitable parts of the Fed’s portfolio no longer exist, such as the credit line extended
to AIG, the last $21 billion of which was repaid by the insurer last January.

It’s not a normal business model, of course: as the Fed is not paying for its funding, all profits fall straight to the bottom line. Nor does the Fed book losses it has incurred on certain securities acquired from the likes of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

And ultimately, this is merely taxpayers’ money being shuffled from one arm of government to another. The interest on the debt still has to be met from the public purse. But, as Mr Bernanke observed last year, it is at least interest that the US Government would otherwise have had to pay to the Chinese.
Double delay by the CAA

Peering from its ivory control tower in central London, the Civil Aviation Authority has spotted that new runway capacity in the south-east of England is needed.

It is right, of course, but goodness, where has it been? The Department for Transport is just weeks away from issuing its aviation consultation paper and, in making its recommendations so close to publication, it is hard to see how the regulator can hope to exert much in the way of influence.

Equally belated is the CAA’s new-found focus on consumers, which is again welcome, but scarcely convincing given the way the regulator presided for years over an airport ownership regime that, ultimately, had to be broken up by the Competition Commission on the grounds that it was anti-competitive.
In fairness to the CAA, it was calling for extra runway capacity in the south-east of England as long ago as June
2003, when it argued that expanding Heathrow “could yield the largest economic benefits". But it was not listened
to then and, given the present Government’s myopia on this subject, may not be this time either.
Why were we in the red, Ed?

Ed Miliband’s speech yesterday was billed as recognition that, to chime with the public mood, he and his party would need to show greater realism on the deficit.

Yet here he is on the Today programme: “Before the global financial crisis hit, the debt was lower than we inherited, the deficit was lower than we inherited, the current account was lower than we inherited."

But that won’t wash. The point is that when the crisis hit, Britain had enjoyed 15 years of unbroken growth, dating from the third quarter of 1992.

Under such benign conditions, there ought not to have been a deficit at all. Britain should have been running a surplus. That is why the public accuses Labour of over-spending in the boom.

EU Poised to Reject NYSE, Boerse Merger
By Stephen Fidler and Jacob Bunge
427 words
11 January 2012
The Wall Street Journal Europe

The European Union's competition authority has recommended rejection of a proposed  merger between NYSE
Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG, according to a senior  European Union official.

The recommendation from European competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia will now be debated among other departments at the European Commission, the  EU executive, before a formal decision is made in coming weeks.

The recommendation is likely to set off weeks of intensive lobbying in Brussels, but it would be unusual if a decision on a technical question by the competition department was overturned by the full 27-person commission.
A final decision is expected by Feb. 9.
The deal is among the last standing in a raft of abortive exchange mergers launched over the past year. Competition authorities have been focused on the domination of the European futures markets by a combination
of NYSE Euronext's Liffe exchange and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex. Together they control about 90% of
exchange-based trading in futures and options contracts linked to key European interest rates and stock indexes.
But the two exchanges have argued, among other things, that the exchanges suffer serious competition from
over-the-counter markets.
NYSE Euronext also owns the New York Stock Exchange and four European stock markets, while Deutsche
Boerse runs the main German stock market.

Spokesmen for Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext said in separate statements Tuesday that the merger candidates hadn't received any decision on the deal from the EU.

"We have clearly demonstrated to the European Commission the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," the spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said in the statement.

EU officials pushed back the target date for their decision twice as they continued talks over potential divestitures as well as canvassing rivals and customers on the potential impact of the merger. The exchanges' shareholders and U.S. antitrust officials already cleared the merger.

In an effort to gain approval, exchange executives agreed to hive off contracts that overlap, refrain from lifting some trading fees, and grant rivals access to Deutsche Boerse's clearinghouse

NYSE Euronext shares climbed $1.22, or 4.6% to $27.79 Tuesday as reports of the competition authority's ruling hit. Deutsche Boerse shares climbed 1.975 euros, or 4.9%, to 42.015 euros in Frankfurt. Both share prices had suffered in recent months amid uncertainty about the deal.

NYSE Deal Nears Collapse;  EU Regulators Argue Against  Proposed  Merger With Germany's  Deutsche
Börse
By Stephen Fidler And Jacob Bunge

The proposed merger of the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Börse headed toward collapse Tuesday after  European antitrust regulators urged rejection of the deal.

A regulatory ruling on the deal would cap a frantic year of attempted consolidation among exchanges that has mostly been unsuccessful. Would-be partners have faced resistance based on a combination of nationalist sentiment, antitrust concerns and other pressures.

The European Union competition authority recommended that EU commissioners rule against the tie-up, according to a senior European Union official. The recommendation, which hasn't been made public, cited the potential combined power of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext over the trading of exchange-listed derivatives, including futures and options, the official said.
The $17 billion proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, inked last February, was a
high-water mark in the wave of consolidation activity. It promised to create the world's largest platform for share
listings and a dominant player in European stock and futures trading.

A collapse of the deal would be a disappointment for the two companies, which have said the merger would help consolidate more European trading under one roof and position the company to partner up with fast-growing markets in Asia. However, both NYSE and Deutsche Börse have insisted they would be able to thrive on their own if the deal foundered.

The deal passed muster subject to minimal conditions with U.S. antitrust officials last month, but European regulators have fixated on the companies' combined market share in European futures and options trading, where together their markets are estimated to make up more than 90% of all exchange trading.

The companies have heavily promoted the deal as making securities trading more efficient for all types of investors. They have argued, among other things, that the exchanges face serious competition from
over-the-counter markets.

They have vowed not to spin off either company's futures exchange—a possibility that EU regulators had raised—saying that doing so would undermine the strategic goals of the deal.
Representatives of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext declined to comment on the recommendation, saying
that neither company had received notice of it. A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined
to comment.

Executives of both exchange groups will meet Wednesday morning in New York to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The deal could still happen. Neither firm plans to walk away until the 27-person European Commission has its say, according to people familiar with the matter. The two exchange operators have been focusing on persuading the commissioners, who are expected to meet to discuss the deal on Feb. 1 with a final decision required by Feb.
9.

Commissioners have broken with EU competition authorities in the past, including Oracle Corp.'s 2010 acquisition of Sun Microsystems. But only about 10% of mergers that undergo an in-depth EU review survive a
recommended block by antitrust examiners, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

NYSE Euronext shares closed 4.6% higher Tuesday at $27.79 after reports of the competition authority's recommendation. Deutsche Börse's shares rallied 4.9% to settle at €42.01. Uncertainty over the deal's outcome has weighed on both stocks.
News of the recommendation was earlier reported by the Financial Times and Fox Business.

Failure would represent a missed chance to forge a European competitor to the CME Group, which currently dominates U.S. trading of futures, contracts that allow investors to manage risk related to the movement of stock indexes, interest rates and commodities.

Last year, some proposed tie-ups came undone. In April, Australia rejected the Singapore Exchange Ltd.'s proposed acquisition of the Australian exchange parent ASX Ltd. over fears that Australia could lose control over key trading services.

A deal also struck last February between London Stock Exchange Group PLC and TMX Group Inc., which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, also fell apart last year in the face of a rival bid by a consortium of banks that sought to keep Canadian ownership of the company.

It would also be the second failed deal aimed at ownership of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. antitrust officials in May signaled they would oppose a rival bid for NYSE Euronext put forth by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and the futures exchange operator IntercontinentalExchange Inc.

A collapse of the NYSE deal would be another disappointment in the mergers and acquisitions market, which had a lackluster performance last year after this deal, among others, raised hopes for a busy run that ultimately didn't materialize.

NYSE vows to pursue Deutsche Boerse merger

The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday it would press its case to merge with German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse with EU authorities, amid media reports that Brussels would reject it.

In a video message to employees, NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer outlined the company's efforts to win a favorable ruling on the merger from the European Commission, expected early next month.
"We have not received a formal decision" from the EU competition authorities, he said.

"But it certainly appears, if you look at all the news reports, that the preliminary conclusion they have reached will be to recommend that the proposed merger with DB be prohibited," he said, according to a transcript.
"If that's true, I would have to say that's a pretty disappointing conclusion," he added.

Niederauer insisted that the Commission's call for NYSE and Deutsche Boerse to sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay competition concerns was unfounded.

"I have to tell you I think that's a conclusion that results from a fundamentally flawed technical analysis that ignores the realities of the marketplace that we live and work in every day," he told employees.

"Over the next few weeks we're going to continue to press our case directly with various Commissioners in the EU, both to highlight the serious flaws in the case team's core argument, and to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe," Niederauer said.

A person familiar with the EU review told AFP on Tuesday that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable.

The office of Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia still has reservations and objections to a merger which would see Deutsche Boerse shareholders own 60 percent of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm, the source said on condition of anonymity.

The New York and Frankfurt exchange operators both indicated Tuesday they had received no information about the Commission's position, and would not comment on speculation.
They said they had been told a final decision on the proposed merger would be made on February 9. vs/pmh

Antitrust chief to block NYSE-DB merger:  report;  US$9B accord;  EC regulator said to have dominant

FRANKFURT . Joaquin Almunia, the  European Commission antitrust chief, has told  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext that he plans to block their US$9-billion  merger, the Financial Times said in its online edition on Tuesday.

Mr. Almunia, the  European competition commissioner, has told the companies that he plans to prohibit their bid to create the world's biggest exchange group, the Financial Times said, without citing its sources.

Asked to comment on the report, a spokesman for the European Commission said: "The decision concerning this proposed merger is due to be taken by the Commission before 9 February. Until the decision is taken, we cannot comment, confirm and/or deny anything."

Mr. Almunia's case team has drafted an official recommendation to disallow the deal because it would create a dominant player in European exchange-traded derivatives markets, the Financial Times said, citing two people involved in the process.

Although the EU antitrust case team and Mr. Almunia work closely together, it remains unclear whether Mr. Almunia shares the views of the case team. An EU source said it is likely that a draft proposal on the decision is out now.

The European Commission has demanded that Deutsche Boerse and NYSE sell either the Eurex derivatives arm or Liffe, the Financial Times said, a move that both exchanges have ruled out so far. Reuters reported last month that European Commission antitrust officials showed no sign of being swayed by lastditch arguments to save the deal, forcing Deutsche Boerse and NYSE to lobby European Commissioners, including Mr. Almunia directly.

Deutsche Boerse on Tuesday said: "Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have not received yet any decision by the European Commission regarding the requested merger of both companies. The Commission has announced that it will make its final ruling on whether to clear the proposed merger by Feb. 9, 2012. As a matter of policy, we cannot comment on speculation."
NYSE Euronext said it has not received an official decision by the European commission.

Bloomberg News Files / Joaquin Almunia says he plans to prohibit the bid to create the world's biggest exchange group, according to a report.;

The European Commission (EC) could block the planned  merger between stock exchange operators  Deutsche
Boerse and NYSE Euronext under the currently proposed form as it fears a dominance in derivatives trading.
The competition authority is concerned about the dominant position of  Deutsche Boerse's Eurex unit and that of
NYSE's Liffe derivatives business, whose planned combination would impede effective competition in  Europe.

A complete sale of one of the two derivatives markets has been excluded so far by Deutsche Boerse's chief Reto Francioni and NYSE head Duncan Niederauer. They had just proposed a sale of certain parts. The two operators also proposed to give third parties access to Eurex Clearing.
The EC is due to issue its final decision on February 9.

EC most likely to block Deutsche Boerse, Nyse merger - report

(SeeNews) - Jan 11, 2012 - The European Commission (EC) will most likely block the planned  merger between Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX), which would create the world's biggest stock exchange operator.

EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is expected to recommend to the other 26 commissioners not to approve the deal, news agency Reuters reported today citing a source familiar with the matter.

According to a report of Financial Times (FT), the experts who have to vote on the deal do not consider the concessions already announced by the stock exchange operators are sufficient. The daily also said that the experts group has made a draft for a final decision, according to which the planned merger may lead to a monopoly in the European derivatives market and therefore, has to be blocked.

However, according to a spokesman for the EC, the authority has not yet made a final decision on the matter, Reuters said.
The EC is expected to decide on the matter at the beginning of February.

According to the initial plans of the stock exchange operators, the merger was supposed to be completed by the end of 2011. The deal has already got approval in the United States, but it also needs the EC's consent.

Time to think small in stock-exchange mergers

The global stock exchange merger wave is fizzling out. The  European Commission may soon give Deutsche     Boerse's combination with NYSE Euronext the thumbs-down, following on the collapse of takeovers in Australia and Canada last year. That's tough for bourses grappling with legal changes, upstart rivals and weak markets.
But big M&A will now be the exception, not the rule.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext may yet prevail. But they will have to persuade European states, or competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, that the continent needs to create its own counterweight to U.S. derivatives powerhouse CME Group. Either way, exchange heads will in future think twice about bids that could inflame politicians or regulators. Last year the attempted takeovers of the Australian and Canadian exchanges, by the Singapore and London exchanges respectively, both foundered on local opposition. And while the U.S. Department of Justice blessed Deutsche's tie-up with NYSE, it blocked a rival bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.

Moreover, reforms such as Europe's mooted tax on financial transactions and a shakeup of clearing will eat into earnings and could deter less-affected bidders. Exchanges in the most promising countries, such as China, India and Russia, are mostly off-limits for foreigners. And while Hong Kong could use its highly valued stock to buy a European rival, now is hardly the ideal time.

Instead, the focus is likely to switch to smaller deals in promising fields. LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet could find an unencumbered NYSE an unwelcome competitor for two of his current targets, clearing house LCH.Clearnet and the London Metal Exchange. In faster-growing economies, buying small stakes or entering partnerships, as NYSE has done in Warsaw, might allow bigger deals later. Europe's big exchange groups could also consider pooling resources.

That's not to say there will be no big deals. After all, savings can be huge: One-third of target costs, Berenberg Bank reckons. Revisiting an LSE-Nasdaq combination could make sense if the duo can put bad blood behind them. Still, it's a shift. The sector's short public life has been spent in near-constant bid frenzy. That era may now be ending.

Deutsche Boerse's  NYSE Deal Seen Heading For the Rocks
Reuters
830 words
11 January 2012
HedgeWorld News
HDGWR
English
(c) 2012
FRANKFURT (Reuters)—Deutsche Boerse AG's last-ditch lobbying efforts in support of its proposed takeover of
NYSE Euronext look set to fail, leaving the deal heading for the rocks with  European antitrust regulators
expected to block the deal.

Deutsche Boerse's Reto Francioni and NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer hope to salvage the deal by pressing the case for the merger with commissioners ahead of a February deadline in Brussels.

"Both companies will use the remaining time to emphasize the merits of the merger," Deutsche Boerse said in a statement on Wednesday [Jan. 11].
Both will also seek to influence politicians and regulators at a visit to the World Economic Forum at the end of
January, but analysts cast doubt on their prospects of success.

"The commissioners have rarely voted against the case team's recommendation, so the probability of the deal going through now drops to 20 percent," UBS analyst Arnaud Gilbat said in a note on Wednesday.

A source told Reuters on Tuesday [Jan. 10] that European Commission antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia and his case team would recommend blocking a merger which would create the world's largest exchange operator. The European Commission on Wednesday declined to comment on its potential ruling.

Deutsche Boerse plans to bypass the antitrust ruling and appeal directly to the so-called college of 27 commissioners, who are expected to meet early next month.

But Martin Peter, an analyst at LBBW, said "The Boerse has underestimated Brussels. The chances of a successful deal are sinking by the day. I think it's quite unlikely that a majority of commissioners will outvote Almunia."

Deutsche Boerse cannot propose additional remedies to the European Commission but will instead seek to win political backing in Berlin from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in the hope that she may pressure commissioners in Brussels.
But this too will prove difficult said Simmy Grewal, analyst at Aite Group.

"The problem for Merkel is that if she uses political influence on this she's not going to be able to use it on something else," Ms. Grewal said. "This merger is not her highest priority at the moment and one might question whether it is prudent to go ahead with the deal given the amount of opposition among the commissioners."

The head of trading at a large European investment bank in London said both exchange operators had not done enough to sway European regulators. "Brussels understands the competition issues but the concessions the exchanges offered were pathetic," the trader said.

"Both exchanges have demonstrated classic monopolistic behavior in their protection of their futures businesses and this is obvious from the fact that trading and clearing fees have fallen over recent years in all areas across Europe apart from exchange-traded futures," he added.
The college of commissioners will give a formal ruling by Feb. 9.

The Boerse is hoping to appeal to EU internal markets Commissioner Michel Barnier, who is striving to regulate the $600 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market, which is exempt from stricter regulations including reporting

Page 104 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
requirements because it takes place off-exchange. Deutsche Boerse is arguing that the merger of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Eurex derivatives platform with the New York Stock Exchange and the Liffe derivatives exchange will create a bigger player in the so-called regulated market.

The exchange operators plan to raise the issue of how the European antitrust case team defined the derivatives market in coming to its decision, the first source said. They plan to argue that any analysis of the impact on competition from their deal should look at the derivatives market as global rather than just European, and should include the over-the-counter market, the source said.

Yet Reuters reported last month that European Commission antitrust officials showed no sign of being swayed by last-ditch arguments to save the deal.
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have said they have not yet received an official decision from the
Commission.

For the Boerse there are few alternatives to the merger. The takeover of NYSE Euronext, announced in February last year, capped a wave of exchange merger plans globally, but most other proposed transactions, including bids by the LSE, Singapore Exchange Ltd. and Nasdaq OMX Group have since failed.
"Smaller acquisitions in eastern Europe or perhaps Spain may be an option, but a big deal such as the one with
NYSE won't come along again," Equinet analyst Philipp Haessler said.
The European Commission has demanded Deutsche Boerse and NYSE sell either the Eurex derivatives arm or
Liffe — a move that both exchanges have ruled out so far.

German union representatives on Wednesday said they would be pleased if the European authorities blocked the deal: "We had feared there would be grave consequences for Frankfurt as a financial center if the deal succeeded."

NYSEMerger Deal Nears a Collapse
By Jacob Bunge and Stephen Fidler
775 words
11 January 2012
The Wall Street Journal

The proposed merger of the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and Germany's  Deutsche Boerse AG
headed toward collapse Tuesday after  European antitrust regulators urged rejection of the deal.

A regulatory ruling on the deal would cap a frantic year of attempted consolidation among exchanges that has mostly been unsuccessful. Would-be partners have faced resistance based on a combination of nationalist sentiment, antitrust concerns and other pressures.

The European Union competition authority recommended that EU commissioners rule against the tie-up, according to a senior European Union official. The recommendation, which hasn't been made public, cited the potential combined power of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext over the trading of exchange-listed derivatives, including futures and options, the official said.
The $17 billion proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse, inked last February, was a
high-water mark in the wave of consolidation activity. It promised to create the world's largest platform for share
listings and a dominant player in European stock and futures trading.

A collapse of the deal would be a disappointment for the two companies, which have said the merger would help consolidate more European trading under one roof and position the company to partner up with fast-growing markets in Asia. However, both NYSE and Deutsche Boerse have insisted they would be able to thrive on their own if the deal foundered.

The deal passed muster subject to minimal conditions with U.S. antitrust officials last month, but European regulators have fixated on the companies' combined market share in European futures and options trading, where together their markets are estimated to make up more than 90% of all exchange trading.

The companies have heavily promoted the deal as making securities trading more efficient for all types of investors. They have argued, among other things, that the exchanges face serious competition from
over-the-counter markets.
They have vowed not to spin off either company's futures exchange -- a possibility that EU regulators had raised
-- saying that doing so would undermine the strategic goals of the deal.

Representatives of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext declined to comment on the recommendation, saying that neither company had received notice of it. A spokeswoman for the European Union antitrust division declined to comment.

Executives of both exchange groups will meet Wednesday morning in New York to discuss ongoing issues related to the merger in a pre-scheduled meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The deal could still happen. Neither firm plans to walk away until the 27-person European Commission has its say, according to people familiar with the matter. The two exchange operators have been focusing on persuading the commissioners, who are expected to meet to discuss the deal on Feb. 1 with a final decision required by Feb.
9.

Commissioners have broken with EU competition authorities in the past, including Oracle Corp.'s 2010 acquisition of Sun Microsystems. But only about 10% of mergers that undergo an in-depth EU review survive a
recommended block by antitrust examiners, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

Page 106 of 138 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
NYSE Euronext shares closed 4.6% higher Tuesday at $27.79 after reports of the competition authority's recommendation. Deutsche Boerse's shares rallied 4.9% to settle at 42.01 euros. Uncertainty over the deal's outcome has weighed on both stocks.
News of the recommendation was earlier reported by the Financial Times and Fox Business.

Failure would represent a missed chance to forge a European competitor to the CME Group, which currently dominates U.S. trading of futures, contracts that allow investors to manage risk related to the movement of stock indexes, interest rates and commodities.

Last year, some proposed tie-ups came undone. In April, Australia rejected the Singapore Exchange Ltd.'s proposed acquisition of the Australian exchange parent ASX Ltd. over fears that Australia could lose control over key trading services.

A deal also struck last February between London Stock Exchange Group PLC and TMX Group Inc., which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, also fell apart last year in the face of a rival bid by a consortium of banks that sought to keep Canadian ownership of the company.

It would also be the second failed deal aimed at ownership of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. antitrust officials in May signaled they would oppose a rival bid for NYSE Euronext put forth by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and the futures exchange operator IntercontinentalExchange Inc.

NYSE, Deutsche Boerse plan to lobby in Europe to rescue deal

11 January 2012 - Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) and  NYSE Euronext (NYSE:NYX) will make a case for their USD9bn (EUR7bn) merger in front of  European commissioners and government officials in  Europe in an effort to save the deal likely to be blocked by regulators, Reuters cited an informed source as saying.

Joaquin Almunia, the head of the  European Commission (EC), and the team reviewing the deal are set to recommend the 27 commissioners to vote against the merger at their meeting in February, the person said.
The exchanges are looking to convince commissioners to overturn that recommendation, arguing that in
reviewing the deal, the derivatives market should include the over-the-counter segment and be defined as global,
not only European.
NYSE and Deutsche Boerse’s chiefs will also bring up the case with politicians and business leaders at the World
Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on 25 January to 29 January, the source told the news agency.

The European regulator, not convinced by the remedies already proposed, has asked the two companies to dispose of either the Eurex derivatives arm or Liffe, a concession they were so far not willing to make.

A EC spokesman told Reuters that the regulator would not comment on any speculation before 9 February when its ruling on the transaction is due.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse said they had received no information on a decision by the EC regarding their merger and thus would make no comment.

The chief executive officers of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext will meet in New York Wednesday to discuss rising opposition to their planned merger, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.

Reto Francioni and executives of  Deutsche Boerse are flying to meet NYSE's Duncan Niederauer after the companies said Tuesday that no official decision has been received from European antitrust regulators on the deal. Shares of the exchange operators rose more than five per cent after the Financial Times said the  European Commission would block it.

"Their realistic options are to continue to do what they're doing, lobby for the deal and give every ounce of effort, and I think that's what they're doing," Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP in New York, said in a telephone interview. "They never positioned this deal as a layup, or an automatic shoo-in."

Niederauer and Francioni have been working for 11 months to convince competition authorities in Europe that their merger won't stifle competition in derivatives trading. Scrutiny of the proposed acquisition has been greatest in Europe, where it would unite the region's two biggest derivatives exchanges, NYSE's Liffe and Deutsche Boerse's Eurex.

The executives will discuss steps that can be taken to persuade regulators to clear the proposal, which would create the world's biggest exchange company, two people said, requesting anonymity because the plans are private. Topics will include opposition in the EC and among regulators in the German state of Hesse, as well as the integration they have been pursuing since announcing the deal in February, the people said. "They could appeal to politicians to secure some pressure on the regulators," said Jamie Selway, head of liquidity management at New York-based Investment Technology Group Inc.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse start last-ditch bid to save $9bn tie-up; CAPITAL MARKETS

THE CHIEF executive of  NYSE Euronext has pledged to fight the "serious flaws" in the argument of the
European regulator, which is set to block their $9bn (£5.87bn)  merger with Deutsche Boerse.

Duncan Niederauer used a video to staff to pledge that he and  Deutsche Boerse boss Reto Francioni would continue to press their case after it emerged that  European anti-trust chief Joaquín Almunia was set to veto the deal unless the two firms agreed to sell one of their derivatives businesses.
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE now plan to bypass the antitrust ruling and appeal directly to the so-called college of
27 commissioners, who are expected to meet early next month.

Analysts said they face an uphill task. Arnaud Gilbat at UBS said: "[They] have rarely voted against the case team's recommendation, so the probability of the deal going through now drops to 20 per cent."
Niederauer and Francioni will also lobby politicians at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month.

NYSE and Deutsche say they have not received a formal decision from the European Commission and declined to comment further yesterday.
If the deal to create the world's largest exchange group collapses it would provide a boost to the London Stock
Exchange.

NYSE to fight merger decision

The New York Stock Exchange refused to accept a decision by the  European Commission to block its tie-up with Deutsche Börse, describing the regulator's reasoning as "fundamentally flawed" (Helen Power writes). The two exchanges thought last month that they had secured clearance to create a global trading superpower.

However, it emerged on Tuesday that Joaquín Almunia, the  EU Competition Commissioner, told the suitors that he would block the proposed deal unless they agreed to sell either Liffe or Eurex, their derivatives platforms.

Duncan Niederauer, the chief executive of NYSE Euronext, yesterday promised to fight on, saying he would try to persuade the competition authorities of the EU's 27 member states, which have the final say on mergers, to force Mr Almunia into a U-turn.

"[We will] highlight the serious flaws in the case team's core argument, and ensure that there is a clear understanding of the strong benefits that our combination will bring to a broad set of stakeholders in Europe."

NYSE Chief Says EU Analysis Is 'Fundamentally Flawed'
By Jacob Bunge and Ulrike Dauer

The chief executive of NYSE Euronext said that  European Union antitrust regulators' analysis of his company's planned merger with Deutsche Boerse AG was "fundamentally flawed," after regulators recommended blocking the deal.
The main concern among the antitrust examiners who made the recommendation Tuesday is the potential for a
European monopoly in exchange-traded futures and options, said a senior  EU official.

The companies have yet to receive notice of the recommendation, but NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer on Wednesday said the analysis overlooks competing markets in privately traded derivatives as well as overseas rival exchanges.

Executives of both companies met to discuss the merger Wednesday in a pre-scheduled meeting. Final say on the transaction lies with the 27 EU commissioners, who are slated to formally discuss the matter on Feb. 1 and due to deliver a ruling by Feb. 9.

Shares in Deutsche Boerse declined 0.6% to 41.405 euros Wednesday in Frankfurt, and NYSE Euronext shares were little changed at $27.80 in afternoon New York trading.

If the deal is blocked, the exchanges will be forced to rethink fundamental aspects of their plans to expand trading services. Remaining independent would upend both companies' strategies for deepening their business in processing financial transactions, especially in sophisticated swap deals, and poses a setback for efforts to forge partnerships in fast-growing Asian markets.

Analysts have diverged on whether the companies would be better off without their deal. Niamh Alexander, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, on Wednesday downgraded NYSE Euronext to "market perform" from "outperform" on a "very low probability" of the merger closing.

Sandler O'Neill analyst Rich Repetto on Tuesday determined that NYSE Euronext was worth more as an independent company, around $30 per share. Some investors believe the merger plan has weighed on the stock because it would enlarge NYSE's exposure to Europe, where the ongoing debt crisis and potential tax on trading represent threats to financial-services firms.

UBS analyst Arnaud Giblat lowered his price target for Deutsche Boerse's stock to 56 euros ($72) from 60 euros, saying he forecasts a 20% likelihood of a deal happening.

No Big Deal for Deutsche Börse and NYSE
By Hester Plumridge

Nice try, but no dice. The European competition authority has effectively scuttled a planned $17 billion  merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, recommending the deal be blocked on antitrust concerns. That is a blow for both groups, which between them own the New York, Frankfurt and Paris stock exchanges. But investors shouldn't lose sleep over it.

The deal always looked like a long shot: The combined group would have an estimated 94% share of  European derivatives trading. The exchanges claimed this was irrelevant since derivatives trading is a global business and most happens over the counter rather than on exchanges, but their argument was given short shrift. So, too, were their proposals to sell an equity-trading business, improve rivals' access to clearing services and freeze fees for two years.

Their best hope lay in the sale of one of either Eurex or Liffe, their prized derivatives-trading businesses. But neither was prepared to contemplate this step. The European Commission will make its final decision in February, but UBS now puts the deal's chances of success at 20%.

The deal's failure would be a relief for smaller rivals like the London Stock Exchange and ICAP and for some customers who were concerned about the group's pricing power, despite the promise of $3 billion in savings on collateral. It would cap a spate of failed sector deals, including plans last year to merge the Canadian exchange and LSE, and exchanges in Australia and Singapore.

NYSE and Deutsche Börse will forfeit synergies with an estimated capitalized value of €1.9 billion ($2.43 billion), and the prospect of a re-rating to the higher multiples enjoyed by more integrated trading and clearing groups. Still, their shares were already largely discounting the deal's failure—having reversed post-announcement gains of more than 10% on news of competition concerns last August—and were broadly flat on Wednesday.

But all isn't lost. Both groups now trade around 10 to 11 times forward earnings, well below the long-term average of 20 times for exchanges globally. Yet G-20 commitments to push standardized over-the-counter derivatives
onto exchanges and European proposals to force more derivatives through clearing aren't yet reflected in earnings estimates. Their shares may have further to roll.

Rethinking Roles as Merger Falters
By Jacob Bunge And Ulrike Dauer
988 words

The Wall Street Journal Online
WSJO

The potential demise of the planned  merger between NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse AG at the hands of European regulators would mark a stark setback for the leaders of the two companies and force them to rethink their firms' roles in the global exchange industry.

Continuing as stand-alone players could offer benefits to the exchange operators, analysts say; for instance, it would limit NYSE Euronext's exposure to the wobbly  European market. But both  NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Deutsche Börse CEO Reto Francioni have championed the deal as a way to forge a new, dominant exchange group and would need to rethink their companies' growth strategies.

European Union antitrust regulators this week recommended that lawmakers block the $17 billion combination, following a nine-month examination that ultimately centered on the exchange groups' market share in European exchange-traded derivatives, estimated at a combined 90%. The Wall Street Journal reported online on Tuesday that regulators feared the merged entity would have a monopoly in such contracts.

Mr. Niederauer, in a video message to his staff Wednesday, said the companies have received no formal notification from EU regulators, but called their reported analysis "fundamentally flawed" because it overlooked competing markets in privately traded derivatives as well as overseas exchange rivals.

The companies are pressing ahead with efforts to persuade EU commissioners. Executives of both companies met Wednesday to discuss the merger in a prescheduled session where they were expected to discuss issues, including a name for the combined company.

Final say on the transaction lies with the 27 EU commissioners, who are slated to formally discuss the matter on Feb. 1 and deliver a ruling by Feb. 9. They could opt to reject regulators' recommendations and approve the deal, although that has rarely happened in the past.

Mr. Niederauer, a veteran of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who was appointed NYSE's chief executive in 2007 and has been slated to lead the combined company as CEO, had hoped the merger would reshape the exchange business, creating a dominant player in European stock and derivatives trading and the world's biggest venue for listing shares.

A few critics of the deal, including some shareholders, blasted Mr. Niederauer after it was announced 11 months ago, accusing him of selling the New York Stock Exchange, a bastion of American capitalism, to a foreign entity and complaining that NYSE's board refused to entertain a rival bid from IntercontinentalExchange Inc. and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. that could have fetched a higher price for the company.

For Deutsche Börse's Mr. Francioni, who would be chairman of the merged company, the tie-up has represented a chance to hitch his firm to the star power of the NYSE, among the financial world's best-known brands. The Frankfurt-based company runs Europe's biggest futures market but faces stiff competition from more well-known exchanges like NYSE and Nasdaq when it comes to winning international share listings.

Critics on the German end have expressed fears that regional jobs could be lost if the merged company shifts to NYSE Euronext's electronic trading system, as planned, replacing the current Xetra platform. Among others, European politicians and shareholders have also expressed uneasiness about the potential prospect that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could hold too much regulatory clout in Europe.

If the deal dies, one challenge for NYSE Euronext would be reassessing its clearing plan. Before the Deutsche Börse deal, NYSE Euronext had planned to create its own trade-clearing facility to back its European markets, reducing reliance on London-based clearer LCH.Clearnet and adding a new stream of revenue. The merger plan aimed instead to route NYSE Euronext's trading to Deutsche Börse's existing clearinghouse.

Both companies would also have to revisit plans to win business from bank-dominated swap markets. Regulators seek to move such transactions into clearinghouses and regulated trading platforms in an effort to reduce systemic risk.

The enlarged and more-efficient clearinghouse of the merged entity was seen as a powerful magnet for such trading, but on their own neither NYSE Euronext or Deutsche Börse has made much headway in the market.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse would also face renewed pressure to strengthen ties to Asian markets, which in 2010 became the world's busiest region for derivatives trading by contract volume and have emerged as a key source of new share listings. Both exchange groups already have ties to Asia exchanges, but executives had pitched the merged company as a bigger and better partner.

Analysts are divided on the companies' prospects as stand-alone entities, with some seeing NYSE Euronext better off with reduced exposure to Europe, where the exchange business's prospects are clouded by the sovereign-debt crisis and a potential tax on trading. Sandler O'Neill analyst Rich Repetto on Tuesday determined that NYSE Euronext was worth more as an independent company, at around $30 a share. The shares fell slightly to $27.77 apiece in New York trading Wednesday, with stock market benchmarks little changed for the day.

Others are less sanguine. Niamh Alexander, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, on Wednesday downgraded NYSE Euronext to market perform from outperform on a "very low probability" of the merger closing, and this expectation now being factored into the stock price. And UBS analyst Arnaud Giblat lowered his price target for Deutsche Börse's stock to €56 from €60, saying that he now forecasts only a 20% likelihood of a deal happening compared with 50% before, and that his previous price target included €8 a share in expected deal synergies. Shares of Deutsche Börse closed down 0.6% at €41.41 in Frankfurt trading.

NYSE says no more concessions for Deutsche Boerse merger

A senior executive of the New York Stock Exchange said it would not make further concessions to secure approval by EU regulators of its planned  merger with German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse.

"We won't go any further because that threatens the business logic of the deal,"  NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told the French business daily La Tribune.

NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer acknowledged Thursday that it appeared the European Commission was set to reject the plans to create the world's biggest stock exchange group, although he said they had received no formal notification.

A person familiar with the EU review told AFP on Tuesday that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable.

EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90 percent of the European derivatives market.

In November the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the Commission was unsatisfied.

Niederauer insisted that the Commission's call for NYSE and Deutsche Boerse to sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay competition concerns was unfounded and based on flawed analyses.

Cerutti was quoted as saying in the Friday edition of La Tribune that Commission experts had made their analyses "based on erroneous data".
He also noted that the Commission had consulted their direct competitors about the planned merger. "They also questioned numerous banks which are at the same time our clients and competitors, and they
obviously oppose our project," he said.
The Commission is set to make a final decision on the proposed merger on February 9.

The merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which operates exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon in addition to New York would create the world's largest market operator worth over $17 billion (nearly
14 billion euros).

The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday it would press its case to merge with German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse with EU authorities, amid media reports that Brussels would reject it. In a video message to employees, NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer, right, outlined the company's efforts to win a favourable ruling on the merger from the European Commission, expected early next month. "We have not received a formal decision" from the  EU competition authorities, he said. "But it certainly appears, if you look at all the news reports, that the preliminary conclusion they have reached will be to recommend that the proposed merger with DB be prohibited," he said, a transcript shows. "If that's true, I would have to say that's a pretty disappointing conclusion," he said.

(SeeNews) - Jan 12, 2012 - Duncan Niederauer, CEO of Nyse Euronext (NYSE:NYX), expects the  European Commission (EC) to block the  merger with Deutsche Boerse (ETR:DB1) into the world's biggest stock exchange operator, news agency Bloomberg said citing Niederauer.

Niederauer was cited as saying that he did not receive a formal information about the decision of the  EC, but there were signs that the authority has already made a decision to block the deal worth USD 9 billion (EUR
7.08bn).
In the next few weeks, Niederauer and Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni will meet a number of European
Union (EU) commissioners in a bid to save the deal.

Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has already signalled his plan to block the merger due to serious concerns that Deutsche Boerse's Eurex and Nyse's Liffe will dominate derivatives markets in Europe after the deal.

A potential failure will deal a blow to primarily Deutsche Boerse as other mergers or big acquisitions are not in sight in the next few years. The growth prospects for the German company are also gloomy because of the increasing competition of alternative trading platforms.

greet speculation that European regulators will reject the merger.

NEW YORK
Hold the bratwurst.

Plans to combine the New York Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse have hit a roadblock, and that has many on Wall Street breathing easier.

Duncan Niederauer, the head of NYSE Euronext Inc., acknowledged the growing speculation that European regulators will reject the proposed deal with the Frankfurt exchange.

Such a collapse would be a blow to executives at both exchanges who staked their future on creating the world's biggest trading platform. Niederauer said in a message to NYSE employees Wednesday that the indications are "pretty disappointing," but he promised to fight for the deal.

But from the rank-and-file traders on the NYSE's iconic trading floor to top Wall Street analysts, the prospect of the deal being scuttled was greeted with some enthusiasm.

"There are a lot of former members of the stock exchange who have been quite vocal about their opposition to the deal from the very beginning," said Ted Weisberg, who trades on the exchange for Seaport Securities.

There has been heavy criticism since the deal was unveiled in February that it would create a monopoly because of its size. In the U.S., politicians and business leaders alike were unsettled at the prospect of the NYSE essentially being controlled from Germany.

The deal can still be approved in a European Commission vote, expected to come in early February. But commission staff members have reportedly said the proposed new company would control too much of the derivatives trading market, the most lucrative and fastest-growing business in the exchange world.

Over the last year, several mergers between exchanges around the world have been rejected by regulators and politicians. They were seen as bringing in a new era of cross-border trading powerhouses but were highly scrutinized in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

"A lot of people thought this deal was doable," said Jillian Miller, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. "It's a unique regulatory environment we're in where regulators see financial services firms as bad guys."

NYSE Euronext shares have risen more than 6% since the beginning of the year as word of the deal's troubles began to circulate. The stock fell 4 cents, or 0.2%, to $27.74 on Wednesday.

When it was announced last year, the deal met resistance in New York from politicians and old-timers in the business who worried about the citadel of U.S. capitalism coming under foreign ownership. Deutsche Boerse would have taken a 60% stake in the new company through an exchange of stock that valued the Big Board at about $10 billion at the time.

The new company was never given a name because of the political sensitivities. It was supposed to have joint headquarters in Frankfurt and New York. The NYSE already owns the Paris-based Euronext exchange.

The sale initially was viewed more positively by investors, who have worried about how the Big Board will compete in a new world of electronic trading that has rendered the physical trading floor of the exchange increasingly obsolete. The merger would have created opportunities to cut costs while allowing both exchanges to better compete in the lucrative derivatives-trading business.

Since last year, though, the growing European sovereign debt crisis has raised questions about whether it would be good for an American exchange to have more exposure to the volatile European markets.
In addition, French proposals to institute a European-wide financial transaction tax could further cut down on the
German exchange's business.

If the deal is rejected, analysts say, the Big Board will have to find another way to grow and compete against the electronic exchanges and private markets where an increasing proportion of all trading is done. This has led a number of analysts to warn investors against buying the stock.
"They are going to have to come up with some kind of compelling stand-alone strategy," Miller said.

NYSE says no more concessions for Deutsche Boerse merger

Paris (AFP)--12Jan2012/740 pm EST/040 GMT

A senior executive of the New York Stock Exchange said it would not make further concessions to secure approval by EU regulators of its planned  merger with German stock market operator  Deutsche Boerse.

"We won't go any further because that threatens the business logic of the deal," NYSE Euronext deputy chief executive Dominique Cerutti told the French business daily La Tribune.

NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer acknowledged Thursday that it appeared the European Commission was set to reject the plans to create the world's biggest stock exchange group, although he said they had received no formal notification.

A person familiar with the EU review told AFP on Tuesday that the proposed merger as it stands was unacceptable.

EU competition authorities opened a probe into the deal in August over concerns that the merged company would control 90% of the European derivatives market.

In November the companies proposed to separate some of their derivatives operations to allay EU concerns, but sources said the EC was unsatisfied.

Niederauer insisted that the EC's call for NYSE and Deutsche Boerse to sell off some of their derivatives businesses to allay competition concerns was unfounded and based on flawed analyses.

Cerutti was quoted as saying in the Friday edition of La Tribune that EC experts had made their analyses "based on erroneous data."
He also noted that the EC had consulted their direct competitors about the planned merger.

"They also questioned numerous banks which are at the same time our clients and competitors, and they obviously oppose our project," he said.
The EC is set to make a final decision on the proposed merger on February 9.

The merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which operates exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon in addition to New York, would create the world's largest market operator worth over $17 billion (nearly Eur14 billion).
Deutsche Boerse shareholders would own 60% of the new combined, Netherlands-incorporated firm. Document PLATT00020120113e81c0000e

NYSE CEO To Meet EU's Reding Jan 17 As Commissioners Weigh Deal

NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) are appealing to two of the top officials on the European Commission in an attempt to sway policymakers in favor of the exchanges' proposed  merger, after European Union antitrust examiners this week deemed the deal anti-competitive.

Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of  NYSE Euronext, is slated to meet with European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding next Tuesday ahead of an early February decision by EU commissioners on the deal. The exchanges separately penned a letter to  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso highlighting benefits of the tie-up.

The 27 EU commissioners are to make a final ruling on the deal by Feb. 9. Antitrust regulators for the EU this week recommended that commissioners block the $17 billion combination on grounds that it would create a monopoly in exchange-traded futures and options trading.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext now are taking their case directly to EU commissioners in an effort to convince them that the antitrust review was too narrowly focused and that the deal carries big-picture benefits for Europe as the region grapples with a debt crisis and seeks to tighten some market regulations.

A spokeswoman for the EU's Reding said that the meeting had been scheduled but said it was yet to be formally confirmed. A spokesman for NYSE Euronext declined to comment on private meetings.

Niederauer would meet with Reding in Strasbourg, France, on Jan. 17. That same day, national antitrust authorities of the EU Commission states will gather to issue an opinion on the exchange merger, though this is confidential and non-binding for the broader EU ruling.

The exchanges' letter to European Commission President Barroso outlined positives to their deal, such as the opportunity for Europe to gain a stronger voice in global regulation of securities trading and to make financial markets more transparent to authorities. The contents of the letter to Barroso were previously reported by Bloomberg News.

The exchanges have also stressed that by combining, it will cost less for major participants like banks to trade in derivatives and other instruments. An estimated EUR3 billion in collateral savings would be brought by combining trade-clearing services of the two firms into one facility.

A nine-month examination by EU antitrust officials ultimately focused on the estimated 93% market share that the combined exchange group would hold in European futures and options trading. Neither Deutsche Boerse nor NYSE Euronext are willing to divest its futures exchange in whole to make the deal work.

NYSE's Niederauer this week called the EU competition authorities' analysis "fundamentally flawed," saying it ignored the far-larger market in over-the-counter derivatives that are used for similar purposes, like guarding investors against shifts in key interest rates.

EU commissioners have previously gone against the recommendation of antitrust examiners and approved mergers that had been deemed anticompetitive in an in-depth review. But such instances are rare, representing only about 10% of such cases that come before the full EU commission, according to research from BMO Capital Markets.

UPDATE 1-EU national  regulators to vote on D.Boerse-NYSE Jan 17 - sources

(Adds further details, background)

BRUSSELS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - National competition regulators in the European Union will vote on Jan. 17 on competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia's plan to block the merger of Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, three people with knowledge of the case said on Friday.
"The advisory committee will meet on Jan. 17 on the case," one of the people said.

Another said the meeting was expected to lead to some fine-tuning of some of the arguments used by Almunia's case team to back up the recommendation but would not reject it. The opinion of the committee of national competition regulators is non-binding.

The advisory committee meeting comes as the two exchanges step up their lobbying to try and get the deal approved.

Even after the committee meeting, Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext will have a final chance to lobby for a rejection of Almunia's advice ahead of the final, binding vote on the merger by the full European Commission. This is expected to take place on Feb. 1, a week ahead of the European Commission's Feb. 9 deadline.
National experts generally back the Commission's recommendations as they follow the same principles and rules. A person familiar with the matter said Almunia's 26 fellow commissioners would likely back his recommendation.
The EU has not so far known a merger case in which fellow commissioners have overturned the antitrust chief's
recommendation to block it.

"There are one or two commissioners who will make a signal that it is not a good idea but they are not really fighting for it," the person said.

Competition experts in the internal market, enterprises and the economic and monetary affairs units have been closely involved in vetting the deal since it was notified to the Commission.

NYSE Euronext's chief executive Duncan Niederauer told employees on Wednesday that the Commission's preliminary finding pointed to a blocking but the exchanges would continue to lobby Almunia's fellow commissioners.
Almunia is concerned about the more than 90 percent share of

the listed derivatives market in Europe that a combined entity would have. To avoid this he has asked that either Deutsche Boerse sell off its Eurex derivatives arm or NYSE Euronext sell Liffe, its London-based futures exchange.

But both exchanges have rejected the idea. Instead they have offered to sell Liffe's single stock equity derivatives business, set a three-year price cap on European derivatives contracts and open up their clearing houses to specific products.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext won U.S. antitrust approval for the deal last month after facing little criticism.

If Almunia succeeds in blocking the deal it would be his second veto of a merger. He blocked the merger of Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines in January last year, saying the combined Greek carrier would have a quasi-monopoly in the domestic air market.

EC blocking NYSE Euronext  / Deutsche BÃ¶rse merger

The European Commission Competition Commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, has told  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse that he will not agree to their  merger unless they agree to sell one of the two major derivative markets - NYSE Liffe or Eurex. The final published decision is not expected before February 9th. Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext CEO is reported to have told staff that he is still fighting to have this decision overturned.

The two groups have said previously they would not go ahead with the merger if they were forced to sell one of the derivative exchanges as a condition. They have offered to sell the single equity derivatives business of Liffe arguing that in other derivatives areas the two markets do not compete currently with the competition coming from other continents. Usually the Competition Commissioner settles mergers by negotiation rather than outright prevention and it remains to be seen whether a last minute compromise can be achieved. In theory Alumia could be overruled by other commissioners but is most unlikely and would create a major incident within the European Union.

German EconMin:  EU Has Sole Responsibility To Decide Boerse,NYSEMerger Plans

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--It's the "sole responsibility" of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to decide on the planned  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), a spokeswoman for the German economics ministry said Saturday.
Her comments damp hopes that the plans would get top-level political support by the German government. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office referred to the German economics and finance
ministries for comment when asked whether Merkel is or would get involved in the process.
He also pointed to a comment by a finance ministry spokeswoman at the German government's press conference
Wednesday that the ministry "currently isn't involved in the process."
After the Commission's antitrust examiners decided this week the planned deal wasn't compatible with EU
antitrust rules, the chief executives of both exchanges are now lobbying at the top levels of the EU Commission in
a last-ditch effort to win approval from the 26 other commissioners who might look at other issues than
competition.

Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, is slated to meet with European Commission Vice President Viviane Reding Tuesday. The exchanges also wrote a letter to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso highlighting benefits of the tie-up.

All 27 EU commissioners are to make a final ruling on the deal by Feb. 9. Antitrust regulators for the EU this week recommended that commissioners block the $17 billion combination on grounds that it would create a monopoly
in European exchange-traded futures and options trading, where the merged group would dominate with a market share of above 90%.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext now are taking their case directly to EU commissioners in order to convince them that the antitrust review was too narrowly focused and that the deal carries bigger-picture benefits for Europe, as the region aims to resolve a sovereign debt crisis and step up market regulation.
