European Commission Set To Block Tetra-Sidel Deal --- Officials Fear Merged Firm Would Have Undue
Share Of Packaging  Market

BRUSSELS -- Adding to a long list of blocked mergers this year, the European Commission is prepared to reject the 1.7 billion euro ($1.5 billion) acquisition of  Sidel SA by Tetra Laval SA, the world's largest maker of carton packaging for beverages.

In a confidential draft decision discussed in Brussels on Friday, the commission's antitrust enforcers recommended blocking the deal because it would give the combined company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market, people familiar with the situation said.

Although the deal could still be saved by last-minute concessions, such a compromise appears unlikely, said two people with knowledge of the commission's position. The commission is expected to hand down its official ruling next week.

The negative decision would cap an unprecedented wave of deals blocked this year by the commission's powerful Merger Task Force. In just four months from July to October, the commission killed General Electric Co.'s $40 billion bid to acquire Honeywell International Inc., Schneider Electric SA's 6.6 billion euro bid for rival Legrand SA and CVC Capital Partners Group's attempt to buy Lenzig AG.

Such frequency of prohibitions is unusual, and could be explained as simple coincidence. But some observers attribute the increase to the growing complexity and size of global deals, and to a high degree of concentration in some industries. It is becoming increasingly difficult for companies already strong or dominant in one market to pull off acquisitions of their rivals without drawing antitrust scrutiny from Brussels.

People familiar with the commission's strategy say the Tetra-Sidel deal raises a host of traditional antitrust issues. While carton and plastic packaging don't constitute the same market in Europe, the industry is already moving in that direction. Beverage makers in Europe increasingly view carton and plastic packaging as interchangeable,
and in the U.S. the two markets have already become indistinguishable. By acquiring Sidel, Tetra could eliminate a potentially strong competitor, which would reduce its incentive to innovate and reduce prices, said a person familiar with the commission's thinking. A spokeswoman for Tetra declined to comment.

Others briefed on the case say the commission's reasoning in the Tetra-Sidel case bears some similarities to its rationale for blocking GE's ill-fated attempt to acquire Honeywell. In that case, the commission sparked a
trans-Atlantic debate by employing a controversial theory of product "bundling" to block the deal, which had already been approved in the U.S.

Two people briefed on the Tetra-Sidel case say the commission has concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and Sidel would cement a strong portfolio of products that its rivals wouldn't be able to match. The commission is also worried that the combined company could leverage its power in carton beverage packaging -- where Tetra has been found dominant -- to achieve a stronger position in the plastic-bottle business, these people say.

The companies have offered to sell some product lines to secure antitrust clearance, but the commission has concluded that these proposals are insufficient, the people close to the case say.
The Tetra-Sidel deal has been already approved in the U.S.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The 1.7 billion euro ($1.5 billion) takeover by  Tetra Laval, the Swedish packaging group, of French rival  Sidel is threatened with collapse after a  European Commission recommendation to block it on competition grounds, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday.

The draft decision by the Commission's competition directorate and  EU member states is likely to be confirmed by the Commission in the next two weeks unless the privately-owned Swedish company makes substantial concessions, the newspaper reported.

Blocking the bid would spark further political uproar in France and the Nordic countries. Politicians have attacked decisions by Mario Monti, European competition commissioner, to block a merger of two French electrical companies and be tough on a deal between two Swedish banks.

It is understood that Tetra Laval, maker of Tetra Pak cartons, is in talks with the Commission in an attempt to salvage the deal, which is crucial to its growth plans.

The company, owned by the multi-millionaire Rausing family, has pledged to dispose of a plastic bottle-making division and four manufacturing plants, but competition experts said it would have to offer considerably more to meet the regulator's concerns, the FT reported.
The Commission and the companies declined to comment. Document lba0000020011024dxao00267

PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) -  Tetra Laval, the Swedish packaging group, said on Wednesday the  European Union had not finished reviewing its 1.7 billion euro takeover of French rival  Sidel and had about two weeks to do so.

The Financial Times reported earlier the deal was threatened with collapse after a  European Commission recommendation to block it on competition grounds.

The draft decision by the Commission's competition directorate and EU member states is likely to be confirmed by the Commission in the next two weeks unless the privately owned Swedish company makes substantial concessions, the FT reported.

"The Brussels process is not over. It goes on until November 9," a spokeswoman in France for Tetra Laval said, declining further comment on any concessions the company might make.

EU likely to block Tetra Laval-Sidel  deal-sources.

BRUSSELS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is likely to block Swedish packaging giant  Tetra        Laval's 1.7 billion euro ($1.52 billion) purchase of French rival  Sidel, two people familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.
The Commission is expected to turn the deal down when it meets next week because it would tighten the hold of
Tetra Laval's Tetra Pak on the liquid container market where it is already the world's largest producer.

Tetra Laval is a family-owned business that operates Tetra Pak. The company, employing 18,900 people, produces containers for dairy products, wine, olive oil, motor oil, juices and other liquids.

The firm already owns 91.2 percent of Sidel's shares, but has been barred from exercising its voting rights pending approval of the deal. If the deal is turned down the company will have to sell the shares.

The final deadline for the Commission to act is November 9, but it almost always acts in advance of such deadlines.

UPDATE 1-EU likely to block Tetra Laval-Sidel  deal-sources.

BRUSSELS/PARIS, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The  European Commission is likely to block Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval's 1.7 billion euro ($1.5 billion) purchase of France's  Sidel SA, sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.
The Commission will probably turn the deal down when it meets next week because it would tighten the hold of
Tetra Laval's Tetra Pak unit on the liquid container market, where it is already the world's largest producer.

Family-owned Tetra Laval produces containers for dairy products, wine, olive oil, motor oil, juices and other liquids and employs 18,900 people.
Tetra already owns 91.2 percent of bottle machine maker Sidel following a takeover bid at the end of March.

It has been barred from exercising its voting rights pending approval of the deal. If the deal is turned down, the company will have to sell the shares.
Sidel's machines make plastic bottles, not paper-based cartons, which are Tetra Laval's largest business. In an attempt to ease the Commission's concerns, Tetra Laval this month offered to sell two companies
representing almost half of its own interest in plastic bottling machines, a source close to Tetra told Reuters.

The source said the company has made a strong case that Sidel is in a different business and that there are no further meetings planned with Commission authorities.
The Commission to due to rule by November 9, but it almost always acts in advance of such deadlines. BREAKING RECORDS
Earlier this year, the Commission set a record by blocking its fourth merger of 2001, breaking the record of three in 1996.
If the Tetra Laval deal were vetoed, it would be the second time in a matter of weeks that Competition
Commissioner Mario Monti will have overturned an acquisition of a French company that has already taken place.

On October 10, he ruled that Schneider Electric SA, which makes electrical fittings and factory control equipment, could not keep the 98 percent of peer Legrand SA that it had already bought.
In France, companies are not obliged to obtain authorisation from Brussels before proceeding with a takeover. Once a company has bought 33 percent of the shares of a target that is listed on the Paris stock market, it is
obliged to make an offer for the rest.

Tetra Laval starting by buying out a group of shareholders in Sidel, much in the same way that Schneider bought out family shareholders of Legrand, though the source close to Tetra said that the initial stake was less than 33 percent.

Tetra Laval was founded by Ruben Rausing, who invented the Tetra Pak carton system in 1951. The company is now the world's largest food packaging group, with its factories making an estimated 85 billion cartons a year.

Sidel, based in Le Havre in northern France, ran into trouble in recent years after its new invention, the Actis bottling system, failed to interest large manufacturers.

Sidel says Actis bottles protect their contents better than other plastic containers, allowing drink makers to fill them with a wider range of products, including beer.

Tetra Laval: Reports Of EU Block On Sidel Buy Premature

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Swedish industrial group  Tetra Laval (S.TLG) Wednesday said reports that the European Commission is prepared to reject its EUR7 billion acquisition of French packaging equipment maker Sidel (F.SDL) are premature as talks about possible divestments are continuing.
"(These reports) are a surprise because talks are still ongoing," a spokeswoman for the group said, adding that it
"isn't the moment" to comment on the talks.
She said she didn't expect the group to comment further until the E.U.'s final ruling on the deal which is due Nov.
9.
Sidel wasn't immediately available for comment.

Tetra Laval has already offered to divest assets in its plastic packaging equipment operations - mainly in its blowing business, while other proposals are underway, the spokeswoman said.
The E.U. antitrust authorities are currently reviewing the proposals for asset divestment, she added.
Under E.U. antitrust rules, companies can offer further concessions until the last minute providing that they are
"clear cut" and don't require further examination within the market.

As reported in the Wall Street Journal, the commission's antitrust enforcers recommended blocking the deal in a confidential draft decision discussed in Brussels Friday, because it would give the combined company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market.

Although the deal could still theoretically be saved by last-minute concessions, such a compromise appears unlikely, said two people familiar with the Commission's position.

People familiar with the Tetra-Sidel case say the Commission has concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and Sidel would cement a strong portfolio of products that its rivals wouldn't be able to match.

The Commission is also concerned that the combined company could leverage its power in carton beverage packaging - where Tetra has been found dominant - to achieve a stronger position in the plastic-bottle business, the sources said.

BRUSSELS -- Adding to a long list of blocked mergers this year, the  European Commission is prepared to reject the 1.7 billion euros acquisition of  Sidel SA by Tetra Laval, the world's largest maker of carton packaging for beverages, say people familiar with the situation.

The commission argued that by combining GE's strength in making jet engines with Honeywell's avionics products, the companies could offer an attractive package to its customers, which in turn would hurt rivals without the same portfolio of products to sell. The companies have appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice.

Two people briefed on the Tetra-Sidel case say the commission has concluded that by merging their businesses Tetra and Sidel would cement a strong portfolio of products that their rivals wouldn't be able to match.

The Tetra-Sidel deal already has been approved in the U.S., partly because Tetra isn't as dominant there as it is
in Europe, says a person close to the commission. Ten years ago, the commission fined Tetra 75 million euros for
allegedly seeking to eliminate competition from other companies.

EU Regulators to Reject Tetra's Acquisition of Sidel --- Officials Fear Packaging-Market Dominance

BRUSSELS -- Adding to a long list of blocked mergers this year, the European Commission is prepared to reject the 1.7 billion euro ($1.51 billion) acquisition of  Sidel SA by Tetra Laval, the world's largest maker of carton packaging for beverages, say people familiar with the situation.

In a confidential draft decision discussed in Brussels on Friday, the commission's antitrust enforcers recommended blocking the deal because it would give the combined company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market.

Although the deal could still theoretically be saved by last-minute concessions, such a compromise appears unlikely, said two people familiar with the commission's position. The commission is expected to hand down its official ruling next week.

The negative decision would cap an already unprecedented wave of deals that were blocked this year by the commission's powerful Merger Task Force. In just four months between July and October, the commission killed General Electric Co.'s $40 billion bid to acquire Honeywell International Inc., Schneider Electric SA's 6.6 billion euro bid for rival Legrand SA and CVC Capital Partners Group's attempt to buy Lenzig AG.

People familiar with the commission's strategy say the Tetra-Sidel deal raises a host of traditional antitrust issues. While carton and plastic packaging don't constitute the same market in Europe, the industry is moving in that direction. Beverage makers in Europe increasingly view carton and plastic packaging as interchangeable, and in the U.S. the two markets have already become indistinguishable. So by acquiring Sidel, Tetra could eliminate a potentially strong competitor, which would reduce its incentive to innovate and reduce prices, said a person familiar with the commission's thinking. A spokeswoman for Tetra declined to comment.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Towards a veto to Tetra Laval/Sidel  merger?
280 words
26 October 2001
Agence Europe
AGEU

(c) 2001 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 25/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - According to the Financial Times, as we mentioned, the  European anti-trust authorities are preparing to block the merger between the specialists in the packaging of liquid food, Tetra Laval and Sidel, unless the two propose much more substantial undertakings than those set out so far. Tetra Laval has so far undertaken to sell all its plastic bottle blowing activities, as well as its four plants, but these concessions should be "considerably broadened", according to competition experts. Last Friday, at the meeting
for advisory opinion, the representatives of the countries members of the Union are said to have decided on a veto. The opinion, however, was said not to have been reached through unanimity as at least two member countries are said to have been in favour of this merger.

According to the daily, Tetra Laval has been unable to convince the European Commission that the markets for cardboard packaging, speciality of Tetra Pak, and plastic packaging, market dominated by Sidel, are different. The European Executive, indeed, considers that the two products may substitute each other and are not complementary. The rapprochement between the two companies would thus be of a nature to create a dominant position on the overall packaging market for liquid food.

You may recall that, early-July, the Commission decided to initiate an in-depth investigation into this rapprochement (see EUROPE of 7 July, p.7). The spokesperson for Commissioner Monti, Amelia Torres, has not confirmed this news, simply saying that "the examination procedure is not yet over. A final decision is expected
for 9 November at the latest".

European regulators under fire as they prepare to block another big merger deal

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The world's largest maker of beverage cartons, facing the rejection of its purchase of a French rival, warned Monday that the spate of mergers rejected by  European Union regulators would have a "chilling effect" on industry.

Confirming days of rumors,  Tetra Laval SA said in a statement that it understood the  European Commission, which enforces EU rules, was "likely" to block the proposed acquisition of  Sidel SA at its Tuesday meeting.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres confirmed that a decision was expected Tuesday, but declined to comment further.

If blocked, the 1.7 billion euro (dlrs 1.53 billion) deal would become the fifth nixed this year by the EU, on top of three European mergers and another involving two U.S. firms: General Electric Co. and Honeywell International Inc.

The EU blocked only 13 mergers in the previous decade, and the unprecedented burst of activity has drawn increasing criticism from some business leaders.

Tetra Laval chairman Goeran Grosskopf charged the Commission was "basing its views on speculation about future market developments that are not supported by any independent industry expert or by any reputable economist."
Noting that similar concerns were raised in the GE-Honeywell case, he warned that applying the same
"speculative theory" again could exacerbate a "growing rift between EU and U.S. regulators."

U.S. antitrust chief Charles James had sharply criticized the EU for rejecting the dlrs 43 billion GE-Honeywell deal, which had been approved in Washington.

Grosskopf said a rejection of his deal now "can only have a chilling effect on European industry as a whole and move the Commission further away from the international mainstream of merger policy ...

"Potentially beneficial mergers, which bring economies of scale and scope, will now be abandoned to the detriment of European business and European consumers."

EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has deflected criticism of his merger task force, and suggested corporate chieftains use the EU as a scapegoat to get out of deals that no longer make sense in a declining or volatile market.

"There may be cases where the least costly way out financially, and in terms of credibility, may be to see that the deal is not authorized," Monti told a European Parliament committee last month.

The Commission warned last July that it was worried that the merger "may lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on the market for liquid food packaging equipment."

Swiss-based Tetra Laval, which controls about half of the world market for food and drink cartons, wanted Sidel to enhance its position in PET plastic bottle packaging.


Page 19 of 64 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Sidel is the world market leader in machines for making the bottles, which are used widely for mineral water and carbonated soft drinks.

The companies insisted the markets for cartons and bottles were separate with next to no overlap, but the Commission reportedly concluded that a merger would give the combined company a strong portfolio of products and an undue share of the beverage-packaging market.

"There is nothing strange in the way the Commission has looked at this case," Torres said. "It's a merger in the packaging sector."

Competition lawyers in Brussels said they believe the spate of rejections is not so much a change in EU policy as a reflection of the increasing size and complexity of cases coming before it.

Fiona Carlin at Baker & McKenzie law firm described Grosskopf's statements as "the latest in a long line of complaints from CEOs who are annoyed that their deal didn't go through."

"With more businesses trying to consolidate and go global, the increase in negative decisions is probably a natural consequence," she said.

The others were on Jan. 31 between SCA and Metsa Tissue, two Nordic paper manufacturers; Oct. 10 between Schneider Electric SA and Legrand SA, two French makers of electrical equipment; and Oct. 17 between CVC Capital Partners Group, a British buyout firm, and German fiber-maker Lenzig AG.

In rejecting that deal, the EU said it was concerned that bundling GE's strength in jet engines and aircraft financing with Honeywell's in avionics might enable the combined company eventually to drive competitors out of business.

This month in Paris, William Kolasky, a top-ranking U.S. antitrust official, said that so-called "portfolio effect" theory was "not strongly grounded in economy theory or empirical evidence."

The number of recent rejections, while it may be only coincidental, could influence companies in "marginal cases" not to go for a merger, said Fergal O'Regan of Van Bael & Bellis. "It obviously makes people think long and hard about whether such cases are going to get clearance," he said.

The EC has blocked the take-over of Austrian company Lenzing by CVC Capital Partners. The take-over would have resulted in a merger of Lenzing with Acordis (CVC has a majority stake in Acordis) to produce the largest European producer of viscose and cellulose fibres. The EC is also reported to be threatening to block the EUR
1.7 bn take-over of French company  Sidel by Tetra Laval. There is a detailed discussion of these decisions and the background to them.

Tetra Laval chief criticises Brussels over Sidel.

Goran Grosskopf, head of Swedish packaging group  Tetra Laval, has written to each of the 20 European commissioners a three-page letter openly criticising the operations of the competition department. Tetra Laval believes Brussels plans to block its merger with  Sidel, the French manufacturer of plastic bottle machinery.

Grosskopf criticises the competition department's "increasingly extreme" attitude to mergers. He says that a blocking of the merger would "strengthen the impression" that the Commission does not have control over the competition department.

Tetra Laval initially thought it would encounter no problems with the merger as the two groups operate on separate markets and it was willing to dispose of assets to gain approval for the deal.

EU To Block Tetra Laval's Takeover Of Sidel Tue -Source

PARIS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission will block Swedish industrial group Tetra Laval's (S.TLG) EUR1.7 billion takeover of French packaging equipment maker Sidel (F.SDL) Tuesday, a source close to the deal told Dow Jones Newswires Monday.
"From what we understand, the Commission is going to block the deal tomorrow...Now new negotiations between
Tetral Laval and Sidel will have to take place, as Tetra already owns 94% of Sidel," the source said.

The Commission has concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and Sidel would cement a strong portfolio of products and would give the combined company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market, the source said.

Tetra Laval has offered to divest assets in its plastic packaging equipment operations - mainly in its blowing business, but the asset sales divestments that were proposed by the companies aren't sufficient, the source said.

A spokeswoman for the Commission confirmed that a decision was due Tuesday, more than a week earlier than the previously announced Nov. 9 deadline.

"I can't say very much about this case because as you know the EU Commission hasn't yet said anything about the purchase of Sidel by Tetra Laval. The deadline to do so is Nov. 9, and there should be a decision tomorrow in principle," the spokeswoman added.

The Commission is also concerned that the combined company could leverage its power in carton beverage packaging - where Tetra has been found dominant - to achieve a stronger position in the plastic-bottle business.

"All I can say at this stage is that in many respects this is a classical merger with some overlaps. So there's nothing strange about the way in which the Commission has looked at this case," the spokeswoman said.
The source also said that Tetra might be considering challenging the decision in the European Court of Justice. The Financial Times reported Monday that Tetra Laval Chairman Goran Grosskopf has written the 19
commissioners expected to block the deal to strongly criticize the merger task force.

The report states that Tetra Laval has accused the competition department of pursuing "extreme" policies that have a "chilling effect" on European industry and hurt consumers.

Tetra Laval Sees Sidel Deal Blocked; Slams EU Commission

STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Swedish industrial group  Tetra Laval (S.TLG) said Monday that the  European Commission is "likely" to block as early as Tuesday its proposed EUR1.7 billion takeover of French packaging equipment maker Sidel (F.SDL).

"The Commission's intention to block our acquisition of  Sidel is negative for our business, bad for the reputation of the Commission and will only be to the detriment of our customers and, ultimately,  European consumerism," said Tetra Laval Chairman Goeran Grosskopf in a statement Monday.

Grosskopf said the Commission is basing its views on speculation about future market developments that "aren't supported by any independent industry expert or by any reputable economist."
"It demonstrates that there is no effective check on the views or prejudices of the (Commission's) Merger Task
Force," he continued.

A source close to the deal told Dow Jones Newswires Monday that the Commission has concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and Sidel would give the combined company an undue share of the beverage packaging market.

Tetra Laval has offered to divest assets in its plastic packaging equipment operations - mainly in its blowing business, but the asset sales divestments that were proposed by the companies aren't sufficient, the source told Dow Jones Newswires.

EU casts doubt on Tetra Laval, Sidel deal

DUSSELDORF, GERMANY - The long-delayed takeover of French blow molding machine supplier Groupe  Sidel by packaging group Tetra Laval International SA has been thrown into doubt after  European Union antitrust experts recommended the deal be blocked on competition grounds.

It was in March 2001 that  Tetra Laval of Pully, Switzerland, made its $1.61 billion bid to acquire  Sidel of Le Havre, France, but completion of the takeover has been held up since the deal came under in-depth scrutiny on antitrust grounds by the  European Commission.

Tetra Laval has been in negotiation with the commission over divesting certain operations. But now, according to published reports, the commission's competition advisory panel, comprising experts representing the 15 EU member states, has reached a draft decision opposing the merger. They believe the resulting group would dominate Europe's liquid-food packaging market.

A majority of EU member states voted to support the panel's advice to the commission to reject the proposed deal, reports London's Financial Times newspaper.
The commission is set to give a final ruling on the matter the week of Oct. 29, in time to meet its deadline of Nov.
9, according to a spokeswoman for the EU competition commissioner, Mario Monti.

Tetra Laval subsidiary Tetra Pak announced in July it plans to sell off several assets, including its stretch blow molding machinery business in Viguzzolo, Italy, and its injection molded PET preform plants in Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. It also is dropping its proprietary injection molded barrier-layer process, Sealica.

Neither Sidel nor Tetra Laval were keen to comment on the threat to their proposed merger prior to the European Commission's final ruling. Tetra Laval vice president of communications Jorgen Haglind would say only that the group is still in talks with the commission.

"We are still talking with the commission. As long as there is constructive discussion continuing, we will carry on with this. We are not commenting until a final decision is known," he said in an Oct. 25 telephone interview.

At the end of September, Haglind, who is based in Lund, Sweden, had stressed the European authorities had not required Tetra to sell off its stretch blow molding machinery and PET preform operations over the deal. Neither had it set down conditions for the merger to be acceptable, he added.

A Sidel spokesman, speaking at the K 2001 trade show in Dusseldorf, made clear that negotiations over the deal with the European Union are being handled by Tetra Laval. He confirmed that authorities had required that Tetra Laval buy at least 95 percent of Sidel.
He said Sidel fully backs the takeover by Tetra Laval, which will allow the publicly quoted supplier of complete
PET blow molding, filling and packing lines as well as barrier coating technology, to go private and concentrate its
efforts on developing innovative products.

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (AFP) - The European Commission said Tuesday it had blocked the acquisition of French packaging and plastic bottle manufacturer Sidel by Tetra Laval of Sweden.

The operation would have significantly reduced competition in the bottling industry at the expense of "innovation, choice and price competition," the commission said.

Following a public offer in the first half of 2001, the French subsidiary of Tetra Laval, makers of cartons for packaging drinks, acquired about 94 percent of the capital of Sidel, the largest European plastic bottler.
The acquisition was estimated in the Swedish press to be valued at 1.7 billion euros (1.54 billion dollars). Tetra Laval chairman Goeran Grosskopf, in an interviewing appearing in the Swedish business newspaper
DagensIndustri before the Commission decison was announced, complained that the panel usually based its
rulings on speculation about future market trends rather than on the facts.

But he added that a negative finding by the Commission "would not endanger our plans to increase our involvement in plastic packaging."

He said the company had not yet decided if it would appeal the ruling, which marked the 18th time in the last 10 years that the Commission's has vetoed such merger requests.

In that period, the body has considered 1,800 cases. The Commission has had the authority to rule on industrial consolidation requests since 1990.

The commission explained: "The combination of Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging and Sidel's leading position in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) packaging equipment would provide the merged entity with the ability and incentives to leverage its dominant position in carton to gain a dominant position in PET packaging equipment."

Grosskopf commented in the interview: "Carton and plastic are two different markets, which the European working group on mergers acknowledged in its report. There's only one percent overlap among our clients. But the working group on fusions says that in four years there will be a very large overlap."

But he added that a negative finding by the Commission "would not endanger our plans to increase our involvement in plastic packaging."

He said the company had not yet decided if it would appeal the ruling, which marked the 18th time in the last 10 years that the Commission's has vetoed such merger proposals.

EU blocks  Swiss-based Tetra Laval takeover of French Sidel

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The  European Union blocked a bid by Tetra Laval SA, the world's largest maker of beverage cartons, to take over the French packaging equipment maker Sidel SA for 1.7 billion euros (dlrs 1.53 billion), saying Tuesday the merged company would violate  EU competition rules.

Spokeswoman Amelia Torres said  EU regulators was worried about the dominant position of the Swiss-based Tetra Laval, which controls about half of the world market for food and drink cartons.  Tetra Laval wanted Sidel to bolster its position in plastic bottle packaging, in which  Sidel is a world market leader.

"Tetra Laval has an overwhelmingly dominant position with regards to cardboard packaging," Torres told reporters. "They are trying to eliminate a competator in a very promising market, packaging plastic."
The Tetra Laval-Sidel deal was the fifth merger turned down this year by the EU, including the U.S. deal between
General Electric Co. and Honeywell International Inc., rejected on July 3.
It is the 18th deal rejected since the Commission set up its regulatory Merger Task Force in 1990.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the merger would have created a dominant position in the market for machines used for packaging products such as fruit juices, liquid dairy products and ice-tea beverages.

EU regulators also were concerned the combined company would use its position in the carton beverage packaging sector to push other competitors away in the plastic bottle business.

Sources close to the deal said Tetra Laval had offered to divest certain assets in its plastic packaging equipment operations to meet EU requirements.
"The undertakings proposed by Tetra Laval were not sufficient to address the Commission's concerns," the
Commission said in a statement.
The companies had insisted the markets for cartons and bottles were separate with next to no overlap.

Tetra Laval Chairman Goeran Grosskopf said Monday that a rejection of the deal would "have a chilling effect on European industry as a whole and move the Commission further away from the international mainstream of merger policy."
The EU opened its probe into the merger in July.
All mergers of companies that do business within the 15-nation bloc must seek regulatory approval from the EU. (cb-dj-)

BRUSSELS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval's 1.7 billion euro ($1.5 billion) attempt to buy rival Sidel SA was blocked on Tuesday by the European Commission, the Commission announced.
The Commission, in its fifth rejection of a merger this year, decided the transaction would tighten the hold of  Tetra
Laval's Tetra Pak unit on the liquid container market, where it is already the world's largest producer.
"The takeover would combine Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging with Sidel's leading position in PET
packaging equipment ...," the Commission said in a statement.

"The merger would also strengthen Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging, therefore significantly reducing competition in liquid packaging to the detriment of innovation, choice and competitive prices," it said.
It said undertakings proposed by Tetra Laval were not sufficient to address the Commission's concerns.

Earlier this year, the Commission set a record by blocking its fourth merger of 2001, breaking the record of three in 1996.

Family-owned Tetra Laval produces containers for dairy products, wine, olive oil, motor oil, juices and other liquids and employs 18,900 people.

Tetra already owns 91.2 percent of bottle machine maker Sidel following a takeover bid at the end of March. Now it will have to dispose of those shares, although when and how remains to be determined.

UPDATE 2-EU rejects Tetra Laval buy of Sidel.
By Jan Strupczewski

STOCKHOLM, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval's 1.7 billion euro ($1.5 billion) attempt to buy French rival Sidel SA was blocked on Tuesday by the European Commission, the Commission announced.

In a record fifth rejection of a merger this year, the Commission decided the transaction would tighten the hold of family-owned Laval's Tetra Pak unit on the liquid container market, where it is already the global market leader.
"The takeover would combine Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging with Sidel's leading position in PET
plastic packaging equipment...," the Commission said in a statement.

"The merger would also strengthen Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging, therefore significantly reducing competition in liquid packaging to the detriment of innovation, choice and competitive prices," it said.
It said undertakings proposed by Tetra Laval did not go far enough to address the Commission's concerns. Tetra Laval had harshly criticised the Commission's blocking of the merger.
"I think it is an extremely worrying policy, because this means that Europe is going it's own route, very different from other countries. It means that the European industry will have a tremendous competitive disadvantage to other countries," Tetra Laval's Chairman Goran Grosskopf told Reuters in an interview.

Hitting back strongly, Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said: "Tetra Laval has a crushing dominant position in carton packaging and they were trying to eliminate a competitor in a very promising market for plastic packaging."
INSUFFICIENT CONCESSIONS

"The Commission could not authorise that unless they (Tetra Laval) agreed to make concessions... which wasn't the case, so unfortunately it was prohibited," she added.
Tetra Laval produces containers for dairy products, wine, olive oil, motor oil, juices and other liquids and employs
18,900 people.

Tetra already owns 94 percent of bottle machine maker Sidel following a takeover bid at the end of March, but has been barred from exercising voting rights pending approval of the deal. It will now have to dispose of those shares, although when and how is yet to be determined.

"If you look at similar situations the Commission has been reasonably generous in granting substantial time for the divestment of shares. I guess we will have... probably several years," Grosskopf said, adding no potential buyers were identified yet.

Sidel's machines make plastic bottles, not paper-based cartons, which are Tetra Laval's largest business. Grosskopf said Tetra Laval's competitive position would not be harmed by the rejection of the deal, and that Sidel would be hit the most.

"I think the most painful part is for Sidel because of the uncertainty of ownership they have experienced now for such a long period of time," he said.

In an attempt to ease the Commission's concerns, Tetra Laval this month offered to sell two companies representing almost half of its own interest in plastic bottling machines, a source close to Tetra told Reuters.
The source said the company tried to make the case that Sidel was in a different business.

Tetra's chairman said that despite the Sidel setback the company was still keen to expand in the plastic bottling sector.

"Our ambition is to grow the company and the group in plastics, so we will definitely look into realizing our strategy in another way, both organically and by looking at other acquisitions," Grosskopf said.
He said Tetra Laval had not identified any potential targets yet.

The rejection is the second time in a matter of weeks that Competition Commissioner Mario Monti has overturned an acquisition of a French company that has already taken place.

On October 10, he ruled that Schneider Electric SA, which makes electrical fittings and factory control equipment, could not keep the 98 percent of peer Legrand SA that it had already bought.

In France, companies are not obliged to obtain authorisation from Brussels before proceeding with a takeover. (Additional reporting Adrian Croft in Brussels, by Denis Thomas and Tom Pfeiffer in Paris and Peter Andersson in Stockholm).

- CVC's planned acquisition of Austria-based Lenzing.
- Schneider Electric's planned 6.42 billion euro bid to buy rival Legrand.
- General Electric Co's planned acquisition of Honeywell International.
- Swedish paper giant Svenska Cellulosa AB's planned acquisition of Finnish Metsa Tissue Oyi.
2000 - Proposed merger of U.S. telecoms firms WorldCom and Sprint.

EU Blocks  Tetra Laval's Takeover Of Sidel

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission said Tuesday that it has blocked Swiss-based
Tetra Laval Group's (S.TLG) EUR1.7 billion takeover of French packaging equipment maker  Sidel (F.SDL).

The Commission concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and  Sidel would have combined a suite of packaging businesses that would give the company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market.
"The takeover would combine Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging with Sidel's leading position in PET
plastic packaging equipment," the Commission said.

It is the eighteenth time that the Commission has blocked a merger since Europe-wide merger control was introduced in 1990.

The tie-up, said the Commission, would have created a dominant position in the market, in particular for machines used for packaging sensitive products such as fruit juices, liquid daily products, fruit-flavored drinks and ice tea beverages.

The Commission was also concerned that the combined company could leverage its power in carton beverage packaging - where Tetra has been found dominant - to achieve a stronger position in the plastic-bottle business.
The Commission also said the merger would have "significantly" reduced competition in carton packaging.

A source close to the deal told Dow Jones Newswires Monday that Tetra Laval had offered to divest assets in its plastic packaging equipment operations - mainly in its blowing business. But the asset sales divestments fell short of the Commission's requirements.

"The undertakings proposed by Tetra Laval weren't sufficient to address the Commission's concerns," the E.U. Commission said in its statement Tuesday.

"Given the serious competition and the fact that Tetra was unable to resolve them, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger."

The Financial Times reported Monday that Tetra Laval Chairman Goran Grosskopf had written to the E.U. commissioners, anticipating the deal would be blocked and strongly criticized the E.U.'s Merger Task Force.

Tetra Laval reportedly accused the competition department of pursuing "extreme" policies that have a "chilling effect" on European industry and hurt consumers.

Tetra Laval was identified as Swiss-based by the E.U. Commission in its statement on Tuesday - even though the deal's original notification to the Commission stated that Tetra Laval SA was a French company registered in The Netherlands as Tetra Laval BV.

Later Tuesday, a Commission spokeswomen clarified that the company was operated by a Swedish family and that its Swedish parent was headquartered in Switzerland.

Jorgen Haglind, a spokesman for Tetra Laval AB, the Swedish parent, said Tetra Laval's preferred designation was Swedish but added that "legally speaking, our domicile is in Switzerland."

Haglind said the company filed its notification with the E.U. Commission as a Dutch-registered, French company in order to meet legal requirements.

"It was a French company we were acquiring, and under French law we had to file in the name of the company holding the shares in our structure," said Haglind. "That's why there was an SA and a BV involved."

Tetra Laval To Pursue Expansion Despite Sidel Block -Chmn

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- The  European Union Commission's decision to block Swiss-based industrial group Tetra Laval's (S.TLG) EUR1.7 billion takeover of French packaging company  Sidel (F.SDL) Tuesday won't deter Tetra Laval from pursuing its expansion strategy in the plastic packaging business.

"It will take us longer to achieve the plastics strategy we planned...but we will continue our acquisition strategy elsewhere, in the U.S. and in Asia,"  Tetra Laval Chairman Goran Grosskopf told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview Tuesday.

Grosskopf also said that the company might have to sell off its 94% stake in packaging group Sidel at a loss, but declined to give a figure.

"There is a risk that we will have some losses...we have to organize our divestment plan in order to limit the losses," he said, adding that the Commission usually grants companies an average of two years to complete their divestment in similar situations.

As reported earlier Tuesday, the Commission concluded that by merging their businesses, Tetra and Sidel would have combined a range of packaging businesses that would give the company an undue share of the
beverage-packaging market.
"The takeover would combine Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging with Sidel's leading position in PET
plastic packaging equipment," the Commission said.

"The undertakings proposed by Tetra Laval weren't sufficient to address the Commission's concerns," the E.U. Commission said in its statement Tuesday.
Grosskopf said Tetra Laval had offered to divest a significant number of assets. "We have been as far as we were possibly expected to go," he said.
It is the eighteenth time that the Commission has blocked a merger since Europe-wide merger control was introduced in 1990.

EU Blocks  $1.54 Billion Takeover Of France's  Sidel by Tetra Laval

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission said Tuesday that it has blocked  Tetra Laval Group's takeover of
French packaging-equipment maker  Sidel SA.

The commission concluded that the 1.7-billion-euro ($1.54 billion) merger would have combined a suite of packaging businesses that would give the company an undue share of the beverage-packaging market.
Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres said EU regulators were worried about the dominant position of the
Switzerland-based Tetra Laval, which controls about half of the world market for food and drink cartons.

Tetra Laval, the world's largest maker of beverage cartons, wanted Sidel to bolster its position in plastic bottle packaging, in which Sidel is a world market leader.

"Tetra Laval has an overwhelmingly dominant position with regards to cardboard packaging," Ms. Torres said. "They are trying to eliminate a competitor in a very promising market, packaging plastic," she added.
It is the 18th time the commission has blocked a merger since Europe-wide merger control was introduced in
1990.

The tie-up would have created a dominant position in the market, in particular for machines used for packaging sensitive products such as fruit juices, fruit-flavored drinks and ice-tea beverages, the commission said.

Tetra Laval had offered to divest assets in its plastic-packaging equipment operations, a person close to the deal said Monday, but the divestments fell short of the commission's requirements.

EU regulators also were concerned the combined company would use its position in the carton beverage packaging sector to push other competitors away in the plastic-bottle business. The companies had insisted the markets for cartons and bottles were separate with almost no overlap.

Tetra Laval Chairman Goeran Grosskopf said Monday that a rejection of the deal would "have a chilling effect on European industry as a whole and move the commission further away from the international mainstream of merger policy."

The EU opened its probe into the merger in July. All mergers of companies that do business within the 15-nation bloc must seek regulatory approval from the EU.

The world's largest maker of beverage cartons, facing the rejection of its purchase of a French rival, warned Monday that the spate of mergers rejected by European Union regulators would have a ''chilling effect'' that could discourage potentially beneficial mergers to Europe's detriment.

Tetra Laval said in a statement that it understood the  European Commission, which enforces  EU rules, was
''likely'' to block the proposed acquisition of  Sidel at its meeting today.

Commission spokeswoman Amelia Torres confirmed that a decision was expected today, but declined to comment further.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Tetra Laval gets thumbs  down in bid to acquire  Sidel.
458 words
31 October 2001
Agence Europe
AGEU
English
(c) 2001 Agence EUROPE, Brussels Not Available for Re-dissemination. .
Brussels, 30/10/2001 (Agence  Europe) - no sudden or last minute developments in the Tetra Laval/Sidel  dossier: the  European Commission, as expected has refused the Swiss group Tetra Laval (owner of Tetra Pak packaging business) from acquiring the French group,  Sidel. The European Commission judged the concessions put forward by the two parties insufficient, as well as the operation having provoked serious concerns regarding competition.

Tetra Laval is the undisputed market leader in carton packaging and accounts for more than 80% of European market share. Sidel is the main plastic packaging equipment manufacturer (PET), particularly strong in
blow-moulding machines. The Commission believes that if the merger had gone ahead a monopoly in the PET packaging equipment market would have been created, as well as having strengthened Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging. PET packaging, in particular stretch blow moulding (SBM) machines are used for packaging sensitive products, namely fruit juices, liquid dairy products, fruit-flavoured drinks and ice-tea beverages. The Commission also regards carton and PET packaging as part of the same sector - liquid food packaging - although they are often considered as belonging to distinct relevant product markets. PET and carton are technical substitutes as PET can be an alternative packaging material for all products that are currently packaged in carton Some foodstuff products, such as common product segments (liquid dairy products, juices, fruit flavoured drinks and tea/coffee are already packaged in PET and carton. The combination of Tetra's dominance in carton packaging would have led to the new company dominating PET packaging. The Commission's reluctance to allow the take-over was also supported by the fact that European customers lack purchasing power. Even the most important customer does not represent more than 5% of sales and most of them are small and medium sized enterprises. Although Tetra had proposed a number of undertakings intended to get the Commission to approve the merger, as well as arguing that carton and PET packaging were two different markets (see EUROPE 26
October, pp14), the Commission gave it the thumbs down. On 27 March Tetra launched a take-over bid for Sidel SA to the tune of 1.7 billion Euro and notified the Commission on 18 May. Given the scale of the proposed merger, the Commission decided to open a preliminary inquiry and a second phase investigation on 5 July 2001 which ruled out the merger - the fifth decision of this nature this year. As in the case of Schneider/Legrand, Tetra
Laval is obliged to hand back at its earliest convenience, the parts of Sidel it acquired at the time its take-over bid, namely 94% of its stake.

PACKAGING INDUSTRY - COMMISSION BLOCKS TETRA LAVAL TAKEOVER OF SIDEL.
534 words
31 October 2001
European Report
EURREP
English
(c) 2001 European Report.
The European Commission has blocked Swiss processing and packaging group  Tetra Laval's purchase of French packaging firm  Sidel, saying that the merger would have strengthened Tetra's already dominant position in the packaging sector. The decision has provoked a fierce response by  Tetra Laval which has accused the European Commission's competition department of pursuing "extreme" policies that have a "chilling effect" on European industry and hurt consumers.
A spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Mario Monti rejected suggestions that the Commission was
acting in a discriminating way by blocking the merger. "This is a classical merger case with overlaps," said Amelia
Torres. "There is nothing strange in the way the Commission treated the  Tetra Laval - Sidel case." Tetra is
nevertheless considering challenging the decision in the  European Court of Justice.

The Commission decided to prohibit the merger on the grounds that the takeover would combine Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging (with an overall market share of over 80 % in Europe) with Sidel's leading position in PET plastic packaging equipment. A negative decision was taken even though carton and PET packaging equipment are distinct product markets. Both product markets are, however, closely related given they belong to the same industry sector, i.e. liquid food packaging.There are four major packaging materials used for liquid food packaging: carton, plastic, cans and glass. As found in earlier Commission decisions and confirmed by the Court of Justice (case C-333/94 Tetrapak v. Commission), Tetra holds dominant positions in the markets for aseptic carton packaging machines and aseptic cartons. The Commission's analysis was reinforced by the fact
that European customers lack buying power. Even the largest does not represent more than 5 % sales since most customers are small and medium sized enterprises. Furthermore, the Commission received complaints from several customers and smaller competitors, such as Elopak of Norway and Germany's SIG and Krones.The European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the acquisition by Tetra Laval S.A. (belonging to the Tetra Pak group) of Sidel S.A. on July 6. The Commission's initial review showed that the merger could lead to
the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on the market for liquid food packaging equipment. The Swiss-based group Tetra Laval had launched a takeover bid for Sidel on March 27, 2001, through its French subsidiary Tetra Laval SA. The proposed acquisition was notified to the Commission for regulatory clearance on May 18 and the Commission opened a second phase investigation on July 5, 2001. Tetra had proposed a number of undertakings intended to address these competition concerns, but they were considered "insufficient".Tetra Laval is composed of a group of companies which offer both processing and packaging equipment for beverages and liquid food. Sidel designs and makes packaging equipment and systems, in particular blow-molding
machinery (it being world market leader in this sector), barrier technology (i.e. the technology enabling bottles to be used for the packaging of light and oxygen sensitive products like juices, milk and beer) and filling machines for PET (polyethylene terephtalate) plastic bottles used widely for mineral water and carbonated soft drinks.

THE European Commission has vetoed the proposed e1.7bn acquisition of  Sidel by Tetra Laval.
According to the  EC, the take-over would have combined Tetra's dominant position in liquid carton packaging with
Sidel's leading position in PET plastic packaging equipment.

"This would create a dominant position in the market for PET packaging equipment, in particular stretch blowmoulding machines used for packaging fruit juices, liquid dairy products, fruit flavoured drinks and ice-tea beverages," an EC statement said.

"The merger would also strengthen Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging, therefore significantly reducing competition in liquid packaging to the detriment of innovation, choice and competitive prices.

"The Commission believes that, even though today carton and PET packaging equipment are distinct relevant product markets, the two are closely related neighbouring markets and belong in the same industry sector: liquid food packaging."

The takeover by Tetra Laval of the Sidel blow moulding machinery company which had been stalled for further consideration by the European Commission has been prohibited. The Commission said that Tetra's dominant position in carton packaging, combined with  Sidel's leading position in PET packaging equipment, would give the combined company the ability to use its dominant position in carton packaging to gain a dominant position in PET packaging equipment. And by eliminating  Sidel as a competitor in a closely neighbouring market, Tetra's dominant position in cartons would be strengthened.

The EC is now left to ponder the practicality of separating the two companies, as  Tetra Laval has already acquired virtually all of  Sidel's shares.

EU sacks Tetra's bid for Sidel

The European Union officially blocked  Tetra Laval International SA's $1.61 billion bid for French blow molding machine supplier Groupe  Sidel, arguing that the deal would allow Tetra to dominate the  European liquid packaging market.

In its ruling, the  EU Commission argued the deal would have given Tetra a controlling interest in the market for PET packaging equipment, especially stretch blow molding machines. The commission rejected that plan because Tetra already has a dominant share in the market for aseptic carton packaging.

Approving the deal would "raise barriers to entry and reduce competition in the overall market for aseptic and nonaseptic packaging of `sensitive products' in the EU region." It pointed specifically to packaging for light- and oxygen-sensitive food products such as fruit juice, liquid dairy, fruit-flavored drinks, iced tea and coffee products.

"Given the serious competition concerns and the fact that Tetra was unable to resolve them, the commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger," the Commission said in a written statement.

Tetra, which already has secured a 95 percent stake in Le Havre, France-based Sidel, responded with anger and disappointment. The company claimed it was willing to divest operations that would have resolved the matter.

"We are disappointed by the commission's decision to block our acquisition of Sidel, since we believe the transaction would have brought considerable benefits to our customers and, ultimately, to European consumers.

"We are surprised that it has not commented on the extensive package of remedies offered in this case, which we believe would have more than addressed the concerns highlighted by the commission in the `sensitive product' area," said Tetra Laval Chairman Goran Grosskopf.

He said his company's acquisition of Sidel was not treated in a "fair and honest manner," and the commission was misled by its competition experts.

Nevertheless, Grosskopf said Tetra Laval will cooperate fully in settling the future of Sidel. That would mean further discussions between Pully, Switzerland-based Tetra and the commission, he said.

In a statement, commissioners said the authority is "prepared to examine practical arrangements for restoring effective competition" in view of Tetra's controlling interest in the blow molding machinery supplier.

The commission, in its ruling, argued that carton and PET packaging equipment "are two closely related neighboring markets and belong in the same industry sector: liquid food packaging."
In his response, Grosskopf said it was misleading of the commission to describe Sidel as a competitor of Tetra
Laval because the customer overlap is very slight.

"Only 2 percent of Tetra Laval's carton packaging customers in the EU have also bought a Sidel [stretch blow molding] machine," he argued.

In its decision, the commission argued that European customers in the field "lack buyer power" since most are small or medium-size enterprises. It said it had received complaints from customers and competitors.

Tetra Laval, the Swedish packaging group, is trying to press on with its takeover of  Sidel, the French bottling group, despite opposition from Brussels. The European Commission is expected to block the takeover on competition grounds, as it fears that it would give Tetra Laval, which owns the Tetra Pak brand and already has a
91% stake in Sidel, too much power in the European packaging market.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION - Monti responds to French criticism.

Brussels, 09/11/2001 (Agence  Europe) - The French daily Le Monde published on 8 November a response from Competition Commissioner Mario Monti, who plans to clarify validity of the  European Commission's decisions concerning recent merger operations. The successive vetoes to the concentration between the French companies Schneider and Legrand as well as the acquisition of  Sidel (France) by Tetra-Laval (Switzerland) caused a polemic, in France, about the way Mr Monti's services carried out appraisal of the dossiers. Mr Monti considers above all that the Commission's decisions were presented to the public in a "biased way" that made one forget
the "countless approvals" given to other French companies. Welcoming the "vitality" of the large French companies, Mr Monti recognises the ability of French business leaders to cooperate effectively with the Commission "even in cases which were problematical".

He does remark, however, that it was pointless to make any political influence intervene as it is our duty, he said, to be strictly insensitive to this. He also responded to the accusation that, in some cases, the Commission adopts a somewhat narrow vision of economic reality. Mr Monti considers the debate is "welcome" as long as it is based on sound arguments. Finally, he refutes the accusation that the Commission automatically bans all mergers between companies from one and the same Member State, and gives the example of TotalFina/Elf whose merger was authorised through certain concessions. Given the "particularly delicate exercise" of identifying remedies for competition problems, Mr Monti invites companies to fully cooperate with the Commission, "without waiting until the last weeks of the procedure". If the Commission makes a mistake ("and the Commission cannot be entirely free of mistakes", he admits), the jurisdictional control by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg allows the damage
to be repaired with the cancellation of any decision taken by the European Executive. We recall that Le Monde had published in its columns a virulent response by Schneider President Henri Lachmann, who, after the European veto on the merger of his company with Legrand, had declared: "We have been ill-treated (...). The procedure is not transparent and is like a denial of justice. It is the same body that not only carries out the investigation, but also examines the remedies and takes a decision". He added moreover that "the Commission refuses the appearance of large groups and even rejects the idea of apprehending Europe to give preference to national markets".

EC blocks  Tetra Laval's bid

The European Commission has blocked Swedish packaging company  Tetra Laval's E1.7bn bid to buy French packaging equipment producer  Sidel.

The Commission says the merger would have had a detrimental effect on competition in the market for packaging machines and materials for liquids.

Tetra Laval chairman Goran Grosskopf says: "While the Commission has accepted our arguments that carton and PET equipment represent two separate product markets, we are surprised that it has not commented on the extensive package of remedies offered in this case, which we believe would have more than addressed the concerns highlighted by the Commission in the sensitive product area.

"In any event, we believe that the Commission's predictions for the growth of PET use in this area are entirely unfounded."

Tetra Laval wanted to buy Sidel to bolster its position in plastic bottle packaging. It is thought that Tetra could sell off some plastic packaging equipment operations.
