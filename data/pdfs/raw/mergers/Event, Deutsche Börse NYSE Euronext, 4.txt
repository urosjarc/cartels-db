BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission issued a verdict Wednesday saying no to the proposed merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext.

According to a statement by the Commission, the proposed  merger "would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in the area of  European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges".
"The two exchanges control more than 90 percent of global trade in these products," it added.
The Commission said if the merger went ahead, it would be very difficult for newcomers to enter the market. Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said :"The merger between
Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives
worldwide."

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns," Almunia added.

Given the ongoing global financial turmoil, the European Commission has of late issued stricter regulation on the trading of financial derivatives. Enditem

BERLIN - Germany's Deutsche Boerse says the European Commission is to block its planned  merger with stock market operator NYSE Euronext.

Deutsche Boerse AG said in a statement Wednesday that the  European Union's executive body is prohibiting the merger because it found it to be inadmissible under competition law.

The German exchange said nearly a year ago that it was looking to buy NYSE Euronext for $10 billion, creating the world's largest exchange operator.
NYSE Euronext owns bourses in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, in addition to New York. (The Associated Press)

According to a research report released today by Goldman Sachs, the potential  merger between Deutsche         Boerse (FRA: DB1) and  NYSE Euronext (NYSE: NYX) is no longer a possibly as it has been rejected by the European Commission.

Goldman Sachs explains further, “This morning the European Commission officially rejected the merger between Deutsche Boerse (DB1) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) owing to competitive concerns around combining Liffe Europe, NYX's European derivatives business, with Eurex. NYX released a statement saying it would be resuming a $550 mn share repurchase immediately following the 4Q conference call on February 10 and that it was prepared to move forward with the standalone strategy it had been pursuing prior to the deal announcement
last February, including new initiatives like NYSE Liffe US, maximizing its EU clearing strategy, and its AMEX joint venture for options.”
NYSE Euronext closed yesterday at $26.56. Document BNZNGA0020120201e821000bl

CNN International: Quest Means Business

MAX FOSTER, HOST: A flurry of Facebook activity as the social network gets set to connect with investors.
"We will end this journey with fewer people," says the CEO of American Airlines, 10,000 jobs will go just in the
US.
And a fight to the finish. An Olympic fencer shows us his world at work. I'm Max Foster, this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.
Well, hello to you. We'll bring you the Facebook story in just a moment. We're also bringing you the latest on what is turning out to be a tragedy in Egypt. Riots after a football match on Wednesday in Port Said have killed at least
25 people, according to Egypt's health minister.
State TV also said roughly 100 people have been injured. More on that as we get it. It's just coming in now.

The company that makes lots of private things public may be about to go public itself. Reports say the world's top social network will file for a share listing in New York as early as today, potentially raising between $5 billion and
$10 billion. That would make it one of the biggest IPOs in US history. Reports say Morgan Stanley has been chosen to underwrite the deal.

CNN's Maggie Lake joins us now, live from New York. I'm baffled about the valuation, but I'm sure you're going to explain it, Maggie.

MAGGIE LAKE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's the big debate, isn't it, Max? You're right. These are staggering numbers, $5 billion to $10 billion raised would absolutely dwarf Google when it went public. We consider that a real benchmark.
They could be valued at the end of this thing between $75 billion and $100 billion, bigger than Disney, bigger than
General Motors, and all for a company that didn't exist just a few years ago.

As you said, this is not -- there's a little confusion about this. They're not going public, they are beginning the official process. So, the clock starts ticking once they make this filing, and then, we would expect them to go to market or debut sometime in the spring.

We've been waiting all day for this. There have been so many rumors, there's so much anticipation. It hasn't actually happened yet. Maybe now that it happens after the close of trade here in the US, we're keeping a close eye on it.

But what's important about this is that we're going to get our first detailed look at the financials of this company. It's a very private, secretive company. How much money do they actually make? Right now, it's only been guesstimates.

And how do they make that money? Is it from advertising? How much of it is from third-party vendors and games that people play on Facebook, the cut they get from that? This is very important information as analysts and investors try to decide, is it a good buy?

MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: All of your stories --

Page 13 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
LAKE (voice-over): Call it Mark Zuckerberg's most important status update ever. His eight-year-old company is looking to friend Wall Street with the largest internet IPO on record. But will Wall Street like what it sees?

LAKE (on camera): Facebook claims to have 800 million users. They're on it at home, they're on it at coffee shops like this one in New York City. It's that kind of popularity that has so many people so excited about Facebook's upcoming IPO.

NATE WESTHEIMER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NEW YORK TECH MEETUP: I think this is a company that is smart enough to figure out in the long run how to really turn their scale into a lot of profit.
LAKE (voice-over): Nate Westheimer is a social networking entrepreneur based in New York. He says the
Facebook growth story is still in its early days.

WESTHEIMER: What I think is exciting about Facebook is the fact that they haven't really pushed the gas on driving revenue. They're doing pretty traditional ads right now. They know that they can try new things and they can really try to push it harder, and they're not yet. And they're still making billions of dollars of revenue.

LAKE: Ad revenue growth at Facebook has been impressive. In 2010, the company took in $1.8 billion. That revenue doubled to just under $4 billion last year. And this year, it's expected to hit $6 billion.
Even so, skeptics say Facebook stock is just not worth the risk.

DAVID DIETZE, POINT VIEW WEALTH MANAGEMENT: There's going to be a lot of advertisers that are already there, and more advertising is going to come. But the question is, of course, whether that can grow sufficiently in order to justify paying 50 times next year's earnings.
LAKE (on camera): What do you think, what are you telling clients?
DIETZE: Yes, well, I think it's too much. I mean, here's one of the problems, it's the law of large numbers. The
800 million people on the 7- billion-person globe here that really like Facebook are already there.

Of course, Facebook would come back and tell you, they've got all sorts of potential for data mining, so there's more than advertisement that can be done. You learn about all these users, that could be sold to all sorts of companies. But of course, that's going to raise all sorts of privacy concerns.

LAKE (voice-over): Indeed, privacy remains a huge concern for some on Facebook. They fear the company might try to sell their information to boost profits, despite Facebook's insistence that users have control over how their information is shared.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is always difficult to tell what they're doing with our information. It makes me a bit uneasy. But there's not really an alternative social networking space.

LAKE: It's a critical mass of users that competitors like Google Plus have yet to duplicate. Still, even some die-hard fans say they'll think twice before buying a share of Facebook.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'd like to see what happens with it. I'd like to see what the reaction is initially at first. (END VIDEOTAPE)
LAKE: It's interesting, Max, in this conversation, you have to point out the ghosts in the room. So many people burn, so many people remember the dot-com bust, getting sucked into the euphoria and get left holding the bag.

But there are also all those people who remember missing out on Google when it priced at $85 a share, and it's trading at $580 a share. So, all of that in the room when you talk about whether Facebook's a good buy.

FOSTER: OK, Maggie, thank you very much, indeed, for that. It's going to be a fascinating flotation when it does happen.

Now, shares in Amazon are sliding after it warned it might lose money this quarter. The world's largest internet retailer made a pretty ambivalent forecast, saying it might make $100 million or lose up to $200 million.

For the quarter just gone, Amazon earned $177 million, more than double what analysts had expected. Revenue came in below forecasts at just less than $17.5 billion.

Now, Chrysler is having a much better day today. It's just had its first profitable year since it endured a government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009. The car maker made $183 million in 2011, compared with a $652 million loss the year before, and it says profits could soar to $1.5 billion this year, with revenue up 18 percent.

CNN's Felicia Taylor is at the New York Stock Exchange, and she joins me, now. So, how is it unfolding this earnings season?

FELICIA TAYLOR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, again, it's sort of this kind of mixed bag that we've been seeing pretty much all throughout the earnings season. Amazon stock is down about 8.33 percent right now. It was down as much as 11 percent. This was a big disappointment for the Street. A lot of the previous reports, they've been very good, so this was enormously disappointing.

As you mentioned, the online retailer reporting a 57 percent decline in quarterly earnings, and sales also missed estimates.

Many analysts say that the stock has been overvalued, that it was due for some kind of a steep sell off, but this is more than that. Besides the softness in Europe, though, the company says its Kindle, even at the cut- rate prices that it's got, isn't selling fast enough. And that free- shipping promotion that it tried to launch, that hasn't really been taking off. It's been pretty slow, actually.

The world's largest internet retailer also had less revenue from the video game market and, like I said, pretty disappointing, and one analyst now even gives it a sell recommendation. The concern here is that this could be the start of continued slow growth for the company. Even its forward guidance for the first quarter was 5 percent below estimates.

However, let's go to the upside. Things are looking good at Chrysler. It's making a nice turnaround. The car company reported a fourth quarter and full year profit. Higher sales of Jeep, which is quite well-known, and other new cars pushed Chrysler to its first annual net income since 2005.

Global sales rose 22 percent, and they were even stronger in the United States, they were up about 26 percent. So, it has now reversed its loss that it had in 2010. As you probably know, Max, Chrysler is privately held with Fiat holding the majority stake. The company, as you mentioned, filed for bankruptcy back in 2009.

The company does say that things are going to get even better this year, with revenue increasing by about 18 percent. The CEO says he's got all the elements in place, even with a sluggish economy, which is expected, and the company is running ahead of its recovery plan.

Chrysler has spent the last couple of years basically overhauling its product line, like the Dodge Dart, and developing new cars and trucks, and obviously, that's a strategy that seems to be paying off as people are turning, once again, to buy a Chrysler. Max?

FOSTER: And the big deal, we've been talking about it for a year, haven't we? It was a -- I think it was a year, wasn't it? What happened? Why is it off the books now?
TAYLOR: Yes, basically, this is that deal that possibly could have happened between the NYSE Euronext and
Deutsche Boerse. It was worth about $17 billion, and it's just not going to happen.

The European Commission says that the deal would have stifled competition and created a virtual monopoly on derivatives trading, which clearly the marketplace doesn't want to see. The NYSE says it strongly disagrees with the EC's decision, but is now in discussions with Deutsche Boerse to terminate the merger agreement.

Instead, the NYSE Euronext will repurchase shares and try to boost investor value. The shares of the NYSE are little changed on this news, and that's pretty much, Max, because this has already been priced into the marketplace.

We've heard about this for a few days, now, and so it's not really surprising to traders that this has been taken off the table. However, initially, everybody thought it was kind of a done deal. So --

FOSTER: Felicia, thank you very much, indeed, for that. We're going to leave it there, because we want to bring you an update on this tragedy unfolding in Egypt. Riots following a football match there. State TV now reporting
40 people have been killed. The number is rising rapidly minute by minute. Also, state TV saying about 100 people have been injured.


Page 15 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
These are the latest pictures we've got from state TV in Egypt, and we now understand, you can't see it in this pictures, but that stadium is actually on fire. Port Said is where we're getting pictures from on this.

It was a football match, 100 people injured, 40 people dead, but that number's escalating as we speak. We're trying to confirm all the details from our own sources, but state TV currently running the story and the pictures, so we're bringing you what we can.

We're going to have more on this in just a moment, and also when we come back, this is the new face of the top of Sony. The troubled company braces for more losses. We'll ask if the new boss can turn things around.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: State TV in Egypt reporting that following these riots, 40 people have died, and the figure really is rising every minute, so we're trying to keep on top of this for you. We're going to speak to a reporter on the ground in
the coming moments, so do stay tuned.

This was a football match in Port Said, and after the match completed, everyone, as you can see, went onto the pitch and started rioting. But this was early in the process.

We understand that actually the stadium's currently on fire and all sorts of missiles are being thrown around, rocks and sticks, we're told, but we're going to get the latest from a reporter on the ground for you as soon as we can get in touch with him.

Sony, meanwhile, is getting a new boss as it tries to turn its back on years of losses. Kazu Hirai, Sony's executive deputy president, will become president and CEO. He'll take over from Howard Stringer, who moves to the board.

The announcement comes a day before Sony reports earnings. It had -- it has already said it expects to make a full year loss. That would be its fourth in a row. CNN's Kyung Lah shows us why the new chief faces a daunting challenge.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (APPLAUSE)
KYUNG LAH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Holding up the new PlayStation, facing public scrutiny about Sony network security lapses, Kazu Hirai was the face of Sony management long before the announcement, but it is now official.
The Japanese native is moving up from executive deputy president to chief executive, taking over the reins from
Welsh-born Howard Stringer.

BEN COLLETT, HEAD OF JAPANESE EQUITIES, LOUIS CAPITAL MARKETS: It's been a very unsuccessful tenure. I think the ingrained culture in Sony is such that he has been unable to make the changes that he needed to make, and I don't think he's got the energy for it anymore. So, I think a try and a fail is probably the way we'd describe it.
LAH: Stringer arrived with high hopes in 2005, with a belief that a Western leader would turn around an aging
Japanese company. But the challenges were massive, and his tenure exhausting.

Sony is losing the battle with Samsung in the TV business, now eight years in the red. In gaming, despite its success with PlayStation, Sony continued to lag behind Nintendo. But perhaps most troubling, it failed to do what Apple managed with ease, create innovative products consumers love.

Then last year's tsunami and soaring yen plunged Sony into a fourth consecutive year of losses. Analysts widely say Sony doesn't just need to restructure, it must be completely torn apart and rebuilt, and there's little hope a new leader will manage to get that tough job done.

COLLETT: The question is, will he be able to effect change at -- at the aging dinosaur that Sony is, a once very proud symbol of Japanese innovation, and now, really, a struggling shadow of its former self.

LAH (on camera): Hirai's background is in music and gaming, not in the TV and gadgets, where Sony needs the most help. So even before he steps into his new job in April, analysts already fear he may be in over his head.

FOSTER: We're hearing now from Reuters that 50 people are dead following soccer riots in Egypt. We're going to join Mohamed Fahmy, he joins us on the line from Cairo. What more can you tell us? What on Earth has happened?

MOHAMED FAHMY, JOURNALIST (via telephone): Well, it's -- it's breaking news, and the fact that two soccer matches going on today between Al-Ahly, which is a leading football team, and Port Said in Port Said stadium, and what we're seeing is an unprecedented situation where thousands of fans just stormed onto the field, and there has been clashes between the two sides.

We spoke to the Ministry of Health, and we know that in Port Said and Al-Ahly, there's 25 people who have died and hundreds injured, and the injuries are because of concussions and deep cuts. And it seems that the situation is unfolding, this is the information we have so far.

At the same time, there is also another situation in Cairo Stadium between Al-Zamalek club and Al-Ismailiya, where there's a huge fire as we speak, now, and it seems that more people have died. The total of these is -- so far is 50, according to the Health Ministry. Max?

FOSTER: In terms of the two separate matches, so you're saying that one stadium's on fire, but the pictures we're looking at now are at a different match, Port Said, early pictures of everyone getting on the pitch. But obviously, then it turned to riots, yes?

FAHMY: Yes. What we're hearing, and it's not confirmed yet, is that the crowd -- the gate that's separating the crowds from the stadium was somehow opened or maybe it has been because there are so many fans have stormed onto the field, and yes, what we're looking at is Port Said and Al- Ahly.

There is presence of police, but it seems that there was not as much interference from the police. Of course, we know now on the political scene happening in Cairo, there has been a sort of a security vacuum lately, with several armed robberies happening in the past two days.

And the situation is a shocking situation to the public to see two soccer matches at the same time. It's -- it's a situation that's unfolding as we speak, Max.

FOSTER: A security official apparently told the Associated Press that the home team, Al-Masry, swarmed the field after they won 3-1. It's a very rare win, so it seems as though it started off as excitement and turned into something else.

FAHMY: Well, sir, we are not very clear if they stormed in due to excitement, but what we know so far is that yes, the team did win 3-1, the home team in Port Said, and with the situation is unfolding, as we see how it happened, we're trying to find out from the minister of interior what the situation -- what started all of this, that's the question. We are trying to get to see where this is going at the moment.

But it's also very suspicious that at the same time, there's also another situation unfolding in Cairo in another soccer game where the clashes are ongoing right now.

FOSTER: Yes, tell us what you can about that. How many injured or killed, or what figures have you got on that one, the Cairo match, not the match that we're watching on TV right now.

FAHMY: Well, the Cairo match, it's Cairo Stadium, it's the biggest stadium in Egypt, it's close -- the situation is unfolding. There's a fire ongoing there. The total of people injured or killed in that match is not specifically the information that I have right now, but we'll definitely be coming to you with more information the next bulletin.
FOSTER: That was a similar picture to what we're seeing right now, as in fans storming the pitch?
FAHMY: Yes, sir, it's similar, but not to that extent. What I'm seeing and hearing is the fire in the background, but I
do have better information, but yes, there is some sort of riot, clashes at that -- there, over there at that match,
too, sir.

FOSTER: OK, Mohamed, thank you very much, indeed, for that. We can also speak to James Montague. He's author of "When Friday Comes," James Montague, a book about soccer in the Middle East.

I mean, is there -- what's the context here to the sort of sense, the feeling in these stadiums? What can you tell us?

Page 17 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JAMES MONTAGUE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Well, Max, the problem of violence in Egyptian soccer has really risen since the revolution. You have to remember that a lot of the soccer ultras, the groups that organize themselves and sing at the football grounds, and they're very good at anti-government.

And there'll be large clashes between the fans and the police, and also between sets of fans, especially within Cairo, where you have Al-Ahly, one of the teams involved today, pretty much the biggest team in Africa, against Al-Zamalek. And outside, there'd be a lot of violence.
I mean, nothing seen before on this scale, but when these football ultras are on the front lines fighting against
Mubarak and against the regime --
FOSTER: But which stadium? There are two --

MONTAGUE: -- are stage four. It was kind of a security vacuum in a lot of the -- in the football stadiums, and there was a huge rise in violence, clashes between teams and clashes with the police, as well, and you'll see, it's pointed at these groups and how they were creating trouble and division within society.

And obviously, now, what's happened is the security vacuum is such that they say, well, we don't know what this is. When we look at Al-Masry and Al-Ahly's a particularly fierce start compared to Zamalek or Al-Ahly, the reason it's maybe another soccer team within Egypt.

So, very much the context here is a rising violence within soccer, so the authorities really couldn't -- haven't been able to get a grip on it.
FOSTER: I'm slightly -- we've got two different stadiums involved in the story tonight, James. There's one in
Cairo, where we're told there's a fire --
MONTAGUE: Yes.
FOSTER: -- so I'm assuming that's what we're seeing right now. And then, there's the other one in Port Said. And
Mohamed -- yes, these are the -- I can confirm that these are the pictures from Cairo, the stadium that's alight.

And Mohamed is suggesting there's some sort of suspicion that two similar events that have happened at the same time on the same night. I mean, what could be linking them?

MONTAGUE: Well, there is obviously -- there has been a lot of organized soccer violence against the state and against the institutions of state over the past -- really, since 2007. So, it's too early to say whether that is part of this, whether groups have got together.

We saw the ultra groups of Al-Zamalek and Al-Ahly, for instance, coming together during the revolution and protesting to sit together on Tahrir Square. One of the ultras told me, "We taught the rest of the people of Tahrir Square how to throw bricks."

They were very much -- they're very well organized, very articulate, very political. But also, they would use violence to -- if it felt to further their own political ends.

So, it's not unheard of to have organized violence between football clubs, but something on this scale has never been seen before. There has been deaths in Egyptian football in the past. Tensions and passions run higher here than almost anywhere else in the world when it comes to soccer and the interjection between soccer and football.
So -- but like I said, nothing has been seen like this before.

FOSTER: And in terms of the Port Said match, as we understand it, the home team had a surprising win, and they're the ones, according to some witnesses on the ground, that stormed the pitch in the first place. So, it could simply have been excitement gone wrong, right?

MONTAGUE: It -- it could have been, it could well have been that. You've got to remember, Al-Ahly have been one of the most successful clubs ever in African football. Much of the national team have come from them. But also, they were closely linked to the regime. Mubarak was apparently a huge Al-Ahly fan.

So, they rarely lose the title, they rarely lose matches, they once held the world record for the longest-run number of unbeaten games in a row. So, it would be a cause, a huge cause for celebration for a smaller team to beat
Al-Ahly.


Page 18 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So, this could just be a terrible, terrible tragedy that's befallen Egyptian football, much like Hillsborough, England in the 1990s -- in 1989. So, it could just be a tragic accident.

FOSTER: Absolutely. You refer to UK matches, 80s perhaps early 90s, and often violence associated with those. But how often do we see violence on African pitches?

MONTAGUE: Well, certainly in terms of the Egyptian context, it has been -- it has been something that's been rising over the past year, and there have been deaths in Egyptian football.

And you've got to remember, you only have to look back to 2009, some of the things that you saw when Egypt played Algeria in a very heated World Cup qualifier, when there were riots outside the grounds.

And I was there personally to see that -- a week of the kind of nationalism, the rhetoric being ratcheted up in the press, and then coming out in this huge anti-Algerian riot and protests and violence. And even the team itself was attacked when the team bus arrived.

So, there is this undercurrent, partially due to the police being heavy-handed with the fans in the first place. And now, kind of in the -- in the vacuum that's come after the revolution -- and there may be a feeling of payback, but that's something that's certainly been happening over the past 12 months.

But like I said, this -- we don't know whether it's just a coincidence it's happening at two places at the same time, but when there's no information and it's -- you can't --

FOSTER: Yes. I can give you one bit of extra information we've had from Reuters whilst you've been speaking. According to Egyptian television, they've been showing these -- if we can bring them up -- the pictures of the fire at the Cairo Stadium, which is separate from the Port Said ones we've got there. But we'll show you those pictures -- oh, we can't bring them right now, but there's a separate stadium fire.
Apparently, James, there was -- the referee canceled a match between the teams Zamalek and Ismailiya. So -- MONTAGUE: Yes.
FOSTER: Does that add anything to the picture?

MONTAGUE: Well, they're certainly two of the -- two of the other big sides in Egyptian football, and there's always heated -- the three big teams in Egypt, Al-Ahly, Zamalek, Ismailiya, and when they play each other, the stadiums are full, the tensions are high, and there's always -- there's always --
And each has very different principle identity and each has fans that are extremely passionate and well
organized. So, normally when you'd see sides at grounds or players being thrown, it's not unheard of, even, some
matches to be canceled in Egypt because of crowd violence. So, that isn't that much of a surprise to see.
Whether it's a coincidence, of course, or whether it's organized, then that takes it into a different level. FOSTER: James, the latest figure we've just got from Reuters, 73 people killed in Egyptian football violence. I
mean, this is on a whole new level, now, right?

MONTAGUE: Yes. I mean, actually -- that's unbelievable. That's -- many of these guys I've met and known over the past year, so I'm going to have to make some phone calls and see if they're OK, but that's -- that's awful.

FOSTER: Yes, we wish them well, but in terms of this sort of stadium security, I mean, we've had situations in Hillsborough that you've referred to, and there were problems with the pitch, weren't there? When things did kick off, as it were, they couldn't get out and it sort of concentrated the problem. Is that potential on these sorts of stadiums?

Because it does seem as though they're freely wandering around the pitch, which would at least sort of relieve the pressure on the crowd.

MONTAGUE: Yes, these are old stadiums. Everybody stands during football matches. You buy a ticket, and usually there's another 30,000 people than the capacity allows. So, we're not talking about European levels of soccer safety, here. We're talking very much developing world soccer stadiums, as it would have been in England in the 50s or 60s.



Page 19 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Crowd numbers hugely, vastly overrate, especially for the big matches, and especially for a match which may lead -- it would be absolutely huge. They have tensions often. And extremely heavy-handed security, as well.

In the past, the games I've been to have had almost more security officers than fans there. But like I said, after the revolution, there has been this -- a security vacuum, and in that vacuum, that's when a lot more pitch invasions, a lot more riots, a lot more fights between fans and fights with whatever authorities have been policing it, have been taking place.
FOSTER: An accident waiting to happen?

MONTAGUE: I wouldn't go that far, but I -- certainly you can see that the violence was rising every month, and -- it's very difficult, since there's a lack of trust between, obviously, the police coming back after the revolution and coming back to police these sort of matches, and the fans who see them very much as the same -- the same police force from before Mubarak. Obviously with just different badges on.

So, it was a problem the people were discussing, that whether -- there was already an Olympic tournament had been -- for qualification for the Olympics in 2012 which was canceled, it was supposed to be held in Egypt. They were talking about canceling the league last season because of the football violence. One team got heavily fined because of a big pitch invasion in the African Champions League.

So, these -- I think you could never predict an event where 78 people would die, but certainly this was a huge cause for concern with Egyptian football. The authorities are trying to get a handle of it, and it was certainly something that was rising month by month.

FOSTER: OK, James, thank you very much indeed, for that recap. Basically we've got -- we're getting escalating figures on the number killed in riots. There's some confusion here, simply because there seems to be two different incidents.

The pictures you're looking at now, from Port Said, when a riot broke out after the end of the match. The home team did well and apparently went on to the match, on to the pitch first, and that turned into riots. We understand from Reuters, 73 people killed, but that figure's going up all the time, and more than 100 injured.

There's a separate incident at a stadium in Cairo, where there's a fire, and there also seem to be injuries, but there's a lot less information coming out from there. But a major incident unfolding in Egyptian football tonight. We'll bring you more in a moment.
(MUSIC PLAYING) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
FOSTER: We're taking you to Egypt. We've got some breaking news. After a football match in Port Said, the home team and presumed other home team fans and other fans entered the pitch, and there have been riots there, and our sources tell us 53 people were killed there. Other agencies are reporting more, but the figures are going up all the time.

The last half hour, going up every minute, so major incident unfolding at Port Said, where fans stormed the pitch and riots unfolded. We've got a parallel incident at a stadium in Cairo, where a fire has broken out, but we have much less information on that.
The information we're getting mainly is from Port Said, a major incident unfolding after a football match. And it
was after the end of the football match, and the home team did particularly well in that. And some suggestion that
they got over excited, hit in the pitch (ph) and riots followed. We're going to keep you updated on this as soon as
fresh information comes in.

Meanwhile, American Airlines says it plans to cut 13,000 jobs, 15 percent of its workforce. Its parent group, AMR, which filed bankruptcy protection in November, says it needs a more competitive labor structure.
James Little is president of the Transport Workers International Union of America. He joins us on the phone from
Dallas in Texas.

Thank you so much for joining us. I know you've been involved with -- in talks in the last couple of hours with the company. What's come out of them?


Page 20 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
JAMES LITTLE, PRESIDENT, TRANSPORT WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF AMERICA: Well, we -- right now we're just finished having a business meeting with admin, which they laid out portions of their business plan. And as you directly said, we've -- we're -- they're looking at losing between at least 13,000 to 15,000 jobs within our groups.

You know, we represent -- that's about two-thirds of our workforce. In the next hour or so, we're supposed to meet with them again, where they're going to break it down with our seven contract groups, and we'll hear specifically what they're looking for.

One of the main items that they're -- they tell them is that they're going to terminate the pension plans, which, you know, that's a major problem for a lot of people. I mean, obviously, it's an obligation going to affect real people with real lives.

FOSTER: Initially, we thought it was 10,000 jobs, but you're saying it could be up to 15,000, so that figure's gone up in the last couple of hours.

LITTLE: No, it's actually between 13,000 and 15,000. We're going to get the actual numbers later on this afternoon, as I said, right now the only thing we've seen so far is their business plan and what they're looking to do to go forward. And that part of that plan calls for a major restructuring of our contracts and their pension obligations.

One of the biggest problems I have with their cutting the jobs is the safety aspects of it, because we represent a large number.

We do 90 percent of our aircraft maintenance in house, and you know, we have a lot of efficiencies in place, and I'm not quite sure how that's all going to shake out and to how -- what degree that's going to impact the workforce. And also the areas where we have large groups of people. I mean, it's going to affect the community as well. It's not just our members (inaudible) that that --
FOSTER: Yes, they really are immense figures. So what are you going to advise your members to do?

LITTLE: Well, right now what we've said is that let's get the -- let's get information. Let's find out what the entire -- look for a $1.25 billion in savings, and going to have to spend some time analyzing what that is, and we're certainly going to have to spend a little time navigating through American's figures to make sure that we agree with the numbers that are -- that are coming forward.

And we're supposed to do that over the next two days with some of our investment bankers and some of our economists and -- who we have on hand and retain. So that's a series of events that's going to place over the next couple of days.

But this is -- this is part of a pretrial process that we're -- they're hoping that we can reach consensual agreements. But the ask (ph) is very deep, as you -- as you -- as you just heard, 15,000 potential employees hitting the street, and that's an -- also impacting their families as well. So with that, and -- I lost him (ph).
FOSTER: OK. We'll leave it there. James Little, president of the Transport Workers International Union of
America, has been in meetings with American Airlines. Thank you very much for joining us, and it could be up to
15,000 jobs we're hearing now, going there. It was initially 10,000, but between 13,000 and 15,000.

FOSTER: The U.S. Republican presidential hopefuls are taking their campaign to Nevada today. Mitt Romney
and Newt Gingrich will be drumming up support in the state ahead of its caucus on Saturday. Romney won a solid
victory in Florida on Tuesday, bolstering his status as front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination from
Tampa, Florida. Sandra Endo (ph) looks at what to expect next.

SANDRA ENDO, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, CNN NEWSOURCE (voice-over): Mitt Romney believes his decisive victory Tuesday night in Florida, a state hit hard by the recession, is evidence he's the candidate to best address the country's top concern this election season.

FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: People care about the economy, and they understand that that's been my background. They really don't think that people who spent their entire life working in Washington are prepared to take on the problem of getting our economy strong again.

ENDO (voice-over): In an interview with CNN, Romney said he's focused on the middle class, not the very rich or the very poor.

ROMNEY: We have food stamps, we have Medicaid, we have housing vouchers, we have programs to help the poor. But the middle income Americans, they're the folks that are really struggling right now.

ENDO (voice-over): Despite his second place finish in Florida, Newt Gingrich showed no sign of backing down Tuesday night. He didn't call Romney to congratulate him, and insisted he will take his fight for the nomination to the Republican Convention in August.

FORMER REP. NEWT GINGRICH, R-GA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to have people power defeat money power in the next six months.

ENDO (voice-over): Ron Paul and Rick Santorum are also staying in, but Romney is expected to do well in the major contest ahead. So his opponents could be facing an uphill battle.
ENDO: Romney will be campaigning in Minnesota later this afternoon, and will finish the night up with a rally in
Las Vegas. Gingrich will also be stumping in Nevada. Reporting from Tampa, I'm Sandra Endo.

FOSTER: We're getting reports of at least 68 people have died in riots over a football match in Egypt. That's from Egypt's health ministry. Our figure, 68, is going up all the time. Egypt state TV says hundreds of people have also been injured in a pitch invasion in the city of Port Said. We'll keep looking across (ph) this for you.

Also, when we come back, as Britain's top naval destroyer prepares to set sail for the Falklands, Prince William comes in for some stick, 30 years after the Falklands War, the war of words is heating up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: At least 68 people die in riots following this pitch storming in Egypt. That's from the Egyptian health ministry, that figure. This are pictures from Port Said. We're also hearing Egypt football federation, not surprisingly, really, indefinitely delaying premier league matches following soccer violence. That's according to state TV. But 68 people have been confirmed dead.

There have been dozens and dozens of injuries as well, so we do expect that figure to rise, but we're bringing you the accurate figure as it comes in. Reuters reporting the figure's already higher; in fact, more than 70, but we're bringing you the confirmed figures from the health ministry to you. We're going to bring you more on this as we
get it.

For your information, there's another bizarrely stadium incident in Cairo, also in Egypt, of course, where there's a fire following a canceled match, but we're not sure about the violence there just yet. The main violence appears to be in Port Said.

Now a new source of tension is sending a ripple through the waters of the Falkland Islands, or Las Malvinas. Britain is set to boost its naval presence in the region with the arrival of its most powerful warship and the deployment of one of its most visible royals, the Duke of Cambridge.

Now Royal Navy says it's a routine deployment. The ship (ph) believes Argentina is slamming the mission, dubbing Prince William, "William the Conqueror." We asked the U.K.'s foreign office minister for Latin America, Jeremy Browne, what he thinks of Argentina's reaction.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JEREMY BROWNE, BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE: Well, I think they're putting that in very emotive terms. Let me put it in less emotive terms, is that in addition to being the second in line to the throne of the United Kingdom, he's also a serving person in the -- in the -- in the search and rescue team in the forces. So he wears the same
uniform as other people. He performs the same duties as other people.



Page 22 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That, if you like, is his day-to-day job. And he is doing his day-to- day job. We are not making a particular point of sending him to one part of the world rather than another part of the world. He is being treated in the same way that another person in that job would be treating, working alongside the other people he works alongside in a entirely routine matter.

And he will be in the Falkland Islands, doing routine jobs, in line with his core task of being a search and rescue pilot, rather than being there because he is second in line to the throne.

FOSTER: But you talk about the Argentinean rhetoric, and now David Cameron is accusing them of colonialism. So they're saying it's entirely the other way around. They're feeling that David Cameron's being provocative.

BROWNE: Well, I think he was replying to a -- to a charge which is leveled often by the Argentinians, which is that Britain is behaving in a colonial manner. I don't think we're doing anything of the sort. What we are saying is that the Falkland Islanders have the right to self- determination, just as we believe other people, including actually
here within the United Kingdom.

I mean, there is a debate going on at the moment about a referendum in Scotland, where the people who live in Scotland will have the right to self-determine themselves, about whether they remain within the United Kingdom. That's completely consensus, all the political parties in Britain are in favor of that referendum taking place in Scotland. So there we go.

I mean, the idea that Britain is in some way keen to keep people against their will, to enforce a destiny upon people that they don't wish to have, is clearly ridiculous. And the people in the Falkland Islands can decide for themselves their own future and how they live. And they are experiencing a lot of pressure from the Argentinians.

The Argentinians are attempting to enforce an economic blockade on the Falkland Islands. And you've got to look at it for what it is. I mean, here you have Argentina, is a country with 40 million people. It's a G-20 country. It's a big, powerful country.

And there's the Falkland Islands, with 21/2 thousand people. And the big country with 40 million people is trying to gang up with other countries to try and -- to try and enforce an economic blockade on 21/2 thousand people, who just want to live their own lives on these islands, and in some cases, have lived there up to nine generations.
So the point I think the prime minister was making is that if you look at it for what it is, you've got 21/2 thousand
Falkland Islanders, who want to have the right to self-determination, just as other people, right around the world.
They want to live their lives free from interference and you have a very big, powerful country in Argentina, which
is enforcing an economic blockade as best as they can against them. And in those terms, I think the context of his
remarks can be understood.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
FOSTER: Foreign Office minister, there, Jeremy Browne, speaking to me earlier.

We're getting reports of at least 73 people dying in riots over a football match in Egypt. The figures are going up all the time. And that's the figure from the health ministry, and they've been coming up with new figures over the hour. So we expect it go up. There have been injuries, many injuries as we understand it.

Port Said is the location of the stadium you see right now. After the game, fans stormed the pitch, some out of excitement for a great result for them, but it obviously turned into something much more serious. And the figures are going up all the time. Premier league matches in the country have all been canceled for the foreseeable future.

And we also understand there will be an emergency parliamentary session now in Egypt tomorrow, but the focus right now is on calming things down and getting those injured help. And we're getting you the figures as we get them, but 73 -- it's gone up to 73 from about 25 within half an hour. So that gives you a sense of how this story is developing. More as it comes through to us.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

FOSTER: Football match ended, and this is what ensued. This is the early stages of a riot, a riot which has already claimed 73 lives, and those figures are going up, many, many more people have been injured, and the authorities are trying to do what they can. Security officials apparently were in the number of those killed.

Page 23 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
There's also a parallel incident in Cairo, a fire at a stadium that seems less serious in terms of injuries. There's the fire. That was -- that was sparked after a match was canceled. So whether these two incidents are linked, time will tell. But for the moment, it seems like a coincidence that two stadium have been caught up in mayhem tonight.

But in Port Said, certainly the picture where you see the crowds, this is Cairo. But in Port Said, certainly a major incident unfolding tonight. We'll bring you the information as we get it from the health ministry.

Car giant Renault and Nissan sees further growth in the emerging markets. CEO Carlos Ghosn told Richard, "You go where the growth is," in our special series of interviews from Davos, all this week, called "Davos Plus." Mr. Ghosn had plenty to tell us about compensation, transparency (inaudible). But before all of that, Richard asked
him just how grim he thinks 2012 could be, especially for the fragile Eurozone.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CARLOS GHOSN, CEO, NISSAN-RENAULT: Europe is going to be in contraction in 2012. You know, I would say not a severe contraction, -3 percent, particularly in the car market. But the rest of the world is going to be doing fine. U.S. going to be up, diverging markets going to be doing well. Even Japan's going to be doing well, because 2011 has been such a terrible year for Japan, it can only do better.
So I think 2012, at the end of the day, is not going to be such a bad year. RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: You're an optimist.
GHOSN: I am very realistic. I am very realistic. I'm very realistic, Richard. I'm looking at the trends already in January. I'm looking at all the facts and all the announcements which have been made. I think 2012 is going to be surprisingly better than what we think.
QUEST: They've been trying it for three years and haven't done it. GHOSN: Yes.
QUEST: Why are you optimistic that they can do it in 2012?

GHOSN: Well, you know, I was -- I'm not optimistic that they're going to do in 2012, but I want them to remove the uncertainty, you know, of even if we know that things are going to be mediocre, it's better that (inaudible) what's going to happen.

QUEST: All right. Let's talk about your company and what you -- and you're seeing. You are making a huge bet, aren't you, into emerging markets?
GHOSN: Yes.
QUEST: You're not -- you're not ignoring developed world, but you're shifting production and resources. GHOSN: True. We are -- we are because this is where the growth is taking place. You know, it's very simple.
When you take the forecast of the global car market in 2012 compared to 2011, we'll be adding 3 million more
cars, 75 million moving to 78 million.

Where the 3 million's coming from? One million additional in the United States, 1 million in China and 1 million from emerging market. So you have to go where the growth is. So we investing more in China. We're investing more into the emerging markets.
QUEST: Are you investing more in those bases at the expense -- ?

GHOSN: Not at all. It's additional capacity that we are adding, because we're increasing our market share and we want to really contribute to the growth of these markets.

QUEST: OK. In those markets, there is a growing middle class, there is a growing ability to buy, but what we are seeing globally is a growing inequality. You -- the one and 99. You must be concerned about that.

GHOSN: Yes. Well, you know, I'm concerned like anybody who is in a leadership position, that everything which is divisive at the level of society is not good.


Page 24 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So we need to, you know, first take this in consideration, explain more -- everything which is around the compensation (inaudible), because this about compensation policy, because from one side, you have to attract balance. From the other side, you have to make sure that you don't give the impression you are disconnected from the feeling of people.

QUEST: So when you select bonuses for yourself -- well, you don't, but I mean, the compensation committee does -- and your top executives, is your principle easy does it, not too much, don't fill your boats?

GHOSN: Well, you know, no, the principle is how are you going to explain it? I mean, I mean, first you're going to have to asses the performance of the company. You have to be fair to people bringing the contribution and making the performance of the company. But that's number one.

And second, whatever you're think you're being fair is how are you going to explain? How are you going to make it transparent, understood and accepted by the people inside the company and outside the company?
(END VIDEO CLIP)

FOSTER: We're getting reports of at least 68 people dying in riots over a football match in Egypt. It actually sparked in Port Said, just outside Port Said, just after the match. So after the match ended, fans raided the pitch and it turned into violence. And it's turning into some sort of major incident, it seems.

I've got a quote here from the Dempsey (ph) health minister describing it as the biggest disaster in Egypt's soccer history. And it certainly is turning into a big disaster in soccer history around the world right now, because the figures are going up all the time. We also have a parallel incident at a stadium in Cairo, where we can speak to Ben Wedeman.
Hi, Ben. What can you tell us about that incident?

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN REPORTER: Well, we understand that this is in the Nasser City neighborhood of Cairo, where apparently there was some sort of fire in a stadium. Now according to state radio, that fire has been put under control, and we don't have any information about casualties or fatalities in the case of the fire in Cairo at the stadium.

But certainly, there's no question about it, that what happened in Port Said this evening, when these Port Said football fans invaded the pitch, is no question, the worst case of football violence in Egyptian history.
And it is indicative of the security vacuum that has existed in Egypt since the revolution a year ago, that
happened. Since then, you've just not -- you haven't had the kind of security presence anywhere in Egypt, as was
the case before the revolution.

And therefore when you have situations like this, a large crowd of very enthusiastic young men, packed into a stadium, as occurred in Port Said, that it's not surprising that it can go out of control, as clearly it has, and this horrendous death toll at this football match -- Max?

FOSTER: In terms of the history of violence in football matches, is this something that has happened before, but not on this scale? Or is this completely out of the blue?

WEDEMAN: There's often been scuffles at football matches in Egypt. The Egyptians take their football very seriously. Everybody seems to identify themselves with one football team or another, and there are organized groups of fans known here as the Ultras, who oftentimes scuffle with opposing fans. But certainly not on this scale.

Usually, in the past, there was a fairly heavy security presence at these football matches to prevent this sort of violence from happening. But what has happened in the last year, Max, is that people have increasingly had less and less respect for the police, given the decade of police brutality here.

And so there's a very antagonistic attitude among many Egyptians, and certainly among young Egyptians, towards the police, to the extent that oftentimes the police will simply pull away because they know they are the focus of so much resentment and anger -- Max?

FOSTER: Ben, we've just got the latest figure from the health ministry -- 73. We can assume that's going to rise, because we've got these injuries as well, more than 100, according to Reuters.


Page 25 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WEDEMAN: Then that's certainly -- I'm sure that number will increase as well. Oftentimes when this sort of incident happens, when there's violence and disorder and chaos, it takes a very long time for the Egyptian authorities to often get the situation under control. So I'm afraid that we can expect the death toll and the number of injured to increase further as the evening wears on -- Max.

FOSTER: An emergency session of parliament being called tomorrow. I guess they'll decide what to discuss, once the, you know, the picture of this has unfolded.

WEDEMAN: Well, this would -- and that would be the third session that parliament has held since the opening last week, and but the question is, what can parliament do? Really, at the end of the day, the power in this country rests in the hands of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the military who took over after Hosni Mubarak resigned on the 11th of February, 2011.

And certainly one hears increasing criticism about the military's ability to run this country of 85 million people. And we'll probably hear more criticism from parliament when it meets tomorrow in this emergency session -- Max.
FOSTER: And, Ben, just very quickly, if you can, give us an update about what we know about what happened in
Egypt tonight.

WEDEMAN: Well, we understand that after the team from Port Said played the Al Ahly team, which is a Cairo team, a team that many people here in Cairo are wildly enthusiastic about, what happened was that the play, the fans of the Port Said team went into the pitch after the game was over, after Port Said beat the Al Ahly team, and soon thereafter, the precise details are still unclear, fighting broke out between the two sides. And here we have it, 73 dead, according to the deputy health minister, more than 180 injured.
In addition to that -- (CROSSTALK)
WEDEMAN: -- as I mentioned, there was this incident in Nasser City, which is a suburb of Cairo, where there was a fire in a stadium, and there have been --
FOSTER: Could I have a pen?
WEDEMAN: -- reportedly between fans there as well.

FOSTER: Ben Wedeman, thank you very much indeed. A major incident unfolding in Egypt tonight. We are going to continue with this coverage for you. Jim is going to join you after the break with the very latest on the tragedy in Egypt.

EU blocks  $10 billion Deutsche Boerse, NYSEmerger, citing  dominance in derivatives trading

BY GABRIELE STEINHAUSER AP

1 February 2012

BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the Deutsche Boerse's planned merger
with NYSE Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said it was ruling against the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 per cent of the trading in European derivatives _ complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.

It said that the combined company's dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

``The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide,'' the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
``These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive.''

The Commission's decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, which hoped combining their businesses would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

But it also underlines the profound transformation their businesses _ and financial markets as a whole _ have undergone over the past decade. Today, the value of outstanding derivatives contracts has surpassed by many times the value of traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext both managed to build highly profitable businesses out of this trend and today own Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges. A push from regulators across the globe to push more derivative trades onto exchanges to make the market more transparent has opened even bigger opportunities for established players.

To make the merger acceptable, the Commission wanted the companies to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or NYSE Euronext's Liffe _ something they refused.
``This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets,'' Deutsche Boerse Chief
Executive Reto Francioni said in a news conference in Frankfurt, Germany.

Francioni added that the decision will prevent the creation of a ``globally competitive'' European exchange group that would have helped strengthen the Commission's push for transparent and stable financial markets.
NYSE said in a statement that the two companies are now discussing terminating the merger agreement.

``While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on,'' NYSE Euronext Chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels said.

The Commission's decision did not come as a surprise as last month a competition case team recommended the merger should be blocked, based on the combined company's dominance in the trading of some of the most popular and liquid European derivatives.


Page 27 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the two exchanges argued that the vast majority of derivatives are traded directly between banks and other investors, or over-the-counter (OTC), rather than on exchanges, providing healthy competition in the overall market.

They also pointed to Chicago-based CME Group, which has a similar dominance over trading in key American derivatives.

But Almunia argued that neither the over-the-counter derivatives market nor CME Group could have been true competitors to a company owning both Eurex and Liffe.

He said derivatives based on U.S. indexes or interest rates traded on the CME were useless for investors trying to hedge against changes in their European equivalents. Over-the-counter trades, he argued, were riskier than exchange-based trades, eliminating then as an alternative to many companies.

Deutsche Boerse announced nearly a year ago that it was looking to buy NYSE Euronext for $10 billion. NYSE Euronext owns bourses in Paris, Lisbon, Brussels and Amsterdam, in addition to New York.
Juergen Baetz in Berlin and David McHugh in Fankfurt, Germany, contributed to this story.

EU blocks  Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronextmerger

Deutsche Welle
DEUEN
English
(c) 2012. Deutsche Welle.
EU antitrust authorities rejected plans of a tie-up between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext to become the world's largest stock market operator. The entity's near-monopoly in derivatives trading was found unacceptable.

The European Commission on Wednesday rejected the planned merger between Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse and New York's NYSE Euronext. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said the merger would have created a "near-monopoly" the European financial derivatives trade. "These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," Almunia said in a statement. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns." Deutsche Börse's takeover of its rival from across the Atlantic would have created a trading giant worth $17 billion (13.03 billion euros). The merger, which would have included stock exchanges in Frankfurt, New York, Lisbon, Paris and Amsterdam, would have controlled 90 percent of Europe's listed derivatives trade. Trans-Atlantic passions Concerned about the company's market position, Almunia demanded that Deutsche Börse should disinvest its Eurex derivatives arm. In addition, he wanted NYSE Euronext to sell its London-based futures exchange Liffe.
The exchanges, however, rejected the commissioner's demands, saying they would be prepared to sell off only a part of Liffe's derivatives business. Almunia, however, said the offer was "too small and not diversified enough to be viable on a standalone basis." In the United States, the deal also stirred a controversy as foreign shareholders would have owned 60 percent of the combined firm. The US Justice Department ruled in December that
Deutsche Börse would have to sell its 31.5 percent stake in Direct Edge Holdings - the fourth largest exchange operator in the United States. Analysts said the EU Commission's reservations about a tie-up were probably of a more political nature. "Europe feared ceding control and being dominated by the Americans," Christian Muschick, analyst at Silvia Quandt, told AFP news agency. If the merger would have been approved, the two exchanges could have benefitted from vast cost synergies and become more profitable. "It was the shareholders of NYSE Euronext who would have stood to gain more from the tie-up," LBBW analyst Martin Peter told AFP news agency, adding that Deutsche Börse was "better positioned" in the financial market than the Americans. The two exchanges can appeal the ruling at the EU courts in Luxembourg. But a legal battle - likely to take between one and two years - could destroy the merger once and for all after two previous attempts had already failed, analysts said.

"I'm frustrated by the outcome, but you can't fault the two companies for what they did," says Hoyle, who doesn't see much point in the exchanges fighting the decision in European courts.

6:44 (Dow Jones) The tumble in natural-gas prices helped result in utility and natural-gas transporter NiSource (NI) report lower-than-expected 4Q results. While gas-transportation and electricity revenue edged higher from a year earlier, it slumped 25% for gas distribution as volume slid 6.7% amid the warmer-than-expected temperatures during the fall, which has extended into the winter and helped result in record levels of natural-gas storage in the US. That pushed prices down to 10-year lows in January. NI shares, inactive premarket, fell 4.5% last month. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

6:33 (Dow Jones) US stock-index futures are strongly higher amid sharp gains in European equities on upbeat euro-zone economic data. PMI manufacturing data shows contraction in factory activity eased last month while China's manufacturing PMI which also beat expectations. The US read is due at 10am EST, data which follows a spade of disappointing economic figures that cast an early pall over US trading Tuesday that was ultimately overcome by the close. Also, ADP's read on January employment comes at 8:15 while the morning's earnings reports still include Hershey (HSY) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).

6:28 (Dow Jones) Investor reaction to Thermo Fisher's (TMO) 4Q results and 2012 view could well be a test case on whether investors in the current environment treasure earnings or revenue more. The instrument and equipment maker easily beat analysts' expectations for the bottom line in 4Q, setting a quarterly record, and gave an in-line 2012 view. But revenue last quarter fell notably short and this year's target is below consensus views as well. EPS has been getting a boost from margin gains and share buybacks, which totaled $1.3B last year; TMO has a near-$20B market cap. Shares, inactive premarket, climbed 18% last month.

6:21 (Dow Jones) Despite the slack demand for appliances, Whirlpool (WHR) proved the "Debby Downers" wrong with 4Q EPS that surprisingly rose and a much higher-than-anticipated profit view for 2012. The quarter's beat
was attributed to cost-cutting that helped North American earnings double as well as higher prices; they
overcame a 3% drop in shipments, in line with the industry's performance. WHR expects little, if any, US shipment
growth in 2012. But the company's bottom line is expected to improve markedly despite muted demand thanks to
the belt-tightening and price hikes. Shares, inactive premarket, jumped 14% in January but remain down 36%
from a year earlier. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:02 (Dow Jones) Hershey (HSY) is playing it cautious with its initial 2012 EPS target, projecting $2.99 to $3.13 excluding charges. That compares with a consensus view of $3.12 by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. As
4Q matched expectations and HSY announced a 10% dividend increase, volume rose a mere 0.4% globally. That could well be why HSY doesn't want to get too far ahead of itself on the outlook front, especially with the
economic climate in the US and Europe still uncertain. Meanwhile, HSY is feeling margin pressure from higher costs, fell 1.1% in January. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

"I'm frustrated by the outcome, but you can't fault the

HSY now sees 5-7% net-sales growth for the year and a 9-11% adjusted-EPS increase growth; the top end of the profit view is where the consensus estimate is. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

7:18 (Dow Jones) Big European banks would have saved an estimated EUR3B ($4B) in collateral costs upon completion and integration of Deutsche Boerse's (DB1.XE, DBOEF) proposed  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX), plus some savings from combined technology systems. That's nothing to sneeze at as Europe looks to lift capital requirements for banks. But they pushed back against the deal on concerns that uniting Europe's two biggest exchanges would create a titan with too much power to set trading fees, particularly for derivatives contracts linked to  European interest rates and stock indexes.(jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:16 (Dow Jones) Expect few tears to be shed in Frankfurt's trading community upon the official death certificate for hometown exchange operator Deutsche Boerse's (DBOEF) merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). Though Germany's financial hub was slated as co-headquarters of the merged entity, a common assumption was that power would consolidate in New York, and even a three-year guarantee on German jobs offered late in the process didn't dispel fears that layoffs would eventually come to the city that traces its financial heritage to medieval fairs in the 1500s.

7:27 (Dow Jones) CME's leaders are breathing a little easier this morning in the wake of the  EU nixing Deutsche Boerse's (DB1.XE, DBOEF) proposed  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). The combination would have effectively created a  EuropeanCME in terms of derivatives trading with the added star power of the Big Board in stocks and a roster of ties to Asian markets. The two will soldier on independently after a year spent on the failed deal, time CME has used building links to new markets like Ukraine. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:23 (Dow Jones) It's never nice to laugh at the misfortune of others, but some executives at Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) and ICE may sport grins Wednesday following the EU's prohibition of NYSE Euronext (NYX) merging with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) on antitrust grounds. A rival proposal by NDAQ and ICE to buy NYSE last spring met a relatively quick end when the US Justice Department deemed the potential combination of NDAQ and the Big Board a monopoly in share listings. That came after NYSE for weeks showed its suitors the cold shoulder, refusing to entertain their rival offer. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:21 (Dow Jones) Hackers cripple a third Brazilian bank web site in three days, with the banks seemingly unable to respond despite the ample warning. The latest victim is Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.BR). Its website has been off the air for about 10 minutes and follows day-long attacks on the websites of Itau Unibanco (ITUB, ITUB4.BR) on Monday and Banco Bradesco (BBD, BBDC3.BR) yesterday. The hackers aren't apparently doing any permanent damage, and aren't able to access customer data--but it's a huge inconvenience for any bank customers trying to use online services.

7:16 (Dow Jones) Expect few tears to be shed in Frankfurt's trading community upon the official death certificate for hometown exchange operator Deutsche Boerse's (DBOEF) merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). Though Germany's financial hub was slated as co-headquarters of the merged entity, a common assumption was that power would consolidate in New York, and even a three-year guarantee on German jobs offered late in the process didn't dispel fears that layoffs would eventually come to the city that traces its financial heritage to medieval fairs in the 1500s. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:15 (Dow Jones) Hershey's (HSY) is only a month into 2012, but wastes no time deviating to the upside from its long-term growth targets, which some analysts have panned as irrelevant since HSY keeps blowing through the mark. HSY now sees 5-7% net-sales growth for the year and a 9-11% adjusted-EPS increase growth; the top end of the profit view is where the consensus estimate is. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

7:08 (Dow Jones) NYSE Euronext's (NYX) board stuck behind CEO Duncan Niederauer throughout the sometimes-tumultuous Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) deal-wrangling, and observers don't expect any upheaval in the C suite in the aftermath of EU's knocking down of their proposed merger. The board and Niederauer stuck together throughout a leak of the deal plans a year ago, steadfastly refused to entertain unsolicited offer from Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) and ICE and remained unwilling to divest NYSE's prized futures exchange to appease EU antitrust regulators. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:02 (Dow Jones) Hershey (HSY) is playing it cautious with its initial 2012 EPS target, projecting $2.99 to $3.13 excluding charges. That compares with a consensus view of $3.12 by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. As

4Q matched expectations and HSY announced a 10% dividend increase, volume rose a mere 0.4% globally. That could well be why HSY doesn't want to get too far ahead of itself on the outlook front, especially with the
economic climate in the US and Europe still uncertain. Meanwhile, HSY is feeling margin pressure from higher costs, fell 1.1% in January. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

6:51 (Dow Jones) Hard luck, but it was worth a shot. That's the read of one NYSE Euronext (NYX) investor, Tim Hoyle of Haverford Investments, who held Big Board shares through the ups, downs and drama of the past year's merger dance with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF). "I'm frustrated by the outcome, but you can't fault the
two companies for what they did," says Hoyle, who doesn't see much point in the exchanges fighting the decision in European courts. "I'd rather the company get back to business." NYX is inactive premarket. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

6:44 (Dow Jones) The tumble in natural-gas prices helped result in utility and natural-gas transporter NiSource (NI) report lower-than-expected 4Q results. While gas-transportation and electricity revenue edged higher from a year earlier, it slumped 25% for gas distribution as volume slid 6.7% amid the warmer-than-expected temperatures during the fall, which has extended into the winter and helped result in record levels of natural-gas storage in the US. That pushed prices down to 10-year lows in January. NI shares, inactive premarket, fell 4.5% last month. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

6:33 (Dow Jones) US stock-index futures are strongly higher amid sharp gains in European equities on upbeat euro-zone economic data. PMI manufacturing data shows contraction in factory activity eased last month while China's manufacturing PMI which also beat expectations. The US read is due at 10am EST, data which follows a spade of disappointing economic figures that cast an early pall over US trading Tuesday that was ultimately overcome by the close. Also, ADP's read on January employment comes at 8:15 while the morning's earnings reports still include Hershey (HSY) and Northrop Grumman (NOC). Dow-industrial futures are up 85 points while the S&P 500 gains 8.5.(ishaq.siddiqi@dowjones.com)

6:28 (Dow Jones) Investor reaction to Thermo Fisher's (TMO) 4Q results and 2012 view could well be a test case on whether investors in the current environment treasure earnings or revenue more. The instrument and equipment maker easily beat analysts' expectations for the bottom line in 4Q, setting a quarterly record, and gave an in-line 2012 view. But revenue last quarter fell notably short and this year's target is below consensus views as well. EPS has been getting a boost from margin gains and share buybacks, which totaled $1.3B last year; TMO has a near-$20B market cap. Shares, inactive premarket, climbed 18% last month.

7:55 (Dow Jones) A united  NYSE-Deutsche Boerse was partly conceived by the companies to create a powerful force what would partner with fast-growing markets in Asia, where a fractured regulatory landscape has
forestalled the consolidation that swept US and  European exchanges the past decade. Both  NYSE Euronext

merger plan eliminates the potential edge the combined firm would have had over the likes CME, BM&FBovespa

7:53 (Dow Jones) Amazon (AMZN) shares down 9.3% premarket at $176.31 after disappointing 4Q and current quarter forecast. JPMorgan remains bullish, saying it believes gross merchandise value is growing faster than revenue and a shift toward third-party sellers "is at least temporarily (but perhaps longer) depressing revenue and raising margins." Near term could bring more weakness in shares, but JPM sees further pullbacks as buying opportunities. Needham, meanwhile, says weakness could bring opportunity for long-term investors, but "we expect more bumps in the near-term as Amazon continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and sales tax collection begins in earnest in 3Q12." (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

7:44 (Dow Jones) While NYSE Euronext (NYX) generally maintained its market share in stocks and options throughout its failed year-long merger effort with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF), the Big Board parent put on hold plans to build its own trade-clearing facility in favor of using its planned partner's existing platform. With the deal cast asunder, NYX now falls back on longtime provider LCH.Clearnet, though NYX will collect less in
revenues and potentially see a longer time getting new products to market than it would if it owned its own facility. CEO Duncan Niederauer says NYX will revisit plan to build its own unit. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:42 (Dow Jones) Energizer (ENR) becomes the latest consumer product company to warn of the impact a weak European market and stronger dollar will have on earnings. The battery-and-razor maker trims a dime off the top end of its FY12 guidance, blaming it mostly on Europe and volatile currencies. The views now at $6 to $6.20, which still encapsulates the consensus view of $6.18. In its FY1Q, ENR adjusted EPS tops estimates as margins held steady, but sales miss slightly as ongoing weakness in battery sales offsets strength of Schick and other personal care products. No premarket trading for ENR. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

7:36 (Dow Jones) Heavy concentration in exchange-traded derivatives like futures and options proved too high an antitrust hurdle for the proposed merger of Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and NYSE Euronext (NYX), but the exchanges now go their separate ways with a different derivatives headache. Together, the two stood a better chance of developing business in handling swap transactions carried out off-exchange, and neither so far has proven successful winning much of this market on its own. They have been outpaced the likes of LCH.Clearnet, ICE and CME. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:31 (Dow Jones) After reporting a 4Q profit--a rarity since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009--Chrysler comes out early this morning with a 44% surge in US sales in January, logging the best performance for the month in 4 years and an 8th-straight month of at least 20% year-on-year growth. Chrysler saw the biggest sales growth among the major auto makers last year--granted they were still coming off of depressed levels. But comparisons will get tougher as 2012 progresses and as last year's disaster-related inventory problems at Honda (HMC) and Toyota (TM) move further into the rear view. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)
7:30 (Dow Jones) Strong gains in European markets, a peppier euro and a fresh month set the table for US
stocks to open higher. DJIA and S&P 500 aim to snap a four-day losing streak, a series of down days that capped
off the best January point gain ever for both indexes. ADP's January private payrolls report due at 8:15am ET,
followed by Jan ISM manufacturing index and December construction spending at 10:00am. USD index down

0.3%, crude oil futures recovering, back above $99.00/bbl. Amazon shares down 9.4% premarket after 4Q sales disappointed and AMZN projected lower-than-expected sales in the current quarter. S&P futures up 9.25; 10-yr note lower, yield at 1.81%. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

7:27 (Dow Jones) CME's leaders are breathing a little easier this morning in the wake of the EU nixing Deutsche Boerse's (DB1.XE, DBOEF) proposed merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). The combination would have effectively created a European CME in terms of derivatives trading with the added star power of the Big Board in stocks and a roster of ties to Asian markets. The two will soldier on independently after a year spent on the failed deal, time CME has used building links to new markets like Ukraine. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:23 (Dow Jones) It's never nice to laugh at the misfortune of others, but some executives at Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) and ICE may sport grins Wednesday following the EU's prohibition of NYSE Euronext (NYX) merging with Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) on antitrust grounds. A rival proposal by NDAQ and ICE to buy NYSE last spring met a relatively quick end when the US Justice Department deemed the potential combination of NDAQ and the Big Board a monopoly in share listings. That came after NYSE for weeks showed its suitors the cold shoulder, refusing to entertain their rival offer. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

7:21 (Dow Jones) Hackers cripple a third Brazilian bank web site in three days, with the banks seemingly unable to respond despite the ample warning. The latest victim is Banco do Brasil (BBAS3.BR). Its website has been off the air for about 10 minutes and follows day-long attacks on the websites of Itau Unibanco (ITUB, ITUB4.BR) on Monday and Banco Bradesco (BBD, BBDC3.BR) yesterday. The hackers aren't apparently doing any permanent damage, and aren't able to access customer data--but it's a huge inconvenience for any bank customers trying to use online services. (matthew.cowley@dowjones.com)

7:18 (Dow Jones) Big European banks would have saved an estimated EUR3B ($4B) in collateral costs upon completion and integration of Deutsche Boerse's (DB1.XE, DBOEF) proposed merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX), plus some savings from combined technology systems. That's nothing to sneeze at as Europe looks to lift capital requirements for banks. But they pushed back against the deal on concerns that uniting Europe's two biggest exchanges would create a titan with too much power to set trading fees, particularly for derivatives contracts linked to European interest rates and stock indexes.(jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

WSJ Q&A: NYSE's Niederauer Talks About The Merger Collapse
By Jacob Bunge
931 words
1 February 2012
13:56
Dow Jones News Service
DJ
English
(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
NYSE Euronext (NYX) Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels on Wednesday confronted the failure of a tumultuous, yearlong  merger effort with Germany's  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE), blocked by the European Union over fears that the combined exchange group would hold too much power over derivatives trading in the region.
The Big Board managers answered questions about a potential appeal, the ongoing relationship with Deutsche
Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni and NYSE's way forward shortly after the EU decision became official.
(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal website, WSJ.com.) WSJ: At the end of a long process here and obviously not the result you desired. Do you feel like you did
everything you could on the regulatory front?

Mr. Hessels: Yes, we certainly did. Of course we are disappointed, but we don't really feel defeated. We came into this process very carefully, we pre-notified [the EU] before we came into the process. We reiterated that the market definition is not just exchange-traded derivatives, and not just European derivatives. The U.S. took the position this was a global market already four years ago. But, we look forward.

Mr. Niederauer: I don't think we would've done anything differently, in all honestly. We got right up to the goal line with this transaction and hindsight is always 20-20, but we're more interested in looking forward than backward this week.
WSJ: Will you appeal the ruling in court?

Mr. Niederauer: An appeal is one of the options we should certainly consider. But before we go there we would like for all of us to have time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think. But it's something we both would consider.

WSJ: When was your last conversation with [Deutsche Boerse CEO] Reto Francioni? What was the conversation like?

Mr. Niederauer: We talked about 30 or 40 minutes ago. Obviously he shares our disappointment. We both thought the market definition was not a place where we'd be likely to get tripped up. As you and others in the media have reported, the definition of the market [including over-the-counter derivatives and contracts traded on foreign exchanges] is pretty obvious, and it seems obvious to everyone but those reviewing our case.

Mr. Hessels: I would just say that this represents a missed opportunity for capital markets and European capital markets, particularly with regard to markets that are growing in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere.

WSJ: With Deutsche Boerse, do you anticipate that you'll go back to being competitors, or is there possibility for joint ventures?

Mr. Niederauer: I think in our industry you're seeing a lot of partnerships getting formed. I'd remind everybody that one of the ironies is that the [EU] objection centered on derivatives and particularly in interest-rate derivatives, where we and DB compete not at all. It's a bit unfathomable to us, since we have no overlapping products and we're not likely to compete on those products in the future. But Reto and I remain friends. We went through this process together. There are no hard feelings on either side.

Page 47 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WSJ: What's your plan with regard to clearing? You'd been building your own clearinghouse and then shelved that last year in favor of using Deutsche Boerse's Eurex. Will you start to build again or look for a different partnership?

Mr. Niederauer: The investors can look forward to hearing a lot of details on our go-forward plan on our earnings call next week, which will include the post-trade space and technology business. People can also expect us to talk about our capital management strategy going forward. Investors have been patient and supportive and it's time to reward them for that patience and support. We do intend to resume our previously authorized buyback
program and work on the expense side as well. Clearing is front and center as well. Our stated strategy had been to build out Liffe Clear and complete that process, and we made pretty good progress on that until the middle of last year. Then we took our foot off the gas. That work has started again in earnest.

WSJ: How does the EU decision change NYSE's growth strategy--as you look toward smaller-scale deals, what gaps do you seek to fill?

Mr. Niederauer: We'll give a little more clarity looking forward on that next week, so I wouldn't speculate on specific assets. But as you've seen, the majority of our M&A has been in the technology arena. No one should be surprised to see that continue. But with three large-scale, cross-border [exchange] deals not getting
consummated in the last year, the industry has to be realistic about what the prospects are going forward. We'll stick with the strategy going forward that we had before but will not be afraid to execute on those types of
[large-scale] opportunities if they arise down the line.
WSJ: Would you consider a deal with ICE, as some analysts have thrown out there?

Mr. Niederauer: I wouldn't speculate on that either. Let us get through what we're going through today, and then we'll give everyone more clarity next Friday.

8:57 (Dow Jones) Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) CEO Bob Greifeld doesn't believe the  EU's decision to block the NYSE-Deutsche Boerse merger precludes future big exchange deals from succeeding, and says he's empathetic with rival executives' failure to persuade regulators that they operate in a global market. Greifeld tells analysts on a conference call that the narrow definition of the  European derivatives market used by Brussels is "highly suspect," and says there's a "compelling industrial logic" for more exchange deals, though NDAQ is sticking to bolt-ons and sees more opportunities than ever before.

8:56 (Dow Jones) MasterCard (MA) is tightening its relationship with KeyCorp (KEY), adding its PIN debit processing network to the bank's debit cards. Many banks are expected to add or change processing networks for their debit cards because of the Durbin amendment, federal rules that cap how much banks can charge
merchants to accept their cards. Those rules also require banks to add multiple processing networks to their cards to give merchants more options. MA, whose PIN networks is used by fewer banks than Visa's (V), is expected to get a slight boost from the rules. Many banks have exclusive processing relationships with V, which are prohibited by the rules. (andrew.r.johnson@dowjones.com)

8:54 (Dow Jones) Roth Capital adds to the chorus of folks expressing some worry about Wendy's (WEN) revamp plan. "We believe the strategy is attractive, achievable and necessary to restore sales and earnings momentum. However, a more-extended rollout of the breakfast program than earlier anticipated and a costly remodel effort should penalize income over the short term." Roth Capital, which downgrades the fast-food chain to neutral and slashes its price target to $5 from $8, notes the new breakfast effort was intended to be in 1,000 stores by year's end and "aggressively rolled out in 2012. However, it currently is in only about 600 units and apparently there will not be a full launch any time soon." WEN is up 1.3% premarket at $4.75 after sliding a combined 10% Monday and Tuesday. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

8:51 (Dow Jones) Mark Grant, the voluble "wizard" of Southwest Securities who is uber-bearish on Europe, warns that the market may be ignoring a significant event risk in Europe: the increasingly likely election of Socialist candidate Francois Hollande. The man aiming to replace French President Sarkozy has warned that he aims to
re-negotiate the EU's brand-new fiscal treaty, which could rock the boat of the Franco-German alliance. "As we all focus on the travails of Greece and Portugal, now and then see Spain and Italy on the outer perimeter, I suggest that you turn some of your attention to France, as the country is likely to be governed quite differently in the months ahead with serious ramifications for the austerity-wielding Germans." (javier.david@dowjones.com)

8:42 (Dow Jones) The report card for January is out. High-yield corporate debt is the rock star, handing investors a return of 3.04% last month, according to data from Barclays. Muni bonds were also strong with 2.31% return, followed by 2.29% in TIPS. Treasurys handed investors a return of 0.42%. But one bright side for Treasury bulls
is that the market managed to recoup all the losses made during the earlier half of January. Treasury bonds were powered up last week by Fed's new pledge of low-rate through late 2014 and some weakening US data. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

8:35 (Dow Jones) Philadelphia Fed boss Charles Plosser says in a speech today that he doesn't like the Fed's inclination to keep rates very low through 2014. He thinks a recovering economy simply doesn't need that level of central bank support. The non-FOMC voter sees 3% GDP this year and next, and reckons the jobless rate could fall under 8% by year end. All told, he remains a hawk, but is unable to dissent this year the way he did last year. (michael.derby@dowjones.com)

8:34 (Dow Jones) While Colombian oil company Ecopetrol's (EC) proven reserves rose 8.3% last year and recorded more discoveries than output, analysts say EC needs one or more "big finds" to maintain output levels

and meet lofty long-term targets. In 2020, it aims for 1.3M barrels/day of production; it's arond 700K now. (dan.molinski@dowjones.com)

8:33 (Dow Jones) Viewing ADP's job growth figures with "an eye of suspicion," Eric Green at TD Securities notes that the figures have consistently overestimated private payrolls growth by an average of 65,000 jobs over the last few months. He suggests the figures won't do much to alter the outlook for Friday's employment report. "We were looking for 150k private jobs on Friday, that does not change with this release and I suspect nobody on Wall
Street will change theirs, either." (javier.david@dowjones.com)

8:25 (Dow Jones) Dollar remains on the soft side following ADP private payrolls figures, which show 170K jobs created in January, in-line with expectations and setting the tone for Friday's employment report. Stocks and higher-yielding currencies buoyed by strong global manufacturing data, which keeps the greenback soft. Still, Greece's ongoing debt talks inject some caution into the market. EUR/USD up 0.70% to 1.3174, USD/JPY down
0.20% to hover around 76.10, AUD/USD up 0.72% to 1.07. (javier.david@dowjones.com)

8:23 (Dow Jones) The AUD/CAD cross continued its upward stretch overnight, trading as high as C$1.0695, a level not seen since May 1997, as AUD took a sizable overnight boost from better-than-expected Chinese data. The cross looks "very rich to us," says TD Securities early Wednesday, with interest rate spreads contracting sharply as the market anticipates further RBA rate cuts, but the cross is largely ignoring that, as it continues to focus on Australia's terms of trade gains and hopes for sustain Chinese growth. Australian dollar was recently at C$1.0687, from C$1.0649 late Tues. (karen.johnson@dowjones.com)

8:23 (Dow Jones) Shares of Brazilian independent driller OGX (OGXP3.BR, OGXPY) among the day's leading gainers at the start of trade on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange after the company finally pumped its first oil late Tuesday. OGX also said it would restart drilling at a promising pre-salt discovery in shallow waters of the Santos Basin. OGX up 2.4%, outperforming Ibovespa's 1.0% increase. OGX's First production had originally been expected in the third quarter of 2011. Output will ramp up slowly to about 20,000 barrels a day to start, growing to about 50,000 barrels as additional wells connected. (jeff.fick@dowjones.com)

8:21 (Dow Jones) Apparently Georgia Gulf (GGC) investors were hoping for even more as its shares fall premarket despite suitor Westlake Chemical (WLK) boosting its takeover bid 17% to $35/share. GGC is off 4.2% at $33.50 after getting as high as $35.56 last week. The company had rejected the $30/share offer that valued GGC at about $1B. WLK also says it is willing to craft a deal that would be part-stock. But what it won't do is launch a proxy fight at this year's GGC annual meeting, which makes WLK look like it's unwilling to pull out all the stops in acquiring the company if it continues to put up resistance. For now, WLK still wants to reach a deal without going hostile. Its shares are inactive premarket. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

MARKET TALK: European Banks Applaud  Killed Exchange Deal

English
(c) 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
10:36 (Dow Jones) A group of  European big banks, which had been against the deal, says the  European Commission "reached the correct decision" in rejecting proposed  merger of Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX). The Association for Financial Markets in Europe had raised concerns that
the structure of the combined company would have raised barriers to competition and held significant power over trading fees. Group Managing Director Christian Krohn says it's unfortunate that the exchanges didn't take further steps to win approval for the deal, like broadening access to clearing functions. The companies had argued doing so would undermine the deal's logic. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

Group Managing Director Christian Krohn says it's unfortunate that the exchanges didn't take further steps to win approval for the deal, like broadening access to clearing functions. The companies had argued doing so would undermine the deal's logic. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

10:27 (Dow Jones) Flow says Brazilian steelmaker CSN's(CSNA3.BR, SID)'s acquisition of German steel assets is marginally negative for CSN and brings the company's investment strategy into question. "We believe CSN's excess-cash-use strategy may continue weighing on investors' sentiment. Channeling cash to Europe does not seem to be the preferred alternative for cash use from the minority shareholders' perspective." The broker adds the risk for CSN may outweigh the benefit of buying "cheap" assets and that the end game for CSN's minority stake in Usiminas (USNZY, USIM5.BR) still remains unclear to investors. In New York, SID is up 3.7% at $10.65, putting the year's rally at 30%. (diana.kinch@dowjones.com)

10:26 (Dow Jones) Less than an hour after the open, the DJIA has recovered everything it lost during the last four sessions, which happened to mark the longest losing streak since Nov 25. DJIA up 150 at 12783, above the Jan
25 closing high of 12756.96, and on track to close at the highest level since May 3. Although the DJIA posted its biggest January point gain in its history, a triple-digit gain today would be the first since Jan 3. Levels to watch on the upside are the May 2 intraday high of 12876, followed by the May 2008 high of 13137. (tomi.kilgore@dowjones.com)

10:25 (Dow Jones) A big surprise in today's rather ho-hum ISM report was the surge in the price index, to 55.5 in January from a contractionary 47.5 in December. But Bradley Holcomb, who oversees the ISM report, says the gain is not unusual at start of new year because that's when companies try to pass through increases. He says this is unlikely to be the start of a sustained increase in prices. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

10:19 (Dow Jones) It looks like Amazon.com (AMZN) shares will take one of their biggest beatings in recent memory following the company's disappointing 4Q results and outlook. The latest results raised fears growth is decelerating as AMZN continues to invest heavily in its business. That isn't a new concern for the company--its
3Q report in October raised similar sentiments and prompted a 13% drop in the stock, the biggest single-day decline in 3 years. AMZN is currently down 9.7% at $175.50, and that percentage drop would represent the second-biggest tumble over that time frame. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

10:16 (Dow Jones) A day after Mattel's (MAT) shares rallied on a strong 4Q report, the toy maker's stock is slapped with two downgrades, both firms saying shares are fairly valued. Caris cuts to above average from buy, lauding strong brands and pricing power but seeing slowing organic sales and EPS growth tied to upcoming "Brave" and "Batman" films. Stifel Nicolaus cuts MAT to hold from buy, likes cost cutting, international growth and dividend yield, but says "upside is less compelling near-term." MAT has jumped 30% during the past year, and up
1.5% in early trading. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

10:10 (Dow Jones) From the ISM on the factory report: "Prices of raw materials increased for the first time in the last four months. Manufacturing is starting out the year on a positive note, with new orders, production and employment all growing in January." (michael.derby@dowjones.com)

10:10 (Dow Jones) Treasurys push toward session lows after the latest reads on US manufacturing activity and construction spending. Meanwhile, the ISM's increase follows strong manufacturing reports from China and
Page 57 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Europe. They have been a key driver today in pushing investors out of Treasurys and into riskier assets like stocks. The 10-year Treasury is down 8/32, yielding 1.830%. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

10:08 (Dow Jones) US PMI headline checks in at 54.1, slightly less than the expected 54.5, and generally in-line with global manufacturing data showing a thriving -- if not gangbusters -- export sector. Taken together with relatively firm US construction figures, the data don't hurt or help the dollar, which remains softer across the board. The appetitive for stocks and higher-yielding currencies keeps EUR/USD buoyed around 1.3167, up
0.66% on the day. USD/JPY drifts lower to 76.10, off 0.23% and less than a yen from last year's record low. (javier.david@dowjones.com)

10:04 (Dow Jones) Factory growth picks up in January: the ISM index stands at 54.1 from 53.1 in December. That's a little less than expected. Prices gained ground after contracting in December, and hiring grew at a slightly slower pace. Factories continue to be a consistent contributor to overall economic momentum, even if they don't represent that much of total U.S. output. (michael.derby@dowjones.com)

10:03 (Dow Jones) Following growth at smaller rivals Chrysler and Ford (F), GM tries to couch its 6.1% decline in January US sales to a strong prior-year result. That would have been even worse were it not for lower-profit fleet sales; retail deliveries skidded 15% on-year. Overall, crossover sales dropped 18% while Buick saw a 23 slide in its total sales and Cadillac saw a 29% slump. It looks like the sales gap between Ford and GM is likely to continue narrowing for a while more. GM shares are shedding their early gains after the report; they're now up 0.6% at
$24.17. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

9:53 (Dow Jones) Safe assets lose favor as US stock market posts decent gains. It is the first session Tsy bond prices down in six days "Hopes of a Greek debt-swap deal to be finished up in the near term and some economic releases have been better than forecast," says Rick Klingman, managing director of Treasury trading at BNP Paribas. "That encouraged investors to move out of Treasurys and into stocks." Still, even with the selling, the
10-yr yield is less than 20bps away from the historic low of 1.672% set in September. The 10-year note is recently
9/32 lower to yield 1.830%. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

In its statement on rejecting the proposed  merger of Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX), EU officials note CME does represent something of a competitor in derivatives trading, but "only marginally" in the European interest-rate markets that drew antitrust regulators' concerns. The  EU investigation found that "no other player would be able to develop trading in  European financial derivatives on a sufficient
scale to keep the market competitive," including CME. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

11:30 (Dow Jones) Morgan Stanley says the ultra-low valuation on Hartford Financial's (HIG) stock should put pressure on the insurer's board to give a fresh look to the idea of splitting off its life business and shutting down its annuity operations. That would leave HIG as a property-casualty company. But Morgan Stanley notes management doesn't seem inclined to undertake a breakup, with a restructuring being "complex and potentially costly." Still, "business as usual is no longer a satisfactory strategy." HIG gains 3.2% amid today's market rally to
$18.08, or just 40% of book value. Morgan Stanley says a restructured HIG would be worth $27. (erik.holm@dowjones.com)

11:13 (Dow Jones) Meritage (MTH) shares bounce 2.9% to $24.90, helped by a broad market rally, after yesterday's 11% plunge that followed a 4Q earnings miss. "Lower seasonal volumes will pressure margins and lead to an operating loss in 1Q, but 2H profits (as volume improves) should modestly offset the losses in 1H," Credit Suisse writes. The firm increases 2012 EPS estimate to a profit of 5c, up from a 29c/share loss, helped by higher margins and lower charges. (dawn.wotapka@dowjones.com)

11:13 (Dow Jones) US oil demand fell the most in one week in 14 years to set a 13-year average daily low, according to the EIA. Usage slid 8.3%, or 1.6M barrels/day, from a week earlier to 17.7M last week, off 6%
on-year. That as demand for gasoline, the most-widely used petroleum product, fell 1.6% on-week and 6.8% from a year earlier. Usage last week and the past 4 set fresh 11-year lows as January's average US prices for regular gasoline set a record for the month. (david.bird@dowjones.com)

11:09 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD pushes up to new session highs, with analysts seeing in sight a near-term test of the 1.3230 area, the six-week high reached Friday. Although a failure of Greece's debt talks is a looming risk, a firmer tone in markets has greased the wheels of a rally. Taking note of easing Italian bond yields and dollar funding costs, Douglas Borthwick at Faros Trading notes that "the last time the basis swap was at this level, EUR/USD was at 1.3600; the last time Italian yields were here, the EUR/USD was trading at 1.3900." (javier.david@dowjones.com)

11:07 (Dow Jones) Like other health insurers, Aetna (AET) is taking a careful approach after another light year of health-care usage by assuming an increase in 2012. But the motivation for now seems to be caution about the potential for an increase while setting prices, more than any real signs utilization is rising. "We have seen nothing in the underlying data" pointing to higher utilization, CFO Joseph Zubretsky tells Dow Jones. Still, AET has to price products responsibly given the risks it assumes, officials say. Shares gain 3% to $44.99 after the company met analysts' 4Q expectations with help from light health-care costs. (jon.kamp@dowjones.com)

11:03 (Dow Jones) Aflac (AFL) shares off 2.7% at $46.91, even as nearly every other insurer is rising, after AFL sounds newly aggressive about efforts to overhaul its investment portfolio. Most analysts crowed about last night's 4Q results and record-breaking sales in Japan, but AFL's call this morning featured the debut of new CIO Eric Kirsch, who said he's looking to continue reducing AFL's exposure to Europe. While that's probably a good thing long term, it suggests there could be more quarters with hundreds of millions in investment losses before the process is done. (erik.holm@dowjones.com)

11:01 (Dow Jones) Like many other investors, the bond king admits that he can't fight the Fed. In the February investment outlook, Pimco's Bill Gross acknowledges that the Fed's active buying in Treasurys and extension of zero-bound rate policy mean bond yields are unlikely to rise much. That is a reason why Gross has been scooping up longer-dated Treasurys following his sour bets against the market a year ago. But he continues to fret that the Fed's policy may backfire by killing credit expansion. "Developed economies where these low yields reside may suffer accordingly. It may as well induce inflationary distortions that give a rise to commodities and gold as store of value alternatives when there is little value left in paper," he says. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

11:00 (Dow Jones) For a potential pair trade in Canada, Canaccord suggests investors go long airline stocks and short railways. Airlines stand to benefit from "improving consumer/business confidence, a strong C$ (and) reasonable pricing power" while trading at a record valuation discount to railways. (ben.dummett@dowjones.com)

10:56 (Dow Jones) With bad news priced in and more discipline from management, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is still a good buy, Credit Suisse says. Maintains outperform rating, even as it lowers EPS estimates after yesterday's disappointing 2Q results. CS cuts fiscal 2012 EPS view to $2.70 from $3.15; F13 EPS to $3.40 from
$3.50, as the company should see greater returns from capital spending, which is increasingly focused on small projects. "Management is taking a more disciplined approach to capital spending, thinking differently about its cost structure, and returning cash faster to shareholders," Credit Suisse says. ADM up 2% to $29.22 after falling
3.6% yesterday. (ian.berry@dowjones.com)
10:46 (Dow Jones) Cantor Fitzgerlad initiates coverage of the multifamily REIT seector saying to buy
Mid-America (MAA), AvalonBay (AVB) and Associated Estates (AEC), while it urges selling UDR and Home
Properties(HME). MAA is labeled a "growth for less" opportunity, while HME's core markets screen poorly for
employment and population growth. Overall, "a backdrop of low rates and stable employment levels suggest that
apartment valuations, while stretched, should hold steady," firm notes. AEC rises 1.4%, MAA up 0.%, while HME
adds 0.6%. (dawn.wotapka@dowjones.com)

10:45 (Dow Jones) As 4Q reports continue to roll in from money managers, Citi downgrades Waddell & Reed (WDR) and T Rowe Price (TROW) to sell amid its expectation for further multiple compression in the sector. WDR's price target falls to $24 from $29 while Citi lowers EPS estimates for this year and next, with the bank calling WDR "suddenly a stuck franchise as margins compress and flow visibility dims." Citi actually raises its target on TROW by $1 to $50 and edges EPS estimates higher, but the downgrade comes amid "uneven flow prospects" and the lower multiple view.

4:23 (Dow Jones) NYSE Euronext (NYX) is the sole US-listed exchange operator to finish Wednesday in the red amid a broad stock-market rally. Big Board parent's shares close 0.5% lower at $26.43 after  EU seals coffin on Deutsche Boerse merger with an antitrust nail. CME Group (CME) rises most, settling 2.5% higher at $245.48, as ruling removes prospect of a derivatives market equal with a transatlantic stock franchise, plus options. CBOE Holdings (CBOE) rises 0.5%--merging Deutsche Boerse and NYSE would have had 41% of US stock-options
trading--and onetime  NYSE suitor IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) closes 0.2% higher. Nasdaq OMX up slightly at
$24.77. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

4:23 (Dow Jones) NYSE Euronext (NYX) is the sole US-listed exchange operator to finish Wednesday in the red amid a broad stock-market rally. Big Board parent's shares close 0.5% lower at $26.43 after  EU seals coffin on Deutsche Boerse merger with an antitrust nail. CME Group (CME) rises most, settling 2.5% higher at $245.48, as ruling removes prospect of a derivatives market equal with a transatlantic stock franchise, plus options. CBOE Holdings (CBOE) rises 0.5%--merging  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE would have had 41% of US stock-options
trading--and onetime  NYSE suitor IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) closes 0.2% higher. Nasdaq OMX up slightly at
$24.77. (jacob.bunge@dowjones.com)

4:22 (Dow Jones) Despite previous skepticism that Green Mountain's (GMCR) Keurig would remain the market leader, GMCR saw net sales more than double in fiscal 1Q12, allowing it to more than offset higher coffee prices. Given that GMCR sold more than 4M Keurig brewers in the quarter, it will likely continue to see K-cup portion
pack sales rise to fill all those new brewers. This reinforces several analysts' original thesis that the introduction of lower-end brewer coming from Wal-mart (WMT) soon won't pose a threat, given GMCR's strong brand position already. Shares up a fraction to $53.75 after hours. (annie.gasparro@dowjones.com

4:22 (Dow Jones) Electronic Arts' (EA) highly anticipated online multiplayer game, "Star Wars: The Old Republic" appears to be gaining traction among customers. EA said it had 1.7M active subscribers and has sold more than
2M units since its launch on Dec. 20. EA said the project was its biggest ever, and analysts have estimated it cost hundreds of millions of dollars to produce over the past five years. EA has said it would be "approaching profitability" if the game had 500,000 subscribers. With 1M, it would be "a good investment." As it approaches 2M, EA must be grinning. (ian.sherr@dowjones.com)
4:19 (Dow Jones) Electronic Arts' (EA) largely beat analyst expectations for its 3Q, posting non-GAAP revenue of
$1.65B and non-GAAP EPS of 99c, compared to analyst expectations of $1.61B in revenue and EPS of 93c. But,
though EA showed strong traction in its much anticipated "Star Wars" online game and with apps in mobile app
stores, the company's fiscal 4Q outlook disappointed. The company forecast non-GAAP sales between $925M to
$975M with non-GAAP EPS between 10c to 20c. Analysts had been expecting $989.6M and 29c EPS. Shares
are down 2.6% in after-hours trading at $17.95. (ian.sherr@dowjones.com)

4:17 (Dow Jones) Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) 4Q sales rose 3.8% to $876M, above Wall Street's consensus of $864M, as three of the company's four segments reported top line growth, led by a 13% increase for security and storage products. Window materials and door systems was again the laggard, dropping 11%, which CEO Chris Klein attributed to tough year-ago comparisons due to a 2010 energy tax credit. FBHS has managed to maintain sales growth by focusing on product innovation, though Klein said the market "remains challenging." Meanwhile, FBHS FY12 EPS outlook of 66c-74c missed Street's 79c estimate. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

4:16 (Dow Jones) Little is slowing down Chipotle's (CMG) sizzling sales growth, as same-store sales rise 11.1% in 4Q. But one thing CMG can't control is food costs, which were a bigger headwind than expected, causing EPS of $1.81 to miss consensus by a couple pennies. CMG's raising prices to combat the higher costs and it's not scaring off customers too much. But CMG's will have a hard time getting back to brisk growth it saw in 2011. CMG only expects mid-single digit same-store sales growth in 2012 -- up from its prior view of low-single digits, but a slowdown from 11.2% in 2011. Shares off 2.3% in late trading to $362.00. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com)

4:11 (Dow Jones) Qualcomm (QCOM) posts another record quarter, with rev, earnings and chipset shipments reaching all-time highs. Company, which makes chips for smartphones and tablets, also lifts its guidance for fiscal
2012 and provides a better-than-expected outlook for 2Q. QCOM likely benefiting from soaring sales of Apple
(AAPL) iPhones, such as the 4S. Company reports it shipped 156 million chips, up 32% from previous year and
Page 63 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
23% sequentially. QCOM had been expecting 146M to 154M. Shares, up 19% over the past three months through Wednesday's close, climb 3.7% to $61.80 after hours. (shara.tibken@dowjones.com)

4:05 (Dow Jones) US stocks break the pattern they'd been stuck in, rallying at the open and maintaining the gains all day, after a spate of decent data out of Europe and some not-terrible news here. DJIA rises 83 (0.7%) to
12716, S&P 500 gains 14 (1.1%) to 1322, Nasdaq Comp jumps 34 (1.2%) to 2848. Spate of late selling whittles down the gains somewhat. Market seized on some decent PMI reports from Europe. ADP says US private sector added 170,000 jobs in January. Greece is reportedly going to announce a deal on its debt any hour, no, any day, no, any... (paul.vigna@dowjones.com)

3:52 (Dow Jones) Media group Televisa SAB (TV) shares among top performers in Mexico on hopes regulatory agency will green light the broadcaster's tie-up with Iusacell wireless company that is controlled by a competing broadcaster. TV recently gaining 2.5% to MXN52.69, but still far shy of its MXN55.30 close on Jan. 24 before reports that a negative decision was in the works. Investors appear to be hedging bets on the thought that the
deal could be approved, but with conditions that may or may not be deal-breakers. (laurence.iliff@dowjones.com)

3:37 (Dow Jones) More signs of relief from the euro-zone's debt crisis. The two-year US swap spread, a key gauge of credit risk, especially for banks, tightens 2bps recently to 28bps, the lowest level since mid August. The spread has plunged from 48bps at the start of this year and the sharp move corresponds with stunning decline in
10-year Italian government bond yield. Even as investors still fret about longer-term structural problems in the euro zone, few could deny the power of central banks' power in the near term. The ECB's three-year cheap loan program has been a key driver easing market stress and the Fed joined the party by extending low rate pledge into late 2014. BOE may initiate a new QE this month. (min.zeng@dowjones.com)

3:28 (Dow Jones) In its perpetual fight to tame steep inflation, Venezuela will soon unveil a first wave of price caps in connection with aggressively expanded government controls. BofA/Merrill expects the government will avoid making widespread shortages of basic goods worse in an election year by announcing a mild set of new regulations. Setting prices, however, does not address the rapidly increasing money supply spurred by soaring government spending, the firm says. Venezuela's notoriously sky-high inflation ended 2011 at 27.6%. (ezequiel.minaya@dowjones.com)

3:08 (Dow Jones) Something about this Wednesday before NFP-Friday rally feels familiar. Looking back, sure enough, this is the fourth month out of five where the DJIA has run up a triple-digit gain on the Wednesday before release of monthly payroll data. Back on October 5, two days ahead of September's report, the DJIA ran up 131 points. On Nov 2, the average hoisted a 178-point gain before the Oct jobs report, and Nov 30 brought a
490-point moonshot, sparked by central banks' liquidity moves. Ahead of Dec jobs report, stocks only posted a modest gain on Jan 4, but that was on the heels of a 180-point climb the day before. DJIA now up 127. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

DJ Deutsche Boerse:  EU Rejects Merger Plan With NYSE Euronext

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Exchange operators  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) Wednesday said the  European Union has informed them about the decision to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination.

Both would-be  merger partners said that the  EU Commission concluded "that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market," despite remedies offered by both companies.

Both companies said it will now be impossible to fulfil one of the completion conditions for the exchange offer, that the EU clearance must be received by March 31. As a result, the exchange offer will automatically lapse once the merger partners officially receive the prohibition decision, they said. The merger partners will publish the termination offer and will unwind the offer, they said.

With their decision to reject, on antitrust grounds, the plans to create the world's largest exchange in terms of market capitalization, all 27 EU commissioners backed the opinion of EU antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed new company a 93% market share in that region. He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also rejected calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global market.
Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni will comment on the EU decision later Wednesday.

1030 GMT [Dow Jones] Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE) shares trade 1.4% higher at EUR45.43, shaving off some of their earlier gains after the company says the  EU has rejected the planned  merger with NYSE Euronext (NYX). A trader says some investors might be disappointed that the expected synergies from the merger won't occur, but most investors had expected the rejection. He suggests investors take advantage of the dip and buy the stock. (herbert.rude@dowjones.com)

-- Deutsche Boerse, NYSE Euronextmerger would have "practically eliminated" market competition, Almunia says
-- Deal would have created quasi-monopoly in several asset classes
-- Derivatives traded off exchanges aren't substitutes for those traded on-exchange
-- Derivatives with European underlying assets no substitutes to derivatives with U.S. underlying assets

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The proposed tie-up between exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) would have "practically eliminated" market competition and remedies proposed by the two companies "fell far short of resolving the concerns," the European Union's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, said Wednesday.

Earlier Wednesday, the EU, which had been considered the main regulatory hurdle, blocked the planned $17 billion combination about a year after the plans were first announced.

The commission's review of the plans "found ample evidence" that both companies and their derivative exchanges--Eurex and Liffe, the largest exchanges in the world for financial derivatives based on European underlyings--"compete head to head and are each other's closest competitors," Almunia told reporters following the EU's decision.

Almunia had argued the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading, giving the proposed company a 93% market share in that region.

He rejected requests by the exchanges for the review to include derivatives that are traded over-the-counter rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% worldwide. He also turned down calls by the exchanges that the review should take into consideration that today's derivatives market is a global one.

The review found that the two companies themselves "don't view OTC products as competitors for the derivatives they trade," they only consider each other as competitors, Almunia said.
The competition review didn't see any problems in other areas, such as traditional stock trading, but looked at
how consumers regard and use different types of derivatives and the underlying assets, Almunia said. The review
showed that derivatives traded on exchanges and derivatives traded off exchanges are used for different
purposes and in different circumstances, and therefore not considered as substitutes by customers.

In addition, derivatives on euro-zone interest rates aren't substitutes for derivatives on U.S. interest rates, and derivatives on European equity indexes aren't substitutes for derivatives on U.S. equity indexes, Almunia said.

"European underlying assets aren't the same ones as U.S. ones," he said, adding that one can't hedge a derivative based on a Deutsche Boerse index with a derivative based on a U.S. index.

Competition in the past has also enhanced liquidity in products, Almunia said, adding the collateral savings benefits from the combination would have been limited.

The proposed merger would have eliminated the global competition between Eurex and Liffe "and created a quasi-monopoly in several asset classes, leading to significant harm to derivatives users and the European economy as a whole," Almunia said.

Overall, "efficiencies [from the combination] would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers," he said.

Almunia also noted that the combined company would have put up substantial barriers for new market participants. "Due to the closed vertical silo operated by Liffe and Eurex, where the exchange's trading is exclusively linked to a clearing house, there are major barriers to entry in these markets."

He noted that customers prefer to stay on exchanges where they can pool the clearing of similar contracts and thereby save collateral. "As a result, there is no prospect for CME or any other new player to exercise a meaningful competitive constraint of the two companies in the products concerned in the near future."

Asked if there was opposition to the decision among the commissioners, Almunia simply noted that there had been no vote on it--signaling that there was a clear majority in favor of blocking the deal.

However, EU officials confirmed that Financial Markets Commissioner Michel Barnier asked for his views to placed in the minutes and had emphasized the need to take into account the likely evolution of derivative markets in coming years given the entry into force of new rules aiming to force many derivative products through exchanges and off over-the-counter markets.

"For the commissioner, it was important to have a discussion on such an important issue. He made that discussion happen. All commissioners were glad such a discussion on such an important issue could take place," said someone familiar with the discussions.

1657 GMT [Dow Jones] DAX closes 2.4% higher at 6616.64, as largely optimistic manufacturing data in most European countries and hopes about progress in Greece's debt talks boost sentiment, traders say. Infineon finishes 5.6% higher after the company reports 1Q results. Deutsche Bank closes 5.1% higher. RWE gains 4.9% after Morgan Stanley adds the company to its best-ideas list following its upgrading of the stock to overweight. Deutsche Boerse is up 1%, but underperforms the DAX after the  EU Commission rejects its  merger plan with NYSE Euronext. Thursday's macroeconomic releases include US jobless claims at 1330 GMT. In the corporate sector, Deutsche Bank will report 2011 earnings at 0615 GMT and Munich Re at 0645 GMT. (tapan.sharma@dowjones.com)

Threat to Competition - EU Blocks  Merger of NYSE and Deutsche Börse

The European Commision has vetoed a planned  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext stock exchanges, saying that it would have created a quasi-monopoly in certain kinds of trading. Deutsche Börse called it "a black day for  Europe."
It would have been the world's largest stock-exchange company. But plans to combine Germany's Deutsche
Börse with NYSE Euronext have floundered after the European Commission vetoed the merger on Wednesday.

The Commission, the EU's executive body which is also responsible for regulating competition within the bloc, argued that the combined company would have had too much power over trading in European derivatives, the term for financial instruments based on the value of an underlying asset, such as futures contracts and swaps.

"The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia Wednesday in a statement. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

According to the Commission, the two companies control more than 90 percent of the trade in European exchange-traded financial derivatives through their subsidiaries the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe), which is part of NYSE Euronext, and Deutsche Börse's Eurex exchange.

Deutsche Börse reacted to the decision with disappointment. "This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," said the company's executive board in a statement. "The EU Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives."
Legal Action Possible

The two potential merger partners had recently tried to save the $7.3 billion (&#128;5.6 billion) deal, which was originally announced in February 2011. In a bid to appease the European Commission, they offered to divest their overlapping businesses, including Liffe's single-stock derivatives business. Antitrust officials had previously said that the two companies would have to sell off an entire derivatives business, either Liffe or Eurex, but the exchanges weren't prepared to go that far.
The two companies can still appeal the decision before the European Court of Justice. The head of the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE), Duncan Niederauer, recently said that he would not rule out legal action against a veto.

It was the third attempt by Deutsche Börse and NYSE to merge. The Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse would have owned 60 percent of the proposed new company, and the NYSE 40 percent. Since mid-February 2011, the companies had been seeking approval for the deal from around 40 competition and regulatory authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. The US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had already cleared the merger.

NYSE Euronext  (NYX) to Terminate  Merger Agreement  w/ Deutsche Boerse

NYSE Euronext (NYSE: NYX) announced today that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders. In that regard,  NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the  merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext Chairman said, Our merger would have created a high standard for transparency, stability and efficiency in the global capital markets, and we proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction. But as we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination.

While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on and return our sole focus to executing our compelling existing strategy a strategy we have continued to implement without missing a beat over the last year.

The strong underlying fundamentals of our core business, the strength and depth of our management team, and our diversified global footprint give us unique competitive advantages to exploit in the rapidly evolving global landscape as we continue to grow our successful franchises and return capital to shareholders.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders. In that regard,  NYSE Euronext announced its intent to resume a $550 million share repurchase program following the termination of the  merger agreement and after the release of its fourth quarter and 2011 year-end results on February 10, 2012.

Molycorp, Inc. (NYSE: MCP) announced today that Molibdenos y Metales S.A. (Molymet), the world's largest processor of the strategic metals molybdenum and rhenium, has agreed to invest approximately $390 million in Molycorp in exchange for 12.5 million shares of Molycorp common stock. The price of the Molycorp shares to be purchased were valued based on the 20-day volume weighted average share price as of the close of trading on January 30, 2012 plus a 10.0% premium. Molycorp has agreed to appoint to its Board of Directors upon the closing of the proposed investment a nominee to be designated by Molymet.

Proceeds from the Molymet investment will be retained by Molycorp for general corporate purposes and will bolster Molycorp's strategic flexibility. The funds are expected to finance Molycorp's future growth and will help
the Company continue to pursue its vertical supply chain integration business model. Closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental regulatory approvals.

Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE: WLK) announced today that it has submitted a revised proposal to the board of Georgia Gulf Corporation (NYSE: GGC) to acquire all the outstanding shares of Georgia Gulf for $35.00 per share in cash. The Company also announced that Georgia Gulf has rejected this increased offer. The revised proposal represents a 17% increase to Westlake's previous offer of $30.00 per share, a 77% premium to Georgia Gulf's unaffected 30-day volume weighted average share price of $19.82 prior to our original public offer and a substantial premium over the volume weighted average share price since the initial offer.

EU Set to Formally  Nix Market Merger --- Collapse of Deutsche Boerse, NYSE Euronext  Deal Would Be
Latest in a Series of Failed Consolidation Efforts
By Ulrike Dauer and Gina Chon

Exchange operators Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext are expected to see their $17 billion tie-up collapse Wednesday, as European Union regulators declare the yearlong plan to be anticompetitive.

The EU's 27 commissioners are likely to formally nix the move at their regular weekly meeting, backing the opinion of the  EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia.

He has said the combined businesses would dominate on-exchange derivatives trading in Europe, giving the proposed new company 93% of the region's market. He rejected a call by the exchanges to consider derivatives that are traded over-the-counter, rather than only those on exchanges, which would effectively reduce their total market share to below 15% in Europe and below 4% world-wide.

Concessions offered by both merger partners have had little impact. They offered to sell NYSE Euronext's European stock-derivatives business, to cap some trading fees for three years and to open up Deutsche Boerse's clearing platforms to competitors.

The failure of the high-profile deal 12 months after it was announced joins a list of other derailed cross-border exchange tie-ups.

The London Stock Exchange's intended tie-up with Canada's TMX Ltd. was withdrawn after failing to secure enough support from TMX investors. Singapore Exchange's proposed buyout of Australia's ASX Ltd. was blocked by Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan, who said the deal wasn't in Australia's national interest.

Chief executives at Germany's Deutsche Boerse, which runs the main German stock exchange as well as the Eurex derivatives business, and NYSE Euronext, which owns the Big Board and four European stock markets, acknowledged in recent days that hopes of getting the deal approved were fading, despite fierce lobbying efforts.

NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos that there was only "a glimmer of hope" for the tie-up, though he hadn't given up and may consider challenging the EU decision in court.

"It does appear that, at least in our case, nationalism and a little bit of protectionism are winning out," Mr. Niederauer told CNBC television. He told the Financial Times that he misjudged the response of European regulators to the deal.

Mr. Niederauer and his Deutsche Boerse counterpart, Reto Francioni, have said they still strongly advocate the deal, while emphasizing that each company could continue to survive alone.

Analysts say that there was some relief that the CEOs didn't give in to pressure from the EU by offering to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex unit or NYSE Euronext's Liffe derivatives business, as that would have destroyed the transaction's business logic.

There also were political fears in Europe that although the deal would create a European champion, regional jobs, tax revenue and exchange regulation would be lost through the merger. Since NYSE Group Inc. took over Euronext NV in 2007, the merged group's exchanges in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon have effectively become peripheral regional branches.

There is a 250 million euro ($328.6 million) breakup fee that one of the merger partners would have to pay to the other if it decided on its own to walk away from the deal. However, this doesn't apply if the deal is killed because of regulators, according to the merger documents.

The breakup fee applies, however, if either strikes a new deal with a third party that takes 40% or more in equity within nine months of this deal's termination. That would discourage both from doing another big deal and limit them to bolt-on acquisitions in that time, said one person familiar with the matter.
That is in line with recent comments by Mr. Niederauer to CNBC that near-term consolidation in the sector
"appears to be challenging" and that it would be more appropriate to look for "bolt-on" deals.

The merger offer expires on March 31. All regulatory approvals would have to be secured by that date for the deal to go through.
It wasn't immediately clear whether both companies plan to challenge the EU verdict.

Mr. Niederauer has said NYSE Euronext could consider challenging the EU decision in court, but that would be unlikely to overturn the EU verdict before March 31.

A legal challenge could, however, help influence a precedent over how over-the-counter derivatives are viewed in such deals in the future.

NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to prohibit its proposed combination with Deutsche Boerse, the companies are in discussions to terminate their  merger agreement.

NYSE Euronext said it would focus on the successful standalone strategy that has delivered strong growth and diversification of its core businesses and that it would leverage its financial strength to return capital to shareholders.

Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Officer said: "I'm extremely proud of the efforts of the entire NYSE Euronext team over the last year. While effectively advancing our proposed merger on to the final step, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver the commitments we made to our shareholders.

"While we viewed the merger as a way to accelerate our plans, our existing business model was always central to our strategy. Our business had a strongyear, giving us the opportunity to return more capital to our shareholders, as evidenced by today's buy-back announcement.

"We will also take advantage of our financial strength to capture opportunities for growth in derivatives, and through our new initiatives including technology services, NYSE Liffe US/NYPC and post-trade services. And, as always, we will continue the success we have had in optimizing the business through continued cost discipline and operational efficiency.

"In the weeks and months ahead, I look forward to sharing with our investors, employees, customers and partners, the exciting plans we have to continue our growth strategy, build on our reputation as the leading global operator of financial markets and create value for shareholders.

"On behalf of our company, I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by the regulators in our various markets, who worked very hard to accommodate the approval process for our transaction under very tight deadlines."

Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues at Deutsche Börse for their shared vision of the value we would have created for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and for the significant efforts they made to see the deal through to approval."

Following termination of the merger agreement with DB, share repurchases may be executed at the discretion of management in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to applicable United States and European laws, regulations and approvals, strategic considerations, market conditions and other factors. The
$550 million buy-back is being executed under a $1.0 billion Board authorization established in March of 2008.

NYSE CEO: Appeal Possible,  Clearing Strategy Again a Focus
By Jacob Bunge

NYSE Euronext may revive a plan to build its own  European trade-clearing facility, and will continue to look at bolt-on deals for its technology arm, Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said after regulators blocked the planned merger with Deutsche Börse AG.

Mr. Niederauer said the exchange operators may appeal the decision by the  European Commission, although they first need time to review the ruling from Brussels in more detail. The firms on Wednesday began discussions around terminating their  merger deal.

"An appeal is one of the options we should certainly consider," Mr. Niederauer said in an interview Wednesday. "But before we go there, we would like for all of us to have time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think."

NYSE Euronext on Wednesday also announced it would restart a $550 million share-buyback program after the company reports earnings Feb. 10.

The European Union on Wednesday formally prohibited the $17.9 billion exchange combination from proceeding, after EU antitrust authorities determined that the merger would have created a monopoly over exchange-traded futures and options markets in Europe.

Together, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have been estimated to account for 93% of that business, according to Tabb Group. The exchanges had argued that the concentration is much smaller when considering derivatives traded privately among banks, and on foreign-based exchanges.

Mr. Niederauer on Wednesday said that EU regulators' view was skewed and would have been difficult to predict a year ago when the merger was first announced. "I don't think we would've done anything differently, in all honestly," he said.

The executive said he remains on good terms with his Deutsche Börse counterpart, Reto Francioni, and didn't rule out working together in the future.
"There are no hard feelings on either side," Mr. Niederauer said.

The exchange industry will next look to forming smaller-scale partnerships in lieu of megamerger deals, he said, though NYSE Euronext would "not shy away" from larger-scale deals if such a prospect presented itself.

In the near term, NYSE Euronext will look to jump-start a dormant plan to develop in-house trade-clearing services for its European markets, an effort that was shelved after the deal was announced. The merger partners had planned to shift clearing functions to Deutsche Börse's existing Eurex facility.

NYSE Euronext owns the Liffe futures and options exchange and stock exchanges in France, Amsterdam, Belgium and Portugal.

"Our stated strategy had been to build out Liffe Clear and complete that process, and we made pretty good progress on that until the middle of last year," he said. "That work has started again in earnest."

Mr. Niederauer said the exchange group will also keep an eye out for purchases that could expand its NYSE Technologies unit, which aims to bring in $1 billion in revenues by 2015. That business is centered on two
Page 86 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
high-powered data center facilities in the New York and London areas that house a range of trading-oriented services and hardware, which NYSE Euronext still looks to deepen.

The company will also zero in on capital management as it revisits a stand-alone strategy, he said. This is expected to include capital returns and cost-cutting.
"Investors have been patient and supportive and it's time to reward them for that patience and support," he said. Write to Jacob Bunge at  jacob.bunge@dowjones.com

Q&A: NYSE Executives on the Merger's Collapse

NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer and Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels on Wednesday confronted the failure of a tumultuous, year-long  merger effort with Germany's  Deutsche Börse AG, blocked by the European Union over fears that the combined exchange group would hold too much power over derivatives trading in the region.
In an interview, the Big Board managers answered questions about a potential appeal, the relationship with
Deutsche Börse CEO Reto Francioni and the  NYSE's way forward shortly after the  EU decision became official.

WSJ: At the end of a long process here and obviously not the result you desired. Do you feel like you did everything you could on the regulatory front?

Mr. Hessels: Yes, we certainly did. Of course we are disappointed, but we don't really feel defeated. We came into this process very carefully, we pre-notified [the EU] before we came into the process. We reiterated that the market definition is not just exchange-traded derivatives, and not just European derivatives. The US took the position this was a global market already four years ago. But, we look forward.

Mr. Niederauer: I don't think we would've done anything differently, in all honestly. We got right up to the goal line with this transaction and hindsight is always 20-20, but we're more interested in looking forward than backward this week.
WSJ: Will you appeal the ruling in court?

Mr. Niederauer: An appeal is one of the options we should certainly consider. But before we go there we would like for all of us to have time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think. But it's something we both would consider.

WSJ: When was your last conversation with [Deutsche Börse CEO] Reto Francioni? What was the conversation like?

Mr. Niederauer: We talked about 30 or 40 minutes ago. Obviously he shares our disappointment. We both thought the market definition was not a place where we'd be likely to get tripped up. As you and others in the media have reported, the definition of the market [including over-the-counter derivatives and contracts traded on foreign exchanges] is pretty obvious, and it seems obvious to everyone but those reviewing our case.

Mr. Hessels: I would just say that this represents a missed opportunity for capital markets and European capital markets, particularly with regard to markets that are growing in Hong Kong, Singapore, and elsewhere.

WSJ: With Deutsche Börse , do you anticipate that you'll go back to being competitors, or is there possibility for joint ventures?

Mr. Niederauer: I think in our industry you're seeing a lot of partnerships getting formed. I'd remind everybody that one of the ironies is that the [EU] objection centered on derivatives and particularly in interest-rate derivatives, where we and DB compete not at all. It's a bit unfathomable to us, since we have no overlapping products and we're not likely to compete on those products in the future. But Reto and I remain friends. We went through this process together. There are no hard feelings on either side.

WSJ: What's your plan with regard to clearing? You'd been building your own clearinghouse and then shelved that last year in favor of using Deutsche Börse's Eurex. Will you start to build again or look for a different partnership?

Mr. Niederauer: The investors can look forward to hearing a lot of details on our go-forward plan on our earnings call next week, which will include the post-trade space and technology business. People can also expect us to talk about our capital management strategy going forward. Investors have been patient and supportive and it's time to reward them for that patience and support. We do intend to resume our previously authorized buyback
program and work on the expense side as well. Clearing is front and center as well. Our stated strategy had been to build out Liffe Clear and complete that process, and we made pretty good progress on that until the middle of last year. Then we took our foot off the gas. That work has started again in earnest.

WSJ: How does the EU decision change NYSE's growth strategy—as you look toward smaller-scale deals, what gaps do you seek to fill?

Mr. Niederauer: We'll give a little more clarity looking forward on that next week, so I wouldn't speculate on specific assets. But as you've seen, the majority of our M&A has been in the technology arena. No one should be surprised to see that continue. But with three large-scale, cross-border [exchange] deals not getting
consummated in the last year, the industry has to be realistic about what the prospects are going forward. We'll stick with the strategy going forward that we had before but will not be afraid to execute on those types of
[large-scale] opportunities if they arise down the line.
WSJ: Would you consider a deal with [IntercontinentalExchange], as some analysts have thrown out there?

Mr. Niederauer: I wouldn't speculate on that either. Let us get through what we're going through today, and then we'll give everyone more clarity next Friday.

Nasdaq's Greifeld:  NYSE Pact's Failure Won't Stop Other Big Exchange Deals

NEW YORK—The blocked  merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse won't preclude other large exchange mergers from taking place, the head of Big Board rival Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said Wednesday.

Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said he was "empathetic" to the management teams of both exchange companies after word European regulators had moved to prohibit the planned $17 billion combination. Earlier Wednesday, executives from Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext said the  European Union concluded the merger "would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market."

"I do not think it will preclude other large exchange deals from happening," Mr. Greifeld said. But he added that regulators had now sent the message that transactions resulting in over 90% market share are "highly suspect." The latter remark was a reference to the dominating position the two companies would have had in Europe's
on-exchange derivatives market, which had been estimated at a 93% market share.

The comments were made during a conference call with analysts discussing Nasdaq's fourth-quarter earnings report.

Deutsche and NYSE Euronextmerger blocked

The European Commission is prohibiting the planned  merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext because it considers the  merger to be inadmissible under competition law.

The executive board of Deutsche Börse responded: “This is a black day for  Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets. The  EU Commission’s decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. The over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, the major part of the market as a whole, is completely precluded. We therefore regard the decision as wrong.

“What’ s more, it is inconsistent and runs counter to the aim of extending financial market regulation to the OTC derivatives market which the Commission is simultaneously pursuing. In its decision, the European Commission also takes a contrary stand to the assessment of the derivatives market arrived at in the USA back in 2007. There, the two Chicago exchanges CME and CBOT were allowed to merge to form the largest globally operating derivatives exchange.”

Reto Francioni, CEO of Deutsche Börse AG, added: “Prohibiting the planned merger prevents the creation of a European-based, globally competitive exchange group. The merged exchange group would have been the ideal partner to European regulators when it came to providing support in establishing standardised, transparent and stable markets in Europe and worldwide. Deutsche Börse is well equipped and strong enough to grow further and be successful, even without the merger, and will continue to work in partnership with government to promote the stability and integrity of markets.

The European Commission’s decision stands in contrast to approval already obtained from many other major regulators. Approval had already been granted in Germany by the Bundesamt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin), in Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), and in the USA by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the Department of Justice (DOJ) as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The shareholders of both companies supported the planned merger. Document GLI0000020120328e8210000h

After Veto, Europe’s  Exchanges  Gird for Derivatives Battle

From the moment Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext announced their proposed  merger a year ago, their competitors began ringing the antitrust alarm. Not about stocks, mind you. Although the two companies operate six major stock exchanges across  Europe and the U.S., regulatory and technological changes have made equity trading a competitive free-for-all, to the extent that the New York Stock Exchange today handles less than a quarter of the volume in  NYSE-listed stocks. No, what competitors really complained about was the stranglehold that the combined company would have had on the fast-growing business of exchange-traded derivatives in  Europe.

The listed derivatives market has remained extraordinarily concentrated even as it has grown dramatically over the past decade. The trading volume of European equity index futures and options reached 1.4 billion in 2010, with a notional value of $52 trillion, according to research by Hamburg-based Berenberg Bank. Both figures represented a fivefold increase from 2000. Trading in European interest rate derivatives tripled over the same period, to 1.2 billion contracts, while the notional value of those contracts was six times larger, at $730 trillion. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex subsidiary and NYSE Euronext’s London-based NYSE Liffe dominate the space, and a merger would have created a virtual monopoly. The two exchanges together control more than 95 percent of all trading in European listed interest rate futures and options, and more than 80 percent of all listed equity index futures and options, according to Richard Perrott, a London-based analyst who covers diversified financials for Berenberg.

Those numbers prompted the European Commission to block the proposed $7.4 billion deal February 1. The derivatives markets “are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive,” said Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner. “We tried to find a solution, but
the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns.”

The commission’s veto won’t be the final word on competition. A revolution is gathering force that rules out any return to the status quo. European regulators are pressing ahead with new legislation that aims to foster greater transparency and competition in both listed and over-the-counter derivatives. The moves, if adopted, threaten to shatter the lucrative duopoly enjoyed by Eurex and Liffe.

Rivals, meanwhile, are already planning their own assault on the market leaders. The London Stock Exchange Group and BATS Chi-X Europe, an electronic upstart that has shaken up European equity trading in the past five years, are pursuing a variety of strategies to grab a bigger slice of the derivatives pie, from creating their own, customized stock indexes to launching derivatives platforms to trying to acquire their own clearing services.
These initiatives promise to unleash the same kind of competitive whirlwind in the derivatives markets that Europe has seen in equities.

“We’d be in a situation where derivatives trading would be much more akin to equity trading as barriers to entry broke down and margins dropped, but derivatives clearing would still remain attractive — and profitable,” says Berenberg’s Perrott. “Open interest stays open for a long time at derivatives clearinghouses, and that will still give their owners a competitive advantage.”

The reasons for the interest in derivatives are simple and powerful. The financial crisis has dampened trading in equities and provided a spur to futures and options, which give investors a quick and low-cost way to take on or hedge exposure to asset classes ranging from stocks to bonds to commodities. Consider the experience of Deutsche Börse. The Eurex unit, which handles derivatives trading and clearing, is by far the group’s largest business, generating 45.5 percent of its overall revenue — a hefty €275.1 million ($374 million) — in the quarter ended September 30, 2011. That was more than three times the €76.6 million in revenue produced by the group’s cash equity trading and listings subsidiary, Xetra. Eurex may be a mature business, but it is still growing strongly:

Page 94 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Revenue was up 40 percent year-over-year in the quarter ended September 30. A similar dynamic is evident at NYSE Euronext, where exchange-traded derivatives revenue rose 20 percent in the September quarter, to $226 million, or 32.1 percent of the company’s total sales. For rival exchanges eager to diversify their revenue sources and drive growth, derivatives are an obvious target.

New entrants will face some stiff challenges in trying to fulfill their ambitions, however. Derivatives differ from cash equities in ways that have tended to stymie competition. Shares of SAP, the German enterprise software maker that is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, are the same wherever they trade. If an upstart electronic exchange can provide a faster, cheaper way to trade the stock than Deutsche Börse, where SAP is listed, that exchange can win a significant percentage of the trading volume. (Last month, according to data from Thomson Reuters, BATS Chi-X Europe handled 34 percent of the volume in SAP, compared with 56 percent for Deutsche Börse.) Such increased competition was the whole rationale behind the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, the 2007 law known as MiFID. The sweeping regulatory reform abolished concentration rules, whereby many countries had required trading to go through one central exchange, and instead directed brokerages to provide best execution service to their clients. The rule fueled the rise of new players, known as multilateral trading facilities, or MTFs, the most prominent of which were Chi-X Europe; Turquoise Global
Holdings, which is owned 51 percent by LSE Group and the remainder by a dozen banks; and BATS Europe. Their success prompted Lenexa, Kansas–based BATS Global Markets to acquire Chi-X in December and merge their two companies into BATS Chi-X Europe, a powerhouse that controls about a quarter of European equity trading.

By contrast, listed derivatives are proprietary products controlled zealously by individual exchanges. If an exchange can develop a hot product, as Eurex has done with its futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 and European government bonds and Liffe has done with futures on Eurodollar interest rates and the FTSE 100 stock index, it can enjoy a near-monopoly position in that product. Extended periods of open interest also work to deter derivatives traders from switching among trading venues, especially in a world where the vertical silo model — under which an exchange controls both trading and clearing — holds sway.

Deutsche Börse CEO Reto Francioni underscored those competitive advantages in a speech at the Euro Finance Week conference in Frankfurt in mid-November. “The future belongs to integrated exchanges because they offer market participants a single port of call for secure and reliable transaction processing,” he said, noting that even some competitors that criticize vertical integration are seeking to adopt the model. London Stock Exchange Group, for instance, has complained to EU authorities for years about Deutsche Börse’s integrated silo, but it currently is
in talks to acquire control of its main U.K. clearing provider, LCH.Clearnet Group.

European regulators are acutely aware of the problem. The Commission, the European Union’s executive agency, blocked the Deutsche Börse–NYSE Euronext merger precisely because it would have created a mammoth company with overwhelming dominance of the European market for trading and clearing
exchange-listed derivatives — a “near-monopoly,” as Almunia put it. Such a development would run counter to the Commission’s efforts in recent years to level the playing field and promote greater competition among European exchanges.

In October the Commission released a draft proposal of a revised directive known as MiFID II that seeks to strengthen the transformative changes wrought by its predecessor and increase competition in derivatives markets. The draft calls for two significant alterations in market structure that would directly impact derivatives exchanges and their parent companies. The first change would force incumbent exchanges to license their indexes to rivals, effectively tearing down the proprietary walls in the derivatives markets. Deutsche Börse, which co-owns index provider Stoxx along with SIX Swiss Exchange, is likely to resist such a requirement fiercely; contracts based on the Euro Stoxx 50 are among the most popular and heavily traded derivatives products in Europe.

The second proposed change would introduce open access for derivatives clearing. Such a move would require the largest clearinghouses, like Eurex Clearing, to clear trades conducted on other exchanges and allow customers to net the margins they post on competing but similar derivatives contracts. That could provide a big boost to the ambitions of rival marketplaces. Currently, any exchange looking to compete with Eurex or Liffe has to organize its own clearing arrangements for clients. Those arrangements require clients to post additional
margin and prevent them from being able to offset trading positions, or open interest, they hold with other venues. The higher costs effectively deter broker-dealers and other market participants from shifting their trading volume away from the incumbents. Not surprisingly, smashing open the vertical silo model has become one of the top priorities for challengers like LSE, which launched its own competing derivatives platform, Turquoise Derivatives, in May 2011.

The EU is also working to finalize a piece of legislation — the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, known as EMIR — that aims to have a similar impact on over-the-counter derivatives. The law will require OTC derivative trades to be channeled through a clearinghouse and will mandate that firms report data about their
trades to a central trade data repository. Analysts believe the regulation, which is expected to be approved by the European Council and the European Parliament later this year and come into force in 2013, will foster more transparency in OTC transactions — and greater competition among central counterparty clearinghouses.

The road from draft proposals to final legislation is a lengthy one, and exchanges will be lobbying aggressively in coming months to shape the final rules. Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext can be counted on to put up particularly stiff opposition, judging by their unwillingness to offer much in the way of remedies in their failed attempt to win approval for their merger. The two companies had argued that the proposed deal should be viewed in a global context and pointed out that Chicago-based CME Group was allowed to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade for $11.2 billion in 2007, creating the world’s largest derivatives exchange.

The German and U.S. exchange operators had suggested three potential concessions. The first was to offer to divest NYSE Liffe’s single-stock futures and options, which would have had almost no impact on the combined group’s market share and profits. The second was to offer to relax the criteria whereby competitors could clear their own equity index and interest rate products at Eurex Clearing, a proposal that stopped well short of the full access that competitors had sought. Third, the parties said they would allow competitors interested in launching rival interest rate derivatives to license Eurex’s trading technology. Those half measures played a big role in the Commission’s decision to block the deal, analysts say.
“Competition authorities didn’t like the idea of combining Eurex and Liffe full stop and were pushing for divestment
— or, at the very least, a stronger potential remedy,” says Berenberg’s Perrott.

Will Rhode, a London-based senior analyst with TABB Group, a New York–based financial market research firm, predicts an intensive period of infighting to define the final MiFID II rules. “There is a lobbying window open right now in Europe that may last from six to nine months, during which time all market participants are going to have to consider which hills they’re prepared to die on, which hills they’re willing to give away,” he says.

The troubles of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext offer the latest evidence that the exchange industry is like few others. Technological developments and increases in cross-border capital flows are acting as powerful drivers for consolidation, but the forces of regulation and nationalism are pushing just as hard in the opposite direction.

Singapore Exchange set off a flurry of merger activity in October 2010 when it announced an agreed-upon A$8.4 billion ($8.86 billion) offer for ASX, operator of the Australian Securities Exchange. SGX CEO Magnus Böcker said the deal would allow the combined company to play a leading role in shifting the world’s capital markets
toward the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. Three months later LSE made its own international move by reaching an agreement to acquire Toronto-based exchange operator TMX Group for C$3.6 billion ($3.56 billion). And just six days after the LSE-Toronto deal, Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext unveiled their blockbuster deal.

Rarely have so many been so frustrated. In April 2011, Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan blocked the takeover of the Sydney-based exchange, bowing to domestic protest over the Singapore government’s role in the deal. (A vehicle of its sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, owns 23.5 percent of SGX.) “It’s not the right deal for Australia if we want to ensure the strength and stability of our financial system,” Swan said. Canada’s response was more subtle but equally effective: In June a group of 13 Canadian banks and pension funds calling
themselves Maple Group countered with a higher bid for the Toronto exchange and sent LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet away empty-handed. The EU rebuff to Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext provided the most dramatic setback yet to the would-be consolidators and will almost certainly prompt a major rethinking of strategy by key players.

“Isn’t it time to step back and ask what it is we are trying to achieve?” says Georges Ugeux, chairman and CEO of New York–based investment banking consulting firm Galileo Global Advisors, and a former NYSE executive. “Because the basic question that the exchanges must answer is, what is the added value that globalization can create in the securities markets? Once they answer that question, then perhaps they can look for solutions that create value — and not just for more mergers and acquisitions.”

The growth-by-takeover model may prove a hard habit to break. Developing a new business from scratch is a much riskier prospect than buying one outright. Yet a few entrepreneurial efforts do exist. At the same time that LSE was pursuing Toronto, its Turquoise subsidiary was launching its own pan-European futures and options platform, Turquoise Derivatives.

Page 96 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
“We wanted to get ahead of the curve and bring competition to exchange-traded derivatives,” says Turquoise Global Holdings CEO Adrian Farnham. “We decided to demonstrate that it is possible, so we put ourselves in a position where as market structures evolve we will be able to offer customers a choice of trading venue.”

Turquoise Derivatives represents the first effort by a European MTF (admittedly, one backed by the full weight of LSE) to loosen the competitive stranglehold that Eurex and Liffe hold over exchange-traded derivatives, but it wasn’t built from scratch. Turquoise developed it on the back of EDX London, a derivatives venture LSE launched in 2003 that operated only in the niche markets of Norwegian single-stock futures and options and Russian depositary receipts.

The new exchange was an innovator in another respect: Turquoise Derivatives adopted a so-called maker-taker pricing system, a model pioneered by alternative equity-trading venues in the U.S. and Europe that uses rebates to build traffic. The company offers rebate fees — currently 5 pence (7.8 cents) per contract — to customers that “make” liquidity by supplying bid-offer quotes on the trading book, and it charges a “take” fee of 20 pence a contract to clients that remove liquidity by hitting those bids and offers. Although it remains to be seen whether that equity pricing model will work effectively in the exchange-traded derivatives market, some industry participants are impressed with Turquoise’s sheer moxie in launching the platform.

“Turquoise did well to take first-mover advantage and get into listed derivatives,” says Daryl McDonald, who is responsible for global equity execution strategy at investment bank Jefferies International in London. “Since the LSE already had EDX in place, Turquoise was able to leverage off that existing platform to build capacity quickly and diversify its product offerings.”

Capacity alone does not create trading flows, however; brand-name products do. From the outset Turquoise tested its rivals’ willingness to tolerate competition by asking for permission to access their intellectual property, first approaching Eurex for a license to list products based on its Euro Stoxx 50 Index. The German company summarily denied the request. Thanks to its relationship with LSE, which co-owns FTSE Group, Turquoise was able to obtain a license to list futures and options based on the FTSE 100 stock index, the leading U.K. blue-chip index. Turquoise Derivatives started trading FTSE 100 index futures in June, but results so far have been modest, to say the least. Through December only 4,308 contracts, with a notional value of £233.4 million ($363.9 million), changed hands. FTSE 100 index options, which began trading in September, have seen more action, with volume reaching 15,518 contracts by year-end, representing a notional value of £804.3 million.
Growing that volume won’t be easy. Both Turquoise Derivatives and Liffe offer futures and options on the FTSE
100 index and use London-based LCH.Clearnet for central counterparty services, but under current arrangements
customers cannot offset the margins they hold on trading positions at Turquoise against those held on positions
of similar contracts at Liffe. For a newcomer trying to win market share from Liffe, that’s a big hurdle for Turquoise
to overcome.

“This is where the farcical nature of the current market structure becomes obvious, and it’s easy to understand why it needs to change,” says TABB Group’s Rhode. “Customers are frustrated.”

Regulatory change may eventually transform clearing — and do much to support greater competition among trading venues — but that hasn’t stopped LSE from looking to create its own version of a vertical silo. In September 2011 the company announced it was in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet to acquire a 51 percent stake. The agreement marked something of a coup for CEO Rolet, who had turned to the clearer on the rebound from his failed bid for TMX. LSE’s offer valued LCH.Clearnet — which is owned 83 percent by market participants, 9 percent by NYSE Euronext and 8 percent by the London Metal Exchange — at approximately €1 billion ($1.35 billion). It beat a rival bid from London-based financial information services firm Markit Group. The two sides had not completed the deal as of late last month.

Securing the clearinghouse would give Rolet and his team an enhanced ability to oversee the entire ecosystem of equity and derivatives trading, clearing, counterparty services and custody. It could also give LSE the chance to capitalize on future market opportunities like the introduction of EMIR, which will push some OTC derivatives into more-formalized clearing arrangements by 2013. LCH.Clearnet already has the capacity and expertise to handle
a broad range of products, from cash equities to complex OTC swaps and derivatives, and its regional importance as a central counterparty clearinghouse, or CCP, is likely to grow.

Rolet might be in a greater hurry now that the Deutsche Börse–NYSE Euronext merger has fallen apart. That megamerger would have given Liffe direct access to Eurex Clearing, with all of the attendant cost efficiencies and cross-margining possibilities of a consolidated business. In the wake of the EU veto, NYSE Euronext might seek to create a vertical silo of its own, perhaps by making a rival bid for LCH.Clearnet. “It is possible that NYSE could

Page 97 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
go after LCH and try to outbid the LSE — or break into that transaction,” says a former Liffe executive who has been avidly following events from the sidelines and spoke on condition of anonymity.

LSE may need to get the LCH.Clearnet deal done to protect its own autonomy. In the four years since his arrival as CEO, Rolet has integrated Borsa Italiana, which LSE acquired in 2007, and struck a joint venture arrangement with Tokyo Stock Exchange Group, but he has not been able to pull off an acquisition to extend the group’s geographic reach or diversify its revenue sources. Without the TMX deal, LSE could find itself becoming a takeover target once again. Deutsche Börse, which made two failed bids for its London rival in the 2000s, might take another shot at London now that it is without a partner. Nasdaq OMX Group, another failed suitor, which last bid in 2006, also might be interested in making a fresh attempt to create a transatlantic marketplace, analysts say. The exchange has struggled to chart a clear direction since it failed to pry NYSE Euronext away from the
Germans with a counteroffer last year. Nasdaq’s hefty debt burden could limit CEO Robert Greifeld’s ambitions, though.

“The LCH.Clearnet deal is obviously going to be good for the London Stock Exchange Group, especially since coming regulation will require standardized OTC contracts to be centrally cleared, but the company still needs a new strategic exchange partner,” says one investment banker, who requested not to be named. “Otherwise the executive team will have to keep looking over their shoulders, and Nasdaq will be right there.”

The other new entrant on the European derivatives scene is BATS Chi-X Europe. Chi-X took advantage of MiFID to win a big chunk of European equity trading. It boasted a market share of 20.7 percent in December, compared with 5.4 percent for LSE’s Turquoise and 4.6 percent for BATS Europe. With the financial and technological backing of BATS and the clout of a combined market share of more than 25 percent, BATS Chi-X Europe aims to make similar inroads in the futures and options markets.

Former Chi-X Europe CEO Alasdair Haynes had tried to get Chi-X Europe’s prices included in the calculations of the major indexes, like the FTSE 100, as a precursor to launching market data services and creating index-based derivative products. But FTSE Group rebuffed him.

Not to be denied, Chi-X teamed up with Russell Investments to create a new set of benchmarks, the Chi-X Europe Russell Index series, or Cheri indexes. Launched in October 2011, the series aims to fill a gap between existing blue-chip and diversified indexes. The flagship Cheri PanEurope Index, for example, was engineered to split the difference between the Stoxx Europe 600, a broad index that contains many less-liquid securities, and the FTSE 100, which contains the largest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Cheri PanEurope Index encompasses a broader range of 216 large-cap stocks from 14 European countries and five currencies, all drawn from the Russell 1000 Index universe of large-cap stocks.

Mark Hemsley, the former CEO of BATS Europe who has taken over from Haynes as CEO of BATS Chi-X Europe, has not yet disclosed his plans for the Cheri indexes — BATS executives are in a quiet period in preparation for the company’s initial public offering early this year — but he has long shared a common approach with Chi-X Europe’s executives of targeting data services and derivatives as growth areas.

Whether or not EU regulators require incumbents to license their indexes, BATS Chi-X Europe can control its own destiny by maintaining the relationship with Russell and rolling out its own derivatives products.

Self-determination will be a valuable commodity in the months ahead. And newcomers can count on having regulatory momentum on their side. The incumbents are powerful players, though, and they will work hard to defend their valuable franchises. The fight for Europe’s derivatives markets has only just begun. • •

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deutsche Börse AG (Deutsche Börse) and NYSE Euronext have been informed that the European Commission today has decided to prohibit their proposed business combination.
Despite the remedies offered by the companies, the European Commission concluded that the combination would significantly impede effective competition and declared the concentration to be incompatible with the Common Market.
Upon receipt of the official notification of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext of this decision by the European Commission, it will become impossible to fulfill the completion condition for the exchange offer made by Alpha Beta Netherlands Holding N.V. to the shareholders of Deutsche
Börse on May 4, 2011, as amended, that clearance by the European Commission must be received on or prior to March 31, 2012. Upon receipt of the
official notification of the prohibition decision, the exchange offer will therefore automatically lapse.
Alpha Beta Netherlands Holding N.V. will publish the termination of the exchange offer and will unwind (rückabwickeln) the exchange offer in accordance with the exchange offer terms.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext cancelled their mega-merger Thursday after  European regulators vetoed the deal.

The decision to abandon the plan to create the world's largest exchange operator potentially dominating the global derivatives trade was expected after the  European Commission on Wednesday rejected it.

"NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the European Commission to block the proposed merger agreement, both companies have agreed to a mutual termination of the business combination agreement originally signed by the companies on February 15, 2011," NYSE Euronext said in a brief statement.

The European Commission said Wednesday it had "no alternative" but to veto the transatlantic tie-up, billed as a merger but which would have left the German side dominant in the combined company.
The EC had expressed worries that it would have had monopolistic power in certain derivatives trading.

But NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse had refused recommendations to hive off some of the business that the merger would have covered.
"We could only have allowed a merger if the parties had offered sufficient remedies" to regulator worries, the
European Union's senior competition regulator Joaquin Almunia said on Wednesday.
"Unfortunately they only offered remedies limited in their scope," he said.

Well-steeled in advance for losing the chance to become the world's biggest market operator, Deutsche Boerse said Wednesday the decision showed the EU was "out of touch with reality."
"This is a dark day for Europe and its future competitiveness on global financial markets," it raged. Deutsche Boerse chief Reto Francioni called the decision "inconsistent with and even contradictory to the
Commission's stated aim of expanding regulation on the over-the-counter derivatives market."
NYSE Euronext, which includes the New York Stock Exchange and exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam, said the
EC decision was "based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market."

"As we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination," said NYSE Euronext chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels.

In pursuing the deal, the two had to fend off a competing $11.3 billion bid by the Nasdaq and ICE exchanges for NYSE Euronext, which they had said valued NYSE Euronext at nearly 20 percent more than the German suitor's valuation.

But that aggressive bid was ultimately scotched when US regulators signaled they would oppose it on anti-trust grounds.

Analysts say Deutsche Boerse is better positioned than its US counterpart, anyway, because it is active across the whole range of activities, from its Xetra electronic stock-trading platform, to its Eurex derivatives market and its Luxembourg-based clearing subsidiary, Clearstream.


Page 105 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Deutsche Boerse generates just 12 percent of its revenues from the highly competitive, low-margin stock-trading activities, while in the case of NYSE Euronext it accounts for around half of overall business.

Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 1.25 percent in early trade Thursday after losing 0.5 percent Wednesday on the EC rejection of the deal.
In Frankfurt Deutsche Boerse shares rose 2.1 percent.

Rival US derivatives and commodities exchange operator CME meanwhile saw its share price jump nearly five percent on the news.

EU vetoes Deutsche Boerse-NYSE merger

European Union regulators vetoed Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding the merger would hurt competition.

"Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext have been informed that the  European Commission on Wednesday has decided to prohibit their proposed business combination," the companies said in a statement. "Despite the remedies offered by the companies, the  European Commission concluded that the combination would significantly impede effective competition."

Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire its New York rival in a deal valued at $9.5 billion when it was announced last February. Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3 billion as Deutsche Boerse shares fell. The companies appealed directly to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that an EU ban would harm European exchanges and drive business to other parts of the world.

Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US justice department threatened to sue. Singapore Exchange's (SGX) $8.8 billion bid for ASX collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal wasn't in the national interest.
The merger prohibition is the EU's fourth since 2004. Document AIWFIE0020120201e8220002y

EU blocks  $10B merger of exchanges

BRUSSELS - The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with NYSE
Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said it opposed the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 percent of the trading in European derivatives - complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.
It said the combined company's dominance would have made it almost impossible for rivals to compete .

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. "These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, which hoped that combining their businesses would have let them compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

But it also underlines the profound transformation their businesses - and financial markets as a whole - have undergone over the past decade. Today, the value of outstanding derivatives contracts has surpassed by many times the value of traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext both managed to build highly profitable businesses out of this trend and today own Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges.
To make the merger acceptable, the commission wanted the companies to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or
NYSE Euronext's Liffe, something they refused.

European regulators block exchange merger;  NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Boerse deal would have led to
futures  monopoly: EU

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse could try to put the disappointment of their failed $7.4-billion  merger deal behind them by turning their attention to  European exchange and clearing assets, and a less ambitious growth path.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE's proposal to create the world's largest exchange operator was rejected by European anti-trust authorities Wednesday, making it the fourth to be blocked among a series of large exchange deals struck in a frenzy of activity last year.

Now, the exchange operators need another way of facing the imperatives that led them to seek mergers in the first place: the need for scale and cost savings amid global competition.

NYSE chief executive Duncan Niederauer, in an interview last week in Davos, said the company had another strategy it had been pursuing even as it tried to close the Deutsche Boerse deal.
"We will continue to be primarily focused on the derivatives and technologies businesses."

On Wednesday, NYSE said it plans to return $550 million to shareholders through a share-repurchase program and to seek to grow its derivatives business.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse also have been linked in media reports with the London Metal Exchange (LME), the metals market that has been put up for sale by shareholders.

A move on the LME would pitch them into a wide field thought to include the Intercontinental-Exchange and CME Group from the United States, and the London Stock Exchange and British broker ICAP.

NYSE Euronext also is seen by analysts as an obvious rival bidder for European clearing house LCH Clearnet, which has been in exclusive sales talks with the London Stock Exchange since September.

NYSE was in talks about a possible joint bid for LCH with data vendor Markit, but the plan was scrapped in the middle part of last year.

Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob Greifeld said large deals are still feasible, but companies would need to take into account the regulator's analysis of the market.

"Now, when you look at this, any time you are trying to complete a merger where the number of competitors is low or the market share is high, your success will hinge on whether you can broaden the definition of the market," he told a conference call after Nasdaq posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings.

Among other failed deals were Nasdaq and Intercontinental-Exchange's bid for NYSE Euronext, which was rejected by the U.S. Department of Justice, London Stock Exchange's takeover of TMX Group was halted by shareholders of the Toronto Stock Exchange operator, and Singapore Exchange Ltd.'s bid for Australia's ASX Ltd. was blocked by the Australian government.

zz Deal 'not good for competition'

EU regulators have vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the European Commission said yesterday. "Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.
Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange operator in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (about
R74bn) when it was announced in February last year.
Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3bn as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell.

The companies appealed to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that a ban would drive business to other parts of the world.

"This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," Deutsche Boerse said. "The European Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong."
The merger prohibition is the commission's fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and
IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US Justice Department
threatened to sue.

Singapore Exchange's $8.8bn bid for ASX collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal was not in the national interest.

"I fully expect consolidation to continue in the industry," said Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London. "This last year was a disaster for the exchanges that wanted to merge, but in this deal it was clear from the start it was going to be tricky. You were looking to combine the two dominant derivatives exchanges in Europe."

The merger would have put more than 90 percent of Europe's exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 percent of stock trading in the hands of one company.

Deutsche Boerse's Eurex is the region's biggest derivatives exchange, while NYSE's Liffe is the second-largest. They had offered to sell overlapping businesses and give rivals access to post-trade services as they struggled to convince regulators that the merger wouldn't stifle competition in derivatives and clearing.

After the prohibition, they said they would focus on their stand-alone strategies and were negotiating to terminate their merger. NYSE Euronext said it would resume a $550 million stock repurchase programme after reporting earnings next Friday and after formal termination of the deal. - Bloomberg

zz Deal 'not good for competition'

EU regulators have vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the European Commission said yesterday. "Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.
Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange operator in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (about
R74bn) when it was announced in February last year.
Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3bn as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell.

EU blocks  $10 billion merger between Deutsche Boerse, NYSE

BRUSSELS — The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the  Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with
NYSE Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said it was ruling against the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 percent of the trading in European derivatives — complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.

It said that the combined company's dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," the EU's Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
"These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The Commission's decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, which hoped combining their businesses would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

But it also underlines the profound transformation their businesses — and financial markets as a whole — have undergone over the past decade. Today, the value of outstanding derivatives contracts has surpassed by many times the value of traditional financial products like stocks and bonds.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext both managed to build highly profitable businesses out of this trend and today own Europe's biggest derivatives exchanges. A push from regulators across the globe to push more derivative trades onto exchanges to make the market more transparent has opened even bigger opportunities for established players.

EU Barroso: Committed To Keeping Fair, Vigilant  Antitrust System

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)-  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso issued a stout defense of the regional bloc's antitrust policies Thursday, saying its competition system was a "model" of independence and "diligence."

Speaking at a seminar on competition policy in Brussels the day after the European Union's antitrust authorities blocked the merger of global exchanges  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE) and NYSE Euronext (NYX), Barroso said the commission has "one of the best competition systems in the world."

"Despite the criticism we sometimes face for our decisions, European competition law is cited as a model of independence, coherence and objectivity," he said, according to a text of his remarks.

Barroso said the EU would continue battling against monopolies and protectionism, saying these have "an immensely corrosive effect" on the economy and society.
But he acknowledged the EU must "work hard" to keep its antitrust system running well.

"Today, and moving forward, we are committed to keeping our system vigilant, fair, open and capable of evolving with the times," he said.

EU Almunia: NYSE-Deutsche Boerse Merger Block Proof Of EU Vigilance

BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- The European Union's antitrust chief Thursday defended the decision to block a proposed merger between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE), reiterating it would have resulted in a "quasi monopoly" that would have harmed consumers.

Joaquin Almunia, the  EU's competition commissioner, said the decision was proof of how seriously the  EU takes competition regulation.

"The latest proof of our continued vigilance is in today's papers. Yesterday, the European Commission prohibited the proposed merger between Deutsche Boerse and New York Stock Exchange - Euronext," he said.

Almunia said the decision was a rare one. "I rarely have to propose the prohibition of a merger; since I took office, this is the second time. This means that I do not do so lightly; but I have done and will continue to do so whenever necessary," he said.

The proposed US$18.1 billion tie-up had been in the hands of EU competition officials for the past 18 months, before the announcement of their decision Wednesday.

Almunia said the EU had tried to reach an agreement with the two companies involved, but in the end their offers had been insufficient to quell concerns that the merger would result in an unacceptable outcome.

"We tried to find a solution with the two companies; but unfortunately the remedies they proposed were too limited," he said.

Deutsche Boerse, NYSE Euronext  Abandon  Merger Deal

Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) on Thursday officially ended their year-long
merger push, abandoning their agreement after the European Union on Wednesday blocked the deal.

Both exchange companies agreed to a "mutual termination" of the  merger plan. No break-up fee will be paid on account of the deal falling apart due to regulatory pushback.

The European Commission on Wednesday formally rejected the $17 billion combination, on grounds that it would create a "quasi-monopoly" over European exchange-traded derivatives markets. Together the two firms hold an estimated 93% of such business.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse had objected to the antitrust verdict, arguing that it disregarded the market in privately traded swap contracts and foreign-based exchanges, both of which represent competition.

Though no longer pushing to merge, the companies may yet appeal the matter to European courts in an effort to overturn the legal precedent.
The merger was officially unveiled Feb. 15, 2011.

Brussels blocks  £6.3bn tie–up to create top global exchange
By Bruno Waterfield in Brussels

THE European Commission yesterday blocked a £6.3bn  merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE
Euronext that would have created the world's largest exchange.
Brussels' decision delivered a devastating blow to the emergence of Frankfurt to rival London for dominance in
European and world markets.

Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, insisted that the merger would have given DB–NYSE a "near monopoly" with more than 90pc of the world's market in exchange–traded derivatives.

"The merger would have led to the worsening of conditions for companies trying to access financial instruments and would have harmed the European economy as a whole," he said.

"We found ample evidence in our investigation that Eurex–DB and Liffe–NYSE Euronext compete head–to–head and are each other's closest competitors. These two companies constrain each other's prices and compete in product and technology innovation. Therefore, the merger would have eliminated a healthy process of competition."

Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Boerse, reacted angrily, saying the commission had failed to support a "globally competitive" European exchange.

"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets," he said. To make the merger acceptable, the commission had asked the companies to sell either Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or NYSE
Euronext's Liffe, "remedies" that both parties refused.

Jan–Michiel Hessels, NYSE Euronext chairman said: "While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on."

The ruling followed a furious debate within the commission and a campaign by Michel Barnier, the financial services commissioner, in favour of the merger to create a new "European champion" in global markets.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext‘s  merger was blocked by the European Commission (EC) because the
CEO of the German stock exchange operator, Reto Francioni, did not assess the situation correctly.

Both Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext were so convinced that the  EC will approve the planned  merger that until recently they did not take seriously the concerns of the  European anti-trust authority. The two companies
had assumed that the  European watchdog would not be able to resist the opportunity to create a leading company on the global stock exchange market with a strong  European base.
However, competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia and his colleagues were not impressed by Deutsche
Boerse and NYSE Euronext‘s plans.
Moreover, Francioni did not manage to secure any political support for the planned merger.

FINANCIAL MARKETS : COMMISSION BLOCKS NYSE-DEUTSCHE BÖRSE MERGER
928 words
2 February 2012

English

A proposed merger between NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Börse has been blocked by the  European Commission. The decision to this effect, announced on 1 February, will prohibit the  merger between the exchanges of New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon on one side, and Frankfurt on the other, on the basis that the  merger would have created a quasi-monopoly on global trading of  European financial derivatives on these exchanges.

Following an 90-minute-long debate, the College of Commissioners backed their colleague in charge of competition, Joaquín Almunia, who declared that this  merger would damage competition on the global derivatives market, since 90% of this market is already dominated by Liffe (operated by  NYSE Euronext), which leads trading in short-term interest rates, and Eurex (owned by  Deutsche Börse), leader on the  European market for government bonds.

The proposed merger was announced on 29 June 2011. Subsequently, the Commission decided to carry out an in-depth investigation into the services offered by the merged entity; selling certain assets, and providing access to their clearinghouse for some categories of new contracts. More than 700 stakeholders were consulted during the investigation, which resulted in a 450-page document focusing primarily on the derivatives market.

Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset (eg interest rates and equity). They are used by companies and financial institutions to manage financial risk, and also as an investment vehicle by retail and institutional investors. They can be traded on exchanges - these are highly liquid and relatively small in size (around 100,000 per trade) and are fully standardised contracts in all their legal and economic terms and conditions. However, derivatives which are traded over-the-counter' typically concern much bigger contracts (around 200,000,000 per trade) and allow for customisation' of their legal and economic terms and conditions.
RELEVANT MARKET

Therefore, an economic analysis of these products implicates not just the derivatives market but also that of the underlying assets of the derivatives in question. The Commission's analysis focused on the European market, based on the assumption that if the demand for derivates was global, the provision of financial services would depend on underlying assets, and there is segmentation between European, Asian and American assets. The Commission considered that the European market was the relevant market, because this is where the merged entity would have a dominant position, and there was no substitution with other products whose assets were located elsewhere than in Europe. Therefore, the Commission opposed the argument put forward by Deutsche Börse and NYSE, which claimed that derivatives negotiated over-the-counter (which represent the majority of trading in financial products) would continue to provide important competition for the merger of their exchanges of products derived on markets negotiated on the stock exchange. The Commission defended its decision to focus its analysis on the European market, saying there is no substitution possible because of the compartmentalised markets of the underlying assets, and due to non-substitution of derived products negotiated on the stock exchange and those negotiated over-the-counter.

The 450-page decision explains that if the merger had been authorised, it would have worsened conditions of access to derived financial instruments, and damaged the competition at the heart of the financial system.

"It would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns,' said Commissioner Almunia.

Page 129 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said that certain other companies, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), provide similar services on an international scale, but their activities are marginal in the area of derived products negotiated on the stock exchange. The investigation showed that new competitors would be unlikely to enter the market successfully enough to pose a credible competitive threat to the merged company.

Eurex and Liffe operate closed vertical silos linking their exchange to their own clearing house. The merger would have resulted in a single vertical silo, trading and clearing more than 90% of the global market of European financial ETDs. It would have been difficult for a new player to enter the market because given the advantages of clearing similar contracts in a single clearing house, customers would have been reluctant to trade similar derivatives at another exchange.

"Therefore, the dynamics of the market would have reinforced the monopolistic position of the merger, thus resulting in higher prices and lower incentives to innovate," the Commission said in a statement.
INSUFFICIENT CONCESSIONS

Responding to the Commission's concerns, the two companies offered to sell certain entities on the European shares market (including Bclear) and, in order to maintain competition on the market for futures contracts for indexes and interest rates, to give their competitors access to Eurex Clearing, the German stock exchange's compensation chamber for derivatives.

However, the Commission did not consider this measure sufficient, in particular because it did not extend to existing competing products. There were also fundamental concerns about the feasibility and the effectiveness of such an access remedy.

It seems that neither NYSE Euronext nor Deutsche Börse were expecting this decision. In two separate statements, both companies referred to their "disappointment" and announced that they would continue trading separately.

"This is a black day for Europe and its future competitiveness on the global financial market," said Reto Francioni, CEO of Deutsche Börse.

Regular Deutsche Börse Share Again Included  In The DAX - Changes Will Be Effective  On 8 February

Deutsche Börse has today announced changes in the DAX index. Deutsche Börse AG’s tendered share class (ISIN DE000A1KRND6) is to be replaced in the DAX with the original Deutsche Börse AG share class (ISIN DE0005810055). The changes will be effective on 8 February 2012 and are a result of today’s announcement on the reversal of the transaction between  Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext due to the prohibition of the merger by the EU Commission.

The Deutsche Börse share (ISIN DE0005810055) was replaced in the DAX on 20 July 2011 by the Deutsche Börse AG tendered share class (ISIN DE000A1KRND6). Due to the reversal of the transaction, the tendered share class is now to be replaced by the regular Deutsche Börse share in accordance with the framework for the equity indices concerning regulations for mergers of index members, as Deutsche Börse announced on 6 June
2011. No adjustment will be made to the free float factor or weighting of the share in the index, nor does the change affect the composition of the DAX index.

IT'S OFFICIAL: NYSE DEAL IS DEAD

EU regulators have blocked the merger of exchange operators Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext to stop them taking a stranglehold on the European futures market.

Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which unveiled the $7.4 billion plan to create the world's biggest stock exchange a year ago, said they would unwind the deal, the sector's fourth failed  merger in a year.

The European Commission consulted more than 700 stakeholders and said in a 459-page document Wednesday that the combined entity would make it hard for new players to compete.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

Analysts said the regulatory veto might put a temporary brake on the next wave of deals. "The motivation to do deals is as relevant as ever ... but the failed deals over the past year will make investors and companies more cautious," said Richard Perrott of Berenberg Bank.

London breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as the European Commission confirmed the view of  EU regulators that the controversial  merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, should be blocked.

Watchdogs objected to the deal on competition grounds, not least because the merged organisation would dominate the derivatives business in Europe. The merged company would have owned both Liffe, London's futures exchange, and its Frankfurtbased rival, Eurex.

The London Stock Exchange and Michael Spencer's Icap had quietly lobbied against the deal fearing its impact on their businesses.

Deutsche Börse's board described the decision as "a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets".

Deutsche's board added: "The EU Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives."
Both exchanges had argued that a merger would enable them to compete globally with companies like America's
CME Group, which dominates US derivatives.

Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of NYSE Euronext, which owns several European stock exchanges including Paris, said: "We made clear throughout this process we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination."

NYSE and Deutsche Börse drop plan to merge; Deal would have created world’s biggest  exchange, but
was opposed  by E.U.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse conceded defeat Wednesday, saying they were in talks to call off their planned merger after antitrust regulators in  Europe formally opposed the deal.

Both exchanges said they fundamentally disagreed with concessions that the  European Commission had requested, notably the divestiture of major parts of the combined company’s business.
‘‘This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets,’’ the Deutsche
Börse board said in a statement. ‘‘The E.U. commission’s decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition
of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives.’’

The European Union competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said that the proposed deal would have resulted in a quasi monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges and that the companies would have controlled more than 90 percent of global trade in these products.

‘‘These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive,’’ Mr. Almunia said Wednesday. ‘‘We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns.’’

The decision leaves NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, to figure out a new course after having wagered on creating the world’s biggest market operator. The company is likely to look to smaller acquisitions and cost-cutting as a way to grow, and said Wednesday that it planned to resume a $550 million share buyback program.

It was the latest collapse of a planned merger of exchanges in the past 12 months. Many, including the proposed union of the Australian and Singaporean markets, ran aground because of a failure to win regulatory approval.

Executives at NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse had acknowledged in recent weeks that their merger appeared increasingly unlikely. Duncan L. Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, told The Financial Times last week that he held only ‘‘a glimmer of hope’’ that the deal would succeed, and conceded that he had
‘‘misjudged’’ the review process.

The NYSE Euronext chairman, Jan-Michiel Hessels, said in a statement Wednesday: ‘‘While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the E.U. decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on.’’

The deal’s collapse will come as little surprise to analysts and investors, many of whom were cool to the idea. Shares in NYSE Euronext have fallen 18 percent in the past 12 months, while those in Deutsche Börse have tumbled 19 percent.

The deal to merge NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, announced last February, would have formed a powerhouse exchange, one with a formidable platform for the trading of stocks and derivatives. The two had surmounted several challenges, including a rival bid for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, and secured shareholder approval for the deal.



Page 136 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the management teams of both companies had underestimated the potential for opposition from European antitrust officials. Led by the Union’s competition commissioner, regulators argued that the merged company would wield too much power in the market for derivatives traded on exchanges.

‘‘It took American observers by surprise, given how accommodating U.S. regulators were to the roll ups by the CME Group,’’ said Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. ‘‘I can’t help but think that governments and politicians are treating the financial industry much more skeptically than they were before the crisis.’’

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse executives countered that their combined company would control only a small portion of the entire market, which includes the trading of derivatives over the counter. They have also said that the regulators’ analysis was too focused on the European market. Among the concessions requested by European officials was the sale of either NYSE Euronext’s Liffe platform or Deutsche Börse’s Eurex unit. Both companies strenuously opposed such a move.

‘‘As we made clear throughout this process, we would not agree to any concessions that would compromise or undermine the industrial and economic logic of the proposed combination,’’ Mr. Hessels, at NYSE Euronext, said in the statement.
The commission, wary that the companies still could bring an appeal to reverse the decision, took extra care
Wednesday to show it had done its homework before blocking the deal.

It said it had conducted a ‘‘far-reaching market investigation’’ to show that users of derivatives would find themselves locked into a tighter market, and that they would have few opportunities to take their business elsewhere if made to pay higher fees, had the deal had been allowed to go ahead as the exchanges wanted.

The commission also took pains to say that it was not against creating industrial ‘‘champions’’ as long as they were not in a position to exercise monopoly power.

As part of its review, the regulator said it had thoroughly examined the market to show that the two exchanges’ derivatives operations, Eurex and Liffe, were by far the largest players in European financial derivatives and that none of their competitors, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a unit of the CME Group, ‘‘achieves significant volumes.’’ It was ‘‘very unlikely’’ that the Chicago exchange ‘‘would become a credible competitive force in this area,’’ the commission said.

‘‘Whether the market is global or European, the merger would lead to a near monopoly in this product area,’’ the commission said in a set of written questions and answers distributed shortly after its decision to block the deal.

One commissioner, Michel Barnier, who is in charge of financial market regulations, voiced some reservations at the meeting Wednesday about the decision to block the deal. Mr. Barnier said the current derivatives market was likely to evolve in the coming years, partly because of new European regulations, suggesting that allowing the deal might not stymie competition as much as Mr. Almunia feared.

But the commission was able to approve the decision without the need to hold a formal vote, indicating that Mr. Barnier wanted to register his concerns rather than hold up the decision.

The companies have two months to decide whether to appeal, and may decide to do so even if they unwind the merger, because the commission’s decision, if it stands, could cause trouble for future deals.

Deutsche Börse would not comment on an appeal, but seemed to at least be keeping its options open by pointing out what it said were flaws in the commission’s reasoning. The statement by Deutsche Börse noted that the merger had already been approved by regulatory agencies in Germany, the United States and other countries.

The company also said that the commission decision was based on an ‘‘erroneous’’ definition of the market for derivatives, and that it was at odds with approval in 2007 of a merger between the two main derivatives exchanges in Chicago to form the CME Group.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, neither NYSE Euronext nor Deutsche Börse will be responsible for paying a break-up fee of €250 million, or $330 million, since the deal was scuttled by regulators. But either company would need to pay that fee if it reaches a merger deal with a different partner within the next nine months.

Instead, both companies have said they will focus on smaller acquisitions that will bolster existing businesses. Mr. Ditmire, the analyst, suggested that other kinds of mergers might still pass regulatory muster. NYSE Euronext could look to bolster its commodities or futures trading operations, potentially with a U.S. partner like the

IntercontinentalExchange. The company could also look to find a merger partner in Asia, but would be wary of running into the kind of nationalist opposition that broke up the Australian-Singaporean market deal.

In the meantime, NYSE Euronext will most likely turn to other alternatives to improve its stock price. One is more cost-cutting, something that had slowed down last year as executives focused on the merger. Mr. Ditmire said NYSE Euronext still had low operating margins compared with its peers, running at about 35 percent to some rivals’ margins that run higher than 60 percent.

Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners, wrote in a recent research note, ‘‘We expect NYX to return to is multiyear cost-reduction program,’’ adding that ‘‘similar (if not better) cost efficiencies can be attained in the coming years.’’ NYX is the stock symbol of NYSE Euronext.

NYSE Euronext could also turn to repurchasing stock. Mr. Repetto argued that the company’s strong cash flow, sound credit ratings and low debt levels could allow it to borrow money to augment an existing buyback program.

Deutsche Börse merger plan is vetoed by EU.

2 February 2012

EUROPEAN UNION regulators vetoed a plan by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext to create the world’s biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a “near-monopoly” in  European exchange-traded derivatives, the  EC said in an emailed statement yesterday. “Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the  merger.”
Deutsche Börse agreed to acquire its New York rival in a deal valued at $9.5 billion when it was announced last
February. Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3 billion as Deutsche Börse’s shares fell.

The companies appealed directly to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that a ban would harm European exchanges and drive business to other parts of the world.

“The EU Commission’s decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong,” Deutsche Börse said in an emailed statement.

The rejection of the merger is the commission’s fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US Justice Department threatened to sue. Singapore Exchange’s $8.8 billion bid for ASX collapsed after Australian treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal wasn’t in the national interest.

Deutsche Börse’s acquisition of NYSE Euronext would have put more than 90 per cent of Europe’s exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 per cent of stock trading in the hands of one company. Deutsche Börse’s Eurex is the region’s biggest derivatives exchange, while NYSE’s Liffe is the second-largest.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse had offered to sell overlapping businesses and give rivals access to post-trade services as they struggled to convince regulators that the merger wouldn’t stifle competition in derivatives and clearing. – (Bloomberg)

NYSE-Deutsche Boerse Joins Dead-Deal List
By Jacob Bunge

The rejection by  European regulators of the  merger of German exchange operator  Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext could bring to an end an 18-month world-wide deal boom among stock exchanges that fizzed, and then fizzled.

The planned $18.1 billion tie-up, announced in February 2011, would have created the world's largest market for trading stocks and derivatives, marrying the global power of the New York Stock Exchange brand with the derivatives heft of Deutsche Boerse, which runs Europe's biggest market for exchange-listed futures and options.

U.S. antitrust authorities had approved the deal late last year, subject to relatively minor conditions. But on Wednesday, the European Commission, a 27-person body, said the deal would set up a "quasi-monopoly" in exchanges' trading of European derivatives.

The doomed deal marks the latest and highest-profile collapse in a year of failed deal making by exchanges, with attempted tie-ups that spanned Asia, North America and the U.K.

It also hampers a march toward globalization of the exchange industry spurred by markets' embrace of electronic trading. While exchanges will likely continue to establish links to one another, a megamarket offering a slate of stocks and derivatives contracts relevant to every corner of the globe appears to face high barriers.

NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said in an interview Wednesday, "This represents a missed opportunity for capital markets."

Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni in a statement called the EU's ruling "wrong" and said it was "a black day for Europe."

Investors in both NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse became skeptical about the deal's prospects months ago. Wednesday, NYSE Euronext shares fell 13 cents, or 0.5%, to $26.35 in 4 p.m. composite trading. Shares of Deutsche Boerse rose 1.1% to 45.48 euros ($59.50) in Frankfurt.

Banks and brokers, some of whom had lobbied heavily against the deal out of concern the merged exchange would gain too much control over trading fees, welcomed the ruling. The deal was "very appropriately rejected by [Brussels] because it would have created a monopoly in Europe in financial futures," said Michael Spencer, chief executive of Icap PLC, the world's largest interdealer broker by trading volume.

The collapse also reminds that the fate of merger activity often rests with government regulators.In 2011, the biggest announced deal of the year -- AT&T Inc.'s proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG -- collapsed under resistance from the U.S. Justice Department.

Many analysts and investors now expect that exchanges, whose various merger efforts had to confront antitrust concerns, nationalist sentiment and shareholder resistance, will likely take a breather from ambitious deal pursuits.

Instead, the types of failed deals of the past year -- one attempting to join Australian and Singapore exchange groups, another between Canadian and London market operators -- will likely give way to smaller-scale alliances and joint ventures centered on specific markets and securities, analysts say.

Together, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are estimated to account for 93% of exchange-based trading in
European futures and options, according to research by Tabb Group.

EU rules against NYSEmerger

The European Union has blocked the Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with NYSE Euronext Inc., a
$10-billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said Wednesday that it was ruling against the  merger because the combined exchange would have controlled 90% of the trading in  European derivatives -- complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on areas like interest rates or the price of oil. It said that dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

"The merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement. "These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive."

The commission's decision deals a blow to Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which hoped combining their businesses would have allowed them to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.
"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets," said Deutsche Boerse Chief
Executive Reto Francioni.

Francioni added that the decision will prevent the creation of a "globally competitive" European exchange group that would have helped strengthen the commission's push for transparent and stable financial markets across Europe and the world.

The NYSE said in a statement that the two companies are discussing terminating the merger agreement -- an indication that they are not optimistic that an appeal would succeed.

"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on," NYSE Euronext Chairman
Jan-Michiel Hessels said.

The commission's decision did not come as a surprise; last month a case team recommended the merger should be blocked, citing the combined exchange's dominance in the trading of key derivatives.

But the two companies argued that the vast majority of derivatives are traded directly between banks and other investors.

Rising regulatory risk squashing M&A deals, say advisers
By Sophie Sassard
1,251 words
2 February 2012
18:20
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2012 Reuters Limited
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Competition watchdogs are stifling those companies still braving economic uncertainty to attempt mergers and acquisitions, say bankers and lawyers who claim the burden of bureaucracy has intensified with the financial crisis.
The European Commission on Wednesday blocked the  merger between Deutsche Boerse and New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), feeding worries of tougher  merger controls and a trend towards further bans.

Regulators are bearing down more heavily in response to public expectations that they shore up protection for consumers at a time of financial hardship, say lawyers and dealmakers.

"I am receiving many calls from clients worried that regulators might have a heavier hand on merger control," said the head of M&A for EMEA at a major European investment bank, who declined to be named to protect his
clients' identities.

The EU Commission, the region's antitrust watchdog, said the way it approaches merger control had not changed.

"The Commission is not toughening its approach to merger control. It is however true that it had to deal with particularly complicated cases recently. But the number of bans or of remedy requirements have not increased since the new team took office in 2009," said EC spokesman Antoine Colombani.

"Bans should not be seen as a toughening. Every decision is based on facts and every case is different," he added, noting that in 22 years, the EC only banned 21 transactions out of 5000 that were reviewed, or 0.4 percent of the cases.

Corporate advisers say however that what the numbers do not show is the complex and lengthy procedure of checking deals that is becoming more burdensome and, more than the threat of a ban, is worrying company executives as well as driving up the cost and the risks involved.
FINDING BUYERS

With mining giant Xstrata and commodities trader Glencore announcing on Thursday that they are in talks over a possible merger, there are clearly signs of life in the sector.

But lawyers say that such negotiations must now also encompass lining up more partners for merger-related asset disposals further down the line, an added complication.

In one sign of things getting tougher, EU regulators are increasingly requiring companies to name potential buyers when antitrust clearance is conditional on them shedding assets.

"In some markets, the pool of available buyers who will have the ability and incentive to operate the divested business as an effective competitor may be quite limited, raising a question as to whether the merging parties will actually be able to find a buyer at all," points out Mark Friend, head of law firm Allen & Overy's antitrust department, who noted several cases in the retail sector.

In those kind of situations, he says, it is to be expected that the regulator would insist on seeing a buyer for these assets before approving the deal.

Page 143 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However in the current economic climate, finding buyers is becoming increasingly tough because of the difficulty interested parties can face in securing funding.

And in a vicious circle that in turn is making regulators more insistent that companies tie up asset sales before they will give the nod to their plans.

In June 2011, the UK regulator, the Office of Fair Trade (OFT) had demanded an up-front buyer in 66% of its recent investment cases. Lawyers and bankers expect deal-making in the UK to be hit even harder by this aspect in future.
"I would not be surprised if in 2012 that percentage comes out even higher," said Ajal Notowicz, head of M&A at
UK-based law firm Dickson Minto.
DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS

UK investigations may take longer than those in the European Union, but they are also fewer owing to a voluntary regime where only the truly problematic transactions are filed with the country's regulator, the Office of Fair Trading.

By contrast, European business chiefs must endure lengthy procedures even when competition concerns are minor, corporate lawyers say.

"Merger control procedures can be very heavy. The Commission usually requires an extremely detailed level of information, even in cases of moderate complexity," said Bernd Meyring, antitrust partner at global law firm Linklaters.

Even just the first step -- being allowed to file the intention to go ahead with a deal -- requires more effort than before. Several European lawyers said the back and forth between them and the European Commission can go on for months before a dossier is deemed "complete".

"Pre-notification discussions tend to be longer than they were a few years ago," Didier Theophile, head of antitrust at Paris-based Darrois Villey law firm said.

Once the review is underway the Commission can still pause it if it needs more material. This happened recently in Google's

$12.5 billion bid for U.S. handset maker Motorola Mobility: the EC suspended a January 10 deadline for a decision and asked for more information on the deal.

Although the aim in doing this is to avoid a longer and more harmful "Phase II" investigation, a dragging review can be problematic, often scaring off would-be partners, prompting renegotiation of funding terms or leading to higher legal costs.

"When the investigation lasts too long, the parties become increasingly nervous and it can very well become a deal-breaker," said Arnaud Coibion, M&A partner at Linklaters.
And longer preliminary reviews are no guarantee that the rest of the process will pass more quickly: the European
Commission extended its review of Johnson & Johnson's $21.3 billion acquisition of Swiss orthopedic firm
Synthes to a Phase II review -- then extended its final verdict by another 10 days to April 2.

In the UK a plan to merge the OFT and the Competition Commission (CC) into a single regulator is also expected to lead to more Phase II investigations, several UK-based lawyers said.

"To date, the prospect of a CC review - and the significant burdens that places on companies - has incentivised the OFT to reach the 'right' answer and avoid unnecessary references," said Alastair Mordaunt, partner at Clifford Chance's Antitrust practice and former OFT director of Mergers.

"This discipline may be diluted in a merged institution - if as the decision maker you're unsure about a borderline case, then why wouldn't you pass it upstairs (or downstairs) for a further look?", he added.

The European Commission has beefed up its senior management team in the wake of three contentious decisions involving Airtours, Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval which were acrimoniously contested and overturned in 2002-2003.

Since then, the Commission has made it a point to be seen as "irreproachable" and has hired legions of experts, said Bernd Meyring, antitrust lawyer at Linklaters.
Today, about 110 persons oversee merger control at the EC.

The new competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia, seen as more dogmatic than his predecessor Neelie Kroes, "is personally involved in every antitrust dossier", said an EC spokesperson.

In the interest of navigating the regulatory process companies are now devoting more resources to preparing their case for scrutiny.
"Companies must anticipate antitrust issues as soon as when the deal is in gestation. The smartest ones would
try to sound the regulator even before deciding whether to launch a bid to see if the antitrust is manageable," said

NEW YORK, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- NYSE Euronext announced Thursday the termination of its mega-merger deal with German stock exchange Deutsche Boerse after European regulators vetoed the deal.

"NYSE Euronext announced today that in light of the decision by the  European Commission to block the proposed merger agreement, both companies have agreed to a mutual termination of the business combination agreement originally signed by the companies on February 15, 2011,"  NYSE said in a brief statement.
The European Commission issued a verdict Wednesday saying no to the proposed merger between Deutsche
Boerse and NYSE Euronext.

According to a statement by the Commission, the proposed merger "would have resulted in a quasi-monopoly in the area of European financial derivatives traded globally on exchanges."

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse approved in July 2011 the 9. 53-billion-dollar takeover deal, which would have created the world's biggest exchange group.

zz Deal 'not good for competition'

EU regulators have vetoed Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange after concluding that the merger would hurt competition.

The deal would have led to a "near-monopoly" in European exchange-traded derivatives, the European Commission said yesterday. "Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.
Deutsche Boerse agreed to acquire the New York Stock Exchange operator in a deal valued at $9.5 billion (about
R74bn) when it was announced in February last year.
Since then, the value has plummeted to about $7.3bn as Deutsche Boerse's shares fell.

The companies appealed to commission president Jose Barroso last month to try to salvage their merger, arguing that a ban would drive business to other parts of the world.

"This is a black day for Europe and for its future competitiveness on global financial markets," Deutsche Boerse said. "The European Commission's decision is based on an unrealistically narrow definition of the market that does no justice to the global nature of competition in the market for derivatives. We therefore regard the decision as wrong."
The merger prohibition is the commission's fourth since 2004, when it overhauled its rules for reviewing deals. Antitrust concerns have thwarted other exchange tie-ups around the world. Nasdaq OMX Group and
IntercontinentalExchange abandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the US Justice Department
threatened to sue.

Singapore Exchange's $8.8bn bid for ASX collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the deal was not in the national interest.

"I fully expect consolidation to continue in the industry," said Richard Perrott, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London. "This last year was a disaster for the exchanges that wanted to merge, but in this deal it was clear from the start it was going to be tricky. You were looking to combine the two dominant derivatives exchanges in Europe."

The merger would have put more than 90 percent of Europe's exchange-traded derivatives market and about 30 percent of stock trading in the hands of one company.

Deutsche Boerse's Eurex is the region's biggest derivatives exchange, while NYSE's Liffe is the second-largest. They had offered to sell overlapping businesses and give rivals access to post-trade services as they struggled to convince regulators that the merger wouldn't stifle competition in derivatives and clearing.

After the prohibition, they said they would focus on their stand-alone strategies and were negotiating to terminate their merger. NYSE Euronext said it would resume a $550 million stock repurchase programme after reporting earnings next Friday and after formal termination of the deal. - Bloomberg

NYSE, Deutsche Boerse call off merger after block from EU

NEW YORK (AP) - The New York Stock Exchange and German exchange Deutsche Boerse called off their planned merger Thursday, a day after the  European Union said it would block the union because of concerns about a monopoly.

The two exchanges announced in February 2011 that they would merge in a $10 billion deal. But the  European Commission, the  EU's executive body, said the combined company would control 90 percent of the trading of some financial products in  Europe.
The European decision was a blow to the combined dreams of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, the
NYSE's parent company. They had hoped to compete better with other large exchanges in the U.S. and Asia.

In the U.S., the planned merger made waves because it would have meant foreign control of the storied trading floor at 11 Wall St. in New York. Despite political opposition to the deal, it got the green light from regulators in the U.S.
In Europe, however, the regulatory discussions revolved around control.

Some hoped the deal would boost Frankfurt's status as a financial center that would compete with New York, Hong Kong and London. But regulators worried that it would create a financial behemoth.

The timing of the deal also played a role. Regulators are under great pressure to increase oversight of the financial sector as Europe tries to resolve the huge debt loads of its countries. Adding a complex institution would add to the regulatory burden.

The commission said it would block the deal because the combined company's dominance of the market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

Bourse Merger Blocked  in Europe

BRUSSELS -- The  European Commission blocked the  merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext, saying the deal would create a "quasi-monopoly" in derivatives trading.

Wednesday's move, which was widely expected for weeks, officially ends the two firms' vision of creating a global exchange operator, after months of negotiating with antitrust officials at the commission, the  European Union's executive arm. The commission rejected the companies' arguments that the deal would lower trading costs more than it would harm competition. It also rejected their proposed solution to the commission's concerns about the merger's impact on competition in derivatives trading.

"These markets are at the heart of the financial system, and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive," said Joaquin Almunia, the commission's top merger regulator, after a meeting with the
26 other commissioners in the EU executive body. "We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns."

The companies may yet appeal the ruling in court, though NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said executives would take some time to evaluate the ruling before deciding to pursue the matter further. Such an effort could be expensive and take years, and success isn't assured.

"Before we go there we would like for all of us to have some time to digest the decision in full detail, where it's rooted and what we think," Mr. Niederauer said in an interview. "But it's something we both would consider."

A few commissioners -- Michel Barnier and Gunther Oettinger, the French and German commissioners -- raised concerns about blocking the merger, an official said. But most, including senior figures such as Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding and Jose Manuel Barroso, the commission president, strongly supported Mr. Almunia, according to the official.
The commission's objections centered around Eurex and Liffe, the European derivatives exchanges operated by
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, respectively. Combining the two units would give the company more than
90% of the market in exchange-traded derivatives.

Moreover, both exchanges have their own clearing houses, entities that stand between buyers, absorbing losses if either side defaults. The commission worried that combining the two firms would have created a dominant EU clearing house that could offer powerful incentives for traders to stick with incumbent exchanges rather than switch to competitors.
NYSE Euronext owns stock markets in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Brussels in addition to New York's
Big Board. Deutsche Boerse owns the main German stock market.

The exchanges argued that creating a giant European trading venue -- complete with its own clearing house -- would mean lower trading costs. But the commission said the new firm's monopoly power would have allowed it to retain those benefits as profits, rather than pass them on to customers as lower costs.

"Any efficiencies would not be substantial enough to outweigh the harm to customers caused by the merger," the commission said.

Derivatives trading, which is more profitable than stock dealing, had been the keystone of the $17.9 billion combination since it was unveiled in February 2011. The companies argued that their European derivatives trading businesses focus on different segments of the market: short-term interest-rate futures for Liffe and
Page 154 of 166 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
long-term futures for Deutsche Boerse. They also noted that the over-the-counter market, still home to the vast majority of derivatives trading globally, offers plenty of competition to trading done through exchanges.

But the commission took a different view of the market: "The investigation showed that [exchange-trade derivatives] and OTCs are generally not considered as substitutes by customers, since they use them for different purposes and in different circumstance," it said.

Serious threats to the deal emerged in December, when EU competition regulators proved unsatisfied with several deal concessions put forward by Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext. Proposed remedies included allowing rivals limited access to the combined company's trade-clearing operations, as well as the spinoff of some contracts traded on both companies' markets.

But neither company was willing to divest its derivatives franchise to make the deal happen. Executives of both firms said such a step would undermine the logic of the merger plan.

NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse pushed for their deal up until the end. Wednesday, Deutsche Boerse said it is in a position for growth even without a merger, following earnings and revenue growth in 2011.

NYSE Euronext immediately announced plans to resume a $550 million share buyback program after release of its fourth-quarter results Feb. 10.

EU blocks merger of financial exchanges
BRUSSELS (AP)?The  European Union on Wednesday blocked the  Deutsche Boerse's planned merger with
NYSE Euronext, a $10 billion deal that would have created the world's largest financial exchange operator.

The European Commission,the EU's executive body, said it was ruling against the merger because the combined exchange would have controlled more than 90 percent of the trading in European derivatives?complex but highly profitable financial products that allow investors to bet on changes in interest rates or the price of oil.

It said that the combined company's dominance of that market would have made it almost impossible for competitors to offer rival trading systems.

Canada's currency rose beyond parity with the greenback as purchasing manager indexes from China to the U.S. increased.
The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 99.86 Canadian cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. Wednesday. It touched
99.64 cents,the strongest level since Oct. 31. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0014.

JohnMarshall Law School in Chicago and the Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University were among a group of law schools sued over claims they misrepresented employment data, leaving graduates with mounting debt and limited job prospects.

The schools sued Wednesday also include Brooklyn Law School and Albany Law School of Union University. Plaintiffs' lawyers said additional suits were filed in state courts in California, Florida and in federal court in New Jersey.

"We believe that some in the legal academy have done a disservice to the profession and the nation by saddling tens of thousands of young lawyers with massive debt for a degree worth far less than advertised," DavidAnziska, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.

EU REGULATORS have blocked the $7.4bn (£4.7bn) deal to merge exchange operators Deutsche Boerse and
NYSE Euronext, saying the combined firm would have killed competition in the European futures market.

The two companies are now set to abandon the plan, which would have created the world's biggest stock exchange.

Neither firm was willing to placate the EU regulator by disposing of its European futures business, causing the deal to be blocked. The combined firm would have handled over 95 per cent of such trades.

Deutsche Boerse said it was a "black day for Europe" and that in the future the continent would struggle to compete in global financial markets.
The deal was first unveiled in February 2011 and had been approved in the US. CEO Duncan L Niederauer failed to merge NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Boerse

The Globe and Mail reports in its Thursday, Feb. 2, edition that the European Union officially rejected the planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse on Wednesday. A Wall Street Journal dispatch to The Globe reports that NYSE chief executive officer Duncan Niederauer acknowledges he misjudged EU antitrust authorities' view on the combination at a time when other cross-border exchange deals have drawn fire from regulators
around the world. Neither he nor Deutsche Boerse CEO Reto Francioni imagined that regulators would focus solely on exchange-traded derivatives in their analysis of the deal, setting aside privately traded contracts and foreign-based markets. Mr. Niederauer says, "We both thought the market definition was not a place where we'd be likely to get tripped up." However, regulators in Europe zeroed in on the exchanges' combined power in listed derivatives trading. Mr. Niederauer and Mr. Francioni were to have been chief executive and chairman of the new exchange group. Deutsche Boerse shareholders would have owned 60 per cent of the entity, while NYSE Euronext investors would have held the balance of a new Amsterdam-based holding company.

Shares in the London Stock Exchange (LSE) jumped 47p to 917p after the £5.7bn  merger between rivals
Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext was blocked by  European regulators on competition grounds.

Investors bought shares in the stock hoping the London exchange will not now face an enlarged rival four times its size.

However, analysts said the LSE’s own bid to buy rival LCH.Clearnet for £860m might be gatecrashed by one of these players as the sector looks for smaller acquisitions which are unlikely to attract the attention of regulators.

9:04 (Dow Jones) A day after  EU nixed merger between Deutsche Boerse (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) over their concentration in European futures, CME Group (CME) on Thursday includes a slide in earnings presentation that seems to underscore the point that the  merger partners failed to impress upon  EU antitrust regulators: that futures competition is global. CME slide claims a 60% "global" market share against its largest rivals, including  NYSE, Deutsche Boerse and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and includes direct comparisons between CME interest-rate markets and those offered by its  European rivals.

9:02 (Dow Jones) Investors' concerns about Sara Lee's (SLE)falling volumes aren't likely to go away after the company's F2Q results. Although revenue rose 6%, volumes declined across every single business. They were off 5% at its North American retail meats business, in part because of price increases that nonetheless didn't
cover higher commodity costs. The Europe-focused coffee-and-tea business passed through big prices increases as well, no doubt helping cause a volume decline of 6.5%. Shares are fractionally higher premarket as EPS topped analysts' expectations. (marshall.eckblad@dowjones.com)

8:59 (Dow Jones) SandRidge Energy (SD) got a compliment from Tudor Pickering along with its downgrade following the oil and natural gas company's $1.28B purchase Dynamic Offshore, an operator in the Gulf of Mexico. "SD is as tenacious as a honey badger," the firm said in its note, referencing the popular YouTube video that's made its way from the internet to the floor of Congress. "Honey badgers are tough skinned, and SD will need to be as multiple compression from buying into the GOM [Gulf of Mexico] will be painful," the firm says. SD down 13% to $6.80 premarket.

8:59 (Dow Jones) The 4Q results from MDC show a continued struggle that is putting it at the back of the improving homebuilder pack. Orders increased just 1% from a year earlier, well below Credit Suisse's 13% estimate, as sales per community plunged 21% to 2.8 homes, the lowest absorption pace since early 2009. Cancellations remained extremely elevated at 43% of gross orders, one of the sector's highest rates. JPMorgan is bearish, citing the "below-industry-average order growth and gross margins and our outlook for" notable losses
this year. MDC shares, inactive premarket, have climbed 16% this year. (dawn.wotapka@dowjones.com)

8:55 (Dow Jones) Orange juice prices are up again, ahead of the FDA's scheduled release of more fungicide testing results tomorrow. So far, 11 out of 80 juice imports tested positive for the fungicide. Since the beginning of the year, orange juice futures are up more than 18% and hit an all-time high of $2.2695/lb. on Jan. 23, as concerns that the FDA could ban or suspend orange juice imports peaked. Uncertainty has kept the market hovering above $2/lb, but analysts think futures will fall below that without more supply-related news. Orange
juice for March delivery is up 1.2% at $2.0765/lb. (alexandra.wexler@dowjones.com)

8:54 (Dow Jones) Dow Chemical (DOW) says it cut production after demand slumped last quarter, with its operating rate falling to 72%, the lowest level since the start of 2009. The world's second-largest chemicals producer after BASF sees the global economy gaining momentum in the second quarter as customers restock--US inventories are seen at all-time lows in some sectors--though has launched more cost-cutting
measures in an effort to free up $750M in cash. Shares down 2.9% at $32.95 in pre-open trade after 4Q miss. (doug.cameron@dowjones.com)

8:52 (Dow Jones) The dollar was relatively mixed and trading in tight ranges early in New York as investors await Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's Congressional testimony and Friday's key jobs report. The euro dipped as traders still haven't heard about the final deal -- if it is to be forthcoming -- on a Greek debt restructuring. Not even comments from China's premier that the country plans to support bailout efforts could keep the euro from rising.

8:47 (Dow Jones) Baked into Merck's (MRK) 2012 forecast is research-and-development spending that's flat with
2011's tab, ex-items, of about $7.7B, which came in below targets. This illustrates how MRK has chipped away at
its R&D spending plans since it announced a year ago that it would hold R&D steady at more than $8B despite
pressure from investors to cut more. MRK up 1.2% to $39.10 premarket. (peter.loftus@dowjones.com)

8:46 (Dow Jones) As 4Q orders at Pulte (PHM) fell short of UBS' expectations, it isn't completely bearish on the homebuilder. "Despite the underperformance, we found reason for optimism. "Notably, profitability improvements continue as management moves forward with efforts to drive efficiency" and strengthen operations. PHM's cash hoard also tops $1B, giving it plenty of liquidity to survive until the housing market finally picks up. PHM is down
3.3% premarket at $7.57 after having risen 24% so far this year. (dawn.wotapka@dowjones.com)

8:40 (Dow Jones) Rite Aid's (RAD) January same-store sales climbed 2.2%, the 10th-consecutive month of growth and building on a 1.1% increase last year. RAD saw growth in all but one month in 2011--March had a
0.1% decline--as the retailer benefits from the rollout of a loyalty program and store renovations under a new format that expands clinical pharmacy services and offers more health-and-wellness products. Last month,
front-end SSS were the strongest, up 2.7%, while pharmacy SSS posted a more-modest 1.6% increase. Shares are up a penny premarket at $1.41. (john.kell@dowjones.com)
8:38 (Dow Jones) Royal Caribbean (RCL) provides its first insight on how its results are due to be affected by
rival Carnival's (CCL) ship-capsizing in Italy, and it isn't pretty. It projects 2012 EPS some 1/3 below what analysts
had expected, with 1Q also falling notably short despite much of this quarter's occupants having already booked
before the tragedy. However, RCL has seen "a big percentage decline in new activity," hurting how 1Q will
ultimately pan out. RCL shares slide 7.9% premarket to $26 after having risen 14% so far this year.
(kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)
8:35 (Dow Jones) Nonfarm productivity grows at 0.7% annual rate in 4Q, on expectations and slower than 3Q's
1.9% gain. A slowdown in output per hour is typical into a recovery as businesses rely less on existing staff and
start to add new workers to create new output. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

Deutsche Boerse, NYSE Euronext  Abandon  Merger Deal

Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE, DBOEF) and NYSE Euronext (NYX) on Thursday officially ended their year-long
merger push, abandoning their agreement after the European Union on Wednesday blocked the deal.

Both exchange companies agreed to a "mutual termination" of the  merger plan. No break-up fee will be paid on account of the deal falling apart due to regulatory pushback.

The European Commission on Wednesday formally rejected the $17 billion combination, on grounds that it would create a "quasi-monopoly" over European exchange-traded derivatives markets. Together the two firms hold an estimated 93% of such business.

NYSE and Deutsche Boerse had objected to the antitrust verdict, arguing that it disregarded the market in privately traded swap contracts and foreign-based exchanges, both of which represent competition.

Though no longer pushing to merge, the companies may yet appeal the matter to European courts in an effort to overturn the legal precedent.
The merger was officially unveiled Feb. 15, 2011.
