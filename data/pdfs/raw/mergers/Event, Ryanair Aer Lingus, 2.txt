FACTBOX-Key points  on EU merger rejections

Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2007 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - The  European Commission's decision to bar budget airline  Ryanair from buying rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus  marks the 20th such ban since 1990. Here are some key facts about  EU     merger prohibitions:
TOTAL CASES

Between 1990 and May 31 this year, 3,418 cases had been notified to the EU's regulatory arm for review. Twenty of those were rejected, including Ryanair's attempt to buy Aer Lingus.
PREVIOUS PROHIBITION
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, backed by the full Commission, on Dec. 9, 2004 blocked plans by
Electricidade de Portugal and Italy's ENI to buy Gas de Portugal. European Union courts upheld her decision.
HIGH WATER MARK

No mergers were blocked during seven of the past 17 years, but in 2001 the Commission prohibited a record five mergers including a high-profile all-U.S. deal in which General Electric tried to purchase Honeywell International .
COURT REVERSES PROHIBITIONS

In 2002, the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg for the first time nullified Commission prohibitions, overturning three: Airtours' proposed acquisition of smaller British package-holiday rival First Choice, Schneider Electric's proposed purchase of French rival Legrand , and package machine maker Tetra Pak's buy of France's Sidel.

CHRONOLOGY-Ryanair's  failed bid for Aer Lingus

(c) 2007 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - The regulatory arm of the  European Union rejected budget airline  Ryanair's proposed takeover of Irish rival  Aer Lingus  on Wednesday, citing concerns the  deal would stifle competition.
Following is a chronology of the  takeover bid:
2006:

Oct. 2: Aer Lingus shares begin open trading as the Irish government cuts its holding in the company to 25 percent from 85 percent.
Oct. 5: Ryanair acquires a 16 percent stake in Aer Lingus and makes an offer worth 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion)
to acquire the company, setting an expiry deadline of Nov. 13. The Irish government reacts negatively.
Oct. 30: Ryanair asks the European Commission for competition clearance to buy Aer Lingus. Nov. 14: Ryanair extends takeover period to Dec. 4.
Nov. 28: Ryanair increases its share of Aer Lingus to 25.2 percent, but two days later Chief Financial Officer
Howard Miller calls the proposed deal "a long shot".
Dec. 6: Ryanair moves takeover deadline to Dec. 22.

Dec. 20: Commission opens in-depth investigation of the deal with a deadline of May 11; the bid automatically lapses.
2007
Feb. 22: European Commission extends deadline to June 13.

March 29: Commission sends formal and confidential "statement of objections" to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the proposed deal would damage competition.

April 12: Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary says he expects the Commission to block the deal and if so will open a court challenge.
May 4: Commission extends deadline to July 4 as Ryanair offers new remedies to competition problems. May 9: O'Leary says if the EU executive approves the deal, Ryanair will consider a second bid.

UPDATE 1-EU says treats airline mergers consistently
233 words
27 June 2007
12:19
Reuters News
LBA
English
(c) 2007 Reuters Limited
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Reuters) - The  EU's top antitrust official said on Wednesday she would be consistent in her handling of airline takeovers,  such as an offer for Alitalia , after Brussels blocked Irish carrier  Ryanair's bid for its compatriot Aer Lingus.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes and her antitrust department have powers to review large  European mergers although it is rare for the  EU executive to block bids.

The Commission said it did not allow Ryanair to go ahead with its bid for Aer Lingus because it believed it would be impossible for new airlines to enter the Irish market, particularly on Dublin routes, if the two merged.

At a news conference Kroes was asked how she would review a takeover of Alitalia, especially if it is bought by fellow Italian carrier Air One which is looking at Alitalia's books, in the light of the Ryanair decision.

"We are consistent and hopefully also transparent in how we are dealing with mergers that are notified," she replied.
"So indeed it's not a matter of what nationality the merger partners are"
Alitalia shares were suspended on Wednesday pending a statement, the Milan bourse said. Earlier, Russia's Aeroflot pulled out of the bidding for the loss-making Italian carrier. ALITALIA/EU (UPDATE 1)|LANGEN|ABN|E|RBN|UKI|RNP|DNP|PCO

Ryanair to challenge  EU decision on Aer Lingusbid

DUBLIN, June 27 (Reuters) -  Ryanair said on Wednesday it would appeal against what it called the  EU's
"unlawful" decision to block an attempt to  buy rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus  .
In a statement that criticised both the commission's decision and management at  Aer Lingus  , Ryanair,
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said it was confident the ruling would be overturned.

" Aer Lingus claimed yesterday that the EU Commission's prohibition is 'another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers'," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.

"This is nonsense. Aer Lingus' share price is now significantly below Ryanair's 2.80 euro offer which means that their shareholders are losing out."

News
Ryanair hits out at EU's rumoured veto on deal
BY GEOFF MEADE Business Correspondent
669 words
27 June 2007
Daily Post (Liverpool)
LIVERP
English
(c) The Liverpool Daily Post & Echo Ltd, 2007.
IN ASSOCIATION WITH Rensburg Sheppards 'No reason to halt  bid for Aer Lingus'

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his lowcost airline taking over Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus.

The attack from the airline, which is the largest operator at Liverpool John Lennon Airport, came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels this week or next week - the first time for 20 years that the Commission's competition authorities will have blocked a European airline merger.
Mr O'Leary, speaking in Brussels, said there was no justification for the "unprecedented" decision.

He said: "This is designed to appeal solely to the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government and ignore the benefits to millions of consumers."

Ryanair's £1bn offer for Aer Lingus immediately attracted a formal Commission monopolies inquiry amid concern about the development of a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport and stifling competition.
Mr O'Leary pointed out that the proposed takeover affected less than 5% of the European airline market.

And he insisted he had already guaranteed massive savings for passengers of about £70m per year in lower fares and fuel surcharges.

He said if the Commission does announce a block on the takeover, " Aer Lingus passengers should send the bill for their higher fares and fuel surcharges to the European Commission in Brussels".

Mr O'Leary declared: "The Commission's decision to prohibit this merger between two EU airlines which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic is not just unprecedented but, in our view, unlawful. We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber-stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport."

Mr O'Leary said the Air France/- KLM merger had resulted in significant fare increases - but Ryanair has offered unprecedented reductions which, he said, were guaranteed.
He accused the Commission of targeting Ryanair with a "unique" set of rules which did not mirror the
Commission's approach to airline takeover cases for the last 20 years.
Apart from Aer Lingus, only the Irish Government raised objections to the proposed merger, and last March the
Commission set out a "statement of objections" against the move.

Final confirmation that the deal will not be permitted is bound to raise the stakes in the lengthy difficult relationship between Mr O'Leary and EU competition officials.

Yesterday Ryanair claimed any ban was based on an inaccurate analysis of the effects on European airline competition and the competitive position of Dublin Airport.




Page 9 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
It said Brussels was wrong to claim that competing airlines would not enter Dublin Airport if Ryanair took over Aer Lingus - "the case file proves that other competitors have confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport," said the statement.

The low-cost carrier owns 25% of Aer Lingus and, once the takeover ban is announced, intends to appeal to European judges in Luxembourg. "The court has overturned several Commission prohibitions and we expect it will do so again in this case," said Mr O'Leary.
"European consumers should not be denied the lower fare and fuel surcharge savings which will follow from a
Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger.

"We are confident that the European Court will overturn this bizarre, illogical, manifestly inaccurate and untenable prohibition."
Mr O'Leary said he was confident that European judges would overturn the Commission banning order once the
Commission's "flaky" arguments were exposed.
He said: "Any independent-minded judge is going to say 'why the hell can Air France, with 60% of air traffic at
Paris Charles De Gaulle airport, acquire KLM when Ryanair cannot merge with Aer Lingus, when they only have
5% of the market'?
This is designed to ignore the benefits to millions of consumers

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of  Ryanair, launched a pre-emptive strike against the  European Commission yesterday, accusing it of blocking his planned  merger with Aer Lingus  on political grounds. The Commission has until next Wednesday to give its opinion on the airline's hostile takeover bid, but Mr O'Leary predicted that a negative verdict would be delivered today. "This is a nakedly political decision to look after the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government," he said. If the  bid is turned down, he said, he will appeal. (Rory Watson)

RYANAIR yesterday slammed the  European Commission ahead of an expected decision to block the airline's
takeover of AER LINGUS.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary vowed to challenge the "political" decision in court.

But Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion hit back: "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and has failed."
A commission spokesman said no decision had been made. (C) The Sun, 2007

BRUSSELS, June 27, 2007 (AFP) -
The European Union's top competition watchdog blocked on Wednesday  Ryanair's takeover of Irish airline  Aer
Lingus,  a move the low-cost carrier has already vowed to appeal.

The European Commission forbid the takeover on the grounds that the merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines would have given the combined carrier a crushing grip on 35 routes.

Although Ryanair withdrew its bid in December after regulators launched an in-depth competition probe, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would relaunch it if the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices," she added. "Low-cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule."

In anticipation of the Commission's move, O'Leary launched a pre-emptive strike on Tuesday by vowing to lodge an appeal with an EU court against the decision, which he described as "nakedly political".

Ryanair, which already owned 25-percent of Aer Lingus, launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October, valuing its smaller rival at 1.481 billion euros (1.992 billion dollars), only days after the former Irish flagship was partly floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.
The bid has faced stiff opposition from other big Aer Lingus shareholders, including the Irish government with a
25.4 percent stake, employees with another 14.4 percent of the airlines' shares, and 4.1 percent belonging to
pilots and their pension fund.

Although Ryanair withdrew its bid in December after regulators launched an in-depth competition probe, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would relaunch it if the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

"Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices," she added. "Low-cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule."

In anticipation of the Commission's move, O'Leary launched a pre-emptive strike on Tuesday by vowing to lodge an appeal with an EU court against the decision, which he described as "nakedly political".

Ryanair, which already owned 25-percent of Aer Lingus, launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October that valued its smaller rival at 1.481 billion euros (1.992 billion dollars), only days after the former Irish flagship was partly floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.
The bid has faced stiff opposition from other major Aer Lingus shareholders, including the Irish government with a
25.4 percent stake and employees with another 14.4 percent.
Aer Lingus pilots and their pension fund own an additional 4.1 percent of the airline.

After an "extensive in-depth investigation", EU regulators concluded that the deal would have handed the merged company a market share of over 60 percent and around 80 percent on key intra-European routes out of Dublin.

In addition to crushing market share, newcomers faced an uphill battle because "Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors," the Commission said.

The veto is only the second since Kroes became Europe's top antitrust regulator in November 2004 after she blocked the merger of Portuguese energy companies EDP and GDP shortly after coming to office.

Since 1990, the Commission has forbidden only 20 out of the 3,000 that it has examined for competition threats and the European Court of Justice overturned eight, or 40 percent, of the vetoes.

Encouraged by relatively high proportion of successful challenges, media savvy O'Leary told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday: "We will reconsider the offer if the court overturns the decision."
The showdown is not the straight-talking, ebullient Irishman's first run-in with European regulators.

BRUSSELS, June 27, 2007 (AFP) -
The European Union's top competition watchdog and Ryanair on Wednesday headed for a dogfight in an  EU
court as regulators blocked the low-cost carrier's takeover of Irish rival  Aer Lingus.

Shortly after the regulators' action, Ryanair vowed to challenge what it described as "unprecedented and unlawful" decision by lodging an appeal with the EU's highest court.

The European Commission vetoed the takeover on the grounds that the merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines would have given the combined carrier a crushing grip on 35 routes.

Although Ryanair withdrew its bid in December after regulators launched an in-depth competition probe, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would relaunch it if the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

"Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices," she added. "Low-cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule."

In anticipation of the Commission's move, O'Leary launched a pre-emptive strike on Tuesday by promising to make an appeal at the European Court of Justice against the decision, which he described as "nakedly political."

Confirming the appeal on Wednesday, Ryanair's combative leader said: "We look forward to the European courts overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition."

Ryanair, which already owns 25-percent of Aer Lingus, launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October that valued its smaller rival at 1.481 billion euros (1.992 billion dollars), only days after the former Irish flagship was partly floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.
The bid has faced stiff opposition from other major Aer Lingus shareholders, including the Irish government with a
25.4 percent stake and employees, pilots and their pension fund with nearly another 20 percent.

After an "extensive in-depth investigation," EU regulators concluded that the deal would have handed the merged company a market share of over 60 percent and around 80 percent on key intra-European routes out of Dublin.

In addition to the merged airline's crushing market share, newcomers would have faced an uphill battle because "Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors," the Commission said.

European Commission bans Aer Lingustakeover

The European Commission has banned a bid for Ireland's  Aer Lingus  by Ryanair.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the decision was necessary to safeguard Irish consumers, as the two airlines together would control more than 80% of all  European flights to and from the Dublin airport.

Additionally, the Commission said that new airlines would be hesitant to enter the market due to the alleged reputation for "aggressive retaliation" from Ryanair Holdings Plc as well as the carrier's ability to cut fares temporarily and launch new routes to protect its market share, The Associated Press reported. Yesterday (26
June) Ryanair alleged that the decision was politically motivated.

EU blocks  Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus,  saying it would reduce consumer choice

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  EU regulators blocked low-fare airline  Ryanair Holdings PLC's hostile  bid for Aer    Lingus  Group PLC on Wednesday, saying the  deal would limit consumer choice and likely lead to higher prices.

Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the  EU veto meant his  bid, suspended since December, was now
"officially dead." He has said he would appeal.

The European Commission refused to clear the deal because the two Irish airlines would control more than 80 percent of all European flights to and from Dublin.

New airlines were unlikely to try to muscle in because of Ryanair's reputation for "aggressive retaliation" and its ability to temporarily slash fares and launch new routes to protect its powerful market position, the EU said.

"What we are doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "Ireland, being an island, depends heavily on air transport."
This is only the second time since 2001 that the EU has blocked a deal.

The euro1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) takeover already seemed doomed after nearly half of Aer Lingus shareholders vowed to block it and Ryanair's share offer found few takers.

But Ryanair vowed to take regulators to court, claiming they were wrong to block the deal when they had cleared others between Air France and KLM and between Lufthansa and Swissair.

O'Leary said Ryanair could not make any new bid now until the European Court of First Instance rules on his appeal -- which could take 18 to 24 months.

Ryanair's only options were to sell its 25.2 percent stake in Aer Lingus -- something O'Leary said would crash its share price -- or hold on "and nurse our losses," he said.

Ryanair has complained that the EU decision was politically motivated and aimed at pleasing the Irish government, which owns a quarter of Aer Lingus.
Kroes said the decision was legally sound and would stand up in the EU courts.

Her officials said Ryanair's proposed deal was unprecedented because both airlines had such a large share of routes at one airport, Dublin, while other airlines like Air France and KLM had their main hubs in different cities.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete directly on 35 routes to and from Ireland, the EU said, and the combination would give them a monopoly on 22.

"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the European Commission said.

Ryanair's offer to make changes to soothe these concerns were inadequate, it said, criticizing the limited number of airport landing slots the airline offered to give away to new rivals. This would not replace the competitive pressure in the market that would disappear if Ryanair swallowed Aer Lingus, it said.


Page 24 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
A plan by Ryanair to reduce Aer Lingus short-haul fares by 10 percent in the first year was "almost impossible to monitor" and gave no assurances that prices wouldn't rise afterward or that Ryanair would not raise its own prices in the meantime, the EU said.

"What is certain is that Ryanair proposed to end the intense competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus at Dublin airport that has pushed prices down and brought Irish consumers an increasing choice of direct flight connections from Dublin," it said.

"It is highly unlikely that Irish consumers would be better off with a near monopoly, even if it were sweetened by a temporary, hard-to-monitor price rebate."

Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman said the decision was good news for the company and its customers: "The creation of one dominant player out of Ireland -- despite the protestations of Ryanair -- just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said.

But Aer Lingus shares fell to euro2.55 (US$3.43) -- well below Ryanair's bid price of euro2.80 (US$3.76). Ryanair's massive purchases of Aer Lingus shares and its surprise offer drove Aer Lingus over euro3 (US$4.03) at one point as investors wrongly gambled that O'Leary would raise his bid.

O'Leary warned Wednesday that Aer Lingus shares would plummet to euro1.50 (US$2.02) if Ryanair opted to dump its holding. Ryanair was euro0.04 (US$0.05) lower Wednesday at euro4.96 (US$6.67).

Growing rapidly from its Irish base into Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair has spearheaded the drive toward no-frills cheap flights that forced Aer Lingus -- a former state-owned airline -- to do the same.

EU blocks  Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus  on monopoly concerns

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -  EU regulators blocked a hostile  takeover bid by low-fare carrier Ryanair for
Ireland's  Aer Lingus  on Wednesday, saying it would limit consumer choice and likely boost ticket prices.

Together, the two Irish airlines would control more than 80 percent of all  European flights to and from Dublin airport, the  European Commission said.

"What we are doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said. "Ireland, being an island, depends heavily on air transport."
It is only the second time the EU has blocked a takeover bid since 2001.
The 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion) takeover already appeared doomed after nearly half of Aer Lingus Group PLC
shareholders vowed to block it.

Ryanair believes the EU decision is politically motivated and aimed to please the Irish government. The government and Ryanair each control about a quarter of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair vowed to take regulators to court, citing earlier EU decisions to allow the combination of Air France and
KLM and of Lufthansa and Swissair.

Regulators, however, say the Ryanair bid was unprecedented because both airlines have such a large share of routes at one airport, Dublin. In previous takeovers, the airlines' main hubs were in different cities.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete directly on 35 routes to and from Ireland, regulators said, and the combination would give the combined carrier a monopoly on 22.

"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the European Commission said.
Changes offered by Ryanair to soothe EU concerns were inadequate, it said.

Regulators said the limited number of airport landing slots the airline offered to give away to new rivals would not replace the competitive pressure in the market that would disappear if Ryanair swallowed Aer Lingus.

"What is certain is that Ryanair proposed to end the intense competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus at Dublin airport that has pushed prices down and brought Irish consumers an increasing choice of direct flight connections from Dublin," it said.

"It is highly unlikely that Irish consumers would be better off with a near monopoly, even if it were sweetened by a temporary, hard-to-monitor price rebate."
Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said the EU decision was good news for the company and travelers.

"The creation of one dominant player out of Ireland -- despite the protestations of Ryanair -- just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said.



Page 28 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Aer Lingus and its passengers were the real losers as the company's share price sinks far below the 2.80 euros ($3.77) a share that Ryanair had offered. He had also promised 100 million euros ($134.6 million) in savings for Aer Lingus customers through reduced fares and scrapped fuel surcharges.
Aer Lingus shares fell to 2.55 euros ($3.43) Wednesday.

"This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral loss-making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from Dublin at a time when the rest of the European industry is consolidating," the company said.

O'Leary acknowledged his bid, suspended since December, was now "officially dead," and that Ryanair was legally barred from making a new bid until a court rules on an appeal. That could take 18 to 24 months to be heard.

Growing rapidly from its Irish base into Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading no-frills cheap flights that forced Aer Lingus -- a former state-owned airline -- to do the same.

Daily Briefing: TRANSPORTATION: Ryanair blasts EU regulators

Dublin, Ireland --- Low-fare airline Ryanair vowed Tuesday to sue  EU regulators if they blocked its hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus,  claiming it was the victim of political bias. The  European Commission has until July 4 to block or clear the  deal and has pointed to "serious competition concerns" with the proposed combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.
But Ryanair Holdings PLC Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he expected the  EU's executive arm to refuse him permission to buy the former state-owned carrier, a "politically motivated" decision that he said aimed to please the Irish government,  Aer Lingus  PLC's biggest shareholder. "This is a nakedly political decision. ... It's all to do with looking after the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government," he told reporters in Brussels, Belgium.

EU spokesman Jonathan Todd refused to confirm that the EU would block the deal, saying that consumer interests were "at the foremost in the commission mind."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's top antitrust official said on Wednesday she would be consistent in her handling of airline takeovers, such as an offer for Alitalia , after Brussels blocked Irish carrier Ryanair's bid for its
compatriot Aer Lingus.

* EU Commission blocks Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked an attempt by Ryanair to acquire rival
Irish carrier Aer Lingus, marking only the second merger prohibition by the EU executive in four years.

The Commission, confirming a Reuters report from May 30, decided the combination would destroy competition at Dublin Airport where Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, and Aer Lingus are based.

O'Leary fury as Ryanair take over plan set to be shot down

Outspoken Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary yesterday attacked EU plans to veto its hostile bid to take  
over Irish rival Aer Lingus,  calling the move politically motivated to appease Dublin.

According to sources, the European Commission todayintends to block the approach by Europe's biggest budget airline.

Mr O'Leary's comments revived a ninemonth war of words with Aer Lingus which has strenuously defended itself against a takeover ever since Ryanair's approach last October.
"Michael O'Leary has sought to 'take out' his closest competitor and he has failed," Aer Lingus chief executive
Dermot Mannion said in a statement. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."
Mr O'Leary yesterday repeated that he would appeal against the expected bid veto by going to the EU's Court of
First Instance.

"This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government, which was the only party - other than Aer Lingus itself - to object to the merger," he said.

"The decision is manifestly in error since it is based on the Commission's inaccurate claim that there are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport," he added.

The European Commission responded by saying it was obliged to be "completely impartial and objective" and pointed out that all its merger decisions could be challenged in EU courts.

"This is the first time that we have been looking at a proposed merger where the two airlines operate out of the same home base airport," said the European Commission's spokesman for competition, Jonathan Todd.

Ryanair's 1.48 billion euro (£1 billion) approach for the former state carrier lapsed automatically in December when authorities decided to conduct the in-depth investigation, but the company has said it intends to return with a second offer.

The bid came shortly after Aer Lingus's stock market debut last year but faced big hurdles from the start amid opposition from key shareholders, including Aer Lingus's biggest-the Irish state - with just over 25 per cent.

Recently re-elected Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has said the government's stake is strategic and he will never sell it.

Mr O'Leary said he would "oppose any attempt" by the Commission to force a disposal of its 25 per cent stake, adding that it would lead to a "collapse" in the Aer Lingus share price.

Aer Lingus  welcomes  EU bid decision

Aer Lingus  today welcomed the  EU's decision to block  Ryanair's bid for the airline, saying that it is "good news for its customers."

In a statement issued today, the airline said, "the Board of  Aer Lingus  welcomes the EU Commission's prohibition decision, relating to  Ryanair's hostile bid, announced today following an exhaustive investigation of the competition issues surrounding this unwelcome bid.
"Today's prohibition decision, following the EU Commission's exhaustive investigation, is good news for Aer
Lingus and for our customers. Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one
dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers.
Aer Lingus has made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in successfully executing our strategy and
that work will continue apace. We are determined to deliver on our excellent prospects as an independent
company and I'd like to thank our staff for their continued commitment.

"Today's prohibition announcement supports the Board's position and allows the Company to get on with what it does best - providing consumers with choice, with year round low fares on direct services to popular destinations and with a commitment that we will look after our passengers in the event of disruptions. Aer Lingus already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all consumers, said John Sharman, chairman of Aer Lingus

Ryanair buy of Aer Lingus  blocked  by EU
852 words
27 June 2007
Business and Finance Daily News Service
BNFD
English
Copyright (c) 2007, Media World Ltd
The European Commission has blocked Irish low-cost air carrier  Ryanair proposed E1.48 billion hostile
acquisition of Aer Lingus.

It said the combination would be anti-competitive and harm consumers by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and a dominant position with a market share over 60pc on a further 13.

It added the deal would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million passengers in the EU using these routes to and from Ireland each year.
The EU executive also confirmed that Ryanair's proposed remedies offered during the investigation were
'inadequate' and 'insufficient' to alleviate competition concerns. The 'limited number' of airport slots offered were
'not likely to lead to competition sufficient to replace the competitive pressure currently exercised by each airline
on the other', it continued. The commission said both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are currently by far the largest
airlines offering short-haul flights to and from Ireland and constitute the main competitive constraints on each
other on these routes. It says their position is particularly strong to and from Dublin, where the merged entity
would have accounted for around 80 pct of all intra-European traffic. It's investigation also revealed that most
airlines were unlikely to enter into direct competition against a merged Ryanair/ Aer Lingus in Ireland. 'This is not
only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer Lingus in
Ireland ... but also because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by
competitors,' it reasoned. 'A merged Ryanair/ Aer Lingus would have had even greater flexibility to engage in
selective short-term price reductions and capacity increases if competitors entered routes to and from Ireland, in
order to protect its powerful market position,' it added. 'The likelihood of entry is further reduced by peak-time
congestion at Dublin airport and other airports on overlap routes.' The commission said this case differs from
previous airline mergers it had cleared, because it is the first time it has assessed a tie-up of the two main airlines
in a single country with both operating from the same 'home' airport, in this case Dublin. It is also the first time the
commission has assessed a merger of two 'low-cost' airlines, operating on a 'point-to-point' basis, it said, adding
the number of overlapping routes is 'unprecedented'. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: 'Our
decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport,
and other EU consumers. ''Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give
rise to higher prices. Low-cost carriers like Ryanair are no exception to this rule'. It is only the 20th time the
commission has blocked a merger out of 3,000 cases since 1990. It is also the first time in that period the EU has
vetoed a combination in the EU aviation industry. Yesterday, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he
expected the veto and launched a blistering attack against EU regulators over their analysis of the deal and what
he termed 'persistent and repeated' leaks by the commission of confidential information regarding the process
and decision-making of the file. The group has filed a formal complaint to the EU ombudsman over the alleged
leaks. He also claimed the decision is 'nakedly political', with the commission intent on 'facilitating the interests of
the Irish government'. The EU executive denied all charges made against it. On the analysis, O'Leary said the two
Irish airlines' combined share of route activity from Dublin is equivalent to other merged airlines' shares of their
own European regional airports. He also said the proposed takeover would affect less than 5pc of the European
airline market and would result in E200 million cost savings, as well as E100 million in savings for customers from
lower fares and the scrapping of fuel surcharges. O'Leary said he has a 'high degree of confidence' that the EU's
second-highest court, the European Court of Instance, will overturn the block, following an appeal lodged within
two months of the EU executive's ruling. Ryanair withdrew its 2.80 eur per share takeover bid at the end of
December last year after the commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns'. It
built up a 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid. The deal has faced opposition from the start. Aer
Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, fiercely opposed the deal. Unions have also expressed
concern. Ryanair operates low-cost services on more than 400 routes across Europe and carried more than 40
mln passengers last year. Aer Lingus has changed its business model in recent years to offer mainly low-cost

short-haul flights. It operates more than 80 routes and carried more than 8.6 million passengers last year. Its operations are limited to routes to and from Ireland, operating from Dublin, Shannon and Cork.

The Consumers Association has welcomed the decision by the  EU Commission to block Ryanair's hostile  bid for
Aer Lingus.

Despite assurances from  Ryanair that it would abolish flight surcharges and drop prices, the Association said a Ryanair monopoly in Ireland would result in the airline making more money and the travelling public getting less value.

Announcing the decision today, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said a merger between the two companies would be a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has already vowed to launch a legal challenge to the decision at the
European Court in Luxembourg.

Ryanair confirms it will fight EU ruling
594 words

Ryanair has confirmed that it will appeal the  European Commission's decision to block its proposed E1.48bn hostile acquisition of Aer Lingus.
The airline told reporters at press briefing in Dublin this afternoon that would mount the appeal at the  European
Court of First Instance.
The company said it is confident the court will overturn the EC's ruling.

However, a decision is unlikely to be reached for up to two years and even if the appeal is fast tracked Ryanair chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said it is likely to take at least 18 months. "We look forward to the European Courts overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition," Mr O'Leary said. O'Leary described the decision to block its bid as "unlawful" and said the EU has "overturned twenty years of airline precedency". The airline pointed to a number of takeovers in the airline sector in recent years such as Air France's deal with KLM and the merger between Lufthansa and Swiss. The EU said this morning that it had blocked Ryanair's bid as the combination of it and Aer Lingus would be anti-competitive and harm consumers by creating a monopoly on 22 routes and a dominant position with a market share over 60pc on a further 13. It added that the deal would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million passengers in the EU using these routes to and from Ireland each year. O'Leary said this afternoon described this reasoning as "bull****". "This is a political block and has nothing to do with consumers and nothing to do with fares," he said. The outspoken boss also criticised the Board and Management of Aer Lingus for their "continuing failure to deliver value for its customers or shareholders". He questioned Aer Lingus' decision to recently order new long haul aircraft when prices are at an all time high. "Aer Lingus' actions in recent weeks have damaged its cost base and destroyed significant shareholder value. It would appear that the Board of Aer Lingus is more interested in looking after its own interests and those of the Irish Government than it is in lowering airfares or increasing its share price." 'The EU prohibition leaves Aer Lingus as a struggling, loss making, third-tier small Irish airline. It will dawn on them
that they cannot compete with Ryanair on. Aer Lingus is irrelevant." He again called on Aer Lingus to remove all fuel surcharges and to reduce fares, which O'Leary claims are costing the Irish consumer E100m per annum. "Aer Lingus claimed yesterday that the EU Commission's prohibition is 'another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers'. This is nonsense. Aer Lingus' share price is now significantly below Ryanair's E2.80 offer which means that their shareholders are losing out. The fact that consumers will be denied the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares and the elimination of fuel surcharges means that they will suffer a penalty of over E100m per annum" "Aer Lingus is continuing to waste shareholders' money by ordering new aircraft at the top of the cycle, by supporting expensive T2 facilities at Dublin airport which will double their costs and by wasting almost E20m of shareholders funds to oppose Ryanair's E2.80 offer. This waste has been reflected in their falling share price," he added. At 1530 in Dublin, shares in Aer Lingus were unchanged at E2.60, while Ryanair was down 4c at E4.96.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his low-cost airline taking over Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus.

The attack came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels - the first time for 20 years that the commission's competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger. Ryanair's £1bn offer for Aer Lingus  immediately attracted a formal commission monopolies inquiry, amid concern about the development of a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport and stifling competition.

O’LEARY PLAN DOESN’T FLY: RYANAIR BID TO BUYAER LINGUS BLOCKED

THE EUROPEAN Commission today blocked  Ryanair’s €1.4bn bid to buyAer Lingus,  saying it was a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

Ryanair announced a legal appeal after boss Michael O’Leary claimed Brussels was biased against his company, and was preventing a merger which would mean lower fares for passengers flying in and out of Dublin airport.

The Board of Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying it was “good news for Aer Lingus and for our customers”. Chairman of Aer Lingus John Sharman said: “The creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers.”

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said an inquiry had decided that a merger between the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would remove the existing ‘‘vigorous’’ competition between them and create a monopoly on the 35 routes they share.
The result would be reduced choice and, ‘‘most likely’’, higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers. A Commission statement also blamed Ryanair’s reputation for ‘‘aggressive retaliation’’ for further reducing the
chances of opening up competition from rival airlines.

Mr O’Leary will now take the case to the European Court in Luxembourg, arguing that the planned merger would be between two companies which jointly account for less than 5% of EU air traffic — far less than that enjoyed by Air France and KLM, and other airlines allowed by the Commission to merge.

Yesterday's attack came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels today or next week; the first time for 20 years the  EC's competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger.

Speaking in Brussels, he said: "We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber-stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport."

O'Leary rails at commissioners 'political' block on Aer Lingus  move
David Gow, Brussels
486 words
27 June 2007
The Guardian
GRDN

Michael O'Leary launched a scathing attack on  EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes yesterday for her "nakedly political" decision to block  Ryanair's stalled euros 1.5bn (pounds 1bn)  takeover of Aer Lingus.  Ms Kroes will confirm the ban today.

Getting his retaliation in first, Mr O'Leary accused Ms Kroes of kowtowing to the interests of Bertie Ahern, the Irish premier, whose government retains a 25% stake in the former state-owned  Aer Lingus,  and of being biased against Ryanair.

The commission, the chief executive added, had simply ignored the euros 100m in guaranteed savings the merger would give consumers. "It is quite clear that European consumers can't trust this commission. It supports mergers which result in higher fares and surcharges."

Jonathan Todd, Ms Kroes's spokesman, denied any bias. "The commission is under an obligation to be completely objective and impartial and any merger decisions are subject to challenge before the Court of First Instance so it would not make sense to for it to take a political decision."

Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus's chief executive, scoffed at the political jibe. "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

Mr O'Leary said he would appeal the decision before the CFI, Europe's second-highest court, and if he won could "revisit" the lapsed bid for what he called a "second or even third division" and "loss-making regional European airline" no one else would touch. He vowed to hold on to his airline's 25% stake in Aer Lingus and sue the commission for any attempt to force it to sell it off.

He claimed the EC's "unprecedented" decision to ban a combined airline with a less than 5% EU market share contrasted with that to "rubber stamp" all other mergers between larger competitors such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian with minimal "remedies".

The ever-combative Ryanair chief, who has clashed before with Brussels over his Belgian base at Charleroi, averred that Ms Kroes would on past form wave through potential mergers such as a takeover of Alitalia by Italy's Air One or a BA-led consortium's takeover of Iberia. But he also claimed that Ms Kroes's decision would block future airline consolidation.

The commission will block the all-Irish merger because it would give the combined airline more than 80% of the market for flights out of Dublin - compared with the 61% claimed by Mr O'Leary, who has offered to hand over Aer Lingus slots in Heathrow to BA and Air France and allow them to enter Dublin. "It's not in his gift to do so," Mr Mannion's aides said.

1.45pm: Michael O'Leary's airline has confirmed today it will appeal against the ruling. By David Gow in Brussels.

The European commission today blocked the stalled &#8364;1.5bn (£1bn) merger between Ryanair and Aer    Lingus  but left Michael O'Leary's low-cost carrier open to submit a fresh bid if he offers more slots to rival airlines at Dublin Airport.

Ryanair has confirmed that it will appeal against the ruling, the first of its kind in the airline industry, to the court of first instance (CFI).
Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, insisted the decision was "legally sound" and would bear scrutiny by
Europe's second-highest court.

"Airline consolidation has to be achieved in a way that benefits consumers," she said. "There can't be change at their expense."
She ruled that the combined airline would have had a near-monopoly at Dublin, with no competition on 22 out of
35 routes, and that there was a risk of fares increasing.

Ms Kroes refused to engage in a public slanging match with Mr O'Leary, who had accused her of a "nakedly political" decision and of acting hand in glove with the Irish government, which has a 25% controlling stake in Aer Lingus, and tersely dismissed his political jibe as "nonsense".

"Despite strenuous efforts to find remedies to these problems [of monopoly], no solution was found. Ryanair offered several remedies which I considered very carefully.

"Unfortunately, they were not sufficient to remove the negative effects of the merger for consumers," she told journalists. "A prohibition decision was the only option."

Mr O'Leary claims that the merger would have saved consumers &#8364;100m in lower fares and fuel surcharges but Ms Kroes dismissed this, saying it was only guaranteed for one year.

"Ryanair has provided customers with more competition and more choice. But it cannot now take away that choice."
She said this was not "a never ever decision" and Mr O'Leary, who owns 25% of Aer Lingus, said he could
"revisit" a bid if he won his appeal.

Ms Kroes made plain she had no powers to force Ryanair to dispose of its holding in its former state-owned Irish rival, which is set to expand further in the US.

Aer Lingus  hits out at Ryanair antics ahead of EC block on bid
497 words
27 June 2007
Irish Independent
IINM

AER Lingus  has accused Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary of "lashing out" at the  European Commission in a
"vain" attempt to deflect attention from his failure to "take out his closest competitor".

The surprise statement from the national carrier came as  Ryanair addressed throngs of journalists in Brussels ahead of this morning's  European Commission (EC) announcement blocking the €1.48bn hostile  takeover bid.

At the press conference, Mr O'Leary lambasted the EC for shooting down the bid, saying the decision was politically motivated and based on false information, reversed 20 years of policies supporting airline consolidation, and denied consumers €100m in annual fare savings.
Comments

Following Mr O'Leary's comments, Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion broke his usual policy of declining to comment on the bid by issuing a statement, which was highly critical of Ryanair's tactics.

"Michael O'Leary has sought to 'take out' his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure," said Mr Mannion, adding that "if" the Commission shot down the bid, the decision would be "another boost" for Aer Lingus.

The EC also moved to reject Ryanair's claim that the decision was politically motivated, with the Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes saying the only issue at stake was the interests of the consumers which could best be served by "competitive choice".

In the presentation Ryanair also charged the Department of Transport with providing "inaccurate" information to the EC, which was used to bias the Commission against the carrier.

Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs Jim Callaghan said the airline was not considering pursuing legal action against the department. "It's the Commission's fault. They're the ones who believed it," he said.

Mr O'Leary confirmed Ryanair's plans to appeal the decision to the European Court of First Instance, with the first documents to be lodged two months from today.
"We will revisit the possibility of buying Aer Lingus if the Court (of Justice) overturns the decision, but this is not a
'yes' or a 'no', it is just 'we will revisit it'," Mr O'Leary said in Brussels.

The airline will also pursue a separate legal action if the EC's moves to make Ryanair sell any of its 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus, Mr Callaghan said.
The EC will today defend its decision at a press conference in Brussels, with Mr Kroes expected to stress the
EC's role in liberalising Europe's sky and providing Ryanair with a platform for growth.

"The Commission was successful in liberating the market, but it's a bit ironic that they're now saying we should be grateful for that, when at the same time they're turning their backs on competition.
"They're turning down a merger that would save the travelling public €100m a year," said Mr Callaghan.

Budget carrier admits errors in Aer Lingus  route claims
281 words
27 June 2007
Irish Independent
IINM
English
(c) 2007 Independent Newspapers Ireland Ltd
RYANAIR has admitted that it "may have made some errors" in claiming that  Aer Lingus  pulled out of 23
European routes because of competition from the budget carrier.

In a presentation yesterday  Ryanair detailed 23 routes that Aer Lingus  had recently withdrawn from, claiming five of these withdrawals came after  Ryanair launched its hostile takeover bid last October.

The low cost carrier said Aer Lingus' withdrawal proved that the national carrier wasn't aggressively competing with Ryanair.
However, Aer Lingus commercial director Enda Corneille said Ryanair's information was "completely inaccurate". "They say we pulled out of Seville and Toulouse and Turin this year, but we haven't; those are just seasonal
routes that aren't served all year round," he said.
"And they also say we pulled out of two routes we never even served, Dusseldorf and Helsinki."

Aer Lingus' website shows that Seville and Toulouse are indeed bookable, while Mr Corneille said that as a seasonal route, Turin is only bookable in the winter.

Ryanair's head of legal and regulatory affairs Jim Callaghan acknowledged there may have been some errors in their information.

However, he stressed the information had been fully audited and submitted to the European Commission as part of Ryanair's "defence document" in the bid process.

"The overall point we're trying to make is still the same," he said. "What we're saying is that Aer Lingus has been pulling off routes where it competes with Ryanair, not jumping on to them.
"Whether it's 16 routes or 23 isn't really the issue. The issue is how the two airlines compete." LAURA NOONAN

O’Leary blasts regulators over Aer Lingusdeal
By James Moore

The low-cost airline  Ryanair went on the offensive yesterday, saying it planned to sue European Union regulators if – as expected – they block its €1.5bn (£1bn) hostile  bid for its rival Aer Lingus  today.

The European Commission has already pointed to what it calls “serious competition concerns” as a result of the proposed link-up between Ireland’s two main airlines, fearing higher fares and reduced customer choice.

The ever-combative Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary dismissed the arguments, saying the airline had pledged to cut fares, scrap excess fuel charges and sell off landing slots as remedies. He accused the commission of a “politically motivated decision” designed to appease the Irish government, which is vehemently opposed to Ryanair’s takeover of the former state-owned carrier. “It’s all to do with looking after the narrow vested interests of the Irish government,” he said.

Mr O’Leary argued that the two airlines accounted for less than 5 per cent of the EU market, and said turning down the proposed deal “would be a remarkable decision, a historical unprecedented decision to turn down … a merger that for the first time guarantees €100m per annum in fare cuts”. He continued: “It also sends a message that it’s going to be much more difficult for EU airline consolidation to proceed.”

Ryanair denied there were barriers to entry at Dublin airport, arguing a new terminal and runway were being built which would facilitate competition.

Mr O’Leary said: “We call on the commission to explain how it can rubber-stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/Aer Lin-gus share at Dublin airport.

“When Air France, which has over 60 per cent share of aircraft movements at Paris Charles de Gaulle, is allowed by the commission (with minimal remedies) to acquire KLM, which has over 60 per cent share of movements at Schiphol [Amsterdam], it is untenable that the commission now changes these rules, to prohibit a Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger which will result in a similar 60 per cent share of movements at only one airport, Dublin, which is currently doubling its capacity.”

Aer Lingus’s chief executive, Dermot Mannion, accused Mr O’Leary of “lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise [his] failure” to “take out” his closest competitor. He added: “If the EU Commission announces a prohibition decision following its exhaustive investigation, it will represent another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers. We have made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in successfully executing our strategy and look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. The environment is competitive and we will continue to fight to deliver on our excellent prospects as an independent company.”

If the veto is made, it would be only the 20th time the commission has blocked a merger out of 3,000 cases it has considered since 1990. It would also be the first aviation industry deal that the commission has scuppered.

RUMOUR OF THE DAY: EU to clip O'Leary's  wings

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his low-cost airline taking over Ireland's national carrier,  Aer Lingus.

The attack came amid growing speculation the ban would be announced by Brussels as soon as today - the first time for 20 years that the commission's competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger.

O'Leary said there was no justification for what would be an "unprecedented" decision. "This is designed to appeal solely to the narrow vested interests of the Irish government and ignore the benefits to millions of consumers."

Ryanair's GBP 1 billion offer for Aer Lingus immediately attracted a monopolies inquiry amid concern about a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport.

The European Commission will block Irish low-cost airline  Ryanair Holdings PLC's  bid for Irish flag carrier  Aer   Lingus  Group PLC today,  Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. The decision by the  European Union's executive body serves solely the narrow interests of the Irish government, Mr. O'Leary said. The Irish government is Aer Lingus's  biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 25%. "The commission's obligation is to be
completely impartial and objective,"  EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.  Aer Lingus  CEO Dermot Mannion rebuked Mr. O'Leary and vowed to keep  Aer Lingus  independent. "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor, and he has failed," Mr. Mannion said. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

Indications are that the European Commission will refuse permission to  Europe's largest cut-price airline,
Ryanair, to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus.  The €1.48 million  bid went to second-phase consideration in March
2007. The decision is expected in the Commission meeting of 27 June. Chief of  Ryanair Michael Leary has
already publicly anticipated the «politically motivated» blocking decision and has said he will appeal. (RMI)

O'Leary rails at commissioner's 'political' block on Aer Lingus  move

Michael O'Leary launched a scathing attack on  EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes yesterday for her "nakedly political" decision to block  Ryanair's stalled euros 1.5bn (pounds 1bn)  takeover of Aer Lingus.  Ms Kroes will confirm the ban today.

Getting his retaliation in first, Mr O'Leary accused Ms Kroes of kowtowing to the interests of Bertie Ahern, the Irish premier, whose government retains a 25% stake in the former state-owned  Aer Lingus,  and of being biased against Ryanair.

The commission, the chief executive added, had simply ignored the euros 100m in guaranteed savings the merger would give consumers. "It is quite clear that European consumers can't trust this commission. It supports mergers which result in higher fares and surcharges."

Jonathan Todd, Ms Kroes's spokesman, denied any bias. "The commission is under an obligation to be completely objective and impartial and any merger decisions are subject to challenge before the Court of First Instance so it would not make sense to for it to take a political decision."

Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus's chief executive, scoffed at the political jibe. "Michael O'Leary has sought to take out his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure."

Mr O'Leary said he would appeal the decision before the CFI, Europe's second-highest court, and if he won could "revisit" the lapsed bid for what he called a "second or even third division" and "loss-making regional European airline" no one else would touch. He vowed to hold on to his airline's 25% stake in Aer Lingus and sue the commission for any attempt to force it to sell it off.

He claimed the EC's "unprecedented" decision to ban a combined airline with a less than 5% EU market share contrasted with that to "rubber stamp" all other mergers between larger competitors such as Air France-KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss/Austrian with minimal "remedies".

The ever-combative Ryanair chief, who has clashed before with Brussels over his Belgian base at Charleroi, averred that Ms Kroes would on past form wave through potential mergers such as a takeover of Alitalia by Italy's Air One or a BA-led consortium's takeover of Iberia. But he also claimed that Ms Kroes's decision would block future airline consolidation.

The commission will block the all-Irish merger because it would give the combined airline more than 80% of the market for flights out of Dublin - compared with the 61% claimed by Mr O'Leary, who has offered to hand over Aer Lingus slots in Heathrow to BA and Air France and allow them to enter Dublin. "It's not in his gift to do so," Mr Mannion's aides said.

EU blocks  Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus

The EU competition watchdog and Ryanair on Wednesday appeared headed for a dogfight in an  EU court as regulators blocked the low-cost carrier's takeover of Irish rival  Aer Lingus.

The European Commission forbade the  takeover on the grounds that the  merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines would have given the combined carrier a crushing grip on 35 routes.

Although Ryanair withdrew its bid in December after regulators launched an in-depth competition probe, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would relaunch it if the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

Ryanair, which already owns 25% of Aer Lingus, launched an unsuccessful takeover bid last October that valued its smaller rival at Eur1.481 billion ($1.992 billion), only days after the former Irish flagship was partly floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.

RYANAIR TAKEOVER OF AER LINGUS BLOCKED
936 words
27 June 2007
18:41
Press Association National Newswire
PRESSA
English

By Geoff Meade, PA  Europe Editor, in Brussels

Ryanair's takeover of Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus  was blocked by the European Commission today as a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said an inquiry had decided that a merger between the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would remove the existing ''vigorous'' competition between them and create a monopoly on the 35 routes they share.
The result would be reduced choice and, ''most likely'', higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers. A Commission statement also blamed Ryanair's reputation for ''aggressive retaliation'' for further reducing the
chances of opening up competition from rival airlines.

Ryanair immediately announced a legal appeal after boss Michael O'Leary claimed Brussels was biased against his company and was preventing a merger which would mean lower fares for passengers flying in and out of Dublin airport.
Ryanair already owns 25% of Aer Lingus and attacked the Commission ban on a full takeover as ''bizarre'' and
''illogical''.
But Ms Kroes told a press conference in Brussels at the end of a major monopolies investigation by EU officials:
''Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air
transport, and other EU consumers.

''Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices - and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair are no exception to this rule.''

Mr O'Leary, whose airline is one of the biggest in the world, had submitted merger plans to Brussels designed to remove any objections - including a guarantee of lower fares and an end to fuel surcharges for passengers using the new merged airline.
But Ms Kroes said the ''remedies'' offered by Ryanair to avoid the merger creating an illegal monopoly under EU
rules ''were not sufficient to remove the competition concerns''.

Mr O'Leary will take the case to the European Court in Luxembourg, arguing that the planned merger would be between two companies which jointly account for less than 5% of EU air traffic - far less than the share enjoyed by Air France and KLM, and other airlines which have been allowed by the Commission to merge.

But the Commission denies charges that it is ''politically biased'' against Ryanair, pointing out that the takeover involves two key carriers operating from the same place, and with little prospect, in the Commission's view, of rival carriers competing on Dublin routes.

A Commission statement said a limited number of take-off and landing ''slots'' at Dublin would discourage competitors.

It went on: ''The investigation also revealed that most airlines were unlikely to enter into direct competition against a merged Ryanair/ Aer Lingus in Ireland.

Page 54 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
'This is not only because the merged entity would be able to operate from the very large bases of Ryanair and Aer Lingus in Ireland ... but also because Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors.''

Answering Ryanair complaints that the Commission has approved all other mergers between competing European airlines in the last 20 years, the Commission statement said the Irish case was different: it was the first proposed merger between the two main airlines in a single country operating from the same ''home'' airport, with an unprecedented number of overlapping routes between them.

Ryanair and Aer Lingus are by far the biggest airlines offering short-haul European flights to and from Ireland, and the two companies were ''the main competitive constraints on each other'' on those routes.
If merged, they would account for about 80% of all European air traffic in and out of Ireland.
Ryanair operates more than 400 routes across Europe, and carried more than 40 million passengers last year. Aer Lingus has increasingly moved into the 'low-cost'' carrier market, operating more than 80 routes and carrying
more than 8.6 million passengers in 2006.

(reopens) Management at Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying it was good news for the company and its customers.

Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said: 'Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers.

' Aer Lingus already competes successfully with Ryanair across many routes and will continue to do so in the interests of all consumers.''
(reopoens) Mr O'Leary later expressed confidence that the Commission decision would be overturned by the
European court.

He described the decision to block the takeover as 'unprecedented and unlawful'' and rejected an Aer Lingus claim that the Commission move was a boost for the national carrier and its customers.
Mr O'Leary said the Aer Lingus share price was now significantly below Ryanair's takeover offer of 2.80 euros.

'The fact that consumers will be denied the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares and the elimination of fuel surcharges means that they will suffer a penalty of over 100 million euros (£70 million) a year,'' said the Ryanair boss.

He went on: 'We call on Aer Lingus to lower their fares and scrap unfair fuel surcharges and at least deliver the same value to consumers that Ryanair's offer would.
'In the meantime, Ryanair will continue to grow, will continue to offer lower fares and will continue to beat Aer
Lingus on price and punctuality.
'We look forward to the European courts overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition.''

Ryanair flies into a rage over takeover ban
By Sion Barry Western Mail

The Western Mail
WESMAI
English
(c) 2007 Western Mail and Echo Ltd
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary yesterday criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his low-cost airline taking over Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus.

The attack came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels today or next week - the first time for 20 years that the Commission's competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger.
Mr O'Leary, speaking in Brussels yesterday, said there was no justification for the "unprecedented" decision.

He said, "This is designed to appeal solely to the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government and ignore the benefits to millions of consumers."

Ryanair's £1bn offer for Aer Lingus immediately attracted a formal Commission monopolies inquiry amid concern about the development of a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport and stifling competition.
Mr O'Leary pointed out that the proposed takeover affected less than 5% of the European airline market.

And he insisted he had already guaranteed massive savings for passengers of about £70m per year in lower fares and fuel surcharges.

He said if the Commission does announce a block on the takeover, " Aer Lingus passengers should send the bill for their higher fares and fuel surcharges to the European Commission in Brussels".

He added, "The Commission's decision to prohibit this merger between two EU airlines, which between them represent just 5% of European airline traffic, is not just unprecedented but, in our view, unlawful.

"We call on the Commission to explain how it can rubber stamp mergers between larger airlines such as Air France/ KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/Austrian, when these airlines have bigger positions at their home airports than the combined Ryanair/ Aer Lingus share at Dublin Airport."

Mr O'Leary said the Air France/KLM merger had resulted in significant fare increases - but Ryanair has offered unprecedented reductions which, he said, were guaranteed.
He accused the Commission of targeting Ryanair with a "unique" set of rules which did not mirror the
Commission's approach to airline takeover cases for the last 20 years.
Apart from Aer Lingus, only the Irish Government raised objections to the proposed merger, and last March the
Commission set out a "statement of objections" against the move.

Final confirmation that the deal will not be permitted is bound to raise the stakes in the lengthy difficult relationship between Mr O'Leary and EU competition officials.

Ryanair claimed any ban was based on an inaccurate analysis of the effects on European airline competition and the competitive position of Dublin Airport.

A Ryanair statement said Brussels was wrong to claim that competing airlines would not enter Dublin Airport if Ryanair took over Aer Lingus - "the case file proves that other competitors have confirmed they will enter Dublin Airport."

The low-cost carrier owns 25% of Aer Lingus and, once the takeover ban is announced, intends to appeal to
European judges in Luxembourg.
"The court has overturned several Commission prohibitions and we expect it will do so again in this case," said Mr
O'Leary.

FURIOUS  Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary yesterday vowed to appeal a ruling stopping him from taking over  Aer
Lingus.
The European Commission yesterday kicked out the budget airline's plans to  buy out the former national airline. But Mr O'Leary called the ruling "unprecedented and unlawful".
He said he was confident the European courts would overturn the decision.
The EC ruled the merger between the two companies would destroy competition at Dublin Airport and on the
Dublin-London route.
But Mr O'Leary said travellers would suffer as a result of the decision.

He added: "The fact that consumers will be denied the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares and the elimination of fuel surcharges means that they will suffer a penalty of over EUR100million a year."

Ryanair bid blocked  for Aer Lingus

Nicola Clark reported from Paris.

* A bid by the low-cost airline  Ryanair to buyAer Lingus,  the Irish flag carrier, was blocked Wednesday as the top European regulator showed a willingness to intervene despite the overturning of past  merger prohibitions in court. The ruling from the  European Commission prompted a robust reaction and the promise of a legal challenge from Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary, who accused Brussels of bowing to political pressure from the Irish government, which had opposed the  deal.

In barring what would have been the first takeover of a national flag carrier by a low-cost rival, the European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, invoked her power to prohibit mergers for only the second time since taking office in 2004. The commission said the combination of the two Dublin-based airlines would have created a near-monopoly in the Irish market.

Competition lawyers argued that the commission was on relatively safe ground, having revised its procedures after a series of reverses in the European Court of First Instance in 2002.

"This is pretty much an open-and-shut case," said Catriona Hatton, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Hogan & Hartson. "The only question was whether the remedies offered by Ryanair could have been sufficient to bring in a significant new competitor on the routes."

Hatton said the effect of past reversals of European Commission decisions "was to require more and more information and evidence to establish a case."
"The burden on the commission in terms of the depth of the analysis has increased," she said.

In a rare departure, the executive body even commissioned an independent consultant to carry out a customer survey at the Dublin airport to track travellers' opinions.

Since taking office, Kroes has used her powers sparingly, though she did bar the merger of two Portuguese electricity and natural gas companies in 2004. Several other deals have been allowed to go ahead only under strict conditions.

However, the bare statistics disguise a growing trend of planned mergers being called off by the parties involved if they think they would receive a negative decision from the commission.

To try to win approval for its bid of 1.48 billion, or $1.99 billion, Ryanair had offered to lower Aer Lingus's short-haul fares by 10 percent for one year and to sell airport slots for a new rival operating as many as six aircraft.

But the commission said a merger would have created a monopoly on 22 out of 35 routes in or out of Ireland. It argued that the number of slots Ryanair offered to give up would not have permitted a viable competitor to emerge, and that the price cut would be limited in duration and difficult to enforce.

Even without the commission's intervention, Ryanair would have struggled to complete the takeover. The airline managed to amass only a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus since it proposed the merger.

Ryanair promised to appeal to the Court of First Instance, saying in a statement that consumers would suffer from the denial of "the Ryanair guarantee of lower Aer Lingus fares and the elimination of fuel surcharges."

Aer Lingus, which was privatized in September - just days before Ryanair's hostile bid - welcomed the commission's decision.

"Air Lingus has said all along that the best way to serve the interests of consumers and our shareholders is for us to remain as an independent company," Dermot Mannion, the chief executive of Aer Lingus, said by telephone from Dublin.

Mannion said he was unconcerned by the possibility that Ryanair would appeal the ruling, saying that commission lawyers had closely scrutinized the market impact of the proposed deal. "The decision will stand, I have no doubt about that," he said. "The Ryanair takeover deal is over."
Some observers had expected the commission to try to force Ryanair to sell its 25 percent stake in its rival, but
Kroes said the regulator was "not in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share."

She also said that she was open to considering a revised offer from Ryanair, arguing that hers was not "a never-ever decision."

Mannion said he did not expect Ryanair's stake to represent a significant impediment to managing the company. "There are almost no circumstances that I can conceive" that would require Aer Lingus management to obtain approval from 75 percent or more of its shareholders, he said.
The Irish government owns just over 25 percent of Aer Lingus, while the airline's employees, who rejected
Ryanair's bid last year, hold about 13 percent.
Mannion noted that Aer Lingus had required only 50 percent plus one share approval from investors to sign a
$2.4 billion deal earlier this month to purchase 12 new aircraft from Airbus, including six next-generation
A350-XWB jets.

Editorial
EU ruling  on Ryanair - O’Leary’s  gallop needed to be halted
620 words
28 June 2007
The Irish Examiner
IRISEX
English

ACCUSTOMED to getting his own way in things, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary will find it hard to swallow the
European Commission’s decision to block his takeover of Aer Lingus.

Ironically, its ruling against the €1.4bn  bid by Europe’s biggest budget airline is grounded on maintaining competition in the industry and avoiding a monopoly situation.

Doubtless, aggressive lobbying by the Government against the Ryanair tender was a significant factor. As shareholders in the airline, the Government and workforce bitterly opposed the predatory swoop barely two weeks after the State-owned company was privatised.

In its blind haste to sell off Aer Lingus, the Government had failed to anticipate the O’Leary threat. Whether Ryanair will eventually be forced to sell off its 25% stake in Aer Lingus is unclear. Significantly, however, the commission says it has no role in resolving the shares question.

Given his dogged record, the combative presence of the Ryanair chief executive will continue to overshadow Aer Lingus. Characteristically, he accuses the EU of ignoring the real issues and is already planning to launch a legal appeal in the European courts in an attempt to overturn the commission’s ruling.

And he has challenged the commission to justify its approval of mergers between bigger carriers like Air France and KLM when they controlled far larger portions of traffic.

Conversely, Aer Lingus has applauded the EU finding, describing it as "good news" for the company and its customers. The airline’s chairman John Sharman claims the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland could not be in the interests of consumers.

A fair point. Despite Ryanair’s remarkable record of price-cutting, driving other airlines to reduce fares, it would be a bad day for consumers if one airline held sway on the Irish routes, vital links for an island nation on Europe’s western fringes.

Nobody could forget how costly air travel was in the days when Aer Lingus dominated the Irish market. Flights between Britain and Ireland cost a small fortune at the time. Thus, Ryanair’s arrival on the scene has been one of the better moments in Irish airline history.

With competition in mind, the EU decision, which represents only the second merger prohibition by the executive in four years, was the right way to go. Arguably, by ruling against the marriage of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, the commission aims to stoke the embers of ongoing competition at Dublin Airport where the rival airlines are based.

In his efforts to assuage commission fears, Mr O’Leary had promised to reduce Aer Lingus short-haul fares and scrap fuel surcharges. He also offered to transfer the airline’s valuable landing slots at Heathrow to British Airways and Air France while its Dublin slots would go to other competitors.

However, if he was really serious about clinching the takeover deal, he should have gone further to make it clear his bid was genuine and not merely an attempt to muddy the waters for other prospective bidders.

An obviously relieved Aer Lingus boss Dermot Mannion suggests customers will benefit from what he describes as the head-to-head, toe-to-toe competition between Ireland’s leading airlines.

Typifying the cut and thrust of this naked competition, Mr O’Leary lost no time yesterday in criticising his opponent’s high fares and fuel surcharges. And he accused Aer Lingus of shying away from real competition, dropping routes where it was competing with Ryanair.

If anything can be certain in the cut-throat airline business, it seems the consumer will be the winner of the battle for supremacy of Ireland’s skies.

Ryanair to appeal decision to block Aer Lingustakeover
597 words
28 June 2007
The Irish Examiner
IRISEX
English

RYANAIR may not take overAer Lingus,  the European Commission has ruled in its first ever veto on an airline
merger.

The commission said its decision on the hostile  take-over is not a matter of "never ever" but for another  Ryanair bid to be successful, it would have to ensure there were sufficient slots available to allow a new comer to successfully operate out of Dublin.

Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the merged airlines would have a monopoly of 80% of the flights into and out of Dublin and there would not be sufficient capacity left to allow other companies to compete.

Ms Kroes said she had no option but to prohibit the €1.48 billion takeover as it would have led to a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes carrying 14 million passengers to and from Ireland and with no competition at all on 22 of them.
"That is such a dominant position that a newcomer would not have been interested in joining the play," she said. Even with Ryanair’s offer to sell two thirds of Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow and to provide space there and at
Stansted for a competitor, they were not enough, she said. They would have needed to sell off more slots in
Dublin.

"Ryanair offered several remedies which I considered very carefully. Unfortunately they were not sufficient to remove the negative effects of the merger for consumers. They were in particular not capable of ensuring that other airlines would enter the market on a sufficient scale to compete effectively with the merged airline," she told a press conference in Brussels.

Ryanair has said they will appeal the decision to the European Court of First Instance — a step the commission appeared to have expected them to take. Ms Kroes said that she was confident that the decision was legally sound and would bear the court’s scrutiny.

She defended the decision to prohibit this merger while allowing the Air France and KLM on the basis that they operated from two different main airports — Paris and Amsterdam — while Ryanair and Aer Lingus shared Dublin and Ireland was an island heavily dependent on air transport.

Their offer to save consumers €100m by reducing Aer Lingus short-haul fares by 10% was just for one year and was described by the commission as a headline-grabbing figure that could not be monitored and did not include any commitments on Ryanair’s own fares or Aer Lingus the following year.

Describing Ryanair as one of the largest airlines on the planet, with more than 400 routes in Europe carrying 40 million passengers a year Ms Kroes said that Ryanair had built a successful business thanks to the liberalisation.

"Ryanair has provided consumers with more competition and more choice. But Ryanair cannot now take away that choice.
"Any monopoly, even if advertised as low-cost or low-fares, is bad for consumers."

Ms Kroes dismissed as "nonsense" claims made by Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary that the commission’s decision was politically motivated. The Government holds a 25.3% stake in the airline and made a submission to the commission against allowing the merger.

Asked about the personal attacks made by Mr O’Leary, the competition Commissioner said that he was correct in his assessment that had he stood on his head, butt naked she would not be impressed.

"It was a matter of the number of slots and a newcomer getting the opportunity to compete in that market," she said.

Aer Lingus  breathes easy

The Irish Examiner

English
© Irish Examiner, 2007. Thomas Crosbie Media, TCH
AER LINGUS chief executive Dermot Mannion says competition with  Ryanair will benefit all travellers.

Responding to the  EC’s ban on Ryanair’s bid, Mr Mannion said the battle between the two carriers will lead to lower fares and better choice of destinations. He told the Irish Examiner last night that  Aer Lingus’  future would be as an independent and he wanted to see greater "liquidity" in the company’s shares, a sign the airline sought to force Ryanair to sell off its 25% stake.
Mr Mannion said there was a great deal of uncertainty, but one option is to appeal to the Commission under
Article 81 on restrictive business practices.

Ryanair has threatened to use its stake to stop Aer Lingus doing anything "silly" and could make trouble at shareholder meetings. It is not thought this would be enough for regulators to force a sell-off.

Mr Mannion said there was relief within the airline that the bid finally failed, an outcome he believed would happen since Ryanair announced its takeover plans last October. He said Aer Lingus was moving ahead with its business plan, which involved more flights to the US and Europe and a €1.2bn fleet expansion.

Business - Commission blocks  Irish airline  takeover attempt
450 words
28 June 2007
The Irish News
IRISHN
English

Ryanair's takeover of Aer Lingus  was blocked by the European Commission yesterday as a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said an inquiry had decided that a  merger between the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would remove the existing "vigorous" competition between them and create a monopoly on the 35 routes they share.
The result would be reduced choice and, "most likely", higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers, Ms
Kroes said.

A commission statement also blamed Ryanair's reputation for "aggressive retaliation" for further reducing the chances of opening up competition from rival airlines.

Ryanair immediately announced a legal appeal after boss Michael O'Leary claimed Brussels was biased against his company and was preventing a merger which would mean lower fares for passengers flying in and out of Dublin airport.

Ryanair already owns 25 per cent of Aer Lingus and attacked the commission ban on a full takeover as "bizarre" and "illogical".

But Ms Kroes said in Brussels at the end of a major monopolies investigation by EU officials: "Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport, and other EU consumers.

"Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices - and low-cost carriers such as Ryanair are no exception to this rule."

Mr O'Leary, whose airline is one of the biggest in the world, had submitted merger plans to Brussels designed to remove any objections - including a guarantee of lower fares and an end to fuel surcharges for passengers using the new merged airline.
But Ms Kroes said the "remedies" offered by Ryanair to avoid the merger creating an illegal monopoly under EU
rules "were not sufficient to remove the competition concerns".

Mr O'Leary will take the case to the European Court in Luxembourg, arguing that the planned merger would be between two companies which jointly account for less than 5 per cent of EU air traffic - far less than the share enjoyed by Air France and KLM, and other airlines which have been allowed by the commission to merge.

But the commission denies charges that it is biased against Ryanair, pointing out that the takeover involves two key carriers operating from the same place and with little prospect of rival carriers competing on Dublin routes.
Ryanair operates more than 400 routes across Europe and carried 40 million passengers last year.

Aer Lingus has increasingly moved into the 'low-cost' carrier market, operating more than 80 routes and carrying more than 8.6 million passengers last year.

Commission blocks  bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus.
Jamie Smyth in Brussels
555 words
28 June 2007
Irish Times
IRTI
English
(c) 2007, The Irish Times.
The European Commission has prohibited  Ryanair's proposed €1.5 billion  takeover of Aer Lingus,  arguing that it would harm consumers.

In a decision published yesterday, the commission concluded that the  merger would have created competition concerns on at least 35 routes operated by both companies.

"Our decision to prohibit this merger was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport," said competition commissioner Neelie Kroes. "Monopolies are bad for consumers because they reduce choice, lower quality and give rise to higher prices. Low cost carriers like Ryanair are not exempt to this rule."

But Ms Kroes did not rule out a future merger between the airlines if Ryanair could offer remedies that met the commission's competition requirements. This is not "a never ever decision" and the deal could go ahead under the right conditions, she added.

Ms Kroes also said the commission had no power to force Ryanair to sell its 25.2 per cent stake it has built up in Aer Lingus. The commission is not in a position to request Ryanair to divest its shares because it did not amount to a controlling stake, she said.

Aer Lingus had hoped the commission would force Ryanair to sell its stake and it may be forced to complain to the Irish Competition Authority to seek this action now.

The decision to block the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger is only the second prohibition of a merger that the commission has made in four years.

It also marks the first time that the commission has blocked a proposed merger between two European airlines. In recent years the commission has passed several major airline mergers such as KLM/Air France, Lufthansa/Swiss and Lufthansa/ Eurowings. But Ms Kroes justified the decision to block the Ryanair/ Aer Lingus merger because it was the first time the commission had judged a case involving airlines that are based in a single country.

Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying it was good news for its customers and the airline. "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," said John Sharman, chairman of Aer Lingus.

Ms Kroes rejected allegations from Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary that the commission had made a "nakedly political decision" by supporting the Government. She said the commission had no choice but to prohibit the merger because its investigation and a market test of the various remedies offered by Ryanair were inadequate to remove competition concerns.

Ms Kroes highlighted the limited number of slots available at Dublin airport as a key problem that could not be addressed by Ryanair and highlighted significant barriers to entry for other potential competitors.

The decision noted Ryanair's aggressive competition against new entrants, which caused even the second most successful low cost firm Easyjet to stop flying to Dublin in 2006. It also found that the merger of Aer Lingus/Ryanair would give the combined company an 80 per cent share of the passengers at Dublin airport.
It would also lead to competition concerns over 35 routes to and from Ireland (32 of these routes were to and from
Dublin).

Ruling fails to ruffle stock.

Market reaction: The long-awaited, and by now expected, news that the  European Commission has blocked
Ryanair's planned takeover of Aer Lingus  did little to affect the former State airline's share price yesterday.

The stock did in fact end the day down 2.7 per cent, or seven cent, at €2.55, though volume was very light, with only 241,000 shares changing hands - about half the daily average.

Analysts were not surprised, saying that the ruling meant little to the stock as the news had already been priced in. One analyst said the only trading likely to have taken place yesterday was by hedge funds taking the opportunity to exit the stock now that it is no longer a takeover target. Several funds are known for buying into stocks that are targets.

What may affect the share price, however, is the news that Ryanair will not be forced to sell its 25.2 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.

"There had been considerable concern in the market that this would lead to a large overhang in the stock," said one Dublin analyst, adding that this had been weighing on the price recently.
Still, if Ryanair holds on to the stock, it could also cause problems for Aer Lingus, particularly given the fact that
the Government has a 25.4 per cent stake in the airline. Analysts were quick to point out that, with these two large
stakeholders, and a near 15 per cent holding by the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot), the number of
shares available in the open market is small, a fact that could deter some investors.

As for the current price, analysts were in agreement that, at €2.55, Aer Lingus is trading at a reasonable discount to other European flag carrier airlines.
Whether it is worth a punt, however, cannot really be answered until it releases its next set of results. Document IRTI000020070628e36s00022

European Union regulators blocked low-cost airline  Ryanair Holdings PLC from  buying  its Irish peer  Aer Lingus Group PLC, saying that such a  merger would have led to a quasi-monopoly in the Irish market. By combining the two leading airlines that operate from Ireland, "the  merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the
European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.  Ryanair said it will appeal the decision, calling it unlawful. Aer Lingus  Chairman John Sharman welcomed the decision, saying it was good news for competition. Ryanair had failed to win backing among  Aer Lingus  shareholders for the 1.48 billion euros ($1.99 billion) deal, but the EU's decision means Ryanair is unlikely to make a fresh offer.

EU vetoes Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus; 'What we're doing is preventing a monopoly'
Bloomberg News

BRUSSELS

European Union regulators blocked  Ryanair Holdings Plc's 1.48 billion-euro ($2 billion U.S.)  bid for Aer Lingus
Plc, the first  merger veto since 2004, because the  takeover would allow the airline to dominate 35 routes.

The European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, said Ryanair's offer to sell takeoff and landing slots was inadequate. The acquisition would have eliminated Ryanair's main competitor in Ireland, the commission said yesterday.

"What we're doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging in air transport," EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said at a briefing in Brussels. "Ireland being an island, it depends heavily on air transport." Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said he will appeal the "unprecedented" ruling to the European Court of First Instance. The veto is the first since December 2004, when Kroes blocked plans by EDP- Energias de Portugal SA to take joint control of Gas de Portugal.

Ryanair said it is confident the veto will be overturned because a merger would guarantee fare reductions of more than 100 million euros annually for consumers, the company said yesterday.
The carrier, Europe's largest discount airline, announced its hostile bid in October to combine the two
Dublin-based carriers. The EU regulator started a probe in December into concerns that the merger would restrict
competition on Dublin-London flights.

"It's a situation where the most efficient operators are penalized for having the highest market share," said Stephen Furlong, an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin who has the stock on his "focus list." The Irish government is the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus with a 25.3-per-cent stake and opposes a Ryanair takeover because it says a buyout would lead to a monopoly on air travel.
O'Leary said Tuesday that a veto would be a "nakedly political decision" to favour Irish government interests over
European consumers.
Yesterday's decision is "legally sound" and will "bear the scrutiny" of the courts, Kroes said.

Appeals at the European courts can last several years. An initial ruling by the European Court of First Instance can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court.
The decision is good news for Aer Lingus and travellers, the carrier said in a statement.

"Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," CEO John Sharman said in the statement.

Shares of Ryanair fell 3 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $6.68 U.S. in Dublin. Aer Lingus shares fell 7 cents, or 2.7 per cent, to $3.43 U.S.

The European Commission vetoed a merger between two  European Union-based airlines for the first time yesterday when it prevented the low-fare operator  Ryanair from taking over  Aer Lingus,  Ireland's national carrier.

Explaining the unprecedented but expected decision, Neelie Kroes, the Competition Commissioner, said: "This takeover would have led to dramatically reduced choice for consumers and the likelihood of lower quality and higher fares."

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, who had accused the Commission of siding with the Irish Government, said that he would appeal. "We look forward to the European courts overturning this unlawful prohibition," he said.

As European airlines forge new partnerships to withstand competition from the United States, the Commission has raised no objections to earlier mergers. These included Air France with KLM, and Lufthansa with Swissair.
Each merger involved about 70 million passengers a year -considerably more than the 50 million who use
Ryanair and Aer Lingus. However, a key factor in the ruling was the fact that both airlines had large operations at
Dublin airport.

"The merged company would have had a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes to and from Ireland. It would have accounted for around 80 per cent of all intra- European traffic at Dublin airport," Mrs Kroes said.

Ryanair had promised to abolish the fuel surcharge that Aer Lingus passengers pay and to reduce fares. It also offered slots at Dublin and Heathrow to make room for a rival carrier.

Ryanair pledges to fight takeover ban

BUDGET airline  Ryanair yesterday warned it would appeal against the decision by the  European Commission to block its attempted £1billion  takeover of Irish rival  Aer Lingus.

In only the second such merger prohibition in four years, the commission ruled the deal would be bad for consumer choice.
Furious Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said his airline would mount an appeal at the European Court of
First Instance.
"We look forward to the courts overturning this unprecedented and unlawful prohibition, " he added.

The commission said the merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would destroy competition at Dublin airport and combine two Irish carriers that competed vigorously. An enlarged Ryanair would have a monopoly of 22 routes, it added.

"The commission concluded the merger would harm consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties, " its ruling said.
But, in a surprise move, EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the antitrust body could not force
Ryanair to sell the 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus it built up during last year's bid battle.
That leaves Ryanair with a holding large enough to block some decisions by Aer Lingus.

Kroes praised Ryanair for taking advantage of liberalisation in the industry to slash prices and offer choice to consumers. "Ryanair has provided consumers with more competition and more choice but, and that is crucial, it cannot now take away that choice, " she added.

O'Leary said: "This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government which was the only party, other than Aer Lingus, to object to the merger."
Ryanair's offer was tabled at .2.80 (188p). Last night Aer Lingus closed down 6 cents at .2.57 and Ryanair slipped
1 cent to .4.96.

Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said: "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers."

European Commission’s first  merger veto since 2004 crashes Ryanair bid

Brussels – The  EU regulators have blocked Ryanair Holdings’ e1.48 billion (R14.2 billion)  bid for Aer Lingus,  the first merger veto since 2004, because the takeover would allow the airline to dominate 35 routes.

The European Commission, the  EU’s antitrust regulator, said  Ryanair’s offer to sell takeoff and landing slots was inadequate.
The acquisition would have eliminated Ryanair's main competitor in Ireland, the commission said.
‘‘What we’re doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging in air transport,’’ said Neelie Kroes, the EU
competition commissioner.
“Ireland being an island, it depends heavily on air transport.”

The veto is the first since December 2004, when plans by EDP- Energias de Portugal to take joint control of Gas de Portugal were blocked.

Ryanair announced its hostile bid last October to combine the two Dublin-based carriers. It acquired a 19.2 percent stake on October 23 and offered e2.80 a share for the rest of Aer Lingus.

It then spent about e87.5 million on November 29 to boost its stake to 25.2 percent. The stake, acquired for a total of e344.9 million, was worth e406.1 million in March this year. – Bloomberg

EU grounds Ryanair's  Aer Lingusbuyout bid; 'We are ... preventing a monopoly from emerging'

BRUSSELS --  EU regulators blocked a hostile  takeover bid by low-fare carrier Ryanair for Ireland's  Aer Lingus
yesterday, saying it would limit consumer choice and likely boost ticket prices.

Together, the two Irish airlines would control more than 80 per cent of all  European flights to and from Dublin airport, the  European Commission said.

"What we are doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging," said Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner of the EU, which has blocked only one other takeover bid since 2001.
"Ireland, being an island, depends heavily on air transport."
The 1.48 billion euro, or $2.13 billion (Canadian) takeover already appeared doomed after nearly half of Aer
Lingus Group PLC shareholders vowed to block it.
Ryanair believes the EU decision is politically motivated and aims to please the Irish government. The government and Ryanair each control about a quarter of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, vowed to take regulators to court, citing earlier EU decisions to allow mergers of Air France and KLM, and Lufthansa and Swissair.

Regulators, however, say the Ryanair bid was unprecedented because both airlines have such a large share of routes at one airport, Dublin. Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete directly on 35 routes to and from Ireland, regulators said, and the combination would give the combined carrier a monopoly on 22.

"This would have reduced choice and, most likely, led to higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers using these routes to and from Ireland each year," the European Commission said.
"What is certain is that Ryanair proposed to end the intense competition between Ryanair and Aer Lingus at
Dublin airport..."

Aer Lingus shares fell to 2.55 euros yesterday. Ryanair had offered 2.80 euros per share in its hostile takeover bid.

(EU) EU/COMPETITION: Commission rejects  Ryanair's  plans to take overAer Lingus

GENERAL NEWS



Brussels, 27/06/2007 (Agence Europe) - As was to be expected, the European Commission announced on Wednesday 27 June that it was rejecting the projected merger between the Irish airline Aer Lingus and Ryanair, due to excessive concentration on routes serving the Republic of Ireland. This is only the 20th merger to be rejected by DG Competition, of over 3000 notifications which have been tabled since 1990. Even though this result did not exactly come as a surprise, the CEO of the low-cost airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has stated that he is extremely disappointed with the decision, which he described as “political”. Speaking to the press the day before, he had already expressed his intentions of appealing to the Court of First Instance.

But the Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, is confident: “today's decision is based on a solid legal basis, and will stand up to examination by the Court of First Instance in case of an appeal”, she told a Commission press conference on Wednesday. She stressed that given the preponderance of the proposed new entity on 37 routes
in Europe, and its quasi-monopoly on 22 of them, an increase in prices and drop in quality would have been the inevitable result of the merger. The decision which was taken, therefore, was the only one able to safeguard the interests of the consumer. Prior discussions between Ryanair and the Commission had broken down, particularly on the number of take-off and landing slots available for competitors in Dublin, a city with just one airport. Ms Kroes explained that the domination of a single operator would discourage newcomers to the market, even in the case of excessive price increases brought about by that operator.

In response to Mr Leary's accusations, alleging that the Commission is biased in favour of the historical and national operators, the Commissioner pointed out that Ryanair itself had played an important part in the liberalisation and re-dynamisation of the European aviation market. However, she also pointed out that although Ryanair has done much towards the liberalisation of the market, it has no right to deprive travellers of the liberty of choosing an airline on the routes serving Ireland.

It is worth noting that Ryanair owns 25% of Aer Lingus, which already allows it certain rights of veto in the management of the latter company. Speaking to the press, Ms Kroes stated that this stake was not a majority stake, and was therefore not under consideration in the light of Community law on mergers. On the other hand, in virtue of antitrust law, if the Commission launches a separate investigation, Ryanair could possibly be obliged to sell its stake, according to an article which appeared in the Wednesday edition of the daily newspaper “Irish Times”.

Ryanair chief slams decision

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary has criticised an expected  European Commission decision to stop his low-cost airline taking over Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus.

The attack came amid growing speculation that the ban will be announced by Brussels tomorrow or next week - the first time for 20 years that the commission's competition authorities will have blocked a  European airline merger.
The no-frills airline flies from Blackpool daily, serving Dublin and Girona.
Mr O'Leary, speaking in Brussels, said there was no justification for the "unprecedented'' decision. He said: "This is designed to appeal solely to the narrow vested interests of the Irish Government.''
Ryanair's £1bn offer for Aer Lingus immediately attracted a formal Commission monopolies inquiry amid concern about the development of a single dominant air carrier operating at Dublin Airport.

AVIATION
The European Commission yesterday formally blocked an attempt by low cost airline  Ryanair to acquire rival
Irish carrier Aer Lingus  - marking only the second  merger prohibition by the  EU in four years.

The Commission decided the combination would destroy competition at Dublin Airport where Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, and Aer Lingus are based. Both carriers operate out of Birmingham International Airport.

"The acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland which currently compete vigorously against each other," the European Union's top competition watchdog said in a statement.

"The Commission concluded the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties."
But EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said it could not force Ryanair to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer
Lingus. Brussels lawyers and Commission watchers had expected such a divestiture.
The stake gives Ryanair veto power over decisions by the rival.

Ryanair's offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros (£1 billion), becomes only the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed since 1990.

RYANAIR'S takeover of Ireland's national carrier  Aer Lingus  was blocked by the European Commission yesterday as a threat to consumer choice and a recipe for higher fares.

European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said an inquiry had decided that a  merger between the two leading airlines operating from Ireland would remove the existing "vigorous" competition between them and create a monopoly situation on the 35 routes they share.
The result would be reduced choice and, "most likely", higher prices for passengers.

Ryanair immediately announced a legal appeal after boss Michael O'Leary claimed Brussels was biased against his company.

Management at Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying it was good news for both the company and its customers.

City:
AIRLINES O'Leary to appeal against ruling  on Aer Lingus bid
By Russell Hotten

MICHAEL O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said he would appeal against a  European Union ruling to block his airline's euro1.48bn ( pounds 1bn) bid for rival Aer Lingus.  Yesterday, Brussels' Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said a Ryanair takeover would create a monopoly and be bad for the consumer.
Mr O'Leary said the ruling was a "nakedly political decision'' to support the Dublin government which is against an
Aer Lingus takeover and still retains a 25.3pc stake in the privatised airline.

Ms Kroes began investigating the proposed takeover in December, following Ryanair's hostile bid in October. She said yesterday the combined airline would dominate routes between London and Dublin, and said Ryanair's offer to sell take-off and landing slots was not enough.

"What we're doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging in air transport,'' Ms Kroes said. "Ireland, being an island, depends heavily on air transport.'' The decision is the first merger veto since December 2004, when she blocked plans by EDP-Energias de Portugal SA to take joint control of Gas de Portugal.

Mr O'Leary said he was confident of getting the ruling overturned, claiming that a merger would guarantee fare reductions of more than euro100m annually for consumers. Ryanair said the Commission was wrong to block its takeover when they had cleared others between Air France and KLM and between Lufthansa and Swissair.
But Ms Kroes said her decision was "legally sound'' and will "bear the scrutiny'' of the courts.
Ryanair offered to sell up to two-thirds of Aer Lingus's slots at Heathrow, and offered the disposal of slots at other
European airports, still leaving the airline with about 80pc of the market at Dublin's airport.
"The slots were not enough,'' Ms Kroes said. Document DT00000020070628e36s0000t

MERGERS : COMMISSION VETOES RYANAIR'S BID FOR AER LINGUS
512 words

For just the second time in her tenure as Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes has blocked a  merger and she picked a high profile one. But, after an extensive investigation and lengthy consideration of the remedies offered, prohibition was "the only option which would safeguard consumers," said the commissioner.

Ryanair is Europe's biggest low-fare airline, transporting 40 million customers annually. Having cashed in very cleverly on the liberalisation of airline markets, it has built a lucrative business offering low fares on some 400 routes across Europe. Specifically, for this case, it operates 35 routes in and out of Dublin Airport. Its €1.48 billion bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus  came in October 2006. The former Irish national airline,  Aer Lingus,  operates solely out of Ireland, running routes to and from Dublin, Shannon and Cork.

Therefore, the central point distinguishing this merger from others in the airline sector is that the two companies operate from the same airport where they constitute the sole significant competition for each other. A combined RyanAir- Aer Lingus would hold 80% of the market coming in and out of Dublin. Other players, such as BA, Air France and BMI, are present but with market shares of just 5%. In addition, on the 35 routes where the two firms currently compete directly, the merger would wipe out competition completely.

As Commissioner Kroes said, "this would have been unacceptable for the 14 million passengers currently flying to and from Ireland". She continued, "This takeover would have led to dramatically reduced choice for consumers and, as a result, the likelihood of lower quality and higher fares".

The aftermath of the decision is likely to be combative. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has already announced his decision to appeal and has been vitriolic in his condemnation of the European Commission's decision, which he sees as being politically motivated. "It's all to do with looking after the narrow vested interests
of the Irish government," he has said. Ryanair, argues O'Leary, holds only 5% of the EU market and had offered a commitment which would cut €100 million per year off fares. Kroes batted away such criticism, pointing out that it was not the overall share of the market that was the issue but the virtual monopoly which the merger would have given the two firms at Dublin. The fare cuts, she further explained, would have applied to Aer Lingus fares only
(not Ryanair) and would have lasted only a year. They would have been impossible to monitor and offered no lasting guarantees.

A further key point for the Commission was that none of the remedies offered by Ryanair addressed the problem that a combined Ryanair- Aer Lingus would effectively close the market to new entrants. This is not merely because of their respective established brand names and their capacity to selectively reduce prices short term to see off any newcomers, but also because "Ryanair has a reputation of aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors".

EU regulators blocked a hostile €1.48-billion ($1.99-billion U.S.)  takeover bid by low-fare carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC for  Aer Lingus  PLC yesterday, saying it would limit consumer choice and likely boost ticket prices. Together, the two Irish airlines would control more than 80 per cent of all European flights to and from Dublin airport, the European Commission said. It is only the second time the EU has blocked a takeover bid since
2001. Ryanair vowed to take regulators to court, citing earlier  EU decisions to allow the combination of Air France and KLM and of Lufthansa and Swissair. RYA (Dublin) fell 3 euro cents to €4.97, while AERL (Dublin) fell 7 euro cents to €2.55.

Dublin showdown in the air

EC shoots down €1.5bn  takeover bid as Mannion says Ryanair will have 'no control'

AER Lingus  says it is ready for a summer of aggressive competition with  Ryanair, now that the  European
Commission has finally ended the low cost carrier's hostile  takeover bid for its rival.

The national carrier's chief executive Dermot Mannion said he was unconcerned by Ryanair's plans to continue to hold 25pc of Aer Lingus stock, since that shareholdering would give them "no control".

When Ryanair first announced its plans to take over its Irish rival, low cost carrier boss Michael O'Leary warned there would be "blood on the tarmac" at Dublin Airport if the bid didn't succeed.

But last night Mr Mannion was quick to hit back at the notion that his airline was setting itself up for slaughter at the hands of Mr O'Leary.
"Michael would say that," he said. "But the reality is Aer Lingus respects Ryanair and Ryanair respects Aer
Lingus.
"That's what the EC saw and that's what will keep happening. The reality is no one competes with Ryanair like
Aer Lingus does."

The EC said a merger would create a monopoly at Dublin Airport ultimately push up prices for the travelling public.

¨Any monopoly, even if it has low fares and low choice, is bad for consumers - prices are higher and quality is lower when there is no competition," said Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes.

"Today‘s decision is legally sound and will withstand scrutiny by the Court of First Instance should it be appealed," she told reporters in Brussels. "Airline consolidation has to be achieved in a way that benefits the consumers, it cannot be achieved at their expense," she said.
Mr O'Leary angrily dismissed her claims on higher fares as "horseshit".

The EC decision noted that new carriers would be reluctant to come into Dublin Airport because Ryanair has a history of extremely aggressive competition, having already driven easyJet and Go from Irish soil.

Mr O'Leary has also made repeated references to his billion euro plus 'war chest' which allows him to wipe out any competitive threat he chooses to attack.
However, Mr Mannion said he wasn't concerned about the prospect of Ryanair using its war chest to batter Aer
Lingus with loss making services from Dublin.
"Michael O'Leary is accountable to shareholders just like I am, so it wouldn't make sense for him to do that," Mr
Mannion said.

Ryanair has signalled its intention to hang on to its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus; Mr Mannion said this would have no impact on Aer Lingus' operations.
"As the chief executive I can tell you there is nothing material on the horizon at present that could be blocked by
Ryanair," he said.

On the prospect of pushing the Irish Competition Authority to force Ryanair to sell down its Aer Lingus stock, Mr Mannion said: "We're all in new territory here, and the company has to be very Catholic in its views on who is on the share register.
"But talking to investors, we're hearing that they'd like more liquidity in the stock."

Some sources said Aer Lingus' fragile cost cutting plans could be damaged by the removal of the Ryanair bid. The national carrier has spent more than a year negotiating wide ranging cost cuts with unions.
When Ryanair launched its bid, the underlying current became 'we can do it the Aer Lingus' way now or Michael
O'Leary's way in a few months time', sources said, an argument that is now rendered defunct.

However, Mr Mannion said the takeover developments wouldn't wreck the momentum of the cost cutting plans. "By now the staff know as well as I do that things have to change," he said.
"We need to get efficiencies and that's not going to go away just because Ryanair has gone away."

EC: Ryanair and Aer Lingus  compete on 35 routes from Ireland. A  merged airline would have created a monopoly on 22 of these routes.

Ryanair: Ryanair and Aer Lingus  don't fly to the same airports on many of these routes so they're not competing directly on the 35 routes.

EC: Ryanair and Aer Lingus control 80pc of the intra European traffic coming out of Dublin Airport. A merged airline would create an unacceptable monopoly.
Ryanair: The EC should have looked at the merger on a Europe-wide basis

EC: There are barriers to entry at Dublin Airport, so a Ryanair/Aer Lingus merger would be unlikely to face competion from new airlines.

Ryanair: There are no barriers to entry at Dublin, evidenced by the fact that Ryanair has doubled its planes based at Dublin (to 20) in the last 18 months.

EC: A Ryanair/Aer Lingus would not have guaranteed long term lower fares. Ryanair said Aer Lingus' fares would be 10pc lower in the first year, but no guarantees were offered beyond that.
Ryanair: Ryanair would have been happy to give guidance beyond the first year, but the EC never asked for it. EC: The decision was taken to ensure the best interest European and Irish passengers. Based on the information
available to the commission "there was no other choice".
Ryanair: The decision was politically motivated, driven by inaccurate information.

Air wars on way as takeover vetoed

AER Lingus  is ready for a summer of vigorous competition against  Ryanair after the  European Commission vetoed the low fare carrier's €1.5bn  takeover bid.

The Commission yesterday ruled against the proposed  takeover on the grounds that it would be bad for competition and result in higher prices for Irish travellers.

Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary admitted his company's bid was "dead" but warned that Aer Lingus was in for "very difficult times" with Ryanair as a foe and not an ally. He said Ryanair would continue to aggressively expand out
of Dublin.

But Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion hit back, saying his airline was fully prepared to go head to head with Ryanair this summer. "No-one competes with Ryanair like we do," he said.
The Commission said it would not push Ryanair to sell its 25pc stake in the national carrier. Mr O'Leary said he would hang onto the stake indefinitely.
The Consumers' Association praised the EC's decision as a victory for the flying public. FULL REPORT: BUSINESS

O’Leary flies off the handle – again

BUSINESS | OUTLOOK

So what’s old motor-mouth ranting on about this time? Oh dear, Neelie Kroes, the  EU Competition Commissioner, seems to have blocked  Ryanair from buying  its Irish rival  Aer Lingus.

This is about the most unsurprising decision the EU has ever taken – combined, the two carriers would have dominated flights in and out of Dublin with more than 80 per cent of passenger traffic – yet it has again had Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, foaming at the mouth with righteous indignation.

It’s all a political fix, he screams. What an outrage. The only people to oppose Ryanair’s ambitions were Aer Lingus itself, he fumed. In fact, it was the other way around. The only person who actually supported Ryan-air’s attempt to take over its main competitor was its own chief executive.

Mr O’Leary is on firmer ground when he points out other potentially anti-competitive airline mergers within Europe have been approved. Indeed, his is only the second takeover to be blocked by Ms Kroes and the first such airline merger. Yet it is hard to argue she had no cause and even harder to see how the threatened appeal could succeed.

It is completely irrelevant that Ryanair and Aer Lingus combined would have only 5 per cent of the total European air travel market; its grip on Ireland would be all-embracing. Mr O’Leary’s case was perhaps always a hopeless one, yet he scarcely helped his chances by keeping up a more or less constant barrage of insults against the officials examining it.

This sort of rhetoric might be helpful when directed against rivals and airport operators in the battle for passengers, but it is most unwise when dealing with regulators. Who was yesterday’s tirade directed at? Consumers couldn’t give a stuff about Mr O’Leary’s empire -building. Their only concern is about being flown from here to there at the cheapest possible price, an aspiration unlikely to be furthered by the reduction in competition proposed.
Mr O’Leary once said there would come a time when Ryanair would get too big for a “gobshite” like himself. The
Aer Lingus tilt seems to have proved him right.

Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus  blocked  by EU but O’Leary plans to appeal

Ryanair’s controversial £1bn  bid for its rival  Aer Lingus  was blocked yesterday by  EU watchdogs, who claimed it would reduce competition and force up fares.

The EU commissioner Neelie Kroes said the two airlines would control more than 80 per cent of European flights to and from Dublin airport, with a monopoly on 22 routes and a 60 per cent plus market share on 13 others. Other airlines would be unlikely to consider competing against such a dominant carrier, especially in view of Ryanair’s record of aggressive retaliation against competitors.

“Any monopoly, even if advertised as low cost and low fare, is bad for consumers. The reality is that prices are higher and quality is lower when there is no competition,” said Ms Kroes. The Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary, who had lambasted the EU on Tuesday, immediately announced an appeal.

But Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said: “Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers.”

Mr O’Leary dismissed the objections, claiming Aer Lingus passengers will continue to “suffer high prices, unnecessary fuel surcharges, poor punctuality, and repeated strikes”.

He is confident of winning his appeal to the European Court of First Instance. “This is the first time the Commission has prohibited a merger between two companies which combined will have less than 5 per cent of the EU market,” Mr O’Leary said.

“This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral, loss-making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from Dublin at a time when the rest of the European industry is consolidating.”

Ryanair built up a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid last December. A similar stake is held by the Irish government.

Mr O’Leary claims Aer Lingus has wasted shareholders’ money by opposing a bid worth €2.80 (£1.87) a share when the current price has fallen back to below €2.60.

European Regulator  Blocks  Ryanair Bid for Aer Lingus

BRUSSELS, June 27 -- A  bid by the low-cost airline  Ryanair to buyAer Lingus,  Ireland's national carrier, was blocked Wednesday as the top  European regulator showed a willingness to intervene despite the overturning of past merger prohibitions in court.

The European Commission's rejection of the  deal prompted a robust reaction and the promise of a legal challenge from Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary, who accused Brussels of bowing to political pressure from the Irish government, which had opposed the  deal.

In barring what would have been the first takeover of a national flag carrier by a low-cost rival, the European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, invoked her power to prohibit mergers for only the second time since taking office in 2004. The commission said the combination of the two Dublin-based airlines would have created a near-monopoly in the Irish market.

Competition lawyers argued that the commission was on relatively safe ground, having revised its procedures after a series of reverses in Europe's second-highest court, the Court of First Instance, in 2002.

''This is pretty much an open-and-shut case,'' said Catriona Hatton, a partner in the Brussels office of the law firm Hogan & Hartson. ''The only question was whether the remedies offered by Ryanair could have been sufficient to bring in a significant new competitor on the routes.''

In a rare departure, the executive body even commissioned an independent consultant to carry out a customer survey at the Dublin airport to track travelers' opinions.

Since taking office, Ms. Kroes has used her powers sparingly, though she did bar the merger of two Portuguese electricity and natural gas companies in 2004. Several other deals have been allowed to go ahead only under strict conditions.

But some merger plans have been called off when the parties involved decided that the deals risked being turned down by the commission.

To try to win approval for its bid of 1.48 billion euros ($1.99 billion), Ryanair had offered to lower the short-haul fares of Aer Lingus by 10 percent for one year and to sell airport slots for a new rival operating as many as six aircraft.

But the commission said a merger would have created a monopoly on 22 out of 35 routes in or out of Ireland. It argued that the number of slots Ryanair offered to give up would not have permitted a competitor to emerge, and that the price cut would be limited in duration and difficult to enforce.

Even without the commission's intervention, Ryanair would have struggled to complete the takeover. The airline has managed to amass only a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus since it proposed the merger.

Ryanair promised to appeal to the Court of First Instance, saying in a statement that consumers would suffer from the rejection of the deal.

Aer Lingus, which was privatized in September, just days before Ryanair's hostile bid, welcomed the commission's decision.

''Air Lingus has said all along that the best way to serve the interests of consumers and our shareholders is for us to remain as an independent company,'' Dermot Mannion, the chief executive of Aer Lingus, said by telephone from Dublin.

Some had expected the commission to try to force Ryanair to sell its 25 percent stake in its rival, but Ms. Kroes said the regulator was ''not in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share.'' She also said that she was open to considering a revised offer from Ryanair, arguing that hers was not ''a never-ever decision.''

Mr. Mannion said he did not expect Ryanair's stake to represent a significant impediment to managing the company. ''There are almost no circumstances that I can conceive'' that would require Aer Lingus management to obtain approval from 75 percent or more of the voting shares, he said.

UPDATE 1-EU Commission blocks Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus  (Adds Kroes,  Ryanair stake, Aer Lingus
reaction, share prices)
By David Lawsky and Sabina Zawadzki

Brussels, June 27 Reuters - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked an attempt by Ryanair to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, marking only the second merger prohibition by the EU executive in four years.

The Commission, confirming a Reuters report from May 30, decided the combination would destroy competition at Dublin Airport where Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, and Aer Lingus are based. ``The acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland which currently compete vigorously against each other,'' the European Union's top competition watchdog said in a statement. ``The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties.''
But EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the EU's top antitrust body could not force Ryanair to sell its
25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Brussels lawyers and Commission watchers had expected such a divestiture.
``Since Ryanair is not in a position to exercise de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus ... the Commission is not
in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share,'' she told reporters.
The stake gives Ryanair veto power over some decisions by the rival carrier.

Ryanair shares in Dublin were unchanged on the day at 5.00 euros but outperforming a 1.8 percent fall in the broader Irish market. Aer Lingus was down 0.76 percent at 2.6 euros.

Ryanair's offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), becomes only the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union executive since 1990.

Kroes praised Ryanair for taking advantage of liberalisation in the airline industry to slash prices and give choice to consumers. ``Ryanair has provided consumers with more competition and more choice, but, and that is crucial, Ryanair cannot now take away that choice,'' she said.
COURT CASE
In some ways, Aer Lingus owes its own success to Ryanair.

Ryanair's cut-rate prices and expanding choice of destinations have forced Aer Lingus to transform from a staid, high-priced Irish flag carrier into a tough no-frills competitor ready to match its rival ticket for ticket and route for route.
Aer Lingus, privatised only last year, welcomed the Commission's decision against the hostile bid.
Ryanair, expecting the EU executive to block the deal, had lashed out against the Commission on Tuesday.
``This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government, which
was the only party
-- other than Aer Lingus itself -- to object to the merger,'' Ryanair Chief Exxecutive Michael O'Leary said.
He reiterated Ryanair would appeal against the decision at the EU's second highest court, the Court of First
Instance. Kroes said on Wednesday she was confident the decision was legally sound.

Page 101 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In a confidential charge sheet earlier this year, the Commission had laid out a tough case against the merger.

The robustness of the charge sheet will be important once the decision is appealed to the court, which in past cases has scrutinised the fairness of such claims.

The charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said that in the past six years the number of routes on which the carriers competed had jumped to 37 from eight, driving prices down by 5 to 8 percent.

Ryanair offered proposals it said could assure competition despite a merger, but they were never enough to satisfy the Commission. For example, the carrier offered to make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin Airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in Brussels and Paul Hoskins in Dublin)

UPDATE 1-EU Commission blocks Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus  (Adds Kroes,  Ryanair stake, Aer Lingus
reaction, share prices)
By David Lawsky and Sabina Zawadzki

Brussels, June 27 Reuters - The European Commission on Wednesday blocked an attempt by Ryanair to acquire rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus, marking only the second merger prohibition by the EU executive in four years.

The Commission, confirming a Reuters report from May 30, decided the combination would destroy competition at Dublin Airport where Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, and Aer Lingus are based. ``The acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from Ireland which currently compete vigorously against each other,'' the European Union's top competition watchdog said in a statement. ``The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties.''
But EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the EU's top antitrust body could not force Ryanair to sell its
25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Brussels lawyers and Commission watchers had expected such a divestiture.
``Since Ryanair is not in a position to exercise de jure or de facto control of Aer Lingus ... the Commission is not
in a position to require Ryanair to divest its minority share,'' she told reporters.
The stake gives Ryanair veto power over some decisions by the rival carrier.

Ryanair shares in Dublin were unchanged on the day at 5.00 euros but outperforming a 1.8 percent fall in the broader Irish market. Aer Lingus was down 0.76 percent at 2.6 euros.

Ryanair's offer, originally valued at 1.48 billion euros ($2 billion), becomes only the 20th prohibition among more than 3,000 cases reviewed by the European Union executive since 1990.

Kroes praised Ryanair for taking advantage of liberalisation in the airline industry to slash prices and give choice to consumers. ``Ryanair has provided consumers with more competition and more choice, but, and that is crucial, Ryanair cannot now take away that choice,'' she said.
COURT CASE
In some ways, Aer Lingus owes its own success to Ryanair.

Ryanair's cut-rate prices and expanding choice of destinations have forced Aer Lingus to transform from a staid, high-priced Irish flag carrier into a tough no-frills competitor ready to match its rival ticket for ticket and route for route.
Aer Lingus, privatised only last year, welcomed the Commission's decision against the hostile bid.
Ryanair, expecting the EU executive to block the deal, had lashed out against the Commission on Tuesday.
``This decision is politically motivated, designed to appease the narrow interests of the Irish government, which
was the only party
-- other than Aer Lingus itself -- to object to the merger,'' Ryanair Chief Exxecutive Michael O'Leary said.
He reiterated Ryanair would appeal against the decision at the EU's second highest court, the Court of First
Instance. Kroes said on Wednesday she was confident the decision was legally sound.

In a confidential charge sheet earlier this year, the Commission had laid out a tough case against the merger.

The robustness of the charge sheet will be important once the decision is appealed to the court, which in past cases has scrutinised the fairness of such claims.

The charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said that in the past six years the number of routes on which the carriers competed had jumped to 37 from eight, driving prices down by 5 to 8 percent.

Ryanair offered proposals it said could assure competition despite a merger, but they were never enough to satisfy the Commission. For example, the carrier offered to make space for a new rival to base as many as six planes at Dublin Airport.

Ryanair also offered to sell Aer Lingus' slots at London's Heathrow and Dublin for flights between the two airports. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in Brussels and Paul Hoskins in Dublin)

EU vetoes Ryanair's  bid for Aer Lingus; Merger would create monopoly, regulator rules

BRUSSELS

BRUSSELS - European Union regulators blocked Ryanair Holdings Plc's $2-billion U.S.  bid for Aer Lingus  Plc, the first merger veto since 2004, because the takeover would allow the airline to dominate 35 routes.

The European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, said Ryanair's offer to sell takeoff and landing slots was inadequate. The acquisition would have eliminated Ryanair's main competitor in Ireland, the commission said yesterday.
"What we're doing is preventing a monopoly from emerging in air transport," EU competition commissioner Neelie
Kroes said at a briefing in Brussels. "Ireland being an island, it depends heavily on air transport."

Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said he will appeal the "unprecedented" ruling to the European Court of First Instance. The veto is the first since December 2004, when Ms. Kroes blocked plans by EDP- Energias de Portugal SA to take joint control of Gas de Portugal.

Ryanair said it is confident the veto will be overturned because a merger would guarantee fare reductions of more than $130 million U.S. annually for consumers, the company said yesterday in a statement.
In October, the carrier, Europe's largest discount airline, announced its hostile bid to combine the two
Dublin-based carriers. The EU regulator started a probe in December into concerns the merger would restrict
competition on Dublin-London flights.
"It's a situation where the most efficient operators are penalized for having the highest market share," said
Stephen Furlong, an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin who has the stock on his "focus list."

The Irish government is the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus, with a 25.3-per-cent stake, and opposes a Ryanair takeover because it says a buyout would lead to a monopoly on air travel.
Mr. O'Leary said Tuesday the veto will be a "nakedly political decision" to favour Irish government interests over
European consumers'.
Yesterday's decision is "legally sound" and will "bear the scrutiny" of the courts, Ms. Kroes said.

Appeals at the European courts can last several years. An initial ruling by the European Court of First Instance can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court.
The decision is good news for Aer Lingus and travellers, the carrier said in a statement.

"Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," chairman John Sharman said in the statement.

Shares of Ryanair fell more than four cents, or 0.6 per cent, to about $6.69 in Dublin. Aer Lingus shares fell nine cents, or 2.7 per cent, to about $3.43.



Page 109 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
To address the EU's antitrust concerns, Ryanair offered to sell as many as two-thirds of Aer Lingus' slots at Heathrow and provide space for new entrants at the London airport, Europe's busiest. It also offered slots at London's Stansted Airport and airports serving Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Rome, Barcelona and Bratislava, Slovakia. The commission rejected the offers.

"The slots were not enough," Ms. Kroes said. The airline would have about 80 per cent of the market at Dublin's airport.
"That is such a dominant position that a newcomer is not interested in joining that play," she said.

Reducing consumer choice would most likely have led to higher prices for more than 14 million EU passengers, the regulator said.

The commission has approved previous mergers in the airline industry. In February 2004, the regulator approved Air France SA's purchase of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV after the carriers gave up slots and the French and Dutch governments agreed to give access to other airlines on trans-Atlantic routes.

The commission said the Ryanair case was the first time the regulator reviewed a proposed merger of two primary airlines operating from the same airport in one country.

Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus  blocked  by EU but O'Leary plans to appeal

The EU commissioner Neelie Kroes said the two airlines would control more
than 80 per cent of  European flights to and from Dublin airport, with a monopoly on 22 routes and a 60 per cent plus market share on 13 others. Other airlines would be unlikely to consider competing against such a dominant carrier, especially in view of Ryanair's record of aggressive retaliation against competitors.Any monopoly, even if
advertised as low cost and low fare, is bad for consumers. The reality is that prices are higher and quality is lower when there is no competition, said Ms Kroes.The Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who had lambasted the EU on Tuesday, immediately announced an appeal.But Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said: Consumer choice is at the core of every
competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers.Mr O'Leary dismissed the objections, claiming Aer
Lingus passengers will continue to suffer high prices, unnecessary fuel surcharges, poor punctuality, and repeated strikes.He
is confident of winning his appeal to the European Court of First Instance. This is the first time the Commission has prohibited a merger between two companies which combined will have less than 5 per cent of the EU market, Mr O'Leary said.This prohibition leaves Aer Lingus exposed as
a small, peripheral, loss-making regional airline which cannot compete with Ryanair on price or punctuality from Dublin at a time when the rest of the European industry is consolidating.Ryanair built up a 25 per
cent stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid last December. A similar stake is held by the Irish government.Mr O'Leary claims Aer Lingus
has wasted shareholders' money by opposing a bid worth €2.80 (1.87) a share

Leading the News: Ryanair- Aer Lingusdeal blocked  --- EU regulators cite antitrust concerns; appeal is planned

BRUSSELS -- European Union regulators yesterday blocked low-cost airline  Ryanair Holdings PLC from  buying its Irish peer Aer Lingus  Group PLC, saying that such a  merger would have led to a quasi-monopoly in the Irish market.

By combining the two leading airlines operating from Ireland, "the  merger would have harmed consumers by removing this competition and creating a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties," the European Commission, the  EU's executive arm, said in a statement.

The deal would also have given the combined company an 80% share of all flights to and from Dublin airport, effectively making new entries to the market very difficult, the commission said.

The 1.48 billion euro ($1.99 billion) deal was effectively dead anyway, because Ryanair had failed to garner enough backing among Aer Lingus shareholders, but the EU's decision means Ryanair is unlikely to make a fresh offer for the Irish national carrier in the future.
Ryanair said it will appeal the decision, saying it is unlawful and that it is confident that the European Court of
First Instance will overturn it.

The decision to block Ryanair's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus "is legally sound and will bear the scrutiny of the Court of First Instance, should it be appealed," Antitrust Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement.
Aer Lingus Chairman John Sharman welcomed the decision, saying it was good news for competition. "Consumer choice is at the core of every competitive market and the creation of one dominant player out of
Ireland, despite the protestations of Ryanair, just cannot be in the interests of consumers," he said.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the commission's decision to block the takeover was politically motivated, with the Irish government being the only other opponent of the deal, in addition to Aer Lingus. He accused the commission of disregarding some of the evidence and remedies Ryanair had offered to support their bid "solely to appeal to the narrow interests of the Irish government."

Ms. Kroes said the decision to block the merger "was essential to safeguard Irish consumers, who depend heavily on air transport."

STORY OF THE WEEK : New flightpath on the compass  as bid is parked on apron stand
1,019 words
30 June 2007
Irish Independent
IINM
English

TALK about an anti-climax. After more than six months of corporate high-jinks,  Ryanair's €1.5bn  bid for Aer       Lingus  was stamped out with a little more than whisper earlier this week.

With the  European Commission's decision offering mere confirmation of what most of us already knew, the share prices of both airlines met the announcement with total indifference.
Riveting stuff, it certainly wasn't.

But, as the dust settles this weekend, the focus is shifting to the Irish airline industry that will emerge from the debris, and share prices may be jerked into action yet.

Both airlines surface from the rubble several million euro the poorer, thanks to the amounts shelled out on advisers and the like (with Aer Lingus understood to have racked up far bigger bills).

Hardly the end of the world, with both companies having resources that dwarf the size of their bid costs, but Ryanair shareholders may be asking themselves why their chief executive spent millions of their euro on a bid that looked very unlikely to make it out of the stalls.
Then there's the more fundamental stuff. Ryanair now holds, and will continue to hold, a 25pc in Aer Lingus. This spells trouble for Aer Lingus - not because Ryanair can have some control over the airline (it can't), but
because Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus leaves precious little of the national carrier's stock for investors to get their
teeth into.

Less than 30pc of Aer Lingus is now in 'free float', automatically disqualifying the airline from the portfolios of several investment houses - share price growth is essentially a function of supply and demand, the Ryanair stake serves to curb that demand.

And for Ryanair, the company's chief executive has now effectively backed them into a corner which sees them tying up €300m odd of shareholders funds indefinitely, money that could arguably be better spent elsewhere.

Then there's the competitive environment out of Ireland. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary promised blood on the tarmac at Dublin Airport should the bid fail.

If a competitive response of that scale were to be unleashed, Aer Lingus's share price would be hard pressed to remain indifferent.
And so the share price stage is set.
"What happens next is indeed an interesting question," says Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst with London's
ABN Amro. "I'm not sure what Michael O'Leary's game is, or what shareholders want."

The bid's failure is set to have far more impact on share prices at Aer Lingus than those at Ryanair. For Ryanair, the takeover was essentially a 'side show', analysts say; for Aer Lingus, it took centre stage.
"Investors in Ryanair care about Ryanair, not Ryanair/Aer Lingus," says Stephen Furlong, an analyst with Davy in
Dublin, who has a price target of €6 on the low cost carrier.

Or as John Sheehan, analyst with Dublin stockbroker NCB, puts it: "The share price is affected not by Aer Lingus, but by reports on traffic (due next week) and interim results and comments on yields."

Page 116 of 135 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
That's not to say that Ryanair's investors will be completely unmoved by the debacle that became the Aer Lingus bid.

One of the most striking aspects of the whole process has been O'Leary's professed lack of regard for his shareholders' reaction to the takeover.

Last week he said he'd be hanging on to the €300m stake in Aer Lingus come hell or high water - "It [selling it] has come up with shareholders, I answered with two words and the second one was off," as he so delicately put it.

Faced with a chief executive that borders on the distinctly maverick, some shareholders may want to consider their options, though any exodus is likely to be very limited.
"When you're dealing with companies, you have to take the rough with the smooth," says Furlong. Aer Lingus' stock, on the other hand, will be far more responsive to the bid's demise.
Priced at €2.66 at close of business on Friday, the airline since its float has soared as high as €3.27 and as low as €2.20.

Most of the movements, however, had absolutely nothing to do with the core business of the airline, as the takeover battle monopolised investors' interest almost to the complete exclusion of bread and butter issues like yields, costs and expansion. No more.

"People are going to look at Aer Lingus differently now, and it's really going to be on the company to prove that the can bring through changes and cost savings," says Sheehan.

Aer Lingus is striving to implement wide-sweeping cost cuts by August 1; the market will be watching closely to see if this deadline is met.
If it's not, the reaction is likely to be both swift and brutal.
Ryanair's plans to stay on as a long term shareholder also herald significant problems for Aer Lingus.

Less than 30pc of the stake is now in free float, thanks to the Ryanair share coupled with the Government's 25pc, the employees 15pc, Denis O'Brien's 3pc and the stakes held by the pilots and pilots' pension fund.
"There are investors that simply won't come in because there's such a small free float," says Sheehan. "But a small free float works both ways - if something is illiquid, it doesn't take much to force it up." Nonetheless, the liquidity issues mean a substantial section of the investment community has now ruled out
investing in Aer Lingus, in what could hardly be seen as a positive sign for the airline.

Yet despite the uncertain outlook for Aer Lingus, stock brokers Davy will publish a report tomorrow setting the share a 12-month target price of €3.40, some 60c over the Ryanair bid.
"I think the stock is mispriced, it's one of the cheapest stocks in the airline industry and it shouldn't be," says
Furlong.

Legal news
EC vetoes Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus
243 words
1 July 2007
Airfinance Journal
EURMAF
English
(c) 2007. Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC.
The European Commission (EC) has effectively vetoed  Ryanair Holdings' $2 billion bid for Aer Lingus  because of competition concerns. The decision represents the first time the  EC has vetoed any merger or acquisition since the 2004 decision to stop a proposed EDP- Energias de Portugalbid for Gas de Portugal.

The EC decision cited concerns that the  acquisition would have eliminated  Ryanair's primary competitor and created a monopoly, allowing it to dominate 35 routes. Moreover,  Ryanair's offer to sell certain slots was deemed inadequate to alleviate competition concerns.

Ryanair has announced that it will appeal the ruling to the European Court of First Instance. The carrier called the decision "nakedly political". The Irish government, which has opposed the Ryanair takeover, is, with 25.3%, the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus.

Ryanair announced its hostile bid for Aer Lingus last October, and acquired a 25.2% shareholding by the end of November. The EC began its probe in December into initial concerns that the deal would restrict competition on Dublin-London flights.

Under EU merger rules, the EC cannot force Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus because it is not a controlling interest. Aer Lingus could, however, ask competition authorities in Ireland, the UK or Germany to force Ryanair to divest; it could also file a complaint to the EC under EU rules that prohibit restrictive business practices.

Business - Ryanair accuses Aer Lingus  of leaks

Ryanair accused Aer Lingus  of publishing confidential information about its failed  bid for the former state-owned carrier as part of its complaint to European Ombudsman about media leaks during the  European Commission's investigation into the proposed merger.

The news comes as sources close to the commission indicated that it believed either the airline or the department of transport were behind the long-running series of leaks, which seemed designed to undermine  Ryanair's bid.

"There are parties involved in this case who may have had a strong interest to leak and, if I was a gambler, I'd be betting on the department and Aer Lingus," said a source.

Meanwhile, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary confirmed that it had complained that Aer Lingus revealed details of concessions it made to the Commission in its takeover defence document published last December.

"They were meant to have the documentation under the process but they were legally banned from publishing it but they included it in one of their defence documents," he said.

It is understood Ryanair's complaint claims that Aer Lingus published the material despite signing a confidentiality agreement with the Commission 24 hours previously.

It also claims that Aer Lingus was behind press reports quoting "a source close to the deal" who stated that its concessions were "meaningless in some cases, undeliverable in others or irrelevant".

It is understood that the complaint states that these comments came at a sensitive point in Ryanair's bid and were damaging to the low-cost airline.

Ryanair also says that the commission failed to take any action against Aer Lingus despite repeated complaints. It subsequently requested that no further confidential information be sent to Aer Lingus but its request was ignored.

The airline also claims that the commission itself was also responsible for other leaks, including the disclosure of its statement of objections to bid to news agency Bloomberg in March.

Todd said the commission conducted a thorough internal investigation into the leaks and had concluded that they came from outside the commission. He refused to comment on where the commission believed the leaks had come from. Meanwhile, an Aer Lingus spokesman denied that it had leaked any confidential documentation. "The information contained in the Aer Lingus circular published on 1 December was not drawn from any confidential documentation but referred to information that was already available from other sources," he said.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Transport also said that it was not responsible for any of the leaks referred to in Ryanair's complaint.

While the EU Ombudsman lacks any binding legal powers, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan said that the airline had lodged the complaint to highlight its belief that the Commission and Aer Lingus had been leaking sensitive information to the press during the competition investigation.

"In a sense, these incessant leaks seriously undermined the whole process and highly confidential information supplied by Ryanair to the Commission was leaked to the market. It's unbelievable," he said.

However, the Commission's competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said that the Commission had been powerless to stop the leaks.

"We don't have any sanctions we can apply. That's the problem. Normally, the lawyers who deal with these things are bound by codes of conduct and rules governing confidentiality," he said.

Todd said that the Commission had conducted a thorough internal investigation into the leaks and had come to the conclusion that they came from outside the Commission.

Ryanair bid over, but cost battle goes on: Mannion
604 words
1 July 2007
Sunday Business Post
SBPM
English
Copyright (c) 2007 Sunday Business Post; Source: World Reporter (TM)
For Aer Lingus  chief executive Dermot Mannion, last week’s  European Commission decision means it’s now time to come good on the strategy he outlined when urging shareholders to reject the  Ryanair bid last year.

Mannion and his board told shareholders that remaining independent was the best way to deliver a return on their investment.
But with Aer Lingus shares trading at &euro;2.50 at one point last week -11 per cent below the &euro;2.80
Ryanair offer - Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary was quick to accuse his takeover target of ‘‘destroying
shareholder value’’.

Mannion rejected this last week, however. ‘‘Of course we’d prefer if the share price was higher than it is now’’, he said. ‘‘My ambition is to put us back on a path where the share price will move upwards. To some extent, all airlines are in the same boat and we’re working as hard as we can to improve our share price’’.

He said the former state airline was making steady progress on implementing changes that were needed and that this would proceed even in the absence of the threat of an imminent Ryanair takeover.

‘‘Staff understand that, even if the takeover bid is over, the cost battle goes on. No one would deny the need for ongoing improvement and efficiency’’.

Mannion also dismissed O’Leary’s criticism that the airline’s recent hefty investment in new Airbus aircraft came at the wrong time for buyers, because it coincided with a peak in the industry cycle.

‘‘I’ve been involved in lengthy discussions with both Airbus and Boeing, and the deal we struck is as good a deal as anything I’ve seen’’, said Mannion, a former senior executive with the Dubai-based Emirates Airlines.

‘‘We’ve done absolutely the right thing and we’ve got the right aircraft at the right price. In any discussion on long-haul where Ryanair and Aer Lingus are involved, there’s only one entity that knows what’s involved in long-haul activity, and that’s Aer Lingus’’.
Mannion rejected O’Leary’s description of Aer Lingus as ‘‘struggling’’ and ‘‘third-tier’’.
‘‘You’d have to question that. If he really believed it, why would he waste his time trying to take us over? Aer
Lingus has a healthy respect for Ryanair as a competitor, but it’s mutual, I can assure you’’.
He also displayed signs of conciliation towards his airline’s second largest shareholder. ‘‘As a plc, by definition,
it’s a free market and people are free to buy and hold shares in the company. We’re committed to providing value
for all our shareholders and we’ll get on with the job."

He said Aer Lingus management had met with Ryanair representatives on its recent roadshow for the airline’s institutional investors, and that this would continue. ‘‘What we’re trying to achieve is to cut through all the rhetoric and have a decent working relationship with Ryanair, as with any of our investors’’.

But Ryanair’s shareholding also means extra difficulties for Mannion in his attempts to sell Aer Lingus as a suitable investment for major institutions.
The large blocs held by Ryanair, the government, the employee trust and other strategic investors mean that only
35 per cent of Aer Lingus shares are considered to be available for trading, a factor that hurts the stock’s liquidity
and makes it less attractive to buyers.

‘‘Investors are saying that they’d like to see more liquidity in the shares," said Mannion.

Davy forecasts Aer Lingus  growth.
Arthur Beesley Senior Business Correspondent

Irish Times
IRTI
English
(c) 2007, The Irish Times.
Aer Lingus  could have been a stronger global airline as a subsidiary of  Ryanair if the low-cost carrier's  takeover
of former State firm had gone ahead,  Ryanair stockbroker Davy argues in a new report.

While such an argument is immaterial given the  EU ruling against such a  deal, analyst Stephen Furlong placed a price target of €3.40 on  Aer Lingus  shares over Friday's closing price of €2.66. Mr Furlong said  Aer Lingus  was likely at its annual meeting this week to confirm that its business plan was on track. The likelihood of the airline confirming that the market remains competitive underlined the importance of its cost-cutting programme, he said.

The continuation of falling unit costs will be crucial. "If costs continue to fall, Aer Lingus has a decent chance to deliver on its business plan, but limited liquidity and the Ryanair stake/competitive strength represent an overhang of sorts."

Davy said Aer Lingus has multiple but volatile revenue streams in short-haul, long-haul, cargo and ancillary markets. "Relative to its long-haul competitors, Aer Lingus is in a good position regarding costs."
Davy said the "open skies" deal represents a genuine growth opportunity.

"Turning this into the appropriate returns and profitability depends on successfully competing with US competitors, the construction of a new terminal at Dublin airport and the acquisition of capital at an appropriate price. We are encouraged by recent market commentary regarding the level of discounts on the Airbus A350 programme and the airline's securing of early delivery positions . . . Our price target reflects the anomaly that Aer Lingus, one of the highest-return airlines, is also one of the cheapest."

Ryanair thwarted  in bid for Aer Lingus
190 words
2 July 2007
International Freighting Weekly

English
© 2007 Informa PLC
The European Commission last week prohibited the proposed  takeover of Aer Lingus  by Ryanair.

It concluded that the  merger of Ireland's two leading airlines would have harmed competition and created a monopoly or a dominant position on 35 routes operated by both parties.

The commission said Ryanair's reputation for "aggressive retaliation against any entry attempt by competitors", combined with slot limitations due to peak-time congestion at Dublin airport, was likely to discourage competitors from setting up in competition on the routes in question.
Aer Lingus is set to double its long-haul fleet to 14 aircraft by 2014.

It will take delivery of six A330-300E (enhanced) and six A350 XWB (extra-wide body) aircraft, with deliveries commencing in 2009.

The expansion of the Aer Lingus long-haul fleet began in May with the delivery of an A330-200E aircraft, followed by an A330-300E delivery last month, bringing the long-haul fleet to nine aircraft.
CEO Dermot Mannion said:

"These aircraft are key to our growth ambitions, which include new routes to the US following the open skies agreement."

Dempsey has 'no plans' to intervene  on sale of Ryanair stake in Aer Lingus
386 words
3 July 2007
Irish Independent
IINM
English
(c) 2007 Independent Newspapers Ireland Ltd
NEWLY-appointed Transport Minister Noel Dempsey has said he has no plans to try to force  Ryanair to sell its
25pc stake in Aer Lingus.

Ryanair built up the €430m interest in Aer Lingus  as part of a hostile takeover bid that was blocked by the European Commission (EC) last week. The bid was strongly opposed by Aer Lingus  and Government, and both parties were expected to immediately move to force  Ryanair to sell off its stake.

However in response to questions yesterday, Mr Dempsey ruled out any action by his department. "The future of Ryanair's stake isn't a matter for me," he said. "It's not up to me to tell [Ryanair boss] Michael O'Leary how to do his job; he does a fine job of that on his own."

Mr O'Leary has criticised the EC decision as "purely political", but Mr Dempsey rejected this. "Ryanair made their case, the Government and the airlines made theirs, and the EC made a decision, it was as simple as that," he said. "You've got to have a referee in these things and that referee was the EC."

Mr Dempsey also rejected Ryanair's claims that his deparment had given inaccurate and misleading information to the EC.
The future of Ryanair's Aer Lingus holding has been the subject of intense speculation since the EC decision last
Wednesday.

The Commission had been widely expected to tell Ryanair to sell its Aer Lingus stock, and Ryanair had already announced plans to challenge this decision in the courts.
But Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes then surprised observers by saying she had no power to make
Ryanair sell off its stake, because there was no evidence that Ryanair had any control over Aer Lingus.

However other competition agencies, such as Ireland's Competition Authority and the UK's Office of Fair Trading, have different definitions of 'control', and these might allow them to ask Ryanair to sell its share (if a competition complaint were made). Last week Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said there were no immediate plans to try to remove Ryanair from his airline's shareholder base. However he refused to rule out any future action to that end.

Ryanair to sue EU over 'state aid abuses' for Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia,  Olympic

DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, the no-frills airline recently barred by  European Union authorities from buying  Irish rival Aer Lingus,  said Tuesday it will sue the  EU's executive arm over its alleged failure to enforce competition rules fairly.

Ryanair said it would take the  European Commission to the  European Court of Justice because it has refused to act on at least four complaints filed by the Dublin-based carrier since 2005 involving Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and Olympic Airlines of Greece.
The EU later unveiled plans hours to investigate the level of government subsidies used to attract Ryanair and a
British budget carrier, easyJet, to small airports in Germany and Finland.

Ryanair accused France of offering illegal subsidies to Air France's base airports worth euro1 billion (US$1.35 billion) over the past seven years. It said Germany was being permitted to run up annual losses exceeding euro50 million (US$68 million) at a state-owned Munich airport "on a new terminal built exclusively for Lufthansa."

The Irish airline also chided EU authorities for permitting Italy to offer billions in bailout money for Alitalia, which is expected to be put up for sale soon. And it said the EU should have ordered Greece to reclaim "the multimillions
in illegal state aid granted to Olympic."

"Ryanair is confident that the European Court will take the (European) Commission to task for their failure to fairly enforce the state-aid rules against national governments, who continue to protect their inefficient flag carrier airlines," said Jim O'Callaghan, Ryanair's director of regulatory affairs.
O'Callaghan declined to specify when Ryanair intended to begin legal action.

The European Commission -- which on June 27 vetoed Ryanair's ambition to acquire recently privatized Irish airline Aer Lingus -- said it had not received documentation from Ryanair.

"We'll of course, once we have received it, carefully study it," EU spokesman Martin Selmayr said. "We believe that the commission has been dealing with the cases both fairly and effectively in accordance with our duties, and we are confident that when reviewing our actions, the court will confirm this."
Shares in Ryanair fell euro0.09 (US$0.12) to euro5.10 (US$6.99) on the Irish Stock Exchange.

Ryanair launched a hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus in October, barely a week after the Irish government floated most of its stake on the Irish and British stock exchanges.

Ryanair managed to acquire 25.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but faced an uphill struggle to reach the 50 percent level necessary for a successful bid. The government, which retained a 25 percent share, and Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts holding more than 15 percent of shares both opposed the Ryanair approach.

In their ruling, EU authorities said a combined Ryanair- Aer Lingus operation would leave the Irish market with too little competition. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said his company would appeal that decision but expected the legal process to take two years, effectively killing the takeover bid.

RYANAIR is to sue the Eurocrats of Brussels, accusing the  European Commission of failing to police 'blatant abuses of state aid rules' by the governments of France, Germany, Italy and Greece.

Smarting from the  EC's recent blocking of Ryanair's £1 billion takeover of Aer Lingus,  Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary today said he is launching the European Court action because Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic Airways have all received 'millions of euros in illegal state aid'.

Ryanair alleges the French government has subsidised domestic airports to the tune of e1 billion (£677 million) for the benefit of Air France. It says Lufthansa has gained from the exclusive use of a new terminal at Munich airport, with the e50 million-a-year costs picked up by the German government.

The Irish airline also accuses the EC of turning a blind eye to the Italian and Greek governments' 'massive injections of state aid into their terminally ill flag-carrier airlines'.

RYANAIR WILL SUE OVER 'ILLEGAL AID' TO AIRLINES

RYANAIR is to sue the Eurocrats of Brussels, accusing the  European Commission of failing to stop 'blatant abuses of state aid rules' by the French, German, Italian and Greek governments.

Smarting from the  EC's recent blocking of his £1 billion  takeover of Aer Lingus,  Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary today said he is launching the  European Court action because Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic Airways have all received 'millions of euros in illegal state aid'.

Ryanair claims the French government subsidised domestic airports to the tune of e1 billion (£677 million) for Air France's benefit. It says Lufthansa had exclusive use of a new Munich airport terminal, with the German government picking up costs of e50 million a year.

The Irish airline also accuses the EC of turning a blind eye to 'massive injections of state aid into their terminally-ill flag-carrier airlines' by the Italian and Greek governments.

Ryanair, which accuses the EU of double standards, was the victim of EU intervention after the Belgian authorities were found guilty of subsidising its services into Charleroi airport.

'It appears the Commission applies one rule for the high-fare, flag-carrier airlines and state-owned primary airports, but a different one for low-cost airlines like Ryanair and the numerous regional and secondary airports offering competition and lower fares,' O'Leary said.
Ryanair had no alternative but to challenge 'failure to investigate these unlawful state aid abuses'. Document NS00000020070710e37a00040

Ryanair to sue European Commission over 'illegal' subsidy payments

Still smarting from the  EU Commission blocking of  Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus,  Europe's largest low fares airline is now planning to sue it for failing to take action on a number of complaints alleging the payment of illegal state aids.

Ryanair claims that complaints involving Air France, Lufthansa, Alitalia and Olympic Airways were submitted to the commission over a year ago.
They involve hundreds of millions of euros in 'illegal' state aid being granted by the French, German, Italian and
Greek governments to subsidise their national airlines.

'Although Ryanair has called on the commission several times to investigate these claims, it has failed to do so', Ryanair says in a statement. It is taking the matter to the European Courts. Ryanair (RYA) shares slipped 0.0475 to 5.1475.

It claims that Air France received around 1 billion in 'illegal' state aid because the French government discounted domestic airport fees for seven years.

The German government allowed the state-owned airport at Munich to lose over 50 million on a new terminal built exclusively for Lufthansa which is effectively a subsidy, says Ryanair.

Meanwhile, the Italian and Greek governments have repeatedly given state aid to their national carriers, respectively Alitalia and Olympic.

'It appears as always that the commission applies one rule for the high fare flag-carrier airlines and state-owned primary airports, but a different one for low-cost airlines like Ryanair and the numerous regional and secondary airports that are offering competition and lower fares to the travelling public,' said Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs Jim Callaghan.

The legal move is in addition to Ryanair's response to appeal against the Commission's decision last month to block its plan to takeover Aer Lingus which it claims was 'unlawful'.

Ryanair says said the European Commission has spent 20 years encouraging mergers. If combined, Ryanair and Aer Lingus would have less than 5% of the European market and the decision to block a deal so small was the first ever.

Stopping the deal effectively prevented price reductions worth 100 million and left Aer Lingus exposed as a small, peripheral loss-making regional airline, claims Ryanair.

DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ryanair Holdings PLC, the discount airline prevented from  buying  rival Aer Lingus,  said
Tuesday it will take to court EU competition authorities over their alleged failure to enforce competition rules fairly.

Ryanair said it would take the  EU to court because it has refused to act on at least four complaints filed by the
Dublin-based carrier since 2005 involving Lufthansa, Air France, Alitalia and Olympic Airlines of Greece.

Ryanair accused France of offering illegal subsidies to Air France's base airports worth one billion euros (US$1.35 billion) over the past seven years. The company also said Germany was being permitted to run up annual losses exceeding 50 million euros ($68 million) at a state-owned Munich airport ``on a new terminal built exclusively for Lufthansa.''

The Irish airline also chided EU authorities for permitting Italy to offer billions in bailout money for Alitalia, which is expected to be put up for sale soon. It said the EU should have ordered Greece to reclaim ``the multimillions in illegal state aid granted to Olympic.''
``Ryanair is confident that the European Court will take the (European) Commission to task for their failure to
fairly enforce the state-aid rules against national governments, who continue to protect their inefficient flag carrier
airlines,'' said Jim O'Callaghan, Ryanair's director of regulatory affairs.
O'Callaghan declined to specify when Ryanair intended to begin legal action.

The EU, which on June 27 vetoed Ryanair's ambition to acquire recently privatized Irish airline Aer Lingus, offered no immediate comment.
