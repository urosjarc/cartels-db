UPS shareholders look past TNT debacle; Commentary: Pile of uncommitted cash could turn into
dividends

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Ten months ago, when United Parcel Service Inc. bid $6.8 billion for Dutch shipper TNT Express, it was optimistic about securing a major presence in the European market.
Today, citing stiff opposition from  European Commission regulators,  UPS abandoned the bid.

The company’s chief executive, Scott Davis, explained that all the “significant and tangible remedies” proposed to make the deal easier to swallow had failed to convince EC antitrust officials that it would not threaten competition in the overnight parcel-delivery market.
“We are extremely disappointed,” he said.

Not so shareholders. UPS shares popped nearly 2% at the open, bringing them within reach of the 52-week high they hit on March 19 last year, the day the company announced its TNT deal.
Why the relief rally? UPS has to pay TNT a $266 million termination fee. But that’s a drop in the bucket given the
$6.8 billion of uncommitted cash it’s now sitting on. That’s money some shareholders no doubt hope will trickle
down to them in the form of a fatter dividend.

Meanwhile, several Wall Street analysts point out that their earnings estimates for UPS judiciously excluded future contributions from TNT. UPS still looks pretty solid: According to analysts surveyed by FactSet, UPS is expected to earn $4.59 a share in 2102, a 5.5% improvement on its 2011 results. Their projections for 2013, again excluding a TNT acquisition, push the full-year earnings estimate up to $5.12 a share.

UPS’s gains build on a broad increase in global commerce, most of it outside Europe. So while failing to grab a bigger share of the European market might disappoint Davis, it didn’t shake Wall Street.
But that leaves TNT in play, at least in theory.

Possible takers? Apparently not. TNT shares took a 41% dive in Europe and FedEx Corp. , the other name surfacing in the speculation pool, is not likely to make a bid. FedEx executives made that clear last March, when the UPS-TNT deal was first announced. They’ve given no indication they’ve changed their minds, focusing instead on cost-cutting.

Besides, FedEx plainly has stated its strategy in Europe hinges on organic growth and small, tightly focused acquisitions, not billion-dollar takeovers.
After hitting the EC’s regulatory wall, that’s a strategy UPS is likely to embrace as well, and shareholders seem
OK with that.

— Jim Jelter
Failing to grab a bigger share of the European market might disappoint the company’s CEO, but doesn’t shake
Wall Street. Investors also see the possibility of higher UPS dividends, writes Jim Jelter.|103

United Parcel Service Inc, TNT Express NV Deal Falls Apart-DJ

Date Announced: 20130114

Dow Jones reported that United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) has abandoned its protracted, $6.8 billion bid to take over smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV, after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission's antitrust regulator. Despite months of negotiations,  UPS said it expects the Commission to block the proposed acquisition after a meeting with the antitrust body of the
European Union's executive arm last Friday.  UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal after a first phase review, but the process dragged on, highlighting the Commission's concerns about future competition in the market for overnight deliveries of parcels in  Europe.

Date Announced: 20130114

United Parcel Service Inc announced that the  European Commission (EC) has informed UPS and TNT Express that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNT Express. UPS submitted an initial remedies proposal on November 29, 2012 and subsequently revised the proposal twice.  UPS began the competitive review process with the  EC in March 2012. Upon prohibition by the  EC, the Offer Condition relating to EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and  UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of EUR200 million and will withdraw the Offer. Further announcements will be made once the  European Commission has issued formal decision. The decision is expected to be adopted formally in the coming weeks.

PostNL: UPS Anticipates European Commission to Prohibit Acquisition of TNT Express

STOCK REPORT [Company Release]
14 January 2013 at 11:00 CET - The Hague - PostNL has taken notice of the press releases issued today by UPS and TNT Express, that indicate that the European Commission has informed UPS and TNT Express that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNT Express. In its press release, TNT Express indicates that UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis.

Herna Verhagen, CEO of PostNL: "The transaction between UPS and TNT Express would have maximised the value of our stake in TNT Express. If upon a formal decision of the European Commission, the acquisition of TNT Express is not pursued, we expect that we will monetise the stake over the medium term to create better value for shareholders, after we have seen stability return to TNT Express."

As a major shareholder of TNT Express, PostNL will fill in this role in the best interests of PostNL and our shareholders. In the meantime, we will continue our daily business as planned, including the reorganisation in Mail Netherlands and the rollout of the new logistics infrastructure in Parcels.

US delivery giant  United Parcel Service (UPS) says it's pulling out of its multi-billion-euro bid for Dutch firm  TNT
Express.

"UPS informed TNT Express that  UPS sees no realistic prospect that  EC (European Commission) clearance can be obtained and that  UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," UPS said in a statement from Hoofddorp in the Netherlands on Monday.

The decision is despite an attempt by UPS last year to overcome competition concerns by amending its 5.16 billion euros ($A6.59 billion) bid.

EU competition authorities had warned that the takeover as constructed would result in damaging concentration in the European market for express delivery.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision."

UPS then told TNT it would not continue chasing the deal and that "formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision of the EC, which ...TNT Express deems inevitable," it said.

In June, UPS launched a bid to take over TNT Express, but the EU competition authorities announced a month later they would investigate the deal.

The EU said it was worried the proposed merger would reduce the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market for domestic and international express delivery services on the European continent.

TNT-UPS merger collapses in boost for Royal Mail

ROYAL Mail received a much-needed boost today as United Parcel Services, the world's largest deliverer of packages, dropped a €5.2 billion (£4.3 billion) takeover bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express after it became clear that it would be blocked by  European regulators.

The pull-out saw  TNT's shares halve in value, with industry experts questioning the company's future despite the fact that it is the market leader in  Europe.

A combined UPS and TNT would have held 35% of the UK parcels market and would have been a formidable competitor to Royal Mail. It is believed that UPS suggested selling parts of the merged business to Royal Mail in a bid to get round European Commission competition worries.

Ahead of Royal Mail's planned privatisation, chief executive Moya Greene has been pushing its parcels arm and express delivery — where a united TNTUPS would have offered stronger competition — to promote its commercial future.
UPS had wanted to buy TNT to help it expand in the faster-growing Asian and Latin American markets using the
Dutch firm's networks. But TNT has been struggling for several years in its markets closer to home.

TNT Express shares, which were briefly suspended when the market opened, fell as much as 50% to €4.05, compared with the UPS offer price of €9.50 per share.

UPS will pay TNT a fee of €200 million for breaking the takeover deal. But that will be little compensation for the business which made losses of €3 million in the third quarter of 2012 on revenues of €1.8 billion.

Chief executive Marianne-Christine Lombard quit TNT in September partway through the bid, and came under heavy criticism for bailing out when the deal looked to be in trouble. She had stood to make a €2.6 million bonus if the takeover had gone through.

UPS had made a number of offers to the European Commission, including selling off parts of the small packets business and opening up the two carriers' airline networks to rivals. But a meeting with the commission at the end of last week made it clear the deal would be blocked.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive, said in a statement, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."

U.P.S., Facing Resistance  in Europe, Drops Bid for TNT Express

United Parcel Service is withdrawing its $6.9 billion takeover offer for the Dutch shipping company  TNT Express, after European authorities indicated they would block the deal over antitrust concerns

The failure of the deal is a blow to U.P.S.'s expansion efforts. The acquisition of TNT Express, which would have been the largest in the 105-year-history of U.P.S., would have given it a larger presence in Europe and the emerging markets.

The failure also leaves TNT vulnerable. It has reduced operations across Europe amid the sluggish economy and has had setbacks in emerging economies like Brazil and China.
"The European Union's decision is very disappointing," said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy Research in
Dublin. "It's hard to see the company being bought by anyone else."

Shares in TNT Express fell 41 percent, to 4.84 euros, or $6.46, on Monday. U.P.S. had offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT.
U.P.S. rose 1.7 percent on Monday, to $79.24. Some investors had worried that such a merger would distract
U.P.S., especially as it sought approval from the  European Commission .

The commission has been willing to flex its antitrust muscle. Last year, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse called off their $9.2 billion merger, after regulators demanded that the two exchange operators sell significant parts of their businesses.

Other deals have passed muster only with major changes. In approving Universal Music Group's takeover of EMI Music last year, European regulators required the sale of a third of EMI's assets.

U.P.S. and TNT, which announced the deal last March, had been in negotiations with European regulators for months. Regulators worried that a merger would effectively create two main players in the European shipping market, U.P.S. and DHL.

To allay antitrust concerns, U.P.S. had agreed to sell some business units and to grant rivals access to part of its airline network. U.P.S. had tried to convince regulators that selling assets to the French shipping company DPD would help bolster the rival, creating a sizable competitor. TNT Express also said it would sell its airline operations.
Since November, U.P.S. revised its bid three times.

But the changes did not appease regulators. Late last week, regulators informed both companies that they would not approve the multibillion-dollar takeover. While European officials have until early February to rule officially, U.P.S. opted to pre-emptively withdraw its offer for TNT.

"We are extremely disappointed with the European Commission's position," D. Scott Davis, the chief executive of U.P.S., said in a statement. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction." U.P.S. must pay a termination fee of 200 million euros, or $267 million, to TNT Express.

With U.P.S. backing away, TNT's future looks uncertain. After a tough 2011, it has improved modestly, gaining in revenue and profit through the first three quarters of last year. But TNT, which has large operations across Europe, would need a large injection of investment to expand globally, analysts said.

FedEx, which has a much smaller operation in the region than U.P.S., could be a potential suitor. But a deal with the European shipping giant DHL probably would also raise antitrust concerns.

U.P.S. must now go to Plan B in Europe. In a research note on Monday, analysts at Credit Suisse predicted that the company would continue to invest in the region and increase the size of a planned share buyback plan.
U.P.S. said it would look for opportunities to grow organically and through acquisitions. For instance, it could seek smaller acquisitions in peripheral European countries that would not raise antitrust concerns.

PARCELS MERGER DEAL FALLS THROUGH

The collapse of a takeover deal between delivery firms  United Parcel Service (UPS) and TNT Express provided a welcome boost to Royal Mail today.

Atlanta-based UPS ditched its plans to pay 5.2 billion euros (£4.3 billion) for Holland-based  TNT as it became clear European regulators would block the move.

The deal would have been a blow to Royal Mail, which is growing its parcel deliveries business to make up for a continued shortfall in letters as it prepares for privatisation.

TNT has 70 delivery depots, three sorting hubs and three national contact centres in the UK and Ireland, where it employs some 11,000 staff.

While UPS is a major player in the United States, the firm's operations in the UK are smaller than TNT's. When the deal was agreed in March, it had 7,200 staff and a head office at Feltham, Middlesex.
UPS had offered to buy struggling TNT, Europe's second largest delivery company, to better compete with
Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS was also after TNT's assets in Asia and Latin America.

TNT will receive a 200 million euro (£166 million) break fee from UPS, but it faces an uncertain future, with shares plunging nearly 50% at one point in trading in Amsterdam today.

Regulators said in October the deal, which would have been UPS' largest ever acquisition, would lead to over-concentration in the sector.

UPS offered to sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets but after meeting with regulators, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved - and it was not interested in further concessions.

The European Commission, which reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market, will publish its review of the deal by February 5.

1316 GMT [Dow Jones] Euro Stoxx 50 is up 0.1% at 2720.25, paring gains as US futures slip into the red. Still, French banks gain, with Credit Agricole up 2.9% and Societe Generale up 3.5% after an upgrade by Credit Suisse. On the downside, though,  TNT Express falls 41% after  UPS says it will abandon a bid for the company.
Brewin Dolphin strategist Guy Foster says the focus this week will be on the US earnings season, with a big batch of big names due to report. He says this week's results "will likely set the tone for the rest of the season."
Earnings are due from General Electric, Intel, and the major financials, including Bank of American, Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley. (michele.maatouk@dowjones.com)

1632 GMT [Dow Jones] The termination of  UPS's (UPS) proposed acquisition of  TNT (TNTE.AE) is positive news for Deutsche Post (DPW.XE), DZ Bank says. As the market leader in  Europe with 41% market share, Deutsche Post's DHL unit will benefit from an unchanged market environment, DZ says. If  UPS and TNT had combined in Europe, they would have had 37% of the market and been a rival to reckon with for DHL. It is further unlikely that FedEx (FDX) has any interest in  TNT, DZ says. DZ notes  TNT has a number of operating problems and "without
a strong partner like  UPS or FedEX, the Dutch company could be squeezed out of the market." DZ keeps Deutsche Post rated at buy with a EUR19 fair value. Deutsche Post shares trade up 0.1% at EUR16.97.(sarah.sloat@dowjones.com)

MARKET COMMENT: Europe Slips Ahead of Bernanke;  TNT Plunges

MADRID (MarketWatch)--European stock markets ended lower Monday as investors awaited a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while shares of  TNT Express NV plunged after  United Parcel Service Inc. said European regulators would block its proposed acquisition of the Dutch package-delivery company.
The Stoxx  Europe 600 index fell 0.4% to close at 286.01. The index posted a 0.3% loss last week.

Coloring the trading in Europe, stocks traded mixed on Wall Street, with shares of Apple Inc. under pressure after news reports said the company had cut orders for components used in its iPhone 5 due to weaker-than-expected global demand.

Shares of TNT Express plunged more than 41% and PostNL plummeted nearly 36%, upended as UPS said the European Commission would refuse to approve the U.S. logistics group's proposed $6.8 billion buyout of TNT Express over competition concerns. PostNL has been attempting to dispose of its nearly 30% stake in TNT.

In Paris, shares of Societe Generale SA rose 3.8% and Credit Agricole SA added 3%. Credit Suisse upgraded the French banks to overweight, citing positive effects of 2012 asset disposals and inexpensive valuations relative to peers.

Credit Suisse analysts also said they were positive on Credit Agricole's strategy of refocusing on its core franchise.
The banking-sector gains helped the French CAC 40 index eke out a 0.1% rise to 3,708.25.

Also higher in Paris, shares of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA rose 0.4%. The company said Ardagh Glass Ltd. has made a "binding and irrevocable" offer valued at $1.69 billion for the French conglomerate's North American unit, which makes glass bottles and jars.

In other deal news, shares of Swatch Group AG rose 4.1% after the Swiss watch company said it paid $750 million for the jewelry and watch brand of Harry Winston Diamond Corp. of Toronto. Swatch also assumed as much as $250 million of pro forma net debt.
European stocks got an early boost after comments from Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago. Media reports said Evans predicted the U.S. economy will grow by 2.5% in 2013, improving to a 3.5%
growth rate for gross domestic product in 2014.

Coinciding with the close of U.S. trading on Monday, Fed chief Ben Bernanke will give a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., with a question-and-answer session to follow.

Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said equities in Europe can attribute some recent gains to hopes that all central banks, but crucially the Fed, will "remain tilted toward intervention," as growth in developed economies remains tepid.

"If the sense that they will stay engaged is perceived then the expectation that investors will achieve their desired rates of return on capital deployed then we will see steady gains as carefully selected 'risk-on' assets dominate the early 2013 asset allocation decisions," Pope said in emailed comments.

"Be wary of fast-moving stocks that over the medium term are unable to be price makers," he said. "Bottom line is going to be vastly more important in 2013 than top line. Cost control [and] liquidity will still dominate."

Among other regional indexes, the DAX 30 index rose 0.2% to 7,729.52 in Frankfurt, led by shares of German chemicals group BASF SE, up 1.1%. Deutsche Bank said BASF remains its top pick in this space, rated a buy. Linde AG also ranks among its top picks, with a buy rating. Linde rose 1.6%.

Shares of Volkswagen AG gave up an earlier gain to lose 0.1%. Societe Generale said it believes the auto maker will continue to outperform in all major markets, but it did reduce earnings forecasts on the group. Volkwagen's
2013 earnings before interest and taxes forecast was cut to EUR14.4 billion from EUR15.8 billion.

In London, the FTSE 100 index lost 0.2% to finish at 6,107.86. Broker action also commanded much of the action for the index.

Shares of Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. PLC traded 3.5% higher. Credit Suisse analysts upgraded its rating to outperform from neutral, saying they believe that downside risks are now limited and that there are potential
re-rating catalysts this year.

Heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline PLC fell 0.7%. The pharmaceutical said Monday that it submitted a diabetes drug candidate for scrutiny before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Baker & McKenzie has successfully challenged the proposed €5.2bn (£4.3bn) takeover of delivery giant  TNT Express by United Parcel Service (UPS), which has collapsed after the  European Commission moved to block the deal.
FedEx challenged the merger on competitive grounds after  UPS's bid was announced in early 2012, with the
European Commission subsequently  opening an investigation into the proposed deal in July.
FedEx is understood to have made around 40 to 50 written submissions questioning the transaction.

UPS's bid, which was first announced last March, will be officially terminated when Brussels formally blocks the agreement.
Bakers took the lead role for FedEx, with EU and competition head Fiona Carlin and EU competition partner
Gavin Bushell, both of whom are based in Brussels, heading up the firm's team.

UPS has been taking advice from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, with the magic circle firm's team including Amsterdam managing partner Winfred Knibbeler, Amsterdam corporate partner Alexander Doorman, Netherlands corporate partner Jan Willem van der Staay and Brussels-based antitrust partner Alan Ryan.

Allen & Overy (A&O) has been advising TNT on the proposed merger with a team led by Amsterdam head of competition Paul Glazener.

In a statement, UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said: "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."

The European Commission outlined concerns in October that a potential deal would reduce competitors in the express delivery field from four to three players - UPS, Deutsche-Post's DHL and US-based FedEx.

European Commission blocks  UPS-TNT merger
Jon Ross

A case team from the  European Commission has informed officials from  UPS and TNT Express that it's rejecting a proposed $6.3 billion merger between the two integrators.

UPS officials have told  TNT Express that they see no path toward acquiring the company and will not pursue the transaction without  EC approval. The merger, originally announced in March, was estimated to go through during the fourth quarter of 2012.  UPS will now pay TNT a $267 million termination fee.

The decision is expected to be adopted formally in the coming weeks. Shares of TNT are currently down as a result of UPS' decision.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction,” UPS’ Scott Davis said in a statement. “The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."

The European Commission had issues with the proposed merger from the start, seeing a lack of competition in the overnight parcel sector had a deal gone through. In November, TNT and UPS told the commission that the two companies would sell business assets and grant air access to outside companies in order to address the
organization's objections to the proposed merger. UPS then altered these proposed internal remedies twice at the
European Commission’s request. It had been reported that UPS was shopping around parts of TNT Express to
the likes of FedEx, which wasn’t interested. TNT Express officials had also announced the conditional sale of TNT
Airways and Pan Air to ASL Aviation Group. The sale was to be completed once the EU approved the merger
deal.

“UPS and TNT tried to address some of (the commission's) concerns, but were unable to find a buyer for some of TNT Express' operations,” according to a report by Dahlman Rose & Co. “FedEx is one of the few companies with the balance sheet to pull off a deal, but in the past, stated it did not want to participate in the transaction. We do
not expect FedEx to pursue TNT Express at this time as management is focused on tuck-in acquisitions in
Europe.”

Early last year, TNT Express released a statement that it had received an unsolicited takeover offer from UPS, confirming industry rumors that had been circulating for quite some time. That first offer from UPS stood at 9
euros per share, a figure that the TNT board rejected. A little more than a month later, the two integrators came to an agreement: The price was to be 9.50 euros per share, a near 50 percent increase over TNT’s actual
pre-negotiation value of 6.18 euros per share.

PostNL, a major shareholder of TNT Express, had a large hand in the earliest negotiations for the deal. Herna Verhagen, CEO of PostNL, today expressed her distaste for the latest development and hinted at future actions with TNT.

"The transaction between UPS and TNT Express would have maximized the value of our stake in TNT Express,” she said. “If upon a formal decision of the European Commission, the acquisition of TNT Express is not pursued, we expect that we will monetize the stake over the medium term to create better value for shareholders, after we have seen stability return to TNT Express.”

Industry officials had been mixed about the prospect of a deal, with most giving it a 50-50 chance. While FedEx could have seen some benefits with an expansion into Europe, ultimately that was not to happen. Some put the blame on DHL’s bending of the commission’s ear. At consultancy firm Transport Intelligence, officials took issue with how the European Commission handled the proposed transaction from the start.

"It is hard to see what the EC sought to achieve through the negative stance they took to this deal. Their decision making process looks flawed, caused by a fundamental lack of understanding of the industry,” Transport Intelligence’s Joel Ray said in a statement. “It seems to have been driven by a desire to engineer a market structure through political motivations. European shippers would have gained from the acquisition through a strong new road- and air-based player. This decision has set the market back many years, and risks reducing competition, not increasing it." -  Jon Ross

MADRID (MarketWatch) --  European stock markets ended lower Monday as investors awaited a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while shares of  TNT Express NV plunged after  United Parcel Service Inc. said European regulators would block its proposed acquisition of the Dutch package-delivery company.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.4% to close at 286.01. The index posted a 0.3% loss last week.

Coloring the trading in Europe, stocks traded mixed on Wall Street, with shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) under pressure after news reports said the company had cut orders for components used in its iPhone 5 due to weaker-than-expected global demand. .
Shares of TNT Express plunged more than 41% and PostNL plummeted nearly 36%, upended as UPS (UPS)
said the European Commission would refuse to approve the U.S. logistics group's proposed $6.8 billion buyout of
TNT Express over competition concerns. PostNL has been attempting to dispose of its nearly 30% stake in TNT. .

In Paris, shares of Société Générale SA rose 3.8% and Credit Agricole SA added 3%. Credit Suisse upgraded the French banks to overweight, citing positive effects of 2012 asset disposals and inexpensive valuations relative to peers.

Credit Suisse analysts also said they were positive on Crédit Agricole's strategy of refocusing on its core franchise.
Deal news
The banking-sector gains helped the French CAC 40 index eke out a 0.1% rise to 3,708.25.

Also higher in Paris, shares of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA rose 0.4%. The company said Ardagh Glass Ltd. has made a "binding and irrevocable" offer valued at $1.69 billion for the French conglomerate's North American unit, which makes glass bottles and jars. .
In other deal news, shares of Swatch Group AG rose 4.1% after the Swiss watch company said it paid $750
million for the jewelry and watch brand of Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HWD) of Toronto. Swatch also assumed
as much as $250 million of pro forma net debt.
Evans remarks; Bernanke next
European stocks got an early boost after comments from Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago. Media reports said Evans predicted the U.S. economy will grow by 2.5% in 2013, improving to a 3.5%
growth rate for gross domestic product in 2014.

Coinciding with the close of U.S. trading on Monday, Fed chief Ben Bernanke will give a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., with a question-and-answer session to follow.

Stephen Pope, managing partner at Spotlight Ideas, said equities in Europe can attribute some recent gains to hopes that all central banks, but crucially the Fed, will "remain tilted toward intervention," as growth in developed economies remains tepid.

"If the sense that they will stay engaged is perceived then the expectation that investors will achieve their desired rates of return on capital deployed then we will see steady gains as carefully selected 'risk-on' assets dominate the early 2013 asset allocation decisions," Pope said in emailed comments.

Brussels must explain why EU failed to deliver UPS-TNT deal; What a triumph for those Brussels delivery
experts. Debt Ceiling - the White House's sequel to Fiscal Cliff; This Bumi "relationship agreement" could be tested to destruction
By Alistair Osborne Business Editor

When America’s  United Parcel Service rolled up last March with a £4.3bn bid for Holland’s  TNT Express , you could sense the relief. Here was a major US corporate putting proper folding stuff on the line for a  European company – despite the hourly provocations from the warring eurozone.

It was, what is popularly known, as a vote of confidence. Well, not any more.  UPS has pulled the bid – a pricey decision too, given it now has to pay a €200m (£166m) break fee.  TNT shares have collapsed 41pc. And all because of Brussels’ quaint view of what today constitutes a logistics market.

EC competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia never got his head round this deal. He stubbornly stuck to the belief that, when it comes to the go-go world of parcel delivery, only four companies count – UPS, Deutsche Post
’s DHL, FedEx and TNT. Sure, on that basis, the deal turned four groups into three – but that says more about the
EC’s narrow view of the market than what’s happening on the ground.

As your Christmas parcels showed, it’s not just the big four that deliver. What about the Royal Mail or DPD, the parcel firm controlled by France’s state-owned La Poste? Or the tens, if not hundreds, of smaller delivery firms across Europe?

Almunia argued it’s only the big four that have integrated networks, notably with an air freight wing. But, even after the proposed deal, DHL would have been a bigger integrated player in Europe than UPS-TNT, with 28pc of the market versus their 26pc. What’s more, UPS revised its bid three times, offering the asset sales demanded to turn DPD into a more powerful competitor. Meanwhile, TNT Express undertook to sell its airline to satisfy Brussels.

All to no avail. On Friday, after meeting the EC wonks, UPS got knocked back again - this time apparently also told that there could be no extension to the Feb 5 decision deadline, so it was too late to suggest any more remedies.

The upshot is that TNT, which employs 70,000 staff, now looks even more vulnerable, whatever its claims it will just revert to an independent strategy – one that was hardly working before. And the shares are half the €9.5 bid price, below where they were too before UPS showed up.

TNT’s 30pc shareholder PostNL now plans to sell its stake, which in the absence of a bid will only create a stock overhang. Of course, FedEx , which opposed the UPS tie-up and is just a bit player in Europe, could be waiting in the wings. But, with hardly any European business, FedEx cannot match the £400m or so of synergies analysts pencilled in for the UPS deal.

Come Feb 5, Almunia will no doubt claim he has saved businesses and consumers from a so-called European duopoly of UPS/TNT and DHL. But Brussels has come up with this sort of thinking before. It blocked mergers in the package holiday and music businesses, for example, only to relent years later – when the market had moved on and the one-time industry leaders had been left behind.

Asked to explain the EC’s thinking, Almunia’s spokesman demanded all questions by email. Sadly, it’s too late for that. They’re already in the post, coming via TNT.

Even Hollywood would struggle to produce a sequel this quick. Just when you thought you’d had all you could stomach with the Fiscal Cliff epic, here comes another blockbuster from the same White House studio: Debt Ceiling.

Barack Obama had some familiar lines yesterday, telling Republican lawmakers that he expected no nonsense from them over the need to raise the ceiling on America’s $16.4 trillion (£10.2 trillion) borrowings.

They would “not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the economy", the US President declared, as he drove home the chaos of not lifting the debt bar. The markets “could go haywire", he said, while America floundered around trying to make social security payments or deliver salaries to the military.

Put like that, the cinematic potential of failing to raise the ceiling looks rather promising – though Obama doesn’t see things that way. After all, he’s trying to run a country whose Treasury reached its statutory debt limit on December 31 and is now using “extraordinary" measures to keep the show on the road. According to the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center , America will run out of funds to pay all its bills by Feb 15, which points to a frugal Valentine’s Day dinner for Michelle.
Like the written Constitution, the debt ceiling at least allows Americans to know where they stand. But when
Obama insists “we are not a deadbeat nation", you wonder who exactly he’s trying to convince.
What do you have to do to invalidate a shareholder agreement?

That will become clearer soon as Nat Rothschild and Bumi slug it out for control of the bombed-out coal miner. Indonesia’s Bakrie family, who created the financial black hole with Rothschild, insist that a “relationship agreement" allows them to appoint the London-listed company’s chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer. So, they claim, Rothschild can’t appoint his chosen directors – even if he wins next month’s EGM seeking to oust 12 of the current 14-strong board.

The financier will test that. He claims the “irregularities" shortly to be laid at the Bakries’ door by law firm Macfarlanes, plus an undeclared concert party, make the agreement legally worthless. Some big shareholders seem to agree too, with 3.1pc investor Taube Hodson Stonex Partners reportedly lending its support to Rothschild, alongside 4pc investor Schroders – though neither commitment is binding. Meanwhile, Rothschild is upping his own stake to boost his EGM chances. Amid such fraught relations, it looks tricky to make this agreement stick.

Veto fears see UPS pull out of offer

United Parcel Service said it will withdraw its 5.2 billion euro (£4.3bn) bid for  TNT Express because it expects the European Commission (EC) to block the deal.

UPS, the world's number one package delivery company, was seeking to buy Dutch peer and  European market leader TNT Express to gain access to its network in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.

The EC has informed UPS and TNT Express that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, the two companies said in separate statements.

"UPS will pay TNT a termination fee in the amount of 200 million euros and will withdraw the offer," once the formal decision is taken, UPS said yesterday. The collapse of the deal is a blow for TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market.

The US delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly based in eastern Europe.

UPS and TNT fail to deliver £4.3bn tie-up

SHARES in delivery firm TNT Express slumped more than 40 per cent yesterday after its long-awaited €5.2bn
(£4.3bn) takeover by United Parcel Service (UPS) collapsed under regulatory pressure.

Despite efforts to appease the  European Commission with offers to amend the deal, the firms were told on Friday that the  EC intended to prohibit the purchase.

UPS said in a statement it will pay a €200m break fee to withdraw its offer, ending almost a year of discussions between the firms.
The European Commission said its formal decision is not due until 5 February. The body has prohibited around
20 deals on competition grounds in as many years.

The regulatory roadblock leaves Amsterdam-listed TNT without a permanent chief executive or longterm strategy as a standalone company.

FedEx, which had complained to the European Commission about the proposed deal, is not thought to be preparing a bid for TNT, while analysts said an offer from larger rival Deutsche Post was unlikely to gain competition clearance.

Shares in PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay investors a dividend, plunged a third on the news.
Hedge funds were left nursing losses of more han $700m after the collapse of TNT's shares.

Merger arbitrage funds are estimated to have owned around 30 per cent of TNT shares before yesterday's announcement, a source told Reuters.

ADVISERS UPS PURCHASE OF TNT FIONA CARLIN & GAVIN BUSHELL BAKER & MCKENZIE AFTER almost a year of talks about the finances of the £4.3bn postal purchase, the deal was finally felled by legal tangles. Antitrust lawyers from Freshfields acting for UPS and Allen & Overy partner Paul Glazener for TNT Express learned last week that the European Commission planned to exercise its right to prohibit the deal.
FedEx, which successfully lobbied on competition grounds to the EC, hired Baker & McKenzie as its legal
advisers. The team was led by Fiona Carlin, head of the firm's European and competition law practice in Brussels,
and Gavin Bushell, a partner in the same practice (both pictured left).

The collapse of the tie-up between "Taurus" and "Utah" (the codenames given to the firms in the deal's early stages) has cost the financial advisers an estimated $55m (£34.2m) in fees. UPS's financial advisers Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and UBS would have shared around $25m to $30m, according to Freeman Consulting. TNT's bankers, Goldman Sachs and Lazard, along with Deutsche Bank, which helped the Dutch group''s largest shareholder PostNL, would have split the remaining $20m to $25m, the data consultant estimated yesterday.

UPS DELIVERS A RED LETTER DAY FOR ROYAL MAIL

Royal Mail enjoyed a red-letter day as United Parcel Services dropped a £4.3bn bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express that would have created a powerful rival in the UK package delivery market, writes Rob Davies.

UPS is understood to have ditched takeover plans after it became clear that  European regulators would reject the deal on competition grounds.

Royal Mail is due to be privatised this year and its parcels business is seen as key to its survival as a private enterprise.

A combination of UPS and TNT would have controlled more than a third of the parcel delivery market, so the collapse of the deal provides a big boost for Royal Mail's future prospects.

UPS is thought to have proposed selling off parts of its business to Royal Mail to satisfy competition concerns but failed to win the European Commission's blessing.

TNT has 70 delivery depots, three sorting hubs and three national contact centres in the UK and Ireland, where it employs some 11,000 staff.

While UPS is a major player in the United States, the firm's operations in the UK are smaller than TNT's. When the deal was agreed in March, it had 7,200 staff and a head office at Feltham, Middlesex.
UPS had offered to buy struggling TNT, Europe's second largest delivery company, to better compete with
Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS was also after TNT's assets in Asia and Latin America.

TNT will receive a £166m break fee from UPS, but it faces an uncertain future, with shares plunging nearly 50pc at one point in trading in Amsterdam yesterday.

The European Commission, which reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market, will publish its review of the deal by February 5.

¦ US parcel delivery giant  UPS yesterday scrapped its planned £4.3billiion takeover of  Europe's TNT Express, providing a welcome boost for the Royal Mail.
Atlanta-based  UPS and Holland's TNT said they had been warned that  EU regulators would block the deal.

The merger would have been a blow to Royal Mail, which is growing its parcel deliveries business to make up for a continued shortfall in letters as it prepares for privatisation.

TNT employs some 11,000 staff in the UK. while UPS employs 7,200. Shares in TNT fell as much as 50% in response, wiping £1.6billion off its stock market value.

DJ UPS, TNT Deal Falls Apart
By Robin van Daalen

AMSTERDAM--United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Monday it has abandoned its protracted, $6.8 billion bid to take over smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company  TNT Express NV (TNTEY), after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission's antitrust regulator.

Despite months of negotiations,  UPS said it expects the Commission to block the proposed acquisition after a meeting with the antitrust body of the  European Union's executive arm last Friday.

UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal after a first phase review, but the process dragged on, highlighting the Commission's concerns about future competition in the market for overnight deliveries of parcels in Europe. The acquisition, which would have been the biggest in UPS's 105-year history, was announced in March last year.

The U.S. firm had offered remedies on Nov. 29, and revised its proposal twice to overcome the Commission's concerns, it said.

Negotiations with the Commission continued into the new year, with UPS's hopes increasingly riding on whether it could convince the regulator that sales of UPS and TNT assets to DPD, a small parcel-delivery firm controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, might create a credible new European competitor to meet competition concerns.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis.

UPS had offered 9.5 euros ($12.67) a share for the Dutch firm, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target for its U.S. rivals. After UPS had announced its bid for TNT, shareholders speculated on a counter bid from FedEx Corp. (FDX), which didn't emerge.

The Commission's tough stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes a similar position it took in objecting to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext (NYX) early last year largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in a particular segment of financial services, the
exchange-trade derivatives market. For UPS, the Commission's concerns focused on the lack of competition in the overnight parcel-delivery segment if it acquired TNT.
Still, in between its objections to the big securities exchanges and logistics deals, the Commission did approve
Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion of EMI Group PLC's recorded music division last July.

Returned to sender. United Parcel Services has abandoned its plan to buy TNT Express for $6.8 billion, thanks to objections from the  European Commission's competition authorities. The EC was demanding concessions including selling assets to build up another freight rival, making an already expensive-looking deal unviable:  UPS will now pay a EUR200 million break fee to  TNT. That is small comfort for the Dutch company, whose shares plunged 43% on Monday. Unless  TNT can quickly find a convincing new strategy, there could be more falls to come.

The EC's deal rejection might seem short-sighted: Europe's sluggish economy is in need of inward investment. But the regulator was worried the deal would reduce the number of major companies offering both air and ground parcel deliveries in Europe from four to three -- DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx. UPS had agreed this month to sell some assets to help build up a potential fourth rival, France's DPD. Even so, the EC remained unconvinced DPD would have the capacity to be a major competitor.

Cutting its losses after nine months of negotiation seems sensible for UPS. Its EUR9.5 per share offer was already a near-50% premium to TNT's pre-deal share price: UPS shares rose 1.2% in early trading. The real problems lie with TNT. Led by interim chief executive Bernard Bot, the company has delayed plans to cut costs and find partners for its ailing Brazilian and Chinese businesses, pending the UPS tie-up. Its operating income fell by 26% in the first nine months of 2012. Lower prices have put pressure on its European business, where it
makes two-thirds of its revenue.

An alternative bidder seems unlikely. FedEx is going through its own cost saving program and may not want to run the EC competition gauntlet. That leaves more potential downside for TNT. Analysts have been slow to update earnings forecasts for TNT given little company guidance: its earnings per share could be EUR0.18 in
2013 compared with current consensus at EUR0.32, RBC Capital Markets says. At a 14 times earnings multiple, in line with its peers, that would value TNT at around EUR2.50, a further 47% fall. That's not the kind of parcel investors like to find on their doormats.

Almunia  must explain why Brussels failed to deliver  UPS–TNT deal; Comment

What a triumph for those Brussels delivery experts. When America's  United Parcel Service rolled up last March with a £4.3bn bid for Holland's  TNT Express, you could sense the relief. Here was a major US corporate putting proper folding stuff on the line for a  European company – despite the hourly provocations from the warring eurozone.

It was, what is popularly known as, a vote of confidence. Well, not any more.  UPS has pulled the bid – a pricey decision too, given it now has to pay a €200m (£166m) break fee.  TNT shares have collapsed 41pc. And all because of Brussels' quaint view of what today constitutes a logistics market.

EC competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia never got his head round this deal. He stubbornly stuck to the belief that, when it comes to the gogo world of parcel delivery, only four companies count – UPS, Deutsche Post's DHL, FedEx and TNT. Sure, on that basis, the deal turned four groups into three – but that says more about the EC's narrow view of the market than what's happening on the ground.

As your Christmas parcels showed, it's not just the big four that deliver. What about the Royal Mail or DPD, the parcel firm controlled by France's state–owned La Poste? Or the tens, if not hundreds, of smaller delivery firms across Europe? Almunia argued it's only the big four that have integrated networks, notably with an air freight wing. But, even after the proposed deal, DHL would have been a bigger integrated player in Europe than UPS–TNT, with 28pc of the market versus their 26pc.

What's more, UPS revised its bid three times, offering the asset sales demanded to turn DPD into a more powerful competitor. Meanwhile, TNT Express undertook to sell its airline to satisfy Brussels.

All to no avail. On Friday, after meeting the EC wonks, UPS got knocked back again – this time apparently also told that there could be no extension to the Feb 5 decision deadline, so it was too late to suggest any more remedies.

The upshot is that TNT, which employs 70,000 staff, now looks even more vulnerable, whatever its claims it will just revert to an independent strategy – one that was hardly working before. And the shares are half the €9.5 bid price, below where they were too before UPS showed up.

TNT's 30pc shareholder PostNL now plans to sell its stake, which in the absence of a bid will only create a stock overhang. Of course, FedEx, which opposed the UPS tie–up and is just a bit player in Europe, could be waiting in the wings. But, with hardly any European business, FedEx cannot match the £400m or so of synergies analysts pencilled in for the UPS deal.

Come Feb 5, Almunia will no doubt claim he has saved businesses and consumers from a so–called European duopoly of UPS/TNT and DHL. But Brussels has come up with this sort of thinking before. It blocked mergers in the package holiday and music businesses, for example, only to relent years later when the market had moved on and the one–time industry leaders had been left behind.

Asked to explain the EC's thinking, Almunia's spokesman demanded all questions by email. Sadly, it's too late for that. They're already in the post, coming via TNT.

Boost for Royal Mail as UPS drops plans for TNT takeover

AMERICAN parcel delivery company  UPS has been forced to drop its €5.16bn (£4.3bn) takeover of  European
rival TNT Express in a move that should benefit the Royal Mail.

Shares in Dutch company  TNT plunged 41pc to €4.84, wiping €2bn from its market value, after  UPS said yesterday that Brussels regulators had signalled they will block the deal because of competition concerns.

"UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC [European Commission] clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis," UPS said in a statement from Hoofddorp in The Netherlands.

EU competition officials met UPS and TNT Express representatives on Friday and "informed the companies that, on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal, it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision".
The acquisition, which the two businesses agreed last March, would have been the biggest takeover of a
European company by a US rival since Europe's sovereign debt crisis intensified two years ago.
It would also have handed TNT and UPS more than a third of the lucrative express parcel delivery market in
Britain, which Royal Mail is trying to win more of as it heads for a stock market flotation.

For UPS, which alongside FedEx is one of the largest delivery companies in the world, acquiring TNT would have allowed it to increase its operations in Europe in anticipation of an eventual recovery in the region's economy.

The parcel delivery and broader logistics industry has boomed over the past 15 years as companies outsource the management of their complex, global supply chains.

The collapse of the deal is a blow to UPS's ambition of wresting market share from Deutsche Post, Europe's the largest delivery company.

TNT, which has been battling to staunch losses, will have to carve out a new strategy for recovery. Analysts said, given its size, any takeover attempt by Deustche Post would also be rejected on competition grounds. However, an approach from FedEx could succeed because it has smaller operations in Europe.

UPS will pay a €200m break fee to TNT once the EU Competition Commission issues a formal verdict in the next three weeks. UPS chief executive Scott Davis, who offered €9.50 a share for TNT, said he was "extremely disappointed" at the outcome.

UPS drops $6.6bn TNT Express bid amid EU resistance; banks miss out on $55mn fees

United Parcel Services Inc (UPS) withdrew its USD 6.9 billion bid for the Dutch  TNT Express after resistance from
European regulators who threatened to block the deal over antitrust concerns.

The withdrawal has hurt  UPS’ efforts of global expansion that would have brought in new operational mass to its delivery business outside Asia and the U.S.

UPS said the European Commission informed the parties that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNT Express that was first unveiled in March.
In a statement, TNT said that it, “sees no realistic prospect that EC clearance can be obtained.”

Scott Davis, CEO of UPS said in a separate statement, “We are extremely disappointed with the EC’s position. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular.”
Earlier, UPS had twice revised its proposal for TNT to address the regulatory worries.

Meanwhile, the withdrawal would also hurt bankers advising both UPS and TNT Express, who are set to miss out on USD55 million in fees. UPS's advisers Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and UBS would have shared around USD25 to USD30 million. TNT's bankers, Goldman Sachs and Lazard, and Deutsche Bank, would have split the remaining USD20-USD25 million.

Shares in TNT Express fell 41 per cent, to 4.84 euros, or USD6.46, on Monday. U.P.S. had offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT.

U.P.S. gained 1.7 per cent on Monday, to USD79.24. Some investors had worried that such a merger would distract U.P.S., especially as it sought approval from the European Commission.

United Parcel Service has abandoned a $7 billion bid for its Dutch rival  TNT Express after  European regulators threatened to block the deal.

The American company, which worked on the takeover for nearly a year, will hand a €200 million break fee to TNT after European Commission officials indicated that it would stop the deal because of fears that it would damage competition. It would have left only UPS and FedEx offering integrated air and road delivery services in Europe . UPS had hoped that taking over TNT would give it more scope to compete with rivals such as FedEx and DHL, expanding its presence in Europe, the Far East and Latin America.
It offered a host of concessions to push the deal through, but to no avail.
It will be formally blocked on February 5, but UPS said yesterday that it was withdrawing.

Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, said: "We are extremely disappointed with the European Commission's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the Commission's concerns."

Shares in TNT Express, which is listed in Amsterdam, plummeted 41 per cent to €4.84, its lowest since November 2011. PostNL, the Dutch Post Office, which is TNT's largest shareholder, was also hit, its shares closing 36 per cent lower at €1.82.

UPS shares rose 1.4 per cent to $79 as investors hoped that the funds would be redeployed to buy back shares or pay a special dividend.

The collapse of the takeover was seen in some quarters as a fillip for Royal Mail, which is continuing to prepare the ground for privatisation.

While it is relatively rare for Europe to block a deal, the Commission under Joaquín Almunia, its competition chief, has been proactive. Last year it stopped the combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.

Joaquín Almunia, the  EU's competition chief, has evidently acquired a taste for blocking major M&A. Having torpedoed the merger between Deutsche Börse and the New York Stock Exchange in February last year, yesterday he blew up the planned €5.3 billion takeover of  TNT Express, the Dutch parcels firm, by  United Parcel Service.

The Spaniard's decision, aimed at ensuring that a competitive market stays that way, may ultimately have the opposite effect. At first blush, his ruling is logical, as a takeover would have left just three major players —  UPS, FedEx and DHL — in the  European express parcel delivery market.

But TNT Express, as a standalone business, is now even weaker than when it began talks with UPS last February. The share price shows that: having stood at €6.34 before news of interest from UPS, shares languished last night at just €4.84 each.

Having been focused on the merger for most of the past year, management must now knuckle down to the more mundane task of trying to raise profitability at its Asian and Latin American businesses, while growth at home in Europe remains elusive. Having seen a bid premium evaporate, investors will also need soothing, as will customers, some of which, like Amazon, are already bigger than TNT Express itself and well-placed to set up their own parcel delivery operations.

Mr Almunia may soon conclude that competition is better served by a market comprised of three strong players than one comprised of three strong players and one struggler.

US PARCEL delivery giant  UPS yesterday scrapped its planned £4.3billion takeover of  Europe's TNT Express, providing a welcome boost for the Royal Mail.
Atlanta–based  UPS and Holland's TNT said they had been warned that  EU regulators would block the deal.

The merger would have been a blow to Royal Mail, which is growing its parcel deliveries business to make up for a continued shortfall in letters as it prepares for privatisation.

TNT has 70 delivery depots, three sorting hubs 1and three national contact centres in the UK and Ireland, where it employs some 11,000 staff. UPS employs 7,200 UK staff.

Shares in Amsterdam listed TNT fell as much as 50 per cent in response, wiping £1.6billion off its stock market value.

More than a year in the planning, the takeover would have given UPS control of Europe's second largest delivery company behind DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post.

UPS chairman Scott Davis said the enlarged group would have brought "meaningful benefits" to customers and supported growth in Europe.
An offer to sell parts of the group failed to win over regulators, who will announce their formal decision by
February 5.

UPS deal falls through

THE collapse of a takeover deal between delivery firms  United Parcel Service (UPS) and TNT Express provided a welcome boost to Royal Mail.
Atlanta-based  UPS ditched its plans to pay £4.3bn for Holland-based  TNT as it became clear European
regulators would block the move.

The deal would have been a blow to Royal Mail, which is growing its parcel deliveries business to make up for a continued shortfall in letters as it prepares for privatisation.

TNT has 70 delivery depots, three sorting hubs and three national contact centres in the UK and Ireland, where it employs some 11,000 staff.

While UPS is a major player in the US, the firm's operations in the UK are smaller than TNT's. When the deal was agreed in March, it had 7,200 staff and a head office at Feltham, Middlesex.
UPS had offered to buy struggling TNT, Europe's second largest delivery company, to better compete with
Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS was also after TNT's assets in Asia and Latin America.
TNT will receive a £166m break fee from UPS, but it faces an uncertain future, with shares plunging nearly 50%
at one point in trading in Amsterdam yesterday.

Regulators said in October the deal, which would have been UPS's largest ever acquisition, would lead to over-concentration in the sector.

UPS offered to sell parts of the company's small package operations and airline assets but after meeting with regulators, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved - and it was not interested in further concessions.

The European Commission, which reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market, will publish its review of the deal by February 5.

UPS Drops Bid To Acquire  TNT

United Parcel Service Inc. said Monday that it will abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV, pre-empting regulators after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history, and relinquishing it is a huge strategic disappointment for the Atlanta-based company. A deal would have greatly strengthened  UPS's global reach, bringing new operational mass to its delivery business outside Asia and the U.S.

But UPS revised its takeover proposal three times in a bid to overcome concerns from the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm and still wasn't satisfying the demands. The commission was worried the overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. The regulator also worried that other parcel-delivery companies, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp., could be shut out of the market. Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal being approved.

The commission is due to announce its decision by Feb. 5, but UPS said after a meeting with the regulator that it expects the commission to block the deal.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

It is unclear what finally caused UPS to give up. Company employees were surprised by the news; they had been executing plans to bring TNT into the fold right up until they discovered the deal had fallen apart, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Once the commission's decision is announced, UPS said it will pay TNT a 200 million euro ($267 million)
termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal -- which was announced last March
-- after a preliminary antitrust review.

UPS had hoped that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, to DPD, a parcel-delivery company controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here, while UPS and TNT see a wide spectrum of service providers competing and putting competitive pressure on the merging parties and others in the market."

A person familiar with the commission's thinking said that it had sought binding guarantees that DPD could fill the gap in the marketplace and that it wanted this anchored in a contract, as some of the last concessions put forward earlier this month by UPS had been filed "too late" and were "too complex" to be thoroughly tested prior to any commission decision on the deal.

"The commission spelled out during the meeting on Friday what it needed," the person said. "Maintaining competition in the express delivery sector was key. And there was still willingness to find a way forward." That deal also would have needed to address regulators' outstanding concerns, notably whether any agreement would


Page 56 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
have provided DPD with sufficient long-term access to air transportation. However, UPS didn't move to meet those demands, the person said.

FedEx is unlikely to step in and offer its own bid, people close to the company said. The Memphis-based arch rival to UPS has said it wasn't interested, believing the deal to be too pricey, they said. FedEx "is one of the few companies with the balance sheet to pull off a deal," Helane Becker, analyst with Dahlman Rose, said in a report Monday. But FedEx is focused instead on expanding in Europe through smaller, "tuck in" acquisitions, she added.
FedEx officials declined to comment.

The commission's stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes its objection to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext last year, largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.

UPS could have appeased the regulator by selling European assets to FedEx, but the U.S. company showed no interest in doing that.

UPS offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL NV under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target. PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder with nearly 30%, said it plans to sell its stake, assuming the deal with UPS doesn't proceed.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand-alone strategy, which we presented in February," Chief Executive Bernard Bot said Monday.
European Commission officials declined to comment.

United Parcel Service Inc. abandoned a nearly $7 billion bid for Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV, after encountering stiff objections to the deal from  European antitrust regulators.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history, and relinquishing it is a strategic retreat for the Atlanta-based company. A deal would have strengthened  UPS's global reach, bringing new operational mass to its delivery business outside Asia and the U.S.

UPS revised its €5.2 billion proposal—which was announced last March—three times in a bid to overcome concerns from the European Commission, and still wasn't satisfying the demands.

The regulator was worried the overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. The regulator also worried that other
parcel-delivery companies, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp., could be shut out of the market.
Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal being approved.

The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile transactions to be challenged by Europe's antitrust regulator. In February, the commission rejected a $17 billion merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse AG. In September, Universal Music Group agreed to sell many treasured record labels to win approval for its $1.9-billion purchase of rival EMI Group Ltd.

The commission is due to announce its decision by Feb. 5, but UPS said after a meeting with the regulator that it expects the commission to block the deal.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

The news surprised UPS employees; they had been executing plans to bring TNT into the fold right up until they discovered the deal had fallen apart, according to a person familiar with the situation.

UPS had hoped that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator. The assets' proposed buyer, parcel-delivery company DPD, is controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here, while UPS and TNT see a wide spectrum of service providers competing and putting competitive pressure on the merging parties and others in the market."

Although the commission had taken an uncompromising stance on the need for a new rival to be created out of the merger, its officials appeared surprised by UPS's statement that it didn't expect the deal to be cleared.

A person familiar with the commission's thinking said it had sought binding guarantees that DPD could fill the gap in the marketplace and that it wanted this anchored in a contract, as some of the last concessions put forward

PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder with nearly 30%, said it plans to sell its stake, assuming the deal with UPS doesn't proceed.
TNT's shares fell amid news of UPS's decision to call off its takeover attempt. The stock fell 41% to €4.84 in
Amsterdam on Monday on Monday. PostNL shares sank 36% to €1.82, also in Amsterdam. Shares in UPS rose
1.7% to $79.24 at 4 p.m. Monday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand-alone strategy, which we presented in February," Chief Executive Bernard Bot said in a telephone interview on Monday.
European Commission officials declined to comment, saying only that they would issue their official verdict by
Feb. 5.

UPS drops bid to buy TNT Express

United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) has abandoned its $6.9-billion (€5.2-billion) attempt to acquire Amsterdam-based TNT Express NV (TNTE). The Dutch firm is the second-largest package delivery firm in Europe and also has operations in emerging markets.

UPS initiated the bid last March to better compete in  Europe with the continent’s largest-package delivery operation,  Deutsche Post’s DHL.  UPS wanted to buy TNTE both for its  European network and its assets in Asia and Latin America, Reuters reported.

UPS announced yesterday that the European Commission (EC) had “informed UPS and TNTE that it is “working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition of TNTE” as it determined the takeover would make the business sector less competitive by reducing the number of players serving it.

TNTE stated that on January 11, it and UPS “met with EC’s case team investigating the proposed acquisition… The case team informed the companies that on the basis of UPS’s current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision.”

Responding to the EC’s concern,  UPS had offered to sell parts of the company’s small package operations and airline assets, as reported by the Associated Press.

Rival firms FedEx and DHL had both lobbied the EC to stop the takeover, a banking source told Reuters. However, UPS and TNTE failed to secure buyers and the planned asset sales were  not enough to satisfy European Union officials.

“One of the key sticking points to the proposed UPS/TNTE deal falling through was that UPS/TNTE were not able to find a buyer for certain assets that needed to be sold off in order to meet the EC's competition requirements,” pointed out analyst  Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Co. He also said that “UPS, the most likely buyer of those assets, did not get involved and indirectly helped the deal fall through.”

Although UPS must pay TNTE a $265.5-million (€200-million) termination fee, the European firm remains on shaky ground. The news caused to its share price to fall at one point yesterday by 50% before closing 42% lower.

In a statement, TNTE said it “regrets this situation, having believed the merger was feasible and beneficial for all stakeholders.” The company also said the “protracted merger process has been a distraction for management” and that “management will provide an update on its strategy in due course.”

“We are extremely disappointed with the European Commission’s position,” said UPS CEO D. Scott Davis in a statement. “We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission’s concerns with the transaction.

“The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular,” Davis added.

TNT Express shares slump 40% after Europe blocks  UPS takeover

Shares in TNT Express slumped by more than 40% yesterday as rival  United Parcel Service dropped its $6.8bn (pounds 4.2bn) bid for the company after the  European competition authorities said they would probably block the deal.

The share price fall cost investors around euros 1.6bn, despite  UPS paying TNT a euros 200m break fee following its withdrawal. The shares closed at euros 4.81 after slumping from euros 8.24.

The US delivery giant said it was unrealistic to hope that the European commission would give clearance after the authorities said on Friday they were likely to prohibit the deal.

UPS agreed to buy TNT last March, marking the first major bet by a US company on Europe since the region's debt crisis intensified last year. The move was designed to put UPS ahead of competitors such as FedEx, as it would strengthen its position in Europe and globally.

But European competition authorities soon said they would investigate the deal, which they feared would cut the number of competitors from four to three and lead to a highly concentrated market.

UPS revised the deal twice but it appears the amendments were not enough. Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive, said: "We are extremely disappointed with the commission's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies."

TNT shares, which were briefly suspended when the market opened, initially fell by as much as 50% to euros 4, compared with the UPS offer price of euros 9.50 a share.

MERGERS : COMMISSION SCUPPERS UPS-TNT DEAL

Plans for a merger between United Parcel Service (UPS), world leader in express delivery services, and its
Dutch competitor  TNT Express, number two in Europe, have been dropped.

TNT Group put out a statement on 14 January, announcing that, at an 11 January meeting, the European Commission informed the parties that it would block the €5.16 billion deal. "UPS has informed TNT Express that it sees no realistic prospect that the  European Commission clearance can be obtained and that it will not pursue
the transaction on any other basis," announced the Dutch group. The statement added that "TNT Express regrets this situation, having believed that the merger was feasible and beneficial for all shareholders". The firm's share price plummeted by 50% on the Amsterdam exchange following the announcement.

The EU executive, due to competition concerns in the area of international express services where the parties would have held very large combined market shares, opened an in-depth investigation on 20 July 2012 into TNT's proposed takeover of UPS, launched on 19 March (see Europolitics 4471). It feared an excessive concentration that would be detrimental to direct customers and ultimately to European consumers. For the Commission, the market in question is made up of only four firms that control a global air and ground network for small parcel delivery in Europe and beyond: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. The merger of two of these companies could stifle competition by cutting the number of players down to three. Given FedEx's small market share in Europe, DHL would be the only really credible competitor on this market. UPS challenged that view, arguing that the European market is made up of tens of competitors, including parcel delivery firms, forwarding agents and national express delivery firms. However, to dispel the EU executive's fears and in response to the objections it spelled out last November (4515), UPS had offered to sell certain assets, stipulating that some could not be bought by FedEx or DHL. These included TNT subsidiaries in 16 EU member states, including Spain and Portugal

The refusal in early January by the American group FedEx to take over part of these assets was apparently decisive to the collapse of the deal. FedEx is said to have refused to enter into firm talks unless the offer covered a larger share of TNT's activities (4560). The French firm DPD, a subsidiary of La Poste, was being mentioned as a possible buyer but several experts say that the Commission did not consider it a serious applicant because it lacks an air transport network and would have had to rely on UPS or DHL.

UPS will consequently have to pay TNT Express €200 million, an amount agreed contractually by the two parties in the event the bid was withdrawn.

Merger of UPS and TNT fails in face of EC opposition

Royal Mail received a much-needed boost yesterday when United Parcel Services, the world's largest courier company, dropped a €5.2bn (£4.3bn) takeover bid for its Dutch rival,  TNT Express, after it became clear that a tie-up would be blocked by  European regulators.

The pullout saw TNT's shares halve in value, with industry experts questioning the company's future despite the fact it is the market leader in Europe.

A combined UPS and TNT would have held 35 per cent of the UK parcels market and been a formidable competitor to Royal Mail. It is believed that UPS suggested selling parts of the merged group to Royal Mail in a bid to circumvent the European Commission's competition concerns.

Royal Mail's privatisation grew closer in November when the postal group said its half-year pre-tax profit had risen by 12 per cent to £115m. Towards that end, chief executive Moya Greene has been pushing Royal Mail's parcels arm and express delivery - where a united TNT-UPS would have offered stronger competition - to promote its commercial future. Royal Mail is thought to be worth up to £3bn if floated on the stock market, making it the
largest privatisation since the Government sold off the railways in the 1990s.

The Government took over Royal Mail's giant pension fund last year, with £28bn of assets and £38bn in liabilities transferred to the state. UPS had wanted to buy TNT to help it expand in the faster-growing Asian and Latin American markets using the Dutch firm's networks.
UPS will pay TNT a fee of €200m for breaking the deal.

But that will be little compensation for the business, which made losses of €3m in the third quarter of 2012 on revenues of €1.8bn. The TNT chief executive, Marianne-Christine Lombard, quit in September, part-way through the bid. She could have pocketed a €2.6m bonus if the deal had gone through.

UPS had made a number of offers to the EC, including selling off parts of the small packets business, but a commission meeting made clear the deal would be blocked.

UPS had offered a number of concessions to the EC in the hope of securing approval, such as selling off parts of its small packets business and opening up the two carriers' airline networks to rivals.

5.   United Parcel Service (UPS) gave up its nearly $7 bil bid for Dutch rival  TNT Express due to opposition by European regulators. The global shipping giant had twice revised its offer, but the  European Commission still said it could hurt competition.  UPS rose 2% to a 5-month high. FedEx (FDX), which had opposed the deal, hit its best level since May '08, closing up 1%.

UPS takeover of TNT Express collapses.

The proposed €5.2 billion takeover of Dutch delivery group  TNT Express by UPS has collapsed after the
European Commission indicated it would block the deal.

The news sent shares in  TNT Express down precipitously in Amsterdam trading as the nine-month courtship appeared all but over, marking one of the biggest transactions that the commission has ruled against.

Although UPS sees no realistic prospect of the deal being cleared, formal termination of the agreement with TNT Express will occur once Brussels has officially blocked the deal.

UPS had been scrambling to put in place a package of remedies to win approval, which involved selling a portfolio of assets across Europe and giving it rights to buy space on the UPS airline. – (Copyright the Financial Times Limited 2013)

Failed UPS Delivery Leaves TNT in Lurch

Returned to sender. United Parcel Service has ditched its plan to buy  TNT Express for $6.8 billion, after objections from Europe's competition authorities. The  European Commission demanded concessions including asset sales to build up another freight rival, making an already expensive deal unviable.

UPS will pay a 200 million euro ($266.9 million) break fee to TNT. But that is small comfort for the Dutch company, whose shares plunged 41% on Monday. Unless TNT quickly finds a convincing new strategy, more falls may lie ahead.

Regulators were worried the deal would cut the number of major firms offering both air and ground parcel delivery in Europe from four to three: DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx.

Cutting its losses after nine months of negotiation seems sensible for UPS. Its 9.50 euro-a-share offer already was a near-50% premium to TNT's pre-deal share price.

But the real problems now lie with TNT. Led by interim Chief Executive Bernard Bot, the company has delayed plans to cut costs and find partners for its ailing Brazilian and Chinese businesses, pending the UPS tie-up. Its operating income fell by 26% in the first nine months of 2012. Lower prices have put pressure on its European business, where it makes two-thirds of its revenue.

An alternative bidder seems unlikely. FedEx is already going through its own cost-saving program and may not want to run the commission's competition gantlet.

That leaves potential for more declines for TNT's stock. Analysts have been slow to update forecasts given little company guidance: TNT's earnings per share could be 0.18 euros in 2013, versus consensus at 0.32 euros, RBC Capital Markets says. At a 14 times earnings multiple, in line with peers, that would value TNT at about 2.50
euros, a further 47% fall.
That isn't the kind of parcel investors like to find on their doormats. Subscribe to WSJ:  http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires

UPS Quits Takeover in Europe
By Robin van Daalen, Vanessa Mock and Betsy Morris
788 words
15 January 2013
The Wall Street Journal

English

United Parcel Service Inc. abandoned a nearly $7 billion bid for Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV, after encountering stiff objections to the deal from  European antitrust regulators.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history, and relinquishing it is a strategic retreat for the Atlanta-based company. A deal would have strengthened  UPS's global reach, bringing new operational mass to its delivery business outside Asia and the U.S.

UPS revised its 5.2 billion euro proposal -- which was announced last March -- three times in a bid to overcome concerns from the European Commission, and still wasn't satisfying the demands.

The regulator was worried the overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. The regulator also worried that other
parcel-delivery companies, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp., could be shut out of the market.
Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal being approved.

The deal is the latest in a series of high-profile transactions to be challenged by Europe's antitrust regulator. In February, the commission rejected a $17 billion merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. In September, Universal Music Group agreed to sell many treasured record labels to win approval for its $1.9-billion purchase of rival EMI Group Ltd.

The commission is due to announce its decision by Feb. 5, but UPS said after a meeting with the regulator that it expects the commission to block the deal.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

The news surprised UPS employees; they had been executing plans to bring TNT into the fold right up until they discovered the deal had fallen apart, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Once the commission's decision is announced, UPS said it will pay TNT a 200 million euro ($267 million)
termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval after a preliminary antitrust review.

UPS had hoped that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator. The assets' proposed buyer, parcel-delivery company DPD, is controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here."

Although the commission had taken an uncompromising stance on the need for a new rival to be created out of the merger, its officials appeared surprised by UPS's statement that it didn't expect the deal to be cleared.

A person familiar with the commission's thinking said it had sought binding guarantees that DPD could fill the gap in the marketplace and that it wanted this anchored in a contract, as some of the last concessions put forward earlier this month by UPS were "too complex" to be tested thoroughly prior to any commission decision on the deal.
Page 71 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"The commission spelled out during the meeting on Friday what it needed," the person said. "Maintaining competition in the express delivery sector was key. And there was still willingness to find a way forward." However, UPS didn't move to meet those demands, the person said.

FedEx is unlikely to offer its own bid, people close to the company said. The Memphis-based rival to UPS has said it wasn't interested, believing the deal to be too pricey, they said.
FedEx officials declined to comment.

UPS offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL NV in 2011 under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target. PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder with nearly 30%, said it plans to sell its stake, assuming the deal with UPS doesn't proceed.
TNT's shares fell 41% to 4.84 euros in Amsterdam on Monday. PostNL shares sank 36% to 1.82 euros. UPS rose
1.7% to $79.24 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand-alone strategy," Chief Executive Bernard Bot said.

The abandoned bid of US-based  United Parcel Service (UPS) for Dutch TNT Express should have brought welcome relief to French national courier La Poste and its unit Chronopost as the buyer had unhidden ambitions to grow in France, Les Echos said today.
La Poste has declined to comment on the deal, which was abandoned on an expected ban by the  European
Commission (EC).

However, the failed deal marks also a missed opportunity for the French group, which was willing to enhance its international positions by acquiring some of the assets of UPS and TNT Express put up for sale in return for the EC's nod on the deal.

(AE) COMPETITION: UPS drops TNT takeover bid fearing European Commission refusal

Brussels, 14/01/2013 (Agence  Europe) - American courier company United Parcel Service (UPS) announced on 14 January that it has dropped its takeover bid for its Dutch rival TNT Express, because the European Commission told both companies that it would oppose the deal in its current format (a Commission spokesperson said the official decision would be taken on 5 February).

On 19 March 2012, UPS announced a €5.16 billion takeover bid for its rival and, on 20 July, the Commission launched a detailed investigation into the plans (see EUROPE 10661), taking the view that the merger could reduce competition for courier services. By buying up TNT, UPS would become the biggest logistical and parcels delivery company in Europe, reducing the number of companies combining air and land parcel delivery and a
wide range of connected services from four to three (the other two being DHL and Federal Express). UPS offered a number of remedies, including the sale of assets, to win the Commission's approval, but the Commission says that gaps in the Fedex distribution network would have made UPS-TNT and DHL the only companies operating
on different markets. (FG/transl.fl)

UPS drops E5.2bn TNT bid ahead of EU veto

zz Share fall wipes e2bn off value of Dutch delivery firm

United Parcel Service (UPS) would drop its e5.2 billion (R60bn) bid for Dutch delivery firm  TNT Express, the world's largest package delivery company said yesterday.
This was due to the expectation of an EU veto, a sharp blow that halved the value of TNT's shares within minutes. US-based UPS had sought to buy the Dutch firm to gain access to its European network and business in
fast-growing Asia and Latin America.

The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market and will have trouble regaining market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS.
The plunge in its share price wiped more than e2bn off its value.

UPS would also have to adjust to the loss of opportunity, said Philip Scholte at Rabobank. "This is going to make it hard for UPS to increase its position in Europe on its own."

UPS and TNT said the European Commission, the EU's executive body, had told the two firms it was working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, leaving them no choice but to abandon it.

"UPS will pay TNT a termination fee… of e200 million and will withdraw the offer," once the formal decision is taken, UPS said yesterday.

The commission declined to comment. European Commission competition policy spokesman Antoine Colombani said the decision would be taken in "due time" with a deadline of February 5.
TNT has been forced to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in
Brazil, and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer.
TNT shares fell to e4.051 yesterday morning, compared with the UPS offer price of e9.50 a share.

"This is a big disappointment of course. The market had discounted the shares slightly below the offer price, but everyone had thought they would be able to work something out," Scholte said.

After focusing on the deal for nearly a year, TNT will have to find a new boss and set out a new business plan. The deal was initially expected to close in the third quarter of 2012.
TNT said it would give an update on its strategy in due course. A new merger seems unlikely, at least in the short term.
Its closest European rival, Deutsche Post's DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get European approval for an acquisition.

"America's FedEx is the only other option and they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid," Maarten Bakker, an analyst at ABN Amro, said.

The US delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," said Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular," Davis added.

Shares in PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay a dividend, also plunged by a third on the news. - Reuters

FedEx unlikely to pursue TNT -- Decision  to build European business organically paying off

Analysts deemed it unlikely FedEx Corp. would move to buy  TNT Express in the wake of rival  United Parcel       Service's withdrawn bid for  Europe's No. 2 delivery company.

The collapse of the UPS-TNT deal, while removing a cloud from  UPS' profit outlook, added luster to FedEx's approach of growing European business organically and through strategic acquisitions, they said.

I think it vindicates the FedEx management team completely, said analyst Donald Broughton, who covers the parcel delivery industry for Avondale Partners LLC.

FedEx has said for years that there's nothing in the TNT Express franchise that they could not build for less than it would cost them to buy, Broughton added. TNT's falling share price since the acquisition announcement proves that point.

Helane Becker, analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co., said in a research bulletin, FedEx is one of the few companies with the balance sheet to pull off a deal, but in the past stated it did not want to participate in the transaction.

She added, We do not expect FedEx to pursue TNT Express at this time as management is focused on tuck-in acquisitions in Europe. In addition, management is working on its $1.7 billion cost reduction program.

Since UPS announced plans to buy TNT last year, FedEx has closed purchases of delivery companies in France and Poland. TATEX is a leading French business-to-business transportation company. Opek Sp. z o.o. operates a domestic ground network in Poland.

FedEx also added stations in Europe, opened new FedEx Trade Networks freight forwarding offices and invested in new aircraft to serve Europe better.
Broughton didn't think the timing of the acquisitions was related to the UPS-TNT deal.

FedEx continues to make the investments they make and the acquisitions they make based on their own internally driven strategy, not based on anything the UPS guys may or may not be doing, he said.
They've had this point of view on (TNT) for a decade, and this completely vindicates this point of view. As a result of UPS dropping the bid, Broughton upgraded UPS stock from a sell rating to a hold rating. Analysts had criticized the UPS-TNT deal as unrealistic given Europe's regulatory and economic climates.
UPS has spent the last six months focused on trying to get this done, and now they've got to pay a $265 million penalty of shareholder wealth they might as well have flushed down the toilet, Broughton said.

FedEx share prices have kept pace with the larger market's gains since last summer, while UPS shares have lagged, he said.

The UPS-TNT deal began to unravel after European regulators said in October it would lead to overconcentration in the sector and UPS tried unsuccessfully to sell off parts of the small package operations and airline assets.


Page 79 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
After meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was extremely disappointed with the stance taken by regulators on what would have been his company's largest-ever acquisition.

We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction, he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth particularly in Europe.
The European Commission will publish its review of the failed deal within several weeks. Includes information from The Associated Press.

UPS abandons $6.9B deal for  TNT Express

UPS scrapped plans to grow in  Europe through the acquisition of Dutch delivery company  TNT Express because
European regulators were getting ready to reject the $6.9 billion deal. It would have been the largest acquisition
in UPS history. UPS had offered in March to buy  TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better
compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. Regulators objected, saying the deal would reduce
competition in the market for express delivery of small packages in  Europe. UPS said Monday that it had
proposed “tangible remedies,” but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, the Atlanta company told  TNT it saw
no prospect of the deal being approved.
Samsung sells 100M Galaxy Ss

Samsung Electronics Co. said Monday that global sales of its Galaxy S smartphones passed 100 million units since the first model in the series was released less than three years ago. Samsung said it has sold more than 25 million Galaxy S smartphones, 40 million Galaxy S II smartphones and 41 million Galaxy S III smartphones. Samsung introduced the first Galaxy S model at the end of May 2010, scrambling to catch up with Apple, which was reshaping the market with the iPhone. But Samsung was quick to narrow the gap with bigger smartphone makers. Research firm IHS iSuppli said last month that Samsung beat Nokia in cellphone sales and Apple in smartphone sales last year.
Abarta newspaper group for sale

Abarta, a diverse holding company based in Pittsburgh, has put its Press Media Group up for sale, the company said Monday. Included in the planned sale is The Press of Atlantic City, a daily newspaper that Abarta has owned for 60 years, along with other newspapers. John Bitzer III, CEO of the fourth-generation, family-held enterprise, said in a statement that the paper was profitable but subject to “certain growth constraints.” The Press Media Group publishes five other weekly, Sunday and monthly publications. In addition, Abarta owns interests in the beverage, frozen-food, energy and technology sectors.
Bath Fitter, Cabinet World merge

Two of Pittsburgh-area home improvement companies merged, reuniting individuals who formed one of them. Bath Fitter of Pittsburgh acquired the operations of Cabinet World in December, bringing together the founders of Cabinet World. Frank Witkowski, who with Sam Lucci are co-owners of Bath Fitter, now are re-united with Larry Lucci of Cabinet World. He is one of the three Lucci brothers who with Witkowski began Cabinet Warehouse, which later became Cabinet World in 1980. Terms of the merger were not disclosed. Bath Fitter employs 38 to 44 employees and is in the process of opening showrooms in Canonsburg, Center and a yet-to-be determined location in the North Hills. The business expect sales of more than $8 million this year.

Abarta, a diverse holding company based in Pittsburgh, has put its Press Media Group up for sale, the company said Monday. Included in the planned sale is The Press of Atlantic City, a daily newspaper that Abarta has owned for 60 years, along with other newspapers. John Bitzer III, CEO of the fourth-generation, family-held enterprise, said in a statement that the paper was profitable but subject to “certain growth constraints.” The Press Media Group publishes five other weekly, Sunday and monthly publications. In addition, Abarta owns interests in the beverage, frozen-food, energy and technology sectors.
Cabinet World, Bath Fitter merge

Two of Pittsburgh-area home improvement companies merged, reuniting individuals who formed one of them. Bath Fitter of Pittsburgh acquired the operations of Cabinet World in December, bringing together the founders of Cabinet World. Frank Witkowski, who with Sam Lucci are co-owners of Bath Fitter, now are re-united with Larry Lucci of Cabinet World. He is one of the three Lucci brothers who with Witkowski began Cabinet Warehouse, which later became Cabinet World in 1980. Terms of the merger were not disclosed. Bath Fitter employs 38 to 44 employees and is in the process of opening showrooms in Canonsburg, Center and a yet-to-be determined location in the North Hills. The business expect sales of more than $8 million this year.

UPS drops E5.2bn TNT bid ahead of EU veto

zz Share fall wipes e2bn off value of Dutch delivery firm

United Parcel Service (UPS) would drop its e5.2 billion (R60bn) bid for Dutch delivery firm  TNT Express, the world's largest package delivery company said yesterday.
This was due to the expectation of an EU veto, a sharp blow that halved the value of TNT's shares within minutes. US-based UPS had sought to buy the Dutch firm to gain access to its European network and business in
fast-growing Asia and Latin America.

The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market and will have trouble regaining market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS.
The plunge in its share price wiped more than e2bn off its value.

UPS would also have to adjust to the loss of opportunity, said Philip Scholte at Rabobank. "This is going to make it hard for UPS to increase its position in Europe on its own."

UPS and TNT said the European Commission, the EU's executive body, had told the two firms it was working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, leaving them no choice but to abandon it.

"UPS will pay TNT a termination fee… of e200 million and will withdraw the offer," once the formal decision is taken, UPS said yesterday.

The commission declined to comment. European Commission competition policy spokesman Antoine Colombani said the decision would be taken in "due time" with a deadline of February 5.
TNT has been forced to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in
Brazil, and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer.
TNT shares fell to e4.051 yesterday morning, compared with the UPS offer price of e9.50 a share.

"This is a big disappointment of course. The market had discounted the shares slightly below the offer price, but everyone had thought they would be able to work something out," Scholte said.

After focusing on the deal for nearly a year, TNT will have to find a new boss and set out a new business plan. The deal was initially expected to close in the third quarter of 2012.
TNT said it would give an update on its strategy in due course. A new merger seems unlikely, at least in the short term.
Its closest European rival, Deutsche Post's DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get European approval for an acquisition.

"America's FedEx is the only other option and they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid," Maarten Bakker, an analyst at ABN Amro, said.

The US delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," said Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular," Davis added.

Shares in PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay a dividend, also plunged by a third on the news. - Reuters

UPS abandons  $6.9 billion deal to buy TNT Express

NEW YORK — UPS scrapped plans to grow in  Europe through the acquisition of Dutch delivery company  TNT
Express because European regulators were getting ready to reject the $6.9 billion deal.
It would have been the largest acquisition in  UPS history.

United Parcel Service Inc. had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. Regulators objected, saying the deal would reduce competition in the market for express delivery of small packages in Europe. UPS said Monday that it had proposed "tangible remedies," but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, the Atlanta company told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators.

Analysts said UPS could still pursue smaller acquisitions and also might boost its dividend or take some other action to reward shareholders.
TNT shares plunged 42 percent in Europe. Although it will receive a $265.5 million breakup fee from UPS, TNT
faces an uncertain future on its own.
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

UPS had earmarked $5 billion in cash for the purchase of TNT. Sterne Agee analyst Jeffrey Kauffman said he expected the company to now use some of that for dividends or share buybacks. He said UPS could also pursue smaller acquisitions, especially in Asia.

Jim Corridore, equity analyst for S&P Capital IQ, said UPS can still "build a stronger network in Europe through smaller acquisitions and internal growth."

Before UPS jumped in, some analysts thought rival FedEx Corp. might make an offer for TNT, but FedEx executives said in March they had no plans to do so.

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE: UPS abandons  TNT acquisition: European regulators' concerns about
competition doom $6.77 billion deal.

UPS is walking away from its planned $6.77 billion purchase of a Dutch delivery company after  European
regulators said they would not approve the deal because of concerns about competition.

The TNT Express deal was initially viewed as a good one for  UPS, which would have expanded its ground network and supply chain in  Europe. But as the  European Commission delayed its decision, then delayed it again --- and as the commissioner responsible for competition spoke out about his concerns with the deal --- the acquisition came to be seen as less likely.

UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday that the Sandy Springs company is "extremely disappointed" with the European Commission's position, saying the combination "would have been transformative" for the logistics industry and supported growth in Europe.
It would have been UPS's biggest acquisition ever, by far. Now, UPS will pay a $267.4 million termination fee to
TNT.

While experts said the acquisition made strategic sense for UPS, they also said its failure ultimately will not be detrimental. As the approval process got drawn out, it became more likely UPS would have to make major concessions in order to prevail, said Ben Hartford, a senior research analyst with Robert W. Baird

"It was becoming a distraction," he said. "It's disappointing they didn't get the deal done. It doesn't change the fabric of the company."
While TNT's stock price plummeted 41.3 percent after the deal fell through, UPS' rose 1.7 percent. "Our success in Europe does not depend on TNT," said Peggy Gardner, a UPS spokeswoman.
Gardner said the concessions UPS offered to the Commission "changed a rather large amount" between the initial offering in November and the third one earlier this month, but would not detail what UPS had offered in order to complete the deal. UPS said it had proposed "tangible remedies," but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, it told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

The Commission's primary concern, Gardner said, was the unlikelihood that a new, equal competitor would come in to the market. Deutsche Post's DHL is the largest delivery company in Europe, and its chief competitors are UPS, TNT and FedEx. The Commission has not yet released its decision, but has a Feb. 5 deadline to do so.

UPS is able to grow in Europe on its own, but acquiring TNT would have eliminated a competitor and created an easier path to growth, said Doug Caldwell, the vice president of international for AFMS.
Caldwell said UPS "clearly underestimated" the level of opposition to the deal, which was announced last March.

U.S. analysts don't expect FedEx to reconsider in the near-term because it's in the midst of a major restructuring of its express air cargo service. FedEx declined to comment.

UPS Drops Bid for Delivery Firm TNT
By Robin van Daalen and Vanessa Mock

AMSTERDAM --  United Parcel Service Inc. of the U.S. said Monday that it will abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company  TNT Express NV after encountering unexpectedly stiff objections to the deal from the  European Commission.

The acquisition would have been the biggest in  UPS's 105-year history. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, is due to announce its decision on Feb. 5. UPS pre-empted the decision, saying after a meeting with the regulator on Friday that it expects the commission to block the deal.

Once the commission's decision is announced, UPS said it will pay TNT a 200 million euro termination fee. UPS had originally expected to receive approval for the deal, which was first announced last March, after a preliminary antitrust review.

Atlanta-based UPS revised its takeover proposal three times in a bid to overcome the commission's concerns that the overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. The regulator also worried that other parcel-delivery companies, including U.S. rival FedEx Corp., could be shut out of the market.
Both DHL and FedEx lobbied against the deal being approved.

UPS was hoping that a plan to sell some of its assets, together with some TNT assets, to DPD, a parcel-delivery company controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator.

"The commission and the merging parties had two very different visions of the logistics industry," said David Anderson, a Brussels-based partner at law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner. "The commission has identified only four integrators in the market, and two of those were merging here, while UPS and TNT see a wide spectrum of service providers competing and putting competitive pressure on the merging parties and others in the market."

The commission's stance on the UPS-TNT deal echoes its objection to the $17 billion merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext last year, largely because it was worried about the combined companies' dominant position in the exchange-traded derivatives market.

But it approved Universal Music Group's $1.9 billion takeover of EMI Group Ltd.'s recorded-music division in September, before giving the conditional go-ahead to the $32 billion mining-industry merger involving Glencore International PLC and Xstrata PLC in November.

"We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position," said UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction."

UPS and TNT officials said they were surprised by the commission's position. UPS could have appeased the regulator by selling European assets to FedEx, but the U.S. company showed no interest in doing that.

UPS offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT, which was split from Dutch postal company PostNL NV under pressure from shareholders who argued the express business would be an interesting acquisition target.
PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder with nearly 30%, said it plans to sell its stake, assuming the deal with UPS
doesn't proceed.

TNT's shares plunged in Amsterdam amid news of UPS's decision to call off its takeover attempt. The stock fell
41% to 4.84 euros on Monday. PostNL shares sank 36% to 1.82 euros, also in Amsterdam.

TNT said it would pursue a future as an independent company. "Now we'll focus on our stand-alone strategy, which we presented in February," Chief Executive Bernard Bot said Monday.

Commission officials declined to comment, saying only that they would issue their official verdict by Feb. 5. FedEx officials weren't immediately available to comment.

FedEx
Collapse of UPS deal to buy TNT seen as vindication of FedEx strategy

Analysts deemed it unlikely FedEx Corp. would move to buy  TNT Express in the wake of rival  United Parcel       Service's withdrawn bid for  Europe's No. 2 delivery company.

The collapse of the UPS-TNT deal, while removing a cloud from  UPS' profit outlook, added luster to FedEx's approach of growing European business organically and through strategic acquisitions, they said.

"I think it vindicates the FedEx management team completely," said analyst Donald Broughton, who covers the parcel delivery industry for Avondale Partners LLC.

"FedEx has said for years that there's nothing in the TNT Express franchise that they could not build for less than it would cost them to buy," Broughton added. TNT's falling share price since the acquisition announcement
proves that point.

Helane Becker, analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co., said in a research bulletin, "FedEx is one of the few companies with the balance sheet to pull off a deal, but in the past stated it did not want to participate in the transaction."

She added, "We do not expect FedEx to pursue TNT Express at this time as management is focused on tuck-in acquisitions in Europe. In addition, management is working on its $1.7 billion cost reduction program."

Since UPS announced plans to buy TNT last year, FedEx has closed purchases of delivery companies in France and Poland. TATEX is a leading French business-to-business transportation company. Opek Sp. z o.o. operates a domestic ground network in Poland.

FedEx also added stations in Europe, opened new FedEx Trade Networks freight forwarding offices and invested in new aircraft to serve Europe better.
Broughton didn't think the timing of the acquisitions was related to the UPS-TNT deal.

"FedEx continues to make the investments they make and the acquisitions they make based on their own internally driven strategy, not based on anything the UPS guys may or may not be doing," he said.
"They've had this point of view on (TNT) for a decade, and this completely vindicates this point of view." As a result of UPS dropping the bid, Broughton upgraded UPS stock from a "sell" rating to a "hold" rating. Analysts had criticized the UPS-TNT deal as unrealistic given Europe's regulatory and economic climates.
"UPS has spent the last six months focused on trying to get this done, and now they've got to pay a $265 million penalty of shareholder wealth they might as well have flushed down the toilet," Broughton said.

FedEx share prices have kept pace with the larger market's gains since last summer, while UPS shares have lagged, he said.
The UPS-TNT deal began to unravel after European regulators said in October it would lead to
over-concentration in the sector and UPS tried unsuccessfully to sell off parts of the small package operations
and airline assets.

After meeting with regulators Jan. 11, UPS told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved — and it wasn't interested in further concessions.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators on what would have been his company's largest-ever acquisition.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," he said, adding that the deal would have benefited customers worldwide and supported economic growth "particularly in Europe."
The European Commission will publish its review of the failed deal within several weeks. Includes information from The Associated Press.

FedEx tipped to bid for TNT Express

FedEx was today widely tipped as a possible future bidder for TNT Express as media and experts around the world analysed the implications of the failed €5.2 billion deal with UPS.

Analysts highlighted the strategic challenges now facing  TNT Express, pointed to FedEx as the only potential realistic other buyer for the Dutch company and speculated that  UPS would now seek to grow in  Europe through small acquisitions instead.

All three companies were staying tight-lipped following yesterday’s announcements by UPS and TNT that the European Commission was expected to oppose the €5.2 billion deal, prompting UPS to abandon the takeover plan. UPS said yesterday it will withdraw its offer once the Commission formally makes its decision, which is due by a February 5 deadline, and will pay TNT the termination fee of €200 million.

Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive, told the Financial Times: “We are going to take the time to work on updating our strategy and come back in due course.” The company, which will release Q4 and 2012 results on February 18, presented a strategy entitled ‘Building on Strengths’ in February 2012, shortly after rejecting UPS’ initial offer and one month before agreeing to a higher offer. This strategy revolved around focusing on the core business in Europe, reducing costs and seeking partners for the loss-making businesses in Brazil and China.

Several analysts quickly speculated that FedEx might be tempted to make a move for TNT, although possibly waiting first for several months to see how the company’s fortunes fared. Analyst Maarten Bakker, of ABN Amro, told Reuters: "FedEx is the only other option. And they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid." Kevin Sterling, of BB&T, told Bloomberg: “At the end of the day, TNT needs a suitor. TNT is struggling both operationally and financially. FedEx is in a good position just to wait this out and let TNT come to them.” The news agency also cited an unnamed source as saying that FedEx might consider an offer for TNT but would not overpay.

On UPS’ options, Helane Becker, a New York-based analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co., told Bloomberg: “They will probably look to doing smaller tuck-in acquisitions or growing in Europe on their own. Not as rapidly as the TNT Express acquisition would have done, but the growth is there.”

Deutsche Post DHL quickly ruled out any theoretical move for TNT. CFO Larry Rosen told Reuters in New York: "We're pursuing an organic growth strategy, so we are not interested in acquisitions of any kind in the express business, including TNT."

0727 GMT [Dow Jones] Citigroup downgrades  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) to neutral from buy, as it doesn't expect the stock to recover in the near term.  TNT slumped 41% Monday after UPS (UPS) dropped its bid for the express company after encountering stiff objections to the deal from the European Commission. Citigroup says  TNT is challenged by tough market conditions in  Europe, although the company has tackled some of its problems in Brazil and Asia. "We believe rebuilding needs radical action and urgent execution," it says, adding it expects management to give a strategy update in early April. "A signal of intent would be an exit from materially
loss-making Brazil." Citigroup slashes target to EUR5.11 from EUR9.50. Shares closed at EUR4.84 Monday. (maarten.vantartwijk@dowjones.com)

0744 GMT [Dow Jones] Rabobank upgrades  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) to buy from hold, describing the heavy losses on Monday as "overdone." After the failed acquisition by  UPS (UPS), investors should now focus on  TNT's standalone future as FedEx (FDX) isn't likely to make a counterbid, it says. Says  TNT should now refocus on its strategy by implementing a EUR150 million cost-cutting program in  Europe that was delayed pending the  UPS deal. "This huge savings target...can provide ample compensation for a weak  European economy," it says. In addition, a solution for  TNT's troubled operations in Brazil could also positively impact earnings. "In our view, this leaves valuation attractive after the excessive share price drop." Cuts target to EUR6 from EUR9.50. Shares closed at EUR4.84 Monday. (maarten.vantartwijk@dowjones.com)

1310 GMT [Dow Jones] RBC Capital Markets upgrades  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) to sector perform from underperform, but cuts its price target to EUR5 from EUR8. This follows news that the  EU Commission is likely to block the company's takeover by  UPS (UPS). Notes TNT is likely to receive a EUR200M break fee from UPS should the deal be formally prohibited. Says the price target reflects scope for mid-cycle margin in Europe of 8%, with upside to a price target of EUR7 if 10% margin can be achieved. Sees short-term risk of existing
transaction-focused shareholdings rotating out of the shares, and while future strategy remains unclear, new potential shareholders may remain wary. Shares climb 4.6% to EUR5.07, after sharp losses of 41% Monday. (peter.nurse@dowjones.com)

SNS says PostNL vulnerable on failed TNT-UPS merger

(SeeNews) - Jan 15, 2013 - The cancellation of the  TNT-UPS merger has left Dutch mail firm PostNL (AMS:PNL)
vulnerable, analysts of SNS Securities said.

TNT Express (AMS:TNTE), the Dutch express delivery firm in which PostNL owns some 30%, said Monday
US-based United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) would abandon its takeover due to the expected prohibition of the
deal by the European Commission (EC).

According to the Dutch brokerage, PostNL's gross debt burden feels now heavier than before. SNS lowered its stock recommendation on PostNL to "accumulate" from "buy" and the share price target to EUR 3 from EUR 5.85.
Shares in PostNL traded at EUR 1.86, up 2.5%, at 1243 CET in Amsterdam on Tuesday. (EUR 1.0 = USD 1.337)

UPS abandons  $6.9 billion deal for TNT Express

UPS abandons $6.9 billion deal for  TNT Express

UPS scrapped plans to grow in  Europe through the acquisition of Dutch delivery company  TNT Express because
European regulators were getting ready to reject the $6.9 billion deal.
It would have been the largest acquisition in UPS history.

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. Regulators objected, saying the deal would reduce competition in the market for express delivery of small packages in Europe. UPS said Monday that it had proposed "tangible remedies," but after meeting with regulators on Jan. 11, the Atlanta company told TNT it saw no prospect of the deal being approved.

UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday that he was "extremely disappointed" with the stance taken by regulators.

Analysts said UPS could still pursue smaller acquisitions and also might boost its dividend or take some other action to reward shareholders.

TNT shares plunged in Europe. Although it will receive a $265.5 million ((euro) 200 million) breakup fee from UPS, TNT faces an uncertain future on its own. The 42 percent drop in its share price wiped off nearly (euro) 2 billion from its market value.
The European Commission, which would not comment, must publish its review of the deal by Feb. 5. Chicago-area RTA: United runs 'sham'
CHICAGO -- A transportation agency on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging that United Airlines is falsely claiming to buy huge amounts of jet fuel out of a small, rural Illinois office that doesn't even have a computer to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes in Chicago, where the purchases are allegedly being made.

The Regional Transportation Authority alleges United Aviation Fuels Corp., a subsidiary of United Airlines, has operated a "sham" office in the DeKalb County community of Sycamore since 2001 after reaching an agreement to pay the town more than $300,000 a year -- a fraction of what it would have owed in sales taxes in Chicago and Cook County.

"The only reason that United Fuels has an office in Sycamore is to attempt to create a sham tax situs [location] for fuel sales in a lower taxing jurisdiction," reads the lawsuit that the RTA said it filed Monday morning.
United officials say they have not seen the lawsuit, but that the Sycamore operation is legal. "We buy fuel in
Sycamore," spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said in an email.

The RTA, which contends the office has no computer and is staffed by one person who only works part time, said consultants visited the site on a recent weekday and found it locked with nobody inside. The agency said judging from the few chairs and empty desks seen through a window, there is little, if any, business occurring in the office.
Swatch in $1B deal for Harry Winston
GENEVA -- Switzerland's biggest watch maker, Swatch Group AG, will pay about $1 billion to acquire Canada's
Harry Winston watch and jewelry brand, officials from both companies said Monday.
Page 102 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
The Biel, Switzerland-based company has agreed to pay $750 million to acquire the brand from Toronto-based
Harry Winston Diamond Corp. and will also assume as much as $250 million in debt, a joint statement said.

The acquisition includes the Harry Winston production company in Geneva and more than 500 employees globally.

Swatch Group's chairwoman, Nayla Hayek, said the addition of a jewelry-watch brand "brilliantly complements the prestige segment" of Swatch's portfolio, helping it compete against luxury watch makers.

Harry Winston Diamond Corp.'s chairman, Robert Gannicott, said his company, which supplies rough diamonds to the global market, would change its name to Dominion Diamond Corporation.
Gym to close

SARATOGA SPRINGS -- High Rock Sports and Fitness on High Rock Avenue will close at the end of the month, according to Roohan Realty, owner of the building.

Amy Sutton of Roohan Realty said the space, which is a fitness gym, is available for lease. When the gym first opened in 2005 it was called Global Fitness.

UPS drops E5.2bn TNT bid ahead of EU veto

zz Share fall wipes e2bn off value of Dutch delivery firm

United Parcel Service (UPS) would drop its e5.2 billion (R60bn) bid for Dutch delivery firm  TNT Express, the world's largest package delivery company said yesterday.
This was due to the expectation of an EU veto, a sharp blow that halved the value of TNT's shares within minutes. US-based UPS had sought to buy the Dutch firm to gain access to its European network and business in
fast-growing Asia and Latin America.

The collapse of the deal is particularly damaging for TNT, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market and will have trouble regaining market share, believed to have been eroded during the talks with UPS.
The plunge in its share price wiped more than e2bn off its value.

UPS would also have to adjust to the loss of opportunity, said Philip Scholte at Rabobank. "This is going to make it hard for UPS to increase its position in Europe on its own."

UPS and TNT said the European Commission, the EU's executive body, had told the two firms it was working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition, leaving them no choice but to abandon it.

"UPS will pay TNT a termination fee… of e200 million and will withdraw the offer," once the formal decision is taken, UPS said yesterday.

The commission declined to comment. European Commission competition policy spokesman Antoine Colombani said the decision would be taken in "due time" with a deadline of February 5.
TNT has been forced to cut capacity in Europe in response to falling demand, was hit by restructuring problems in
Brazil, and is considered a minor player in China. Its chief executive quit soon after UPS made its offer.
TNT shares fell to e4.051 yesterday morning, compared with the UPS offer price of e9.50 a share.

"This is a big disappointment of course. The market had discounted the shares slightly below the offer price, but everyone had thought they would be able to work something out," Scholte said.

After focusing on the deal for nearly a year, TNT will have to find a new boss and set out a new business plan. The deal was initially expected to close in the third quarter of 2012.
TNT said it would give an update on its strategy in due course. A new merger seems unlikely, at least in the short term.
Its closest European rival, Deutsche Post's DHL, is bigger in Europe and would be unlikely to get European approval for an acquisition.

"America's FedEx is the only other option and they are not going to be in any hurry because there is simply no rival bid," Maarten Bakker, an analyst at ABN Amro, said.

The US delivery company had offered various concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, including a proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission's concerns with the transaction," said Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, expressing disappointment at the decision after months of talks.

"The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular," Davis added.

Shares in PostNL, TNT's biggest shareholder, which had been counting on using proceeds from the deal to pay a dividend, also plunged by a third on the news. - Reuters

U.P.S., Facing Resistance  in Europe, Drops Bid for TNT Express

United Parcel Service is withdrawing its $6.9 billion takeover offer for the Dutch shipping company TNT Express , after European authorities indicated they would block the deal over antitrust concerns

The failure of the deal is a blow to U.P.S.'s expansion efforts. The acquisition of TNT Express , which would have been the largest in the 105-year-history of U.P.S., would have given it a larger presence in Europe and the emerging markets.

The failure also leaves TNT vulnerable. It has reduced operations across Europe amid the sluggish economy and has had setbacks in emerging economies like Brazil and China.
"The European Union 's decision is very disappointing," said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy Research in
Dublin. "It's hard to see the company being bought by anyone else."

Shares in TNT Express fell 41 percent, to 4.84 euros, or $6.46, on Monday. U.P.S. had offered 9.50 euros a share for TNT.
U.P.S. rose 1.7 percent on Monday, to $79.24. Some investors had worried that such a merger would distract
U.P.S., especially as it sought approval from the European Commission .

The commission has been willing to flex its antitrust muscle. Last year, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse called off their $9.2 billion merger, after regulators demanded that the two exchange operators sell significant parts of their businesses.

Other deals have passed muster only with major changes. In approving Universal Music Group 's takeover of EMI Music last year, European regulators required the sale of a third of EMI's assets.

U.P.S. and TNT, which announced the deal last March, had been in negotiations with European regulators for months. Regulators worried that a merger would effectively create two main players in the European shipping market, U.P.S. and DHL.

To allay antitrust concerns, U.P.S. had agreed to sell some business units and to grant rivals access to part of its airline network. U.P.S. had tried to convince regulators that selling assets to the French shipping company DPD would help bolster the rival, creating a sizable competitor. TNT Express also said it would sell its airline operations.
Since November, U.P.S. revised its bid three times.

But the changes did not appease regulators. Late last week, regulators informed both companies that they would not approve the multibillion-dollar takeover. While European officials have until early February to rule officially, U.P.S. opted to pre-emptively withdraw its offer for TNT.
"We are extremely disappointed with the European Commission 's position," D. Scott Davis , the chief executive
of U.P.S., said in a statement. "We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European
Page 108 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Commission 's concerns with the transaction." U.P.S. must pay a termination fee of 200 million euros, or $267 million, to TNT Express .

With U.P.S. backing away, TNT's future looks uncertain. After a tough 2011, it has improved modestly, gaining in revenue and profit through the first three quarters of last year. But TNT, which has large operations across Europe, would need a large injection of investment to expand globally, analysts said.

FedEx , which has a much smaller operation in the region than U.P.S., could be a potential suitor. But a deal with the European shipping giant DHL probably would also raise antitrust concerns.

U.P.S. must now go to Plan B in Europe. In a research note on Monday, analysts at Credit Suisse predicted that the company would continue to invest in the region and increase the size of a planned share buyback plan.
U.P.S. said it would look for opportunities to grow organically and through acquisitions. For instance, it could seek smaller acquisitions in peripheral European countries that would not raise antitrust concerns.

U.P.S. Goldman Sachs , Lazard and the law firm Allen & Overy advised TNT Express and its supervisory board.

U.P.S. abandons  Dutch takeover;  E.U. antitrust authorities told shipping groups  that deal would be
opposed

United Parcel Service announced on Monday that it would withdraw its $6.9 billion takeover offer for  TNT Express , a Dutch shipping company, after the  European antitrust authorities told the companies that they would block the deal.

The announcement is a blow to U.P.S.’s expansion beyond the United States, as the purchase of  TNT Express would have given the U.S. company a larger presence in  European and emerging markets.

Since announcing the deal last March, U.P.S. had faced difficulties with European regulators, who feared that the takeover would hamper competition.

To appease antitrust concerns, U.P.S. had agreed to sell a number of business units and to grant access to some of its airline network to rivals. TNT Express also said it would sell its own airline operations as part of the antitrust concessions.

U.P.S had been in negotiations with European regulators since November but was told late last week that its proposed concessions did not meet the authorities’ demands. The company had tried to convince regulators that selling assets to the French shipping company DPD would create enough competition to satisfy regulatory concerns.

The competition authorities at the European Commission informed both companies that they would not approve the multibillion-dollar takeover, according to separate statements from U.P.S. and TNT Express on Monday. European officials have until early February to rule officially on the proposed takeover.

‘‘We are extremely disappointed with the European Commission ’s position,’’ U.P.S.’s chief executive, D. Scott Davis , said in a statement. ‘‘We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the European Commission ’s concerns with the transaction.’’

The deal is the largest failed takeover since the European aerospace giants BAE Systems of Britain and European Aeronautic Defense & Space , or EADS — the parent of Airbus — ended talks on their proposed $45 billion merger in October after politicians and shareholders balked at the deal.

The decision against U.P.S.’s takeover of TNT Express also is the latest move by the European competition authorities to thwart multibillion-dollar deals that they believe are not in consumers’ interest. Last year, the stock exchange operators NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse called off their planned $9.2 billion merger after European antitrust regulators opposed the deal.

The failure to reach an agreement comes at a difficult time for TNT Express , which has reduced its operations across Europe and faces a series of setbacks in emerging economies like Brazil and China. While the Dutch company has large operations across Europe, analysts say it would need a large injection of investment to expand globally.

Potential buyers could include the U.S.-based shipper FedEx , whose European business is smaller than that of U.P.S., while a deal with the European shipping giant DHL would raise too many antitrust concerns, according to analysts.

Shares in TNT Express plunged 41.3 percent, closing at €4.84, or $6.47, in Amsterdam on Monday. U.P.S., up
1.7 percent in afternoon trading in New York, had offered €9.50 for each share. The stock price of PostNL , the
largest shareholder in TNT Express , closed down 35.9 percent, at €1.82, in trading on Monday.
‘‘The European Union ’s decision is very disappointing,’’ said Stephen Furlong, an analyst at Davy Research in
Dublin, who rates TNT Express as underperform. ‘‘It’s hard to see the company being bought by anyone else.’’

After failing to win regulatory approval, U.P.S. has agreed to pay a €200 million termination fee to TNT Express , according to a statement from U.P.S.

The takeover would have been U.P.S.’s largest acquisition in the company’s 105-year history, according to the data provider Capital IQ. A company spokeswoman said the company would continue to look for opportunities to grow organically and through acquisitions.

Morgan Stanley , UBS , Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer were advisers to U.P.S., while Goldman Sachs , Lazard and the law firm Allen & Overy advised TNT Express and its supervisory board.
U.S. regulators have also recently blocked mergers on antitrust grounds. For example, the U.S. Justice
Department opposed AT&T ’s $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA .

But the European Commission ’s antitrust office, led by Joaquín Almunia, has displayed an aggressive approach that has rankled some deal makers.

Mr. Almunia himself has acknowledged those concerns, even as he has sought to rebut them. In a speech in November, he argued that he was not trying to prevent European companies from growing. Instead, he said he was trying to preserve a competitive marketplace. The European Commission , he said, was less concerned about high concentrations of market share than what mergers might do to prices.

Other deals have passed review, but some have required significant changes. In approving Universal Music Group ’s takeover of EMI Music last year, for example, European regulators required the sale of a third of EMI’s assets. The decision has led to the auction of music labels like Parlophone, the home to artists like Coldplay and David Guetta .

LGT-UPS withdraws merger bid for TNT Express

United Parcel Service announced to abandon its planned EUR5.2 bn ($7 bn) acquisition of Dutch  TNT Express after the European Commission informed the two companies that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed takeover.

The world’s largest package delivery company, was seeking to gain access to Dutch group’s European network and business in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.

Atlanta-based UPS had proposed various ‘significant and tangible’ concessions in a bid to win EU regulatory approval for its bid, Chairman and Chief Executive Scott Davis commented. ‘The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular,’ Davis said. The collapse of the merger is a blow for TNT Express, which has struggled to turn around in a weak European market. UPS will have to pay TNT a termination fee of EUR200 m. While shares of UPS closed 1.3% higher, TNT Express slumped 41%.

TEXT-S&P removes PostNL 'BBB' rating from watch pos; outlook neg
945 words

(c) 2013 Reuters Limited
Rationale

The rating actions reflect the announcement, by Netherlands-based courier, express, and parcels company  TNT Express N.V., that U.S.-based United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) sees no realistic prospect that the sale of PostNL's share in  TNT Express to UPS will gain European Commission clearance on the current terms, and that UPS will not pursue the sale on revised terms. Consequently,  UPS plans to withdraw its offer to buy PostNL's share in TNT Express when the  European Commission delivers its anticipated formal decision to prohibit the sale, which is due by Feb. 5, 2013.

PostNL was planning to sell the 29.8% share it owns in TNT Express to UPS for a cash consideration of EUR1.54 billion. It was also planning to use part of the proceeds to reduce its net debt to EUR300 million-EUR500 million. Since the sale is unlikely to proceed, we no longer see any potential for PostNL to improve its financial risk profile from our current assessment of "significant" in the short term. Such improvement would have depended on
PostNL achieving Standard & Poor's-adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt of 45%, on a sustainable basis. While this no longer appears feasible, we understand that PostNL still plans to monetize its stake in TNT Express in the medium term, although we have no visibility on whether it would be able to achieve a comparable offer to that from UPS.

Furthermore, we consider that PostNL's business risk profile is under persistent pressure from the weak economic environment in The Netherlands and from the company's participation in the European mail industry, which continues to be subject to a structural volume decline. This decline, along with fierce competition and relatively high labor costs, has placed pressure on PostNL's profitability and has led the company to restructure its mail business in The Netherlands. We note that this is a complex program of change and that the effects of reorganization have been more extensive than we originally anticipated. In addition, we note that the volumes of
addressed mail in The Netherlands declined more in the third quarter of 2012 than we previously anticipated, and we forecast a continued decrease in mail volumes. If a rate of decline similar to that in the third quarter persists, and the pressure on the company's profitability continues, this could weigh negatively on our current assessment of the company's business risk profile as "strong".
Liquidity

The short-term rating on PostNL is 'A-2'. We view PostNL's liquidity as "strong" under our criteria, reflecting our calculation that the company's sources of liquidity exceed its uses by 1.5x or more over the next 24 months. We anticipate that net liquidity sources would remain positive even if EBITDA were to decline by 30%. We understand that PostNL has well-established, solid relationships with banks, and a high standing in the credit markets.
Liquidity sources to September 2013 are:

-- About EUR398 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30, 2012, of which about EUR50 million are restricted;
-- A EUR570 million undrawn committed revolving credit facility due May 2016. Uses of liquidity to September 2013 include:
-- About EUR50 million of negative unadjusted FFO under our base-case forecast for 2012, including EUR84 million in top-up payments to pension funds, to be paid in December 2012;
-- Our forecast of working capital needs of about EUR45 million;
Page 115 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
-- Capital expenditures of about EUR200 million; and
-- About EUR60 million of debt maturities.

We note that debt maturities in 2013 and 2014 are immaterial. PostNL's next significant maturity falls due in 2015 when a EUR400 million bond matures.
Outlook

The negative outlook reflects our view that PostNL might be not able to maintain its ratings-commensurate business risk profile amid difficult operating conditions stemming from the weak economic outlook, the structural volume decline in The Netherlands' mail market, and the resulting pressure on the company's profitability.

Moreover, negative rating pressure could arise if PostNL adopts a more aggressive financial policy, thereby weakening its credit metrics to levels below those we consider commensurate with a "significant" financial risk profile. We consider a ratio of adjusted FFO to debt of more than 25%, on a sustainable basis, as commensurate with the current rating.

We will look to update our views after PostNL's release of its year-end 2012 results and our review of its business and financial strategies--in particular, the aggressiveness of its discretionary spending, and its earnings and cash flow prospects.

Moody's  confirms Aa3 rating of UPS on anticipation of steady performance; outlook stable
2,514 words
16 January 2013
Moody's Investors Service Press Release
MOODPR
English
(c) 2013
Moody's Investors Service confirmed its Aa3 Senior Unsecured debt rating assigned to  United Parcel Service, Inc. ("UPS"). The ratings confirmation reflects Moody's belief that  UPS' current operations will continue to generate significant free cash flow and that the company will remain prudent in managing its cost structure, investment spending and financial profile even as it continues to return incremental funds to shareholders. The rating action follows the company's announcement on January 14, 2013 that it expects the  European Commission ("EC") to prohibit its proposed acquisition of  TNT Express, N.V. ("TNT", Baa2, rating under review up). Once formalized, the  EC's decision will prevent completion of one of the transaction's closing conditions. According to UPS, this will cause it to withdraw its offer. Moody's also affirmed the P-1 short-ratings assigned to UPS and UPS Global Treasury Plc. The short-term ratings had not been under review. The outlook is stable.
RATINGS RATIONALE

Today's rating action resolves the review for downgrade initiated on March 19, 2012, upon the announcement that UPS had reached an agreement to purchase all of the equity of TNT in an all cash transaction that valued TNT's equity at about $6.8 billion. UPS was to fund the purchase with cash on hand and some commercial paper,
limiting expected increases in funded debt or leverage. The TNT acquisition would have bolstered UPS' global reach, with particular benefits in international express, particularly in Europe and international small package delivery including in Asia, Australia and South America.

The Aa3 Senior Unsecured rating considers that even without the TNT acquisition UPS maintains a formidable global competitive position, and benefits from strong business fundamentals, a solid liquidity profile and
consistent free cash flow generation. Absent the acquisition spending for TNT, Moody's believes that UPS is likely to return to a higher level of annual share repurchases; however, the company is not expected to utilize
debt-funding for repurchases. UPS has considerable resources, a superior competitive position and an enduring franchise typical of other Aa-rated companies. "We expect UPS to adapt its networks and operations to help maintain margins and cash flow generation as lower-yielding B2C packages account for an increasing share of total volume in upcoming periods," said Moody's Senior Credit Officer, Jonathan Root. "With no catalyst for stronger growth in global economic activity, Moody's believes that shippers are likely to continue trading down to deferred air or ocean freight services to help stretch their freight budgets," continued Root. This trend will require additional focus on the network to further support financial results.

On a fully-adjusted basis, Debt to EBITDA is indicative of a lower rating. Moody's adjustments to debt for its estimate of potential obligations for underfunding of multi-employer pension plan (MEPP) obligations constrain certain credit metrics, particularly Debt to EBITDA and EBIT to Interest. Moody's adds over $12 billion to adjusted debt and over $600 million to interest expense for the MEPP obligation, which is the main driver of the increase in Debt to EBITDA. This adjustment increases debt to EBITDA by almost a full turn and reduces EBIT to Interest by more than four turns. Additionally, the decline in market interest rates in 2012 is likely to increase underfunding of UPS' single-employer plan at the December 31, 2012 measurement date.
The stable outlook considers UPS' significant cost and investment flexibility, which should help it maintain
earnings and cash flows over economic cycles. The rating could be lowered if funds from operations to debt using
UPS' measurements is sustained below the lower end of the company's target of 50% to 60%. A significant
ratcheting up of annual share repurchases, perhaps to levels exceeding $3.0 billion or that require incremental
debt funding would likely lead to a negative rating action, as would any development, including acquisition activity,
that results in sustaining Debt/EBITDA above 2.7 times, EBIT to Interest below 6.0 times or Retained Cash Flow
to Debt below 18%. The rating could also be negatively affected by the failure to maintain a strong liquidity profile.
There is no upwards pressure on the rating at this time. Since electing a more leveraged business profile after the
exit from the Central States MEPP in late 2006, any upgrade would likely require a revision in UPS's policies that

Page 117 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
would lead to a more than $5 billion decrease in funded debt, which would likely be achieved only with an 18 to
24 month holiday from share repurchases, which Moody's does not expect.

Antitrust chief of European Union gets tough on mergers

Copyright (c) 2013 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.
BRUSSELS -- Joaquin Almunia, the  European Union's antitrust chief, is starting to look like a tough guy as he prepares to block a third merger in his tenure, fine Microsoft and extract concessions from Google.

United Parcel Service decided to scrap the biggest deal in its history after concluding it couldn't do more to convince the 64-year-old to approve the 5.16 billion-euro ($6.9 billion US) bid for  TNT Express. Last year, he crushed another trans-Atlantic deal: Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext's plan to create the world's biggest exchange.

"Deutsche Boerse and UPS to me send a signal that the European Commission is getting tougher on mergers," said Alasdair Balfour, a London-based lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson. "Almunia's commission is willing to dig in its heels and stand its ground. And it's not just a question of negotiating the extent of the
remedies, they're willing to say here's what you have to do and if you don't, we'll block it."

Three years into his term, Almunia, has already axed as many deals as Dutch predecessor Neelie Kroes. He's blocked the plans of Aegean Airlines to merge with unprofitable Olympic Air in Greece and is now vetting a resurrected bid by Ryanair Holdings to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus Group. The Spanish socialist, who lost a bid to
be his country's prime minister in 2000, has said he's resisted calls to soften European Union merger scrutiny and would ensure that companies' efforts to consolidate don't trample on consumers.

Still, he rejects being labelled as tough, pointing to the hundreds of deals he's approved. "I've already blocked two in three years and this is to be very tough?" Almunia told reporters in Bruges, Belgium, on Monday. "How many have I cleared? A lot! Hundreds!"

Almunia also points to statistics that minimize the European Union's record of blocking mergers. Regulators have blocked only 22 deals out of 4,600 reviews, he said last month.

Competition-abuse cases also fall under Almunia's remit and he may seek more from Google than his American counterparts in similar probes into whether the world's biggest search engine company discriminates against rivals.

He told Google last month to submit concessions to eliminate concerns over its search results that could allow the European Union to settle the case without fines. U.S. regulators ended their probe earlier this month, saying there was insufficient evidence that Google's actions harmed consumers.

Almunia, who is from Bilbao, Spain, has also warned Microsoft that he will decide on fines as soon as this month over its failure to comply with a settlement to give users a choice of Web browsers.
While he is on track to block more deals than Kroes, he is still behind other predecessors such as Karel Van
Miert, who blocked nine in the 1990s, and Mario Monti, who pulled the plug on eight deals during his stint from
1999 to 2004.

Monti, now Italy's prime minister, in 2001 stopped the proposed $47 billion acquisition of Honeywell by General Electric. That decision stoked a clash with U.S. regulators, with then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill describing the decision as "off the wall."

Page 123 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"It's a huge step for the commission to prohibit deals and I don't think that's really what they're in the business to do," said David Anderson, a lawyer at Berwin Leighton Paisner LLP in Brussels.

Some lawyers say Almunia may have been trying to extract more concessions from UPS to ensure a competitive parcel delivery industry in the 27-nation European Union.

"I'm sure that they would much rather have been able to fashion a remedy which would have allowed the deal to go through but still maintain competition in the markets," said Anderson.

The Brussels-based commission "is very rigorous," said Anderson. UPS and TNT made a "strong case too but couldn't be reconciled."

The more recent merger bans are "a reflection of the deals we are seeing today" where there's a tough trading environment, too much capacity and a need for consolidation, said Matthew Hall, a lawyer at McGuire Woods LLP in Brussels.
"As a result of these two prohibitions you're likely to be more cautious," said Balfour, referring to the Deutsche
Boerse and UPS vetoes.

TNT Express has been plagued by managerial and operational issues, and with the latest blow coming in the form of a dead merger with  UPS, the company will continue to lose market share, but will otherwise “muddle along,” according to an analysis by BB&T Capital Markets.
DHL, UPS and FedEx will continue to make inroads against the  European integrator.

Analysts for BB&T don’t anticipate FedEx jumping in to try for TNT Express, after the European Commission privately rejected the merger, for a number of reasons. FedEx, the analysts wrote, has its own cost-cutting and restructuring issues, and the company might be wary of the European Commission after its dealings with UPS. Finally, BB&T thinks FedEx will focus on capital expenditures to replace older planes in its network.

DHL isn’t a possible match, according to BB&T, because the integrators are too similar. Plus, EC scrutiny in any deal between the two European companies could be just as stringent as the failed UPS deal.

“TNT faces an uphill battle to try to restructure, but will most likely keep losing market share to the big three and could eventually be driven out of business,” the analysts wrote. “However, before the final nail is in the coffin, parts of the company may be sold off.”

If parts of TNT are disassembled, the analysts wrote, FedEx or DHL might be interested in TNT’s ground network, among other portions of the company.

UPS has emerged from the debacle relatively unscathed and in a good position for growth, according to BB&T. The analysts expect UPS to report it has seen solid growth in all four segments during this last quarter. The integrator will continue to grow its healthcare segment and expand its reach in China, Latin American, Vietnam and India.

Ultimately, pulling out of the deal before the European Commission’s ruling officially came down was a good decision, the analysts wrote. Paying the $267 million termination fee won’t seem like that big of a hit in the long run.

“Withdrawing the company’s bid, despite the termination fee, shows the magnitude of the obstacles that UPS perceived it was faced with to make the deal work,“ the analysts wrote. “At the end of the day, we applaud management for walking away from a process that had become too onerous and ultimately not as profitable for shareholders as originally thought.” -  Jon Ross

DJ European Commission Refused To Grant UPS Extra Time to Satisfy Concerns

AMSTERDAM--The  European Commission refused to provide United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) with more time to resolve antitrust concerns about its proposed acquisition of TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE), after it raised concerns about the viability of the proposed purchaser of the remedy package and the lack of a binding deal, according to a TNT spokesman.

On Monday UPS said it would abandon a 5.2 billion euro ($6.9 billion) bid for smaller Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express, after the commission had told the U.S. firm it was working on a decision to block the deal.

"The EC's case team communicated on Friday [Jan. 11] that it still had serious concerns about the viability of the proposed purchaser and that no legally binding documentation for the divestment of the assets was yet available," a spokesman for TNT said. UPS asked the EC to give it more time to resolve the concerns and reach a binding deal, but the EC's case team said it couldn't suspend the process and was working towards a decision to block
the deal based on their concerns, he added.

A spokeswoman for the European Commission said Friday that "a decision will be announced by Feb. 5," and refused to further comment.

UPS revised its proposal to overcome concerns from the European Commission several times, but couldn't satisfy demands from the EC. The commission was worried the overnight-parcel-delivery market in Europe would effectively become a duopoly between the combined UPS-TNT business and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG.

UPS had hoped that a plan to sell some assets to DPD, a parcel-delivery company controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator.

A person familiar with the commission's thinking said earlier this week that some of the last concessions put forward earlier this month by UPS had been filed "too late" and were "too complex" to be thoroughly tested prior to any commission decision on the deal.

"On 3 January 2013, UPS submitted a revised remedy proposal, involving a preferred purchaser of the divestments," the TNT spokesman said, declining to identify the proposed purchaser.

There's "Definitely Life After UPS for TNT"
By Digby Larner

Investors in Dutch parcel-delivery company  TNT Express had a tough start to the week when United Parcel Servicepulled its 5.2 billion euro ($7 billion) yearlong bid for the company, causing  TNT shares to plunge 41% by Monday's market close.

The good news is that it could now be an opportune time to buy TNT stock (ticker: TNTE.Netherlands). With the UPS (UPS) takeover premium gone, investors are left wondering what TNT will do next. Some fund managers and analysts say the company could do quite a lot.

Says Daniel Pasini, a portfolio manager with London-based ACPI Investment Managers: "The market in Europe will continue to be challenging, but given [TNT's] exposure to Asia Pacific and Brazil, the overall market situation, long term, is not too bad."

He views TNT stock as undervalued and expects it to trade near its pre-UPS-bid level for now. "Once operations in emerging markets start to turn around, upside should be more meaningful." he adds.

Several other analysts share Pasini's view. Some were penning upgrades even before the dust settled on UPS's surprise withdrawal, born of delays due to European regulators' antitrust concerns.

TNT CAN NOW IMPLEMENT a strategic plan it put on hold nearly a year ago when UPS made its approach. To show it can survive independently, TNT promises to refocus on its core European business. It also plans to review its operations in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil, part of an expansion plan that had upset some shareholders.

Third-quarter operating income rose in TNT's Asia-Pacific region, despite faltering demand in some countries there. Its Brazilian business remains in the red, but isn't an obvious disposal candidate. Analysts say TNT's leading 20% market share in Brazil means that earnings eventually could be strong there.

The Dutch company sold its Indian business a couple of months before UPS made its bid. But shareholders had wanted more. They had been putting TNT under pressure to make strategic changes or consider being sold months before the UPS bid.

The resumed strategy includes €150 million in cost cuts by 2013. This has led Rabobank analyst Philip Scholte to raise his rating on the stock to Buy from Hold, even though he cut his price target, from €9.50 to €6.00. The stock has been trading below €6. His rationale: "We believe this huge savings target can provide ample compensation for a weak European economy."

TNT was spun off from Dutch mail company PostNL (PNLYY) in 2011, but it suffered a series of profit warnings as loss-making emerging-markets businesses dented its European earnings.
Kepler Capital Markets analyst Andre Mulder cut his TNT price target to €6.50 from €7 following the UPS
withdrawal, but he sees upside potential of 30%. He argues that there is "definitely life after UPS for TNT."

TNT's big strength is in Europe, where its operations account for around 60% of its overall sales. Despite its current troubles, the European market is growing by up to 5% a year, Mulder says. That compares with a mature

Page 130 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
U.S. market, which is static at best and could even be shrinking. He reckons that the Dutch delivery company's profit margin in Europe, before interest and taxes, could rise over time to 10% from around 6%-7% now.

The European market's allure has prompted speculation that FedEx (FDX) could step in to buy TNT, particularly as the collapsed deal means that TNT remains the smallest of the world's main express-delivery companies. However, ACPI's Pasini says FedEx is unlikely to make a bid, as it could suffer the same antitrust concerns that finished off the UPS offer. And FedEx has been growing satisfactorily in Europe without acquisitions.

PERHAPS HARDEST HIT by the failed UPS bid is PostNL, which still owns a hefty 30% of TNT. Its stock slid almost 36% on the day the UPS pullout was announced. Pasini warns that PostNL doesn't have enough cash flow from operations to cover debt coming due in 2015. "The underlying business is not attractive, as mail volumes continue to have negative growth," the analyst adds. "Over all, this stock will behave like TNT. If TNT goes up, Post should move higher with a higher beta."

On the downside, the stock overhang from the PostNL stake, which it said it now plans to "monetize"—meaning sell—over the medium term, could take some of the shine off TNT stock for now.

TNT closed at €5.46 Friday, down almost 34% on the week, while PostNL fell just over 37% in the same period to end at €1.78.

Europe firms not easy to acquire:  UPS fails to win regulatory approval.  Nationalistic concerns increase in
bad worldwide economy.

In a global economy, the best growth opportunities may be abroad. But companies looking to acquire their way into international expansion face as many challenges as ever when it comes to taking on businesses outside their home country.

Last week, Sandy Springs-based UPS walked away from its $6.77 billion purchase of the Dutch package delivery firm TNT Express, saying it expected European regulators to reject the bid in spite of multiple attempts to shape the purchase to their liking.  UPS already has a substantial presence in  Europe, but the addition of  TNT would have strengthened its ability to move packages across the continent.

With the economy in Europe still on shaky ground, those regulators are paying more attention than ever to competition issues, particularly those that could result in jobs lost to foreign firms.
The nationalistic concerns, though increased, are not new.

"It is reemphasized by what we've just seen," said Stuart Johnson, managing partner of the Atlanta office of law firm Barnes & Thornburg. "There are political dynamics where there is sensitivity to a local company being bought out by a foreign competitor. The European Union is sensitive to these types of issues."

In 2011, eight proposals merited increased scrutiny from European regulators, twice the number that were more heavily scrutinized in 2010, said Jeffrey Golman, vice chairman and head of investment banking for Mesirow Financial in Chicago. Since 1989, the European Commission has blocked 22 acquisitions.

"They're taking a more assertive posture," Golman said. "There's clear evidence that there is more scrutiny being given. You can see that simply in the number of more in-depth reviews."
Other reviews have also had reverberations for Atlanta companies:

Last year, the European Commission rejected Deutsche Boerse's planned $10 billion merger with NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. That paved the way for Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, to make an $8.2 billion bid for NYSE Euronext in December. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.

In 1999, Coca-Cola eliminated 22 European markets from its purchase of Cadbury Schweppes' brands because of antitrust concerns, although it made the acquisition in 161 other countries outside the United States.

The biggest challenge to such purchases is the size of the companies involved, said Kevin Sterling, senior vice president of equity research for BB&T Capital Markets. Although buying smaller companies across Europe would take more time than acquiring a large business such as TNT, it would also mean companies like UPS would avoid regulatory scrutiny because competition concerns would be lessened.

Because the European Commission cares more about the level of competition than the effect on the consumer, concerns over the UPS merger should have been expected, analysts and legal experts said. Without TNT, the number of large package carriers would go from four to three, with UPS taking an even larger share of the market.
Page 132 of 142 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
"Frankly, they care more about large companies growing larger than the U.S. does," Troutman Sanders partner Brinkley Dickerson said of the European Commission. "It doesn't surprise me that there was regulatory reluctance to let it (UPS) get larger."

Although making piecemeal acquisitions may be more difficult on paper, in the end, it may prove easier to accomplish, Johnson said. In addition to issues of culture and borders, more sellers are demanding high breakup fees to protect themselves if the deals do not go through in light of several high-profile mergers that did not make it past regulators.

Sterling said he thinks as merger and acquisition activity picks up internationally, it will do so on a smaller scale in order to avoid pitfalls like the ones UPS faced. UPS itself may slow its European activity in response to the protracted process, which has dragged out since March, and will cost the company a $267.4 million termination fee.

"They might be gun-shy for a while," he said. "They spent a lot of time, effort and resources to get TNT done, and it didn't happen. They're probably tired."
UPS' inability to consummate the merger will not have a large impact on its business, though it will mean that TNT
will remain as a competitor and the company's growth will be slower. UPS still intends to expand in Europe.

The company will not "do an about-face on strategy" regarding its plans to grow on that continent, UPS spokeswoman Peggy Gardner said. In lieu of a single large acquisition, UPS will look for ways to expand internally across the European base it already has, or buy small companies there.
"We never stop," Gardner said. "We're always thinking about strategy and what makes sense."

Still, UPS Chairman and CEO Scott Davis said in a statement Monday that the company is "extremely disappointed" with the European Commission's rejection.
Sterling and others said UPS underestimated the level of attention the purchase was likely to receive.

That will not affect the company's business, but it is a black eye for a corporation that is used to getting what it goes after, Sterling said.

With the economic downturn, and an interest in keeping local headquarters and local jobs, countries are becoming more protectionist, said Ben Barkley, a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. Particularly when it comes to businesses that are seen as strong national brands, there is a desire to keep them out of foreign hands.
Other businesses looking at large mergers should expect a higher level of scrutiny, Golman said.

"They have to go into those things with their eyes open," he said. "This is what companies are going to have to be taking into account."

Who? Royal Mail

Why? The postal service received a much-needed boost after United Parcel Services dropped its €5.2bn (£4.3bn) takeover bid for Holland's  TNT Express. The deal, which would have handed UPS 35pc of Britain's postal market, collapsed after it became clear that it would have a very tough time getting past European regulators.

What next? Royal Mail has been pushing its parcels and express delivery arm, which is precisely the part of the business that a projected UPS-TNT tie-up would have hit the hardest. The decision to drop the deal will leave Royal Mail free to keep pursuing that strategy, ahead of its planned privatisation.

Couriers/Messengers
Delivery companies report limited  delays despite severe weather across northern Europe
CEP-Research, UK media

Heavy snowfalls have caused delays to flights and parcel deliveries across parts of northern  Europe today and over the past few days, with UK operations reported to be the most severely affected, although the major UK parcel operators said they were continuing to operate pick-up and delivery services to most areas.

East Midlands Airport (EMA), a UK hub airport for DHL Express,  UPS and TNT Express, was closed last night, but reopened at 14.00 today. At the time of writing, Norwich, Leeds Bradford and Robin Hood Doncaster airports remained closed, while other UK airports were experiencing varying degrees of flight disruption.

Long-haul hub airport Heathrow said around 10 per cent of its flights had been cancelled today, an improvement on the 20 per cent cancellation level yesterday. Stansted Airport, used by FedEx as a UK air express hub, was said to be “open and operational”, while the other main southern English airport, Gatwick, was said to be operating as normal, although expecting some delays from disruption at other airports.

A UPS spokeswoman told CEP Research that the company had responded to the closure of EMA by redirecting flights from its main Cologne European hub “to alternative UK airports, and used its UK road network to get packages to their intended destination”. She added: “UPS’s integrated air and ground network is highly flexible, allowing us to be responsive to adverse conditions, including airport closures.”

A DHL Express spokesman told CEP-Research that it had re-routed one of its EMA flights last night, and that a couple of flights had experienced delays, although the closure at EMA had happened during the relatively quiet weekend period for express operators, limiting the impact of the closure.

UPS said the situation across Europe was “very fluid”, with conditions changing constantly. The UPS spokeswoman added: “While the severe weather that parts of Europe are experiencing is resulting in some service delays, the vast majority of shipments are being picked up and delivered on time. The biggest impact is being experienced in the UK.”

She said UK customers should refer to the current service updates at the UPS UK website, adding: “UPS is doing its utmost and has contingency plans in place to ensure that customers receive their parcels as soon as possible.” UPS’s UK website reported that severe snow and ice conditions were causing collection and delivery disruptions throughout parts of the UK, and that although UPS was “making every reasonable attempt to ensure our customers receive their packages on time”, many shipments would not be collected or delivered due to the hazardous road conditions, listing specific post code areas that were currently affected.

UK Mail reported that heavy snowfalls and freezing temperatures over large parts of the UK, which continued over the weekend and into today, meant that driving conditions were hazardous and that some roads remained closed. “Whilst most main routes are fairly gritted and clear, conditions in the side streets and residential areas just off those main routes remain challenging for our drivers,” the company said. “In most cases, these streets have not been gritted and it is difficult to get all the way to the delivery point.”

UK Mail said it had prepared its operations well in advance of severe weather and was “taking every step to maintain service provision throughout the country. This included working fully over the weekend in any affected areas to provide service. Currently, that planning has proved successful with only isolated postcodes experiencing any delay, these mostly being due to the inaccessibility.”
The company said specific postcode disruption details could be obtained from its customer-care teams, although
in general terms: Scotland remains largely unaffected; North-westand north-eastEngland’s main routes are said to

be “OK”, but with “some isolated postcode issues in side roads”. However,UK Mail said heavy snowfalls are forecast for north-east England area over the next few days, with Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfield, Teesside, York and Newcastle expected to be affected. The Midlandsand south-east England remains largely unaffected apart, from some isolated issues in side roads.

UK Mail said south-west England and Waleswas experiencing “some residual postcode issues from the severe weather last Friday, in the whole of Mid and South Wales and also Bath.” It said snow was forecast for this area again tomorrow. The company added: “The situation is constantly changing. However, the message for today so far is that all consignments are out for delivery or were delivered during the weekend operation. Of course, we have challenging conditions, which may inevitably mean that some postcodes are inaccessible and so service on these may experience a delay.”

UK home-delivery parcel specialist Yodel said that despite the bad weather, its contingency plans had ensured Yodel’s continued service.“All of our sort and service centres and holding facilities have a minimum stock level of rock salt, snow shovels, ice melt, de-icer and scrapers, and all sites have been gritted.We also have
snow-ploughs that fit to forklift trucks in order to keep the yards at our sort centres free from snow.”

A spokesman told CEP-Research that additional time had been allowed for trunking to ensure on-time collections from customers’ warehouses and arrival at the company’s sort centres. “Our Central Operations Control Centre is working closely with our clients, providing them with regular updates throughout each day, including details of any inaccessible postcodes,” he added.“We are also liaising with retailers to ensure that their own processes are in place to ensure that shoppers expectations are being managed.

“There are some parts of the UK where it is not possible for us to deliver due to the extreme weather conditions. As soon as the weather clears we will resume these routes and, where we are unable to deliver, parcels are being securely stored and date-stamped toensure a controlled ‘ first in, first out’ (FIFO) process. He said retailers
using the group’s ‘CollectPlus’ service also allowed shoppers in potentially inaccessible areas to select their local shop as an alternative, convenient delivery point.

A DHL Express spokesman told CEP-Research: “Our flight operationshavebeen minimallyaffected, as we have been able to implement contingencies in the case of any delays or cancellations over the weekend. However, due to the heavy snow and icy conditions in selected areas of some European countries- specifically, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Northern Franceand Centraland Northern UK -some delays arebeing experienced with
pick-up and delivery services. We are monitoring the situation closely and will resume service as soon as we can access these areas.”

TNT Express told CEP-Research that it had experienced some minor delays, but had operated all flights. “TNT Express has put four new de-icing trucks into service in Liege, in addition to the six used last winter,” said a spokesman. “With the new trucks, we are able to de-ice the aircraft more quickly and more efficiently.”

Elsewhere in Europe, Paris airports Charles de Galle and Orly have been forced to cancel around 40 per cent of flights.

ESC: UPS' failed bid good for competition

22 January 2013
American Shipper

The Brussels-based European Shippers' Council has congratulated UPS for abandoning its proposed
5.2-billion-euro takeover of TNT Express due to information that the European Commission would stop the
merger once a formal ruling is held in February.

In a statement, the ESC said it had serious concerns about competition in the  European express market if the merger had been approved. Its decision was reached after consulting with customers of both  TNT and UPS and its large membership.

The merger would have brought an express market with three major players down to two, and it would have been difficult for the smaller of the two, DHL Express, to compete with a merged UPS and TNT. "A few years ago a similar reduction in the number of express companies in the United States resulted in significant price increases," according to the statement. -  Jon Ross
