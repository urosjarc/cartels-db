European Shippers  Welcome Collapse of UPS-TNT Deal

Greater competition will be the result of  the failure of the TNT-UPS deal, according to the  European Shippers’ Council.

“UPS's proposed takeover of  TNT Express would have reduced the number of European express companies from three to only two, with DHL Express alone still able to compete with the proposed TNT-UPS combination,” a statement from the ESC said. “A few years ago a similar reduction in the number of express companies in the United States resulted in significant price increases.”

The ESC said it wanted a properly functioning European transport market in which competition was encouraged and lauded the European Commission’s opposition to the UPS-TNT agreement.
“The European Commission consulted a large number of the ESC’s members, business customers of UPS and
TNT Express, prior to reaching its decision,” the ESC said.

After anticipating the
European Commission to block the merger between UPS and TNT, UPS decided to drop the $6.8 billion bid to acquire TNT.

NEW YORK, January 24, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --

On withdrawing its offer, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) [Full Research Report]([) (1) (]) paid a termination fee of $265.5 million to Dutch shipping company, TNT Express. The European Commission announced that their objection is primarily due to concerns about future market competition for overnight delivery of parcels across Europe.

If ever the merger happens, this is good news for TNT, but could mean bad news for other messenger companies in Europe. Considered as the world's largest package delivery company and the leading global provider of specialized transportation and logistics services, UPS could have given TNT the chance to dominate the
European market.

But the European Commission feared that the merger could negatively influence the market dynamics as UPS would have monopolized the delivery business in Europe and might bring unfair competition, affecting pricing policies and services, thus impacting end-users.

Although UPS can sustain and move forward without the acquisition, it is still a big disappointment for the company, as its chances of boosting its footprint in Europe and consolidating its position as a global leader did not materialize. It could also mean losing significant synergies for UPS.

TNT could have been UPS' biggest acquisition. Despite this failed agreement, the company is still aiming to acquire smaller companies. "While we viewed the acquisition as a compelling growth platform, our financial strength allows UPS to capture future opportunities," said Scott Davis, UPS Chairman and CEO. Analysts' equity summary score for UPS is bullish at 7.9 with a neutral recommendation, given this renewed focus on core operations, allowing for potential margin expansion.

The company has also been upgraded from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating, as analysts see a more aggressive capital deployment and fewer headwinds constraining share performance following the merger termination between UPS and TNT.

On the other hand, TNT shares went down 41% by last Monday's market close after the failed acquisition. Looking beyond this, analysts are still confident with TNT, believing that with the company's exposure to the Asia Pacific and Brazil, it is still an attractive takeover target.

Considering the market situation of both companies, there is definitely life after UPS for TNT, and vice versa. In the first place, many investors were cautious and not confident with the merger, resulting for both shares to go down. The failed acquisition was actually a relief. Both companies can now focus on the growth of their core operations. The lesson here is some things are better left alone.

Interview  - Express customers welcome block on UPS-TNT deal

European express customers have been spared the possibility of significant price increases resulting from a US-style duopoly, thanks to the actions of the  European Commission over UPS’s planned takeover of  TNT Express, shipper representatives told CEP-Research today.

Joost Van Doesburg, policy manager for the  European Shippers’ Council (ESC)’s Air Transport Council, said in an exclusive interview that the large shipper members of the national associations making up the ESC were “very clear” that the integrator market should be treated as separate from  Europe’s national and regional parcel and express operators because DHL,  UPS and TNT were the only companies currently capable of providing the highest level of international express services within  Europe.

Van Doesburg, who is also head of European affairs at Dutch shipper association EVO, said the ESC and its national and shipper members were involved in the EC's investigation of the competition implications of the proposed takeover, after being invited by the EC to participate "as a stakeholder, as a representative of shippers. So they were interested in listening to us, in what our view was, but they also asked us to provide the contact details of big users, the big shippers."

As well as providing these contact details, the ESC and its member associations also helped to make sure that the big shippers filled in the surveys that the European Commission provided for its investigation into the case.

“I can be very certain that the shippers had a clear vision. I organised some meetings with shippers, and they were very clear; they were very concerned about competition in the express market,” he added. “We at the ESC, and the national shippers’ councils, have one very important task: to ensure that the competition level in the transport markets, including the express market, stays at a certain level, where price is determined by competition between the logistics service providers, instead of too few players on this market.

“The big question of the European Commission was how do shippers and the ESC see the market? Do we see the European market as a market of three integrators or of a dozen express providers, and our members and the European Shippers’ Council were very clear: we need to see the market on one hand as three integrators, and
that their service is a completely separate service than that which other express companies provide, such as DPD
and GLS.

“The issue was not that we were against this merger; we were against the situation where companies become too powerful. In the end the European Commission said that this company will become too powerful if they merge as
a whole, and so they were forced to sell certain activities, major activities. And in the end they pulled the plug themselves.”
According to Van Doesburg, shippers said that the clear difference was that there were only three companies in
Europe, UPS, TNT and DHL, providing “high-service products”, with all the others providing low- and
medium-service products.

“These shippers also remember what happened several years ago when DHL exited the American [domestic express] market, and in one year the transport rates increased very significantly, and it was against market developments that rates increased by such a high percentage,” said Van Doesburg. He said shippers still think that the competition level in the US express market is insufficient, with negative consequences.




Page 8 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
“It is also because it is very difficult to create a real integrator,” he added. “Companies like DPD and GLS may need more than a decade to become a real integrator, if they start investing fully, and currently that is simply not possible.”

As well as requiring a lot of capital to set up or buy an airline, it would be a huge challenge to acquire the knowledge and systems to operate such a complex network, said Van Doesburg. “ Everyone knows it’s very difficult to make money flying cargo,” he observed.

Despite the difficulties of the aborted sale, Van Doesburg believes TNT Express can still operate as a successful and significant competitor in Europe to UPS and DHL.

“We definitely have a feeling that TNT is still a very good operator for the European market, and so we’re not worried about their activities in Europe,” he said. “We don’t know what will happen in the near to medium-term future.”

Observers in Europe believe there is still the potential for a purchase of TNT Express by FedEx, which would be likely to get European Commission approval because of FedEx’s relatively small presence in Europe compared with DHL and UPS, although it is thought that TNT would be unlikely to achieve the same sale price as that which had been offered by UPS.

Deutsche Post to Cement European Pole Position

The failed merger between United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and Dutch TNT Express (TNTE.AE), as well as new services, are set to enhance the footprint of Europe's largest postal service company by market share and help compensate for declining revenues from traditional mail services, according to Deutsche Post AG's (DPW.XE) chief executive.

In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Frank Appel told The Wall Street Journal the company will continue to gain market share in its express delivery unit, DHL, and that it plans to deliver food and household goods in an improved global economic environment.
As the confidence of political and economic leaders meeting in Davos has improved, Mr. Appel said he is
"optimistic that the (European and global) economy will improve in the second half of the year."

Commenting on Deutsche Post's DHL ambitions, he said he wants "to further gain market share with its express unit like in the past two years." He added that merger talks between UPS and TNT have unsettled customers, with some of them turning to Deutsche Post.

Logistics industry consultancy Transport Intelligence's calculations show that a combined UPS and TNT would have had 35% of the market for next-day parcel delivery in Europe, behind DHL's 39%, based on 2011 revenue. FedEx Corp. (FDX) has 12% of this segment.

Mr. Appel said he is confident of further strengthening DHL's position in Europe. "TNT will now have to find a standalone strategy" following the failed tie-up, he said.

UPS earlier in January abandoned its plan to buy TNT Express for $6.8 billion, due to objections from the European Commission's competition authorities. Shares of the Dutch company plunged 43% after UPS's announcement.

The regulator was worried the deal would reduce the number of major companies offering both air and ground parcel deliveries in Europe from four to three: DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx.
Deutsche Post's DHL express unit recorded revenues of 9.4 billion euros ($12.7 billion) in the first nine months of
2012, up nearly 10% from the same period a year earlier.

To further compensate for the annual 2% decline of the traditional mail delivery operations, Mr. Appel said the company is to enter new markets. "We plan to deliver groceries and household products in the whole of Germany by 2016," Mr. Appel said. The company will therefore cooperate with retailers.

Deutsche Post hopes to fill a niche in Germany, where the market share of online grocery is only marginal according to Mr. Appel.

In the U.K., in contrast, the market share of food and grocery bought online is to rise to 6% by 2016, up from slightly less than 4% in 2011, according to research firm IGD.

Deutsche Post also intends to launch a country-wide network of long-distance coaches from 2014 onwards in cooperation with German car driver lobby group ADAC, according to Mr. Appel. The move comes after the German government opened the market for all long-distance routes between cities at the beginning of this year. Previously, the country's state-owned railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG had a monopoly for most routes.

TNT Express Raised to Buy From Neutral by UBS

0725 GMT [Dow Jones] UBS upgrades  TNT Express (TNTE.AE) to buy from neutral but lowers target to EUR6.80 from EUR7.50. The first objective now the takeover by  UPS (UPS) has failed, is sort out the loss-making Brazil
and China operations, the brokerage says. Although Brazil is losing more money, it has greater strategic rationale than China, so China should be sold, at least partially, UBS adds. If an economic recovery in Europe comes,
most of the margin erosion should be reversed, meaning 60% earnings upside potential. TNT Express shares closed at EUR5.51 on Friday. (robert.vandenoever@dowjones.com)

Commenting on Deutsche Post's DHL ambitions, he said he wants "to further gain market share with its express unit like in the past two years." He added that merger talks between UPS and TNT have unsettled customers, with some of them turning to Deutsche Post.

Logistics industry consultancy Transport Intelligence's calculations show that a combined UPS and TNT would have had 35% of the market for next-day parcel delivery in Europe, behind DHL's 39%, based on 2011 revenue. FedEx Corp. (FDX) has 12% of this segment.

Mr. Appel said he is confident of further strengthening DHL's position in Europe. "TNT will now have to find a standalone strategy" following the failed tie-up, he said.

UPS earlier in January abandoned its plan to buy TNT Express for $6.8 billion, due to objections from the European Commission's competition authorities. Shares of the Dutch company plunged 43% after UPS's announcement.

The regulator was worried the deal would reduce the number of major companies offering both air and ground parcel deliveries in Europe from four to three: DHL, UPS/TNT and FedEx.
Deutsche Post's DHL express unit recorded revenues of 9.4 billion euros ($12.7 billion) in the first nine months of
2012, up nearly 10% from the same period a year earlier.

To further compensate for the annual 2% decline of the traditional mail delivery operations, Mr. Appel said the company is to enter new markets. "We plan to deliver groceries and household products in the whole of Germany by 2016," Mr. Appel said. The company will therefore cooperate with retailers.

Deutsche Post hopes to fill a niche in Germany, where the market share of online grocery is only marginal according to Mr. Appel.

In the U.K., in contrast, the market share of food and grocery bought online is to rise to 6% by 2016, up from slightly less than 4% in 2011, according to research firm IGD.

Deutsche Post also intends to launch a country-wide network of long-distance coaches from 2014 onwards in cooperation with German car driver lobby group ADAC, according to Mr. Appel. The move comes after the German government opened the market for all long-distance routes between cities at the beginning of this year. Previously, the country's state-owned railway operator Deutsche Bahn AG had a monopoly for most routes.

DAVOS, Switzerland--The failed merger between United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and Dutch TNT Express (TNTE.AE), as well as new services, are set to enhance the footprint of Europe's largest postal service company by market share and help compensate for declining revenues from traditional mail services, according to Deutsche Post AG's (DPW.XE) chief executive.

In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Frank Appel told The Wall Street Journal the company will continue to gain market share in its express delivery unit, DHL, and that it plans to deliver food and household goods in an improved global economic environment.
As the confidence of political and economic leaders meeting in Davos has improved, Mr. Appel said he is
"optimistic that the (European and global) economy will improve in the second half of the year."

Commenting on Deutsche Post's DHL ambitions, he said he wants "to further gain market share with its express unit like in the past two years." He added that merger talks between UPS and TNT have unsettled customers, with some of them turning to Deutsche Post.

MERGERS : COMMISSION SCUPPERS UPS-TNT DEAL
469 words

Plans for a merger between United Parcel Service (UPS), world leader in express delivery services, and its
Dutch competitor  TNT Express, number two in Europe, have been dropped.

TNT Group put out a statement on 14 January, announcing that, at an 11 January meeting, the European Commission informed the parties that it would block the €5.16 billion deal. "UPS has informed TNT Express that it sees no realistic prospect that the  European Commission clearance can be obtained and that it will not pursue
the transaction on any other basis," announced the Dutch group. The statement added that "TNT Express regrets this situation, having believed that the merger was feasible and beneficial for all shareholders". The firm's share price plummeted by 50% on the Amsterdam exchange following the announcement.

The EU executive, due to competition concerns in the area of international express services where the parties would have held very large combined market shares, opened an in-depth investigation on 20 July 2012 into TNT's proposed takeover of UPS, launched on 19 March (. It feared an excessive concentration that would be
detrimental to direct customers and ultimately to European consumers. For the Commission, the market in question is made up of only four firms that control a global air and ground network for small parcel delivery in Europe and beyond: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. The merger of two of these companies could stifle competition by cutting the number of players down to three. Given FedEx's small market share in Europe, DHL would be the only really credible competitor on this market. UPS challenged that view, arguing that the European market is made up of tens of competitors, including parcel delivery firms, forwarding agents and national express delivery firms. However, to dispel the EU executive's fears and in response to the objections it spelled out last November, UPS had offered to sell certain assets, stipulating that some could not be bought by FedEx or DHL. These included TNT subsidiaries in 16 EU member states, including Spain and Portugal

The refusal in early January by the American group FedEx to take over part of these assets was apparently decisive to the collapse of the deal. FedEx is said to have refused to enter into firm talks unless the offer covered a larger share of TNT's activities. The French firm DPD, a subsidiary of La Poste, was being mentioned as a possible buyer but several experts say that the Commission did not consider it a serious applicant because it lacks an air transport network and would have had to rely on UPS or DHL.

UPS will consequently have to pay TNT Express €200 million, an amount agreed contractually by the two parties in the event the bid was withdrawn.

DJ EU Blocks  United Parcel Service, TNT Merger

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday formally blocked a proposed merger between U.S. express delivery giant United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE), saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries.

The decision had been expected after UPS said earlier this month that it would abandon its 5.2 billion euro ($6.99 billion) bid for its Dutch rival, saying the European Commission had told the U.S. firm it was working on a
decision to block the deal.

The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were "inadequate".
"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was
simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," the EU's competition chief Joaquin
Almunia said in a statement.

In particular, the commission said it had been concerned that the tie-up would have reduced the number of players in the express delivery sector from four to only three or even two. It said Germany's DHL would in some case have been left as the only alternative to UPS.

"Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. [...] These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," Mr. Almunia said.

UPS revised its proposal to overcome concerns the commission several times over the past months. It had hoped that a plan to sell some assets to DPD, a parcel-delivery company controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator.

UPS proposed to divest TNT's subsidiaries in the 15 relevant EU countries, as well in Spain and Portugal under certain conditions. It also offered access to its air network for 5 years to sweeten the offer.

However, the commission said it needed the purchaser of those assets to have had suitable networks or partners in the other EU countries.

"UPS would have needed to sign a binding agreement with a suitable purchaser before the concentration was implemented. However, UPS did not propose this to the Commission and its last minute attempt to sign such an agreement before the end of the Commission's investigation did not materialise," the commission said in a statement.

There are currently only four integrators, or firms that offer a full air and road network for express delivery services, in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx, the latter seen as trailing the others owing to its low market shares in a number of countries.

EU Almunia: Was Surprised UPS said TNT Deal was Off, There was Still Time

BRUSSELS--The European Union's competition chief Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday he was surprised that United Parcel Services Inc. (UPS) announced it wouldn't complete its planned merger with Dutch rival  TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE) earlier this month, saying there was still a time window to find a way to clear the 5.2 billion euro ($6.99 billion) deal.

UPS said on Jan. 14 that EU regulators were planning to block the merger with TNT after they held a meeting with Mr. Almunia's team, though the formal decision wasn't due until early February.

"I have to confess that I was a little bit surprised, because we still had time when they published this statement," Mr. Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

"As on many different occasions...the final elements of a positive solution, of a positive alternative are not found on the first day but as close as possible on the last day of the negotiations," he added.

On Wednesday, the European Commission said it would block the deal, saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries. The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were "inadequate."

European Commission confirms blocking of UPS takeover of TNT Express

The European Commission announced that it has prohibited under the  EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of TNT Express (TNTEY) by  UPS (UPS). The Commission found that the take-over would have restricted competition in 15 Member States when it comes to the express delivery of small packages to another European country. In these Member States, the acquisition would have reduced the number of significant players to only 3 or 2, leaving sometimes DHL as the only alternative to  UPS, the EU said. The agency added, "The concentration would therefore have likely harmed customers by causing price increases. During the investigation, UPS offered to divest  TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries and allow the buyer to access its intra-European
air network for five years. The Commission carried out an in-depth assessment, including a market test where customers and other interested parties were consulted.
However, these remedies proved inadequate to address the identified competition concerns." Recall that UPS
dropped its takeover bid TNT Express, saying the merger would be blocked by the European Commission.

UPS announces withdrawal of offer for TNT Express

United Parcel Service (UPS) announced the withdrawal of its Offer for  TNT Express (TNTEY). As anticipated, the European Commission has issued a formal decision prohibiting the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express. As a result of the prohibition by the  EC, the Offer Condition relating to  EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and the acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS will not be completed. Given this outcome,  UPS and TNT Express entered a separate agreement to terminate the Merger Protocol.  UPS proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the  EC's concerns with the transaction concerning the competitive landscape in  Europe. UPS believes that the combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting much needed growth in Europe in particular.

While UPS is disappointed in the EC's decision, the company's focus is on the continued execution of its growth strategy.

EU officially blocks  abortive  UPS-TNT takeover

The EU officially blocked on Wednesday an abortive five-billion-euro bid by US courier giant United Parcel
Services (UPS) to take over  TNT Express of the Netherlands.

Although the decision was announced after the horse had bolted, it was only the third formal rejection issued as against some 800 positive merger decisions in the last three years,  European Union Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia told a news conference.

"The Commission found that the take-over would have restricted competition in 15 (EU) member states when it comes to the express delivery of small packages," said a statement.

UPS abandoned on January 14 its battle to convince Almunia's office to back the deal, which included offers to sell off TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 national markets.
That announcement saw TNT lose half its value in a day, with UPS agreeing to pay a cancellation fee to TNT of
200 million euros.

"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," Almunia said in the statement.

"The Commission had serious doubts as to the ability of the very few potential purchasers that expressed their interest to exercise a sufficient competitive constraint on the merged entity in (European) express delivery markets on the basis of the remedies offered," it added, in a marker for future consolidation in the market especially for air carriage.

The two previous rejections under Almunia were of a Greek airlines merger, and a proposed global stock exchange giant stretching from New York to Frankfurt.

EU turns down UPS acquisition of TNT after UPS had abandoned  the deal over EU objections

BRUSSELS (AP) - The European Union's antitrust chief on Wednesday rejected a $6.9 billion deal for  UPS to acquire Dutch delivery company TNT Express and said he was surprised the U.S. group jettisoned the venture when there was still hope for a solution.

Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that  European businesses `'would have been directly harmed" by the takeover `'because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases."

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS said that it had proposed "tangible remedies" but Almunia said they were `'simply not enough."

Sensing a likely rejection, UPS scrapped the acquisition on Jan. 14, hitting the stock price of the Dutch delivery company. The decision surprised Almunia, convinced there still was room to find a compromise.

`'I have to confess that I was a little bit surprised because we still had time when they published this statement," Almunia told reporters.

`'We have experience that the final elements of a possible solution, a positive alternative, are not found the first day of negotiations but as close as possible to the last day of negotiations," he said.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

It only was the third merger that Almunia rejected out of some 800 cases since he became the EU's competition commissioner in 2010. Yet is showed the power of the EU's antitrust division in setting the conditions for multinationals to operate in the 27-nation bloc.
The TNT takeover would have been the largest acquisition in UPS's history.

`'UPS believes that the combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting much needed growth in Europe in particular," the company said in a statement Wednesday.

Almunia, however, disagreed. The EU found that it would have restricted competition in 15 member states, where the market would have been reduced to just 3 or 2 companies.

The EU was still looking for further concessions from UPS to make the deal palatable when the Atlanta, Ga. company scrapped it.

`'We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems," Almunia said.
UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with
Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL.

Despite the setback, Almunia was convinced TNT Express would remain a viable company.

`'I don't think TNT is an ailing firm, not at all," Almunia said. `'They are present in the market. I am sure they will continue to be in the market."

United Parcel Service Inc announced the withdrawal of Offer for  TNT Express NV. As anticipated, the  European
Commission (EC) has issued a formal decision prohibiting the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express. As a result
of the prohibition by the  EC, the Offer Condition relating to  EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and the
acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS will not be completed. Given this outcome,  UPS and TNT Express entered a
separate agreement to terminate the Merger Protocol.  UPS proposed tangible remedies designed to address the
EC's concerns with the transaction concerning the competitive landscape in  Europe.

Dow Jones reported that European Union (EU) regulators formally blocked a proposed merger between U.S. express delivery giant United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) and TNT Express NV, saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries. The decision had been expected after UPS said earlier this month that
it would abandon its EUR5.2 billion ($6.99 billion) bid for its Dutch rival, saying the European Commission had told the U.S. firm it was working on a decision to block the deal. The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with  UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were 'inadequate'.

Commission officially stops the acquisition of TNT Express by UPS

The European Commission today published its official decision to prohibit under the EU Merger Regulation  the proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS, on the ground of being likely to restrict competition in 15 Member States. In these countries, the acquisition would have reduced the number of carrier companies to only three or two, leaving very few choices to clients. As a result, the concentration would have likely harmed customers by causing price increases.

As Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia stated: "Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. This requires access to affordable, reliable services that truly fit their needs. These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases. We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified".

During the investigation, UPS offered to divest TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries and allow the buyer to access its intra-European air network for five years. However, the Commission concluded that this action would not be sufficient to ensure fair competition in the field.

In Europe, there are only four integrators: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. In particular, FedEx has low market shares in a number of countries where it cannot be an effective competitive alternative on UPS and TNT. Consequently, costumers would have very few choices, leaving sometimes DHL as the only alternative to UPS and this would most likely result in an increase in prices.

EU gives final "no" to UPS takeover bid for TNT Express

Brussels (dpa) - The European Union has formally rejected attempts by US package delivery giant  UPS to take over Dutch-based rival TNT Express, the bloc's executive announced Wednesday, arguing that the resulting company would stifle competition.

Earlier this month  UPS had cancelled the deal, worth 5.2 billion euros (7 billion dollars), knowing that it would likely be rejected by the  European Commission.

EU businesses relying on next-day deliveries "would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," said EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia.

Almunia said this was only the third merger blocked by the commission since he joined in 2010. In that time, they had examined more than 800 cases.

"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," Almunia said.

Savings resulting from the merger, for example by combining the companies' air networks - a crucial component of delivery services - would not have outweighed the negative effects on competition, the commission said.

Only four parcel-delivery companies control air and ground delivery networks in the EU, according to the commission: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. Reducing this number further would harm customers, it argued.
UPS had said it was "extremely disappointed" with the commission's position when it cancelled the deal on
January 14. It said at the time that it would pay TNT a cancellation fee of 200 million euros.
Management consultancy AT Kearney estimated that the express-delivery market was worth 47.2 billion euros in

DON IMUS, HOST, "IMUS IN THE MORNING": This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the FOX Business Network. Now, here's Diane Macedo.

DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning, everyone. It looks like UPS's effort to acquire  TNT Express is officially dead. As expected, the UNT (ph) Trust Regulators have block UPS' $7 billion bid to acquire the Dutch shipping company saying the proposed merger would have reduced competition in the 15 E.U. countries.

Earlier this month, the UPS said, it would withdraw its offer because of EU regulators' concerns to deal would have given the company access to TNT, stronger net works in fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.

Speaking of markets, let's see what they're doing. Here in the U.S., it's been a fairly flat morning. We do have green arrows across the board though, Dow futures are up four, the S&P is up about a point. And the NASDAQ is up three.

In Europe, the European Commission monthly measure of confidence in the Eurozone rose for a third straight month but Spain's GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in the final three months of last year. Stocks there you can see are currently mix, London slightly up, Paris and Frankfurt are slightly down.

Let's take a closer look at what is moving those markets now with Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index over in London. Josh, confidence in the Eurozone seems to be on the way out but then we have the Spanish GDP number coming in worse as the recession there deepens. So, how do investors play this?

JOSHUA RAYMOND, CITY INDEX CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Well -- euro, that's the sudden European states which are in trouble of the -- Spain. Yes, one in four adults are unemployed, one in two youth are unemployed, the recession has deepened as well. So, Spain still in a very difficult place but at the moment we
see equity markets are running quite strongly and that is why confidence as well, there's a lot of U.S. data coming out, softening which a lot of European investors are looking at, you have got the ADP employment, you've got GDP from the U.S. And of course the FOMC decision as well. So, those are three things that we need to keep an eye on later on today.

MACEDO: And Josh, Fitch is also warning today that the U.K. faces a significant, that's a quote, significant risk of losing its AAA rating. How worried are you about that?

RAYMOND: Well, I mean, they are not the only ones you seen coming out saying it before, because obviously the austerity had to be increased by an extra year, deficit is not being hit. So, it is an ongoing concern. Definitely they're going to act immediately but I think they will going to be watching the data oversee and they are on a negative watch. So, that opens the prospect from UK to list its top-notch rating, and that is a real possibility from this year.
MACEDO: All right. That's Josh Raymond over at City Index. We appreciate it Josh, thank you. RAYMOND: Thank you.
MACEDO: And we are getting earnings in from ADT, the security company is reporting an adjusted profit of $0.44 cents a share topping the estimates for $0.43 cents, revenue though was amiss, that came in at $809 million. Analyst were looking for $816.5 million.

For a closer look at the Asian markets now, let's go over to Haidi Lun, business reporter for CCTV. Haidi, it looks like it was a strong day for stock, talk to me about a little bit of what moved the markets today.

HAIDI LUN, CCTV BUSINESS REPORTER: Good morning, Diane. It was a sea of green again today in Asia, the Shanghai -- here in China, lead the gain, a third straight day of gains. Supporter mostly about property stocks today, because there was a report suggesting that Chinese policymakers could tolerate price increases in home prices of up to 10 percent after they sent much of the past trying to get property taxes down.

Over in Hong Kong, that index managed to break out of it, they're seeing range bound over the past few weeks up by seven-tenths-of-one percent as well. Or (INAUDIBLE) Japan, and those major indices were helped by positive earnings as well.
MACEDO: And I know, it is earnings season there as well. What companies are out today?

LUN: In data, one of the ones that I want to talk about that actually announced just after the market close was Lenovo in Hong Kong. Now, Lenovo is currently the world's largest laptop maker in the way to it depending on which firm you chose to follow. It reported -- that came in, profits rather came in a third more than the year before. Lenovo actually closed down 2.7 percent but keep in mind it is a rally by almost 20 percent in January alone and by 36 percent last year. So, a little bit of problem taking, maybe not so hard to understand, Diane.
MACEDO: All right. Haidi Lun from CCTV, we appreciate it, Haidi. Thanks.

And the Federal Reserve is set to wrap up its two day policy meeting this morning. Analysts predict the Fed will stick with its plan of allowing consumers and businesses to borrow at cheap rates in an effort to help the economy. The Central Bank has promised to hold interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent and as long as inflation doesn't threaten to top 2.5 percent.

The Fed adds, that all could take until again to 2015. FOX Business will have full coverage of the Fed's policy decision when it is released at 2:15 p.m. Eastern.

Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold have been to the upside this morning, we have oil up by about 32 cents. Gold is up four bucks. Now, here's the I-man live on FOX Business giving you the power to prosper.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.
IMUS: What is the bigger deal, Warner? A-Rod with the steroids again or Ray Lewis with the deer-antler spray? WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: Well, A-Rod is.
IMUS: OK.

WOLF: Sure. Because number one, he admitted that he lied before and also the fact that Ray Lewis's story was two years ago, same situation.
IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: But A-Rod certainly the highest-paid baseball player in history. BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: No brainer.
WOLF: Has got to be number one.
IMUS: OK. Did you hear Ray Lewis's denial yesterday? WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: And?
WOLF: We have it right here. IMUS: Let me hear it.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

WOLF: Well, that is a situation where he has been accused by sports illustrated and they are saying that he use -- it is called deer antler spray.
IMUS: Sure.

WOLF: Where they take a substance from the antlers of a deer and then they freeze it and it is supposed to give you stimulus for muscle growth and endurance and they sprayed it under your tongue.
CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Right. MCGUIRK: That sounds like it work.
IMUS: That sounds like lighting a bunch of candles and drinking chicken blood, doesn't it? MCSHANE: Cool.
IMUS: Well, so I was really sick yesterday so I went home and went to bed and in the process, but I had the TV
on, you know, so I watched everything and yesterday was media day.
MCSHANE: Oh, man!
IMUS: So, I was alternating between the NFL Channel. MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: .and ESPN and they had Hannah Storm, I like her, you know? MCGUIRK: Yes.
IMUS: And she is anchoring from New Orleans and a bunch of other people on, so I got to see all of this stuff and then I watched another program which was a simulcast of a radio program, could be the most awful thing I've ever seen.
MCSHANE: Oh, no.
IMUS: Have you ever seen this guy? Called The Herd on ESPN? MCSHANE: Yes.
WOLF: Colin Cowherd. IMUS: Yes.
LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: The Herd. IMUS: Oh my God.
MCSHANE: Didn't want to join The Herd, I-man. (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)
IMUS: Jesus! God! MCGUIRK: The Herd.
IMUS: I mean, man, I don't get that. Oh my God. MCGUIRK: It hurt.
IMUS: Dan Patrick. I kind of like Dan Patrick, you know? And he is fine, you know.

Page 39 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: He's got lot of good guest.
IMUS: Yes, and he's got some sense, you know? MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: These other guys, oh my God, they suck! And then we have that idiot Randy Moss. WOLF: Oh, man!
IMUS: And he's talking about I am the greatest wide receiver to ever play the game so Jerry Rice, he is the greatest wide receiver to ever play the game.
WOFL: Right.
IMUS: Won three Super Bowls among many other things, happened to run into old Jerry down there in New
Orleans. Well, Jerry in the other hand -- he has a Super Bowl ring on it.
MCSHANE: That's it.
IMUS: And I know Randy is trying to get his first one. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: But Randy Moss must have lost his mind.
WOLF: Oh, man! I mean, this is an even close 567 more catches. IMUS: He said, he was not concerned with the numbers.
WOLF: Oh, that's right. You are what your record is. (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)
IMUS: You are what your record says you are. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: But anyway, so that was -- and then poor Alex Smith, he didn't even have a podium, he just wandering around.
WOLF: Hey, guys who are not interviewed all year, are now interviewed 18 times. IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: That's painful.
IMUS: You know, he is a pretty good interviewing people is Deion Sanders. MCSHANE: Really?
IMUS: Yes. He was on the NFL Channel, he's actually pretty good. So fat robbed finally showed up. MCSHANE: Good morning, Rob.
IMUS: Here's the situation I find is interesting. I come to work, everybody gets to work on time. Theresa does hair, she lives on Staten Island, she gets here on time.
MCSHANE: Yes.

IMUS: Connell who lives on Long Island, he gets in fine. Rob and Tony can't get to work on time and they call and they blame it on the fog except everybody else who lives in the same are as they do, they get here on time. Can you explain that?
MCGUIRK: Yes, it's brutal.

ROB BARTLETT, COMEDIAN: It was foggy this morning.
IMUS: No, no. How does everybody else get to work on time and you can't? BARTLETT: I cannot answer that question.
IMUS: No, of course you can't. So, you are fired, go home. You and, what's his name? You're both fired. MCGUIRK: Next time he gets into a car accident on the way in and you get feel bad.
MCSHANE: Exactly.
IMUS: Go home. Enough with you guys. IMUS: Enough.
MCSHANE: Bill advice that they leave extra time this morning. IMUS: Well, so get to work on time.
RUFINO: Like London out there. Yes. (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER) MCSHANE: All your gear today. RUFINO: Yes, break it all.
IMUS: To get an impression of, what is his name? All right. Ten minutes after the hour, let's do some news. And here with that is Connell McShane.

MCSHANE: All right, I-man. Good morning. There will be a Senate hearing today on gun control. Wayne Lapierre from the NRA is going to be there to argue in the assault weapons ban universal background checks that they will not work, he will be calling for the enforcement of existing laws, improvements in school security. So that will be going on in Washington.

In the meantime, a gunman in Alabama got on a school bus, shot and killed the driver of the bus and is now holding a six-year-old boy hostage. Local pastor Midland County spoke with kids who were able to get away.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: The young man entered the bus, he told most of them to get off of the bus and then he grabbed this boy, probably I understand and shot the bus driver four times and kids was running down the road behind -- to get to safety.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCSHANE: Well, the police are still trying supposedly to negotiate with this man, he's holding the child in what they are describing as some sort of an underground bunker or storm shelter, so still a developing story out of Alabama. The first execution of a woman in Texas in three years never happened last night. The judge now rescheduled Kimberly McCarthy's execution for April 3rd, so lawyers can have more time to appeal, this is the woman convicted of stabbing her 71-year-old neighbor to death in 1997. And President Obama here making his --
IMUS: That's in Huntsville, right?

MCSHANE: That is where the execution will take place. Yes. It was supposed to be last night but it never happened. Huntsville.
IMUS: The lights are dim in Huntsville. MCSHANE: No, man.
IMUS: The lights are dim in Huntsville.
MCSHANE: Right.

IMUS: That is the Delbert McClinton song, isn't it?
MCSHANE: Yes.

IMUS: You know, my voice is completely gone. Like I was listening on yesterday on the radio when I was going home to my interview with Martha MacCallum and I am not sure what the bottom is, so. You know, I had my vocal chords scrape about a month ago.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: And you think it is these sprays. Right, Warner?

WOLF: Yes, well, for me it was. I know that. Absolutely. Because when I stopped them it took about a week and then my voice came back.

IMUS: Yes. Of course my problem is, if I stop the sprays, you know, the Spiriva and the Ceruvit, that I can't breathe. So, I am not sure what to do. Now, I should retire. Maybe, I just retire.
MCSHANE: No.
IMUS: Tired of doing this anymore.
MCSHANE: Yes, sit home and watch the NFL network. IMUS: Well, I don't know if I will do that or not. MCSHANE: Better keep working.
IMUS: Rob and Tony are back in the greenroom in a time out. MCSHANE: OK.
IMUS: Is Tony here yet? MCSHANE: Caught in the fog.
IMUS: I mean, that's just unbelievable. MCSHANE: It is very foggy.
IMUS: They guy lives in the same area that a bunch of people who work here at FOX do, to resell one of them, they'll get to work on time, Tony can't.
IMUS: I mean, you can't just -- you can't make it up.

MCSHANE: Here is President Obama I-man, watch this, making his case for immigration reform in a speech delivered in Las Vegas.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PRES. BARACK OBAMA (D), UNITED STATES: I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp but I promise you this, the closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCSHANE: Yes. Well, the President endorsed most of the outline presented earlier in the week by a group of senators. More border security.
IMUS: What is the sticking point?

MCSHANE: The border security and whether there will be a trigger for enforcement is going to be the sticking point. In other words, they agree on this idea that there has to be some sort of a pathway to citizenship, the more visas for highly skilled immigrants has a lot of support especially in the business community, want these people to be able to stay, start businesses and hire Americans.

Page 42 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
But the conservatives, the Marco Rubios of the world want some sort of a trigger mechanism where there will be more border security in force in order for those things to go into effect. It's not clear if the President will go along with that part of it.
IMUS: What is the last part again?

MCSHANE: The trigger to require that there is more border security in order to have those other things that I just mentioned. Now, the President's argument is that there already is better enforcement at the borders, that they've increase the number of agents, that fewer people come across, Republicans say, the reason fewer people are coming across is because they don't want to come in because the economy is not as strong as it is, so that is basically the argument right now. But they agree on a lot. They agree on a lot, so.
IMUS: We have got to get to figure this out, don't we?

MCGUIRK: Yes. It looks like, I mean, if you have to bet, you'd probably say, they will figure this out, I mean, they agree on much more than they disagree on.
IMUS: What Bernie?

MCGUIRK: If you give them legal status without fixing the border, then more people will come ever because they will say, oh, once I am there, they will going to let me stay.

MCSHANE: Exactly. And then the President is just going to come back, this is what's going to happen, the President say, all right, I already fixed the border. The border is better than people will say it is, and the Republicans are saying, no, it's not, people don't want to come in.

IMUS: What if you talk to people who live along the border in Arizona, Texas and other areas, New Mexico, they don't think it is better. So, it's a quarter after the hour. What's new with you, Dagen.

DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I have got a lot of business news to do, dude. Come on, man! We've got business news. You want to hear something?
RUFINO: Hit that. MCSHANE: Hit that.
MCDOWELL: Dario Franchitti and Ashley Judd are getting a divorce. IMUS: Who?
MCDOWELL: Dario Franchitti, the IndyCar driver. IMUS: Right.
MCDOWELL: And Ashley Judd are getting a divorce. IMUS: That's too bad.
MCDOWELL: You know, what? That girl let herself go over the last few years. What? MCGUIRK: Let me get up off the floor.
IMUS: Yes. I haven't seen her.

MCDOWELL: If you've seen a picture of her in any of these races? All lousy, badly dressed kind of chunky, short hair, can't have short hair.
MCGUIRK: Right. Can be junky. MCSHANE: Car race looking at that. MCGUIRK: That's your hair, right?
MCDOWELL: That is what is going on in my world. Hey, you want some business news?


Page 43 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Well, the camera back in the greenroom yet?
MCSHANE: I think we do have one. (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER) MCSHANE: Don't we have one Tom?
TOM `BIGFOOT' BOWMAN, PROGRAM PRODUCER: We're working on it. IMUS: You don't have one yet?
BOWMAN: No, but she won't be able to speak to them. So, you just be able to -- IMUS: I don't want to speak to them. Because they are lucky I don't fire both of them. MCSHANE: Well, you just did.
IMUS: Oh, not really. MCSHANE: Of course.
IMUS: But I mean, here is the thing. If people who live in the same areas that Rob and Tony live in our late to work then they have an excuse. But if they can't get here --
MCSHANE: Next time we will coordinate. We will come in late. MCGUIRK: Well, you have certain pockets that are worse than others. MCSHANE: Exactly. The fog was pretty bad this morning.
IMUS: Oh my God!
MCGUIRK: You don't want them to speed in here and get hurt.

MCSHANE: Wait until we get the camera set-up, so we could all do the Brent Musburger thing. You're looking live.
IMUS: You're looking live with Rob and Tony. TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN: Oh, Rob. Wow! IMUS: Did you do any business news yet?
MCDOWELL: I have got good news to tell you about. You look at the futures this morning and they don't really tell the whole story, they are flat but yesterday, the Dow was up 72 to points, that is a new 52 week high, the highest close since mid October of `07 and it is only 210 points away from the Dow all-time high, we'll watch the markets again today.

And then Blackberry today starts its come back to where. The company once great smart phone makers is going to unveil two new blackberries after multiple delays in 18 months without a new phone, he's trying to stop the bleeding in its market share because both Apple and Google have been eat no way at its business, but I think this will probably be the equivalence of maybe Madonna going on another tour, dragging her raggedy broken-down
self across the stage and still croaking out like a virgin even though, well, she has probably had half of Manhattan.
IMUS: Yes.
MCDOWELL: That's him.
IMUS: Well, I don't know anybody who uses a Blackberry, do you? MCDOWELL: We have the network.
IMUS: Oh, it is?


Page 44 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCDOWELL: It has a built-in customer base among businesses. So, it needs to keep those businesses from continuing to live.
IMUS: Eighteen after the hour. Well, a lot of sports news, most in the Super Bowl. But a bigger story according to
Warner Wolf is out of New York with A-Rod and of course, he's denying that he did any of these drugs.
WOLF: Again.
IMUS: Again. But I mean, he slides them up. Well, I wonder if -- why is this story leaking now?

WOLF: Well, they found there's this guy Anthony Bush who worked for this firm and somebody got his records, this new Miami Times newspaper and on the record, man, it has A-Rod, Milky Cabrera, Manny Ramirez, Bartolo Colon and they were all suspended.

Plus, Geo Gonzalez who won 21 games with the Nets, and Nelson Cruz, the Rangers right fielder, and the book, it has names and dates and the shipment, how much they used, and they had A-Rod's name 16 times in the book.
IMUS: So, do they think -- do the Yankees think they could get out of the $100 million -- WOLF: Well, they are trying.
IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: But it is going to be tough. Now, if he suspended, say, 50 games. IMUS: Sure.
WOLF: It will cost them $7.5 million. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: But the key is the language in the contract. Now, there is a moral clause -- but does it entail drugs? In other words, can they just get rid of him? You remember Giambi had that situation that they couldn't get rid of them.

IMUS: Speaking of suspension, here's a picture you were watching on the FOX Business Network of a couple of people who were suspended on this program. There is Rob staring mournfully at the computer.
MCSHANE: Poor Rob, he is such a good guy.
IMUS: Well, that has nothing to do with the -- they can't get to work on time. Where's Tony? What happened to
Tony?
MCSHANE: He is in the empty chair next to Rob. IMUS: Well, appropriately so.
RUFINO: Checking what site Rob is looking at, right? MCSHANE: Tony Powell entering now.
IMUS: Where is Tony now? MCSHANE: Moving from right to left.
IMUS: So, they'll probably working on the behind the scenes blog. MCSHANE: It looks that way.
MCGUIRK: They'll probably looking in -- (LAUGHTER)
IMUS: Probably trying to get hold of Opie and Anthony if they need anybody.

Page 45 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCGUIRK: So, mean.
IMUS: Twenty minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. MCSHANE: So said.
IMUS: Why is it sad?
MCSHANE: Well, I don't know. I just feel for them. Both good guys.
IMUS: That is beside the point. If I don't do anything, then they just do it again. Don't they? MCSHANE: You have to lay down the law.
MCGUIRK: Uh-huh!

IMUS: Well, you have to be some, I mean, I would say to Wyatt or to anybody, there has to be some consequences.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: If there are no consequences for their behavior, then they seldom get to work on time anyway. MCSHANE: So, what are the consequences? Until we need them again kind of thing?
IMUS: Well, I look at both of those scripts, that is another thing. Rob is pretending today to be Blind Mississippi
White Boy Pig Feet Dupree.
MCSHANE: Oh, yes.
IMUS: And he has got a thing called the immigration reform blues -- MCSHANE: OK.
IMUS: And then Tony is Lightnin' Hopkins -- MCSHANE: Oh!
IMUS: And these are something about.
MCSHANE: Kind of funny, they are both blues singers today.
IMUS: Yes. So, they obviously weren't talking with another one called the sucker fired CNN blues. RUFINO: They got the blues now.
IMUS: Which a new morning show that's going to be Chris Cuomo and Aaron Burnet. MCSHANE: Oh, yes, that's the rumor. Yes. They hired Cuomo yesterday.
IMUS: The dynamic duo, everybody out of the water, I guess. Soledad O'Brien, who is a nice woman, I don't know what they're going to do with her. But she will probably get some plum assignment summer.
MCGUIRK: To the weather.
IMUS: Yes. It's 22 after the hour. Warner was trying to do sports.

WOLF: Well, besides the A-Rod story, of course, this would be the third time he has lied. The first one, remember we heard three years ago in 2009 when he was asked about drugs.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALEX RODRIGUEZ, NEW YORK YANKEES: Stopped taking it in 2003 and haven't taken it since. (END VIDEO CLIP)


Page 46 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Yes. Well, and then he said he didn't know Anthony Galea, remember the Canadian doctor and that was this proven. So, I'll tell you what, if he is on the drugs, it hasn't helped him the last two years. He has missed 103 games, he's averaged only 17 homers and just 60 RBIs. Remember, better get some new drugs.

IMUS: He's got a deer antler spray, try that. Ray Lewis out for ten games, they came back at 44 tackles and three playoffs game, it was pretty good.
WOLF: Yes. That's great. Well, who knows the after-effects of that? IMUS: Of what?
WOLF: Spraying antler deer --
IMUS: Deer antler stuff under your tongue. WOLF: Yes, I mean --
IMUS: That sounds like something Deirdre would recommend, by the way. WOLF: In three years.
MCSHANE: Are you sure that is going to work. Right? IMUS: Huh?
WOLF: Yes. The antlers growing out of his helmet. MCGUIRK: Calling him Bambi.
WOLF: And again, talking about delusional.

IMUS: Well, that is pretty good though. I mean, if you are that creative to go to deer antler spray, I would think -- yes, so, what are you going to say, Warner?
WOLF: Randy Moss, man, talk about delusional, he was lost yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RANDY MOSS, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS: I don't really live on numbers. I really live on impact in which you are able to do out on that field. So, I really do think I'm the greatest receiver to ever play this game.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WOLF: I guess he's never heard of Jerry Rice. How about three Super Bowl rings to none? IMUS: All these records, Jerry Rice.
WOLF: It's not even close.

IMUS: Plus, just even somebody unsophisticated, sports observer as I am, watch them both play. Now, right away, Jerry Rice is just better.
WOLF: Absolutely.
IMUS: Doesn't mean Randy Moss is a pretty good player.

WOLF: Yes, he was a great threat in his prime. The only thing Moss leads Rice in is career arrests. That will be about it.
MCSHANE: Ouch! IMUS: That's ugly.
WOLF: And bad news for Rex Ryan's brother Rob Ryan. He was fired, defensive coordinator of the Cowboys, he said that three weeks ago, he would only be out of work for five minutes. Well, he was turned down yesterday by Jeff Fischer and the Rams.
Page 47 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Yes.

WOLF: They said it would not be a good fit for the Rams. And the Lakers beat the Hornets last night. They almost blew an 18 point fourth quarter lead. And here it is again, it's a new role for Kobe Bryant.
IMUS: Did he have more points or assists?

WOLF: Very close. He only had 14 points but he had 11 assists and eight rebounds. So, he is passing up the ball, feeding the ball and getting rebounds. I mean, this is a new role for Kobe Bryant instead of 30 and 35 points.
IMUS: And what does he care if they win or maybe he does care? WOLF: Well, it looks like he does.
IMUS: He does, what?

WOLF: He does care. I mean, he is passing up, this is good. I think it is a nice story, that a superstar like that would pass up --
IMUS: It makes me feel good.
WOLF: The last thing, I saw, remember Rich Ackerman used to work for WFAN? IMUS: Oh, sure.
WOLF: So, ask him about that Francesca story on deadskin.com. MCGUIRK: Yes.
WOLF: And he said, no, no. He said, as far as the police escort from the studio to the airport, no, he said, what happened? He had airport, my Francesca had airport security personnel escort him to the plane once he was inside the airport.
MCGUIRK: Right.
WOLF: So that report from dead skin was not accurate. MCGUIRK: I also read it on shorts illustrated. Good point. RUFINO: Hey, where did you see that one?
IMUS: It was Francesca's show yesterday on the Yes Network. MCGUIRK: Did he not mention it?
IMUS: No, he did not. He was all over the A-Rod story. And I don't know. So, between that, the NFL Network and
ESPN.
MCSHANE: Yes, big day. IMUS: That was pretty much -- MCGUIRK: You had it all covered I-man.
IMUS: Yes. So, that stuff is tough to watch. Although, I did -- I'll tell you who is good, Deion Sanders. That guy is good.
MCSHANE: Good personality. Prime time. IMUS: So, none of them are terrible. MCSHANE: Some of them might be.
IMUS: There's a couple things I saw yesterday, really brutal. MCSHANE: Disturbing.
Page 48 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: So, don't know how they got their jobs.
MCSHANE: You can't get it out of your head.

IMUS: All right. Yes, it is just -- colors the way you think about stuff. This is just talking to Lou and Bernie about it this morning and it's just awful.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: All right. Twenty seven after the hour. Anything else?
WOLF: Well, I will end with the downer. That snowmobiler, Caleb Moore. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: It's not good. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: Remains in critical condition. Remember last Thursday, he crashed, there's no mobile and they rolled on top of him. And the family says it is almost certain he is not going to make it. So, Caleb Moore in the X Games.

IMUS: Twenty eight after the hour on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Bernie has a briefing coming up. What's there, Bernie?
MCGUIRK: We have Al Gore and David Letterman, boss. Colin Powell will get tasty with Bill O'Reilly, Gohmert
Pyle gets married, Jimmy Kimmel, Hillary Clinton, Conan O'Brien, all kinds of stuff, boss.

IMUS: Well, actually, I forgot about the O'Reilly/Colin Powell interview. So, is O'Reilly jumped ugly with him or? It was a spirited exchange, let's put it that way.
IMUS: And then what Colin Powell cop an attitude or?
MCGUIRK: I would not say a bad. No. He answered questions but it was good. It was lively. IMUS: Well, he just said, he got tasty.
MCGUIRK: That's right. I'm going to leave it at tasty.
IMUS: Oh, OK. This is on my rodeo play list. I've never heard this play on the radio but let. (MUSIC PLAYING)

IMUS: Dagen?
MCSHANE: That's my fault.
MCDOWELL: That is Connell's fault. You're trying to talk to me earlier -- MCSHANE: Hold on a second. Let's start again, I-man.
(LAUGHTER)
IMUS: I love the idea.
(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)
.that you have, control over her microphone, Connell. MCSHANE: Let's try it again, I-man.
IMUS: All right. MCSHANE: Yes.
MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir. (LAUGHTER)
IMUS: This is great.
MCDOWELL: It's nice to see someone has more estrogen than I do.
MCSHANE: I love that job, so much fun. This is business relate taken, hurry up. IMUS: Yes, come on, hurry up.
RUFINO: Relate taken, hurry up. (LAUGHTER)
MCDOWELL: Jerk.
IMUS: We don't have time for all of this.
MCDOWELL: OK. We have time to look at Connell's cavs in the morning. MCSHANE: That's right.
IMUS: Twenty five until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. This portion of the program sponsored by the Hackensack University Medical Center, a place where medicine beats innovation. I don't know. So, what I'm supposed to do if you two are so irresponsible that you can't get to work on time when every
Theresa downstairs, she lives where you live, Staten Island, she gets to work, yes, of course. So, you have no excuse. And you -- he lives on Long Island. How is it that you two are the only two people out of everybody here?
BARTLETT: The traffic was obviously different when he came in and I came in. MCSHANE: I was in earlier then than Rob every morning.
BARTLETT: I mean, that is, you know, was not -- obviously it was not an intentional act.
IMUS: OK. So, here is your punishment.


Page 50 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: And don't think you can do it sarcastically. You have to write flattering things about me in the inside the blog thing instead of the awful things that you write about me. You are fired. How does that sound? See if they want to hire you.
POWELL: I will miss you.
IMUS: Well, OK, fine. So, he is fired. MCSHANE: And Rob will be writing --
IMUS: You should be writing yourself, right? MCSHANE: Without a doubt.
BARTLETT: Yes.
IMUS: You don't want to write that? BARTLETT: I will do whatever it will take. MCSHANE: I will write anything.
BARTLETT: I have many bills and children still yet to go through college. IMUS: He told it's fine, he doesn't have to worry about that, so. BARTLETT: He saved his money.
IMUS: Yes, OK. Good. All right. Time for a Bernie briefing, 23 until the hour. And with that Bernard McGuirk. Good morning, B.

MCGUIRK: Good morning, boss. Former Vice President Al Gore, he's got a new book out and it's all about the great masseuses of our time called Robin tag.
MCSHANE: Yes.
MCGUIRK: And he's got a foreword written by John Travolta by the way. MCSHANE: Perfect.
MCGUIRK: And has a happy ending. Believe it or not. So, anyway, yesterday he is on with Matt Lauer and he's talking about his new book on climate change and of course, he sold al-Jazeera, he sold his TV Network, Current TV to al-Jazeera which is funded by big oil and this is how he explains the hypocrisy on all of that stuff. Take a listen to him with Matt Lauer.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

FMR. VICE PRES. AL GORE, UNITED STATES: I certainly understand that criticism. I disagree with it. Because I think al-Jazeera has obviously long since established itself as a really distinguished and effective news gathering organization. And by the way, its climate coverage has been far more extensive and of high-quality --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCGUIRK: Oh, God! Just talk about one of the most unlikable people ever to enter politics and exit politics. IMUS: Ever to be born.
IMUS: That God created.

MCGUIRK: He's down with John Edwards this guy and in any case, Matt Lauer never asked him about the fact that al-Jazeera is an America hating, Jew hating terrorist loving network that you sold it the country out, your quisling but he went on David Letterman last night, did Al Gore, Letterman wasn't as charitable as Matt Lauer. So, anyway, take a listen to David Letterman questioning Al Gore on al-Jazeera.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

Page 51 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MATT LAUER, NBC ANCHOR: Now, why do we think of al-Jazeera as something not right going on there in terms of the good for Americans? Why do we think that they may be propaganda for Muslim violence and terrorism?

GORE: Well, it is certainly not. And many years ago, it put some videos on in the Arabic version that I think were misinterpreted. But the Al- Jazeera English and now al-Jazeera America really high quality stuff.
(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCGUIRK: Great stuff. Never answer the question. Anyway, the two of them went out and got massages afterwards and this guy is making the rounds and it is just gross, it's what it is, chief.

And Colin Powell last night, as you know boss has been going around talking about the Republican Party, he voted for Obama the last two times. Lot of people say, you know republican, what's up with that? Anyway, he went on with O'Reilly, O'Reilly challenged him and all that.

And O'Reilly made the claim, or he repeated the claim that Colin Powell was bitter because he got stung by the weapons of mass destruction thing, he did Cheney's bidding and he looks bad in the eyes of his liberal friends and that's why he's hammering Republicans and he responded as follows. Colin Powell.

That is a bunch of nonsense. I presented the information we all had from the intelligence community and when I went to the U.N., it was with the assurance of the CIA that the information I had was correct. Mr. Cheney had the same information, the President did, all of our commanders thought it was correct and we all were saying so, the Congress voted on the basis of that information four months earlier before I spoke. And so, I made a choice based on the information I had and I don't have.

IMUS: Of course, we were saying on this program that there weren't any weapons of mass destruction. And Bernard was the first to say it, it was nonsense. How is it that that we knew? How did we know and they did know? Can you explain that to me, Bernie? Go ahead.

MCGUIRK: I can't explain it. I can't explain it. But he wasn't finished. He did get a little testy towards the end of that clip. But in any case, it doesn't matter. Jimmy Kimmel, boss --
IMUS: Well, I want to see where he got testy? MCSHANE: You probably have to play the whole thing. MCGUIRK: Yes, it's too long, man.
IMUS: How testy did he get?

MCGUIRK: You know, just a little bit. I don't have to answer silly stupid questions like that or something, that's what he said.
IMUS: Oh, he did? What did Bill say?
MCGUIRK: That was the end of the interview right there. IMUS: It was?
MCGUIRK: Yes. But you had to be there, I guess, boss. MCSHANE: Yes.
MCGUIRK: Anyway, let's jump to Jimmy Kimmel here. IMUS: All right.
MCGUIRK: Here we go. A couple of jokes from your friend Jimmy Kimmel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JIMMY KIMMEL, STAND-UP COMEDIAN: In China, they are about to premiere a new sitcom. I didn't even know they had sitcoms in China but this sitcom is based on the show friends. The Chinese saw how popular friends became in the United States and only 18-and-a-half years later decided to make their own version of it. The

MCSHANE: Pretty good, right?
MCGUIRK: And a good time was had by all.
IMUS: Well, I want to see the end of the Colin Powell thing. MCSHANE: I know that's what you were thinking.
RUFINO: Of course, that's not legal.
MCSHANE: The only thing he was thinking about. IMUS: Can we do that?
BOWMAN: Yes, I got it. IMUS: All right. Let me hear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COLIN POWELL, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: That is a bunch of nonsense. I presented the information that we all had from the intelligence community and when I went to U.N., it was with the assurance of the CIA that the information I had was correct.

Mr. Cheney use that same information, the President did, all of our commanders thought it was correct and we all were saying so. The Congress voted on the basis of that information four months earlier before I spoke. And so, I made a choice based on the information I had and I don't have to answer idiotic questions like that one about whether I am mad at somebody.
(END VIDEO CLIP) MCGUIRK: There you go.
MCSHANE: It was an idiotic question. MCGUIRK: That's it.
IMUS: Well, when Connell Powell said, I don't have to answer idiotic questions like that, what did Bill say?

MCGUIRK: Well, Bill couched in such a way, he says that, you know the criticism, or the speculation that is out there, it wasn't to direct a question from him.
IMUS: Oh, I see.

MCGUIRK: So he just threw it out there and then that was the response and then they moved on. Actually, that was the end of the interview right there.
RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE) IMUS: You do? RUFINO: Yes.

MCSHANE: Oh, man!
BARTLETT: What do you mean pansies? IMUS: You just are.
BARTLETT: You want us to get like all defiant and have Tony get all, you know, Eldridge Cleaver and fight back? You know, we know when the I-man is in a bad mood just to leave him alone.
IMUS: No, no. Here is the point. I am in constant pain. Are you aware of that? (TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)
BARTLETT: No, you never mentioned it.
IMUS: I am in constant pain and I am dead tired. BARTLETT: OK.

IMUS: Why?
BARTLETT: I am begging you. IMUS: Why would you want me to?
BARTLETT: Because you will see what will happen. MCSHANE: Oh!
POWELL: Now who is the pansy? (LAUGHTER)
MCSHANE: Don't do anything else. That's all right.
IMUS: Well, when you put it that way. Hey, Carley. Go get Bo on the phone. POWELL: Does he still have Mango (ph) brothers?

DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the Fox Business
Network. And now here's Diane Macedo.
DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning everyone.

Chrysler group is reporting a fourth quarter net income of $378 million, up 68 percent from the $225 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $17.15 billion compared to just over $15 billion last year. The automaker says it expects to earn a net income of $2.2 billion in 2013.

We're set to get two pieces of economic data before the opening bell this morning including the first look at growth in the fourth quarter. Analysts expect Gross Domestic Product to rise just 1.1 percent for the quarter due to businesses adding less stock to their warehouses and cuts in government spending. That would be the slowest growth rate in nearly two years and a big drop from the 3.1 percent we saw in the third quarter. That number comes our way at 8:30 Eastern.

Shortly before that at 8:15 we'll get the ADP private sector payroll report for January 165,000 jobs are expected to have been added this month down from $215,000 in December. That report comes ahead of the important
monthly jobs report which is released on Friday. That report is expected to show the economy added 160,000 non-farm jobs while the unemployment rate is expected to stay at 7.8 percent.

Checking the markets now here in the U.S. futures are fairly flat this morning, Dow and S&P at exactly that unchanged line, the NASDAQ is up just two points there. In Europe we also have been seeing huge volatility there. The European Commission's monthly measure of confidence in the Eurozone rose for a third straight
month but Spain's GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in the final three months of last year and that has markets there fairly flat as well. London is up about four points Paris and Frankfurt are both to the downside.

Let's take a close look though of what's moving those markets now with Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London. Jane the chief executive of Pinco is warning David Cameron get a Plan B in place to limit the impact on the economy if the U.K. were to exit the E.U. Now how real is the possibility of that exit? And do you agree that Cameron needs a Plan B?

JANE FOLEY, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT RABOBANK: Well perhaps he does. But of course, if there is a referendum about the U.K's situation within the E.U. it won't happen until at least 2017 or thereabouts. So this is something which will be a long time brewing and certainly won't come to a conclusion soon.

But there is also a talk about Plan B in the U.K. with respect to the government needing that because of its budget guidelines. And that is perhaps something which is a lot more present to the market right now. There are fears
that the government could continue failing to hit its debt reduction target and that the U.K. could lose its AAA
credit rating. So, lots have talked about Plan B for the U.K. all around.
MACEDO: Yes and speaking of fears Jane investors though seem pretty cautious ahead of this U.S. fed -- of this
U.S. Fed call. I wonder what is it that investors are hoping to hear from the Central Bank today.

FOLEY: Well of course most economists expect that the fed will just reiterate this very accumulative policy stunt after all the Fed has indicated that it's got a long way to go in terms of these and before that unemployment rate drops. And we don't think that the fed could step away from easing -- quantitative easing until the end of the year bearing in mind its commitment to the unemployment rate in the U.S.

But of course there's been a lot of optimism in the market this year. Yields have been rising and core asset markets has been looking for higher yield in assets to put its money on and some people think perhaps the fed could begin to become a bit more hawkish over the next couple of months.
MACEDO: All right, that's Jane Foley of Rabobank in London. We always appreciate it Jane, thanks. FOLEY: Thank you.
MACEDO: And we have earnings in now from Northrop Grumman, the defense contractor is reporting a profit of
$2.06 a share topping the estimates for a $1.74, revenue came in that was also a beat $6.48 billion the estimate
was $6.33 billion.

We also have earnings in from Rockwell Automation. That company is reporting a profit of adjusted $1.23 a share. The estimate there was $1.27. Revenue came in a slight beat at $1.49 billion beating the estimates by
$1.48 billion. That was the estimate, $1.48 billion.

Meanwhile, it looks like UPS's effort required TNT Express is officially dead. As expected E.U. antitrust regulators have blocked UPS's $7 billion bid to acquire the Dutch shipping company saying the proposed merger would
have reduced competition in 15 E.U. countries. Earlier this month UPS said it would withdraw its offer because of E.U. regulators' concerns. The deal would give the company access to TNT stronger networks and fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.
Here's a look at commodities. Oil and gold are up at the moment. We have oil up by about 32 cents, gold is up $3. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.
CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING. IMUS: Well you know Dr. Bill Evans if you can talk to him live he's pretty good. Isn't he?
CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Very good. LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes.
MCSHANE: Yes.
RUFINO: Yes that really --
IMUS: Try to get Dr. Bill when that whole Lis show thing was going down over there. MCSHANE: In the overnight it will be 46.
IMUS: If -- well, he could have told me has was a gynecologist and a little mental action there, right Dagen or no? DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I suppose so.
IMUS: Sure.
MCDOWELL: If you want to go around bragging about not being or being a gynecologist. IMUS: Yes that's a good point.
MCSHANE: He's a good doctor.
MCDOWELL: Every man thinks he's a gynecologist by the way.
IMUS: Sure so Dr. Bill Evans who lives in old Greenwich, Connecticut -- it's a beautiful area up there. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: Every (inaudible) -- he managed to make it to work on time. MCSHANE: He indeed yes.
IMUS: But you two didn't.
ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: He wasn't having to drive on the L-I-E. MCSHANE: No.
IMUS: Well no --
BARTLETT: Behind somebody who is doing 40 miles an hour with their blinkers on in the left lane. IMUS: The L-I-E doesn't go to Connecticut.
BARTLETT: That's true, that will be the difference why he got on time.

TONY POWELL, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Staten Island express way is the parking lot. Quote, unquote, "It is blocked up from Fort Hamilton, right up to the Battery Tunnel" quote, unquote. "Parking lot from Staten Island, parking lot in Brooklyn" quote, unquote. Now, Teresa got to work on time.

Page 57 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: Yes.
POWELL: Yes she did, what time she leaves. IMUS: She comes in at 2:00 in the morning. POWELL: 2:00 in the morning.
IMUS: Well ok.
MCSHANE: Not many shows have a -- (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: So Warner --
WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes. IMUS: I guess the bigger deal, we've got Ray Lewis. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: At the Super Bowl characterizing the allegation that he was taking some deer antler spray. WOLF: Right.
IMUS: Is stupid, but a bigger story is apparently A-Rod being back, being more steroids about him right? WOLF: Yes the A-Rod story is much bigger.
IMUS: Tell me why?
WOLF: Because number one he already lied back in 2009 -- IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: Saying he only took it in 2001, '02, '03 --
IMUS: He is just an awful human being. He -- I mean he just -- he wreaked phoniness when he was in Seattle. WOLF: Yes.
BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: He got nice eye brow. MCSHANE: Yes he does.
WOLF: And then he lied about -- IMUS: He's a creep.
WOLF: He lied about knowing Dr. Anthony Gallia who admitted that he was guilty of handing out HGH to ballplayers.
IMUS: Yes.
MCGUIRK: I can see Oprah rubbing her bands right now. MCSHANE: Exactly.
WOLF: so it looks bad for him.
IMUS: Yes.



Page 58 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: I mean, either way -- the best scenario for him would be that he is only suspended 50 games which would cost him $7.5 million.

IMUS: You don't have to be -- you don't have to test positive to be suspended. You can be suspended next time just these allegations, right? Or if they're proven, right?
WOLF: They have to be proven. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: But supposedly -- (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: But you don't have to test positive, right. You don't know. WOLF: I don't know. I would think so.
MCGUIRK: Sure.
IMUS: Well then why would he suspended 50 games?
WOLF: Well, they have to find out that he was tested positive like Milky Cabrera, Manny Ramirez, Bartolo Colon. MCSHANE: He's hurt anyway now so he's not playing for --
IMUS: He's not going to play anyway. MCSHANE: Maybe the whole year there. WOLF: He could be out for the year. MCSHANE: The best ways for the Yankees --
IMUS: The Yankees are trying to crawl under that $100 million. RUFINO: Oh I wonder why?
WOLF: Absolutely sure.
MCSHANE: The best case for them is that he never played again and they can have insurance pay the -- WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Or he's healthy or not. MCSHANE: That he never plays.
WOLF: Well this guy -- Anthony Bosh according to this New Times -- New Miami Times, he has books and records from 2009 to 2012.
IMUS: The only thing I thought was suspicious was on the records -- (CROSSTALK)
WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: -- he is listed as Alex R. and A-Rod and -- (CROSSTALK)
WOLF: Right.

IMUS: -- because they claim the records are phony but and Alex Rodriguez hired defense attorney Roy Black who I think -- more of the more famous slime ball defense attorney on the planet.


Page 59 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: So I mean, he always represents people who clearly are guilty. But -- the records seem phony. WOLF: Why is that?
IMUS: Well just because if you're -- if the guy is buying illegal stuff from you. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Wouldn't you think he would use phony names and so on? You wouldn't identify -- you wouldn't write -- you wouldn't write Alex R. or A-Rod or --
MCGUIRK: It could be Jeter or something. IMUS: I mean, anything, yes.
MCSHANE: Yes exactly right. IMUS: Exactly.
WOLF: Well -- well supposedly this guy's character is people said that he's a braggart and that he thought he went around boasting Anthony Bosh and hey look I've got A-Rod. So he also called him Cacique, A-Rod.
IMUS: What does that mean?

WOLF: Well it was a pre-Columbian chief, a chief of the Caribbean. And so he put his name in like he's a king or something.
MCSHANE: I see.

WOLF: But he's -- I mean, if these are true I mean, he's got dates and the shipment and how much A-Rod owed and he says he took HGH IGF which I've never heard of. But that stimulates much muscle growth and endurance and something called Sub Q which is a cocktail that combines HGH and IGF.
MCSHANE: The IGF that's the stuff in the deer antlers, by the way. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: You know by the way as much as my shoulders hurt. WOLF: Yes.
MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: And other various injuries that I constantly have, I would take all that stuff. MCSHANE: In a heartbeat.
IMUS: In a heartbeat. If I give me some deer antler spray, I would be sucking on that stuff now. MCSHANE: Come over here Bambi.
WOLF: Wow.

IMUS: All right, 11 after the hour. All of that is coming. Dagen is here and Lou Rufino is here, Bernard and everybody. Lightning Hopkins, (inaudible) so we've got it covered. But let's do -- Carley is around somewhere.
Let's do some news now and here with that is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell. MCSHANE: Good morning I-Man.
A man walked into a school bus in Alabama, got on the bus shot and killed the driver yesterday.
IMUS: God.

Page 60 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: He took a 6-year-old boy hostage. Here is one of the children speaking about the incident who was on that bus.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I told him that he needed a key because something about the law coming after him and then he shot the bus driver and the bus -- the driver's foot was on the gas and we went backwards and everybody started screaming and then the bus driver was still there and we just all - - we all got off the bus and went to the neighbor's house.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCSHANE: Man so the six year old. IMUS: Oh God poor little thing.
MCSHANE: I know horrible. This little girl was on there and saw the whole thing. IMUS: Jesus, come on.
MCSHANE: So the 6-year-old boy got taken and it still hasn't been resolved. I mean the last that we heard that he was holding this little boy in some sort of an underground storm shelter or bunker of some sort. The guy was -- that's the story out of Alabama.

A Senate hearing today on gun-control in Washington, the first hearing since the Newtown shooting; some of the prepared remarks from Wayne LaPierre from the National Rifle Association. He will say that law-abiding gun owners will not except blame for the acts of violence of deranged criminals. Wayne LaPierre.
And the three -- (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: He should be down in Huntsville. Hook him up with that woman that got electrocuted. MCSHANE: LaPierre should?
IMUS: Yes what a creep. Oh God.

MCSHANE: Maybe slightly on a strong side but that woman by the way was not executed last night. They put it off.

IMUS: Lights are not damn in Huntsville, 13 after the hour. Lights are flickering again. 13 after the hour. I paid the bill. And here's Dagen McDowell with some business news. Good morning Dagen.

MCDOWELL: Good morning sir. Dow futures are up two points and the industrials are just 210 points away from that all-time high. Hit back in October of 2007.
IMUS: When are they going to have qualifying for the Daytona 500?

MCDOWELL: It is not -- it's the weekend before the last weekend, the 500 is on the 24 of February I think which is a Sunday, the weekend before that.
IMUS: All right so we need to know if Danica Patrick is either wins the poll or is in the first row. MCDOWELL: I will let you know. I will not be hiding that information. If I'm wrong -- (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: Well no -- even we can figure that out. Gunz and Warner. MCSHANE: Sure.
MICHAEL GUNZELMAN, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes.
MCSHANE: Gunz is all over the poll.

Page 61 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Gunz is all over this.
WOLF: Oh yes. GUNZELMAN: I love women.
IMUS: Gunz wants to see you eat hot dog on TV. RUFINO: I want to see the hot dog, yes. MCSHANE: Yes the first time he's watched. IMUS: That would be fine Dagen, what else?
MCDOWELL: Oh so fast food restaurants -- you're going to love this. These chains want to ensure that everybody is good and bloated and fat on Super Bowl Sunday. They are rolling out mega meals in giant packages to feed a bunch of folks on game day. Here are my personal favorites a 40-piece chicken McNugget from McDonald's, KFC's new game day bucket comes with 26 pieces of chicken and then the top of the bucket converts into a bowl that's full of wings and chicken bite so you can pass around to your friends and then Taco Bell has a variety taco
12 pack. Comes in a package that looks like a tool box and in fact Taco Bell was running an ad that it called mocking people to bring vegetables to the big game.
MCSHANE: Yes.
MCSHANE: So I am sure "Blonde on Blonde" might have something to say that --

IMUS: You're absolutely right Deirdre Imus will be in here with her tasty Super Bowl snacks sucking the joy out of even that day.
MCSHANE: All right.
IMUS: It's 14 after the hour. Here is Warner with some sports. Good morning Warner. WOLF: Good morning I-Man.
So once again the Yankees are trying to get out of that five years left on the deal for $114 million for A-Rod and they're hoping that the story is right. Well, A-Rod has lied twice already. The first one came, you remember, he had always said -- in fact, remember he was on Katie Couric a long time ago -- he said no, I never took drugs. Well then, of course, in 2009 he said this.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
ALEX RODRIGUEZ, MLB PLAYER: I stopped taking it in 2003 and haven't taken it since. (END AUDIO CLIP)
WOLF: Well. And then he lied about knowing the Canadian doctor, Anthony Gallia who pleaded guilty for dispensing drugs. And A-Rod's firm, of course, denies the story.

The other story, of course, Ray Lewis in today's "Sports Illustrated" says Lewis asked for Antler Deer products that could speed up his recovery from the torn bicep.
IMUS: And you think that would be ok, wouldn't you?
WOLF: Well, it's a banned substance as far as the NFL goes. IMUS: It seems unreasonable to me.
MCSHANE: It's the same stuff Warner mentioned. That IGF1 is in there. WOLF: So they -- apparently they take the stuff.
IMUS: I wonder if it could help my rotator cuffs and whatever else I have going on.



Page 62 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Could be. Well, they say endurance helps muscle growth. Sure, why don't you try it and let us know. In fact, wait a minute. You could do it on the air and Mason could sell it.
MCSHANE: Very good.
IMUS: That's a great idea. We'll run it by Deirdre -- the girl will be out of here in a few minutes -- WOLF: Sure.
IMUS: See what she thinks about. She's for all-natural products and that's a natural product. Deer Antler spray. MCSHANE: Perfect.
WOLF: They freeze the deer antlers substance, and they shake it, it says, for twenty-second and then you have to spray it under your tongue three times.
So you could say "This moment brought to you --
IMUS: She gives me stuff that I have to put under my tongue all the time anyway -- MCSHANE: What?
IMUS: Holistic stuff. So this is something right up her alley. She -- let's hope the hair dryer's on back there now so she's not hearing this part of the program. Yes, because she won't know anything about the deer antler. We'll see if we can get her to buy it. Something out there (ph). What else?
WOLF: We have Randy Moss who thinks he is the greatest. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
RANDY MOSS, SAN FRANSCISCO 49ERS: I don't really live on numbers. I really live on impact and what you are able to do out on that field. So I really do think that I'm the greatest receiver ever to play this game.
(END AUDIO CLIP) WOLF: Oh man.
IMUS: You may ask Jerry Rice (ph), of course.

WOLF: Yes, Rice has -- he has over 500 more catches, over 7,600 more yards than Moss and 46 more touchdowns than Moss.
IMUS: And three more Super Bowls and Randy Moss has zero Super Bowl rings. WOLF: And finally I-Man --
IMUS: Sure.
WOLF: -- watch out for Super Bowl scams. Here is one. A woman in San Jose purchased four tickets for the
Super Bowl for $6,000 from a man on Craigslist --
IMUS: Good God Almighty.

WOLF: -- who said he was a tax attorney in Boca and was a Ravens season ticket holder and couldn't go because his wife was eight months pregnant. She sent the $6,000 to the man's credit union and received a Federal Express package with a picture of Joe Flacco and a message saying "Enjoy the game. Go Ravens."
RUFINO: Yes. Nice.
WOLF: But there's a good finish to the story. IMUS: Sure.
WOLF: Ticket master gave her four free tickets. The 49ers gave her a couple tickets plus a breakfast with Troy
Aikman. So it turns out well.

Page 63 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: I wonder will Joe will be with Troy.
MCSHANE: Joe Buck, yes.
IMUS: All right. 18 after the hour -- Bernie has a briefing coming up. What's there B?
MCGUIRK: We have Dr. Phil, Manti Te'o, Hillary Clinton on running for President. Some late night laughs for the
I-man.
IMUS: All right. 18 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Bruce Springsteen wrote this. I
think this is the better versions and Bruce's. The great Levon Helm.
(MUSIC)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACEDO: Good morning everyone. I'm Diane Macedo.
And shares of Amazon are up more than five percent in the pre-market despite disappointing fourth quarter
results. Thanks to improvements in the company's gross margins and sales. The online retailer reported a profit of
21 cents a share -- 7 cents shy of what Wall Street was looking for. And while revenue was up 22 percent from a
year ago at $21.27 billion, it also fell short of the estimate for more than $22 billion. Amazon's gross margins
came in just 24 percent, up from nearly 21 percent.

Let's take a look at futures now. It's been a fairly flat morning. We have Dow futures up one, the S&P is now down half a point, the Nasdaq is up two. Looking at commodities, those are in the green. We have oil up by about 50 cents. Gold is up $2.
IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MCDOWELL: You know what; she needs to suck it up. She has a job on television. People have told me they hope I die from cancer and call me pancake -- chest.
IMUS: Pancake what? MCDOWELL: Chest, chest.
MCGUIRK: That e-mail that that guy sent was a manifestation of the message that media executives and society sends to overweight women every day. For every hot girl you see TV some fat girl got discriminated against.
(CROSSTALK)
IMUS: That will be fine -- Lou.
MCDOWELL: I thought it was a compliment but apparently not. RUFINO: I take it as one.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
IMUS: All right 25 after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. And now with e-mails is Carley
Shimkus. Good morning Carley.
Carley: Good morning.
IMUS: What do we have here?

CARLEY: This first one here is from Don Marron from Allentown, Pa. Don writes in and says, "Joe Theisman's prostate is giving me fits too. I cannot possibly watch that commercial again. It would be less painful to watch him break his leg again every 20 minutes that see that godforsaken commercial instead."
IMUS: Hating on poor old Joe Theisman, isn't it Warner?


Page 64 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Yes, come on.
IMUS: That was awful when he broke his leg, remember that. (inaudible) WOLF: -- jumped in. Come on, get him out; get a stretcher.
IMUS: All right. Time now for a Bernie Briefing and here with that is Bernard McGuirk. Good morning B.

MCGUIRK: Good morning boss. And you talk about throw grandpa from the train, here's former Democratic National Chairman Ed Rendell on Joe Biden getting out of Hillary's way if she wants to run for president. Take a listen.

ED RENDELL, FORMER CHAIRMAN, DNC: And I think down the road if Hillary decides to run President Obama will be the peacemaker who talks to the vice president.

I love Joe Biden. I think he's done a great job. I think he may be the best vice president in my lifetime. But you can't stay out of the way of history and history is poised for the first woman president if Hillary Clinton chooses to go down that road.
(END AUDIO CLIP)

MCGUIRK: Sorry Pop, you're out. Ok, what you did -- what kind of a clown you made out of yourself for last four years.
IMUS: Let's not write off Chris Christie, yet
MCSHANE: The other party.
MCGUIRK: Yes, Connell, let's not write off Chris Christie. MCSHANE: Right. Bad idea.
MCGUIRK: So anyway, here is Hillary Clinton on running for president, herself. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, it doesn't factor in at all. I have no doubt that I am healthy enough and my stamina is great enough and I will be fully recovered to do whatever I choose to do. I am looking forward to some very quiet time catching up on everything from sleep to reading to walking with my family.

I think it is hard to imagine for me what it will be like next week when I wake up and have nowhere to go and maybe I will go back to sleep for a change.

MCGUIRK: Now, according to "The New York Post" columnist Michael Goodwin she can get up and go run on a treadmill. He writes this morning in the "New York Post" sitting next to the thin, spiffy president, the rolly polly Secretary of State chose a brightly colored jacket that stood out, you know, like a magenta pumpkin stands out.

Ouch. Man, the lady is just retiring. How about, you know, a watch or Godspeed or see you down wrote or something, I don't know. That's a little rough.
IMUS: A little ugly. MCGUIRK: Yes.
And here is Conan O'Brien on that infamous notorious interview by Steve Kroft on "60 Minutes" of Hillary and
President Obama. Take a listen to Conan
RUFINO: Which one? MCGUIRK: The Conan, Obama. IMUS: Any time now.

MCSHANE: Ok. It's going to be good though. We are just all waiting. It is coming. What is the problem? Lou doesn't have it. We don't have a lot of time.
MCGUIRK: We are out. Done.

IMUS: All right. 28 after the hour. Blondes are next. Maybe Lou and Bernard can get on the same page over there on the seventeenth floor.

DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. We have earnings in from Boeing now. The plane makers reporting an adjusted profit of $1.46 a share topping the estimate for $1.19. But revenue was a slight miss. It came in at $22.3 billion. The estimate there was for 22.36 billion. We also have earnings in from Marathon Petroleum, that company reported an adjusted profit of $2.26, also topping the estimate for $2.10. Revenue and other income came to $20.68 billion. The estimate there 19.07 billion.

The Federal Reserve is set to wrap up its two-day policy meeting this morning and analysts predict the Fed will stick with its plan allowing consumers and businesses to borrow at cheap rates in an effort to help the economy. The Central Bank has promised to hold interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent as long as the inflation doesn't threaten to top 2.5 percent. The Fed adds that it could take until the end of 2015. Fox Business will have coverage of the Fed's policy decision when it's released at 2:15 p.m. Eastern. Now, let's get
the latest on weather from meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business weather center. Hey, Maria.

MARIA MOLINA, FOX METEOROLOGIST: Hey, good morning, Diane. Good to see you , good morning, everyone. And today we're tracking a very dangerous storm system that's producing tornadoes. It already has the history of doing so throughout the overnight hours and also damaging wind gusts across places from
southeastern Louisiana all the way up into areas across the Great Lakes. We're also seeing that threat of flooding from some of these storms because, Diane, we're seeing very heavy rain in a short amount of time and believe it or not, Diane, on the backing of the system, heavy snow falling across parts of Iowa and Wisconsin, so all kinds
of weather associated with the storm.

MACEDO: All right. That's Maria Molina from the weather center. Thanks, Maria. "Imus in the Morning" continues right now.

DON IMUS, FBN ANCHOR: All right. 25 until the hour here on the "IMUS IN THE IMUS IN THE MORNING" program. Time for "Blonde on Blonde" with Lis Wiehl and Deirdre Imus. Good morning, Ms. Imus.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Good morning. IMUS: Good morning, Ms. Wiehl.
LIS WIEHL: Good morning, Mr. Imus.
IMUS: Why was there delayed action here? DEIRDRE IMUS: That was me.
IMUS: OK.
MCSHANE: Here we go.

IMUS: Now, before we get to today's topics, Ray Lewis who is playing in the Super Bowl, one of the great linebackers of all time, apparently, is purportedly used some deer antlers spray ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes.
IMUS: ... to aid in the healing of his torn triceps. What are triceps? DEIRDRE IMUS: Do you see that right there?
IMUS: Right.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Check it out.
Page 66 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WIEHL: Right. In your arm.
(CROSSTALK) WIEHL: Upper part ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: That's biceps ... WIEHL: Biceps ...
IMUS: So, let's ...
WIEHL: Biceps, Triceps - OK. IMUS: That's the thing ... (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: I'm not - I don't have the patience for you to talk over me while I am trying to talk. DEIRDRE IMUS: Oh, stop it with your attitude.
IMUS: So - so - OK, don't talk to me like that or you will be in a time out. DEIRDRE IMUS: You need some deer antlers, Jeez.
IMUS: OK, here's the thing ... MCSHANE: Oh-ho.
IMUS: Here's the thing. (LAUGHTER)
IMUS: It's a natural product, wouldn't you agree? Deer antler spray. Stuff from ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes, it is actually - that's why they're apparently - he was using it as an alternative to steroids. IMUS: OK, but it has a banned substance in it.
DEIRDRE IMUS: IGF-1. IMUS: OK.
DEIRDRE IMUS: That's the banned substance that is -- and that's why they're ... IMUS: But is that harmful to your body?
WIEHL: IGF or the deer antlers stuff?
IMUS: Well, IGF is in the deer antlers stuff? DEIRDRE IMUS: Right.
IMUS: Is it?
DEIRDRE IMUS: I'm not sure. IMUS: OK.
DEIRDRE IMUS: I know it's been used - the Chinese have been using the deer antlers spray for years. IMUS: Would you allow me to use it?
DEIRDRE IMUS: I don't know. We would have to talk to your doctors about that, too. What would you need it for? You mean because you want to get more buff, or is it for other reasons? Just strong ...

Page 67 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Because I am in pain!
MCSHANE: Right. Come on. IMUS: Where have you been?
DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, I know, he didn't jump to that. IMUS: Do you live where I live?
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, that is like a steroid, another steroid ... IMUS: No, it's not.
DEIRDRE IMUS: You're going to be on. IMUS: It's not a steroid.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, the IGF-1, and that's why antler - they use it, because antlers grow so quickly ... IMUS: Right.
DEIRDRE IMUS: And the reason why is because of the natural growth hormone. The human, which - it's a deer hormone.
MCSHANE: It's anabolic. IMUS: OK.
DEIRDRE IMUS: That's exactly. So ... IMUS: Where can you get it? MCSHANE: Right. From a deer.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Probably that Chinese doctor that we know. I bet you, you can get it. MCSHANE: Or the Chinese ...
(CROSSTALK)
IMUS: The Chinese doctor I used to go to? DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes.
IMUS: That's ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: I guarantee he has a bottle sitting in there. (LAUGHTER)
MCSHANE: You get it from a Chinese dealer. IMUS: But I am ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: I'm telling you.
IMUS: So, my question is could I use it?

DEIRDRE IMUS: And he also did laser - like light therapy as well at night on the triceps to help heal it, too. He did other modalities. Not just - and it as funny, because when they had the interview - they had him recorded, he was asking if he should spray it on his triceps and his elbow.
(CROSSTALK)



Page 68 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, I mean it's funny to me only because those things, it's like homeopathy. You spray under your tongue, or you put things under your tongue and let them dissolve, and then they go through your system.
IMUS: Another personal - how well do you know O'Reilly? You're on his show every week. WIEHL: Yeah, I did seven years of radio with him.
IMUS: OK. Do you know the ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: Like doing time, it sounds like. (LAUGHTER)
DEIRDRE IMUS: Did seven years. WIEHL: Seven years. (LAUGHTER)
IMUS: I kind of like O'Reilly. I know a lot of people don't. But I don't why I like him. He is not a bad guy, is he? WIEHL: Not a bad guy at all.
IMUS: OK, but some of his ideas are - do you know that you can't email him? WIEHL: I do know that.
IMUS: Why is that?

WIEHL: He - he does not know a BlackBerry for a blueberry from a raspberry. I mean, he really is horrible with that. So, the man is brilliant in a lot of ways ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: That is ridiculous. WIEHL: But computers ...
IMUS: That's absurd ...
WIEHL: That's absurd. And you ... (CROSSTALK)
WIEHL: He will be the first to admit it. He will be the first to admit that I'm not speaking behind his back, because he would say this to you.
IMUS: He can't operate an iPhone or a BlackBerry?
WIEHL: He just - he just doesn't want to be bothered with it. He really doesn't. DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, he doesn't come across ...
IMUS: So there's no way to communicate with him. (CROSSTALK)
WIEHL: Just go up to his office. IMUS: What?
WIEHL: He is here, right in the office. Go to the office. Knock on the door, call him. IMUS: Where is his office?
WIEHL: You don't even know where ...
IMUS: Well, I don't --

Page 69 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
(CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: It sounds like a lot of lame excuses. IMUS: But you can't get it (inaudible) anyway. MCSHANE: Yeah.
IMUS: All right.
DEIRDRE IMUS: You can't get in touch, and he doesn't use e-mail, he doesn't know how. I mean ... WIEHL: He's a - I have not ...
IMUS: That's absurd.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Is he completely dysfunctional?

WIEHL: No, he just doesn't understand that stuff. I'm not even kidding. On the radio, all those years he was keep referring to my BlueBerry and I would still - It's a BlackBerry.
IMUS: Oh, that's -- (CROSSTALK) IMUS: That's phony.
DEIRDRE IMUS: That is phony. That's totally phony.
IMUS: 21 - 21 till the hour here on the "IMUS IN THE MORNING" program. DEIRDRE IMUS: Not buying it.
IMUS: Tell me - give me - be honest, Lis and Deirdre. DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, try, Lis.
IMUS: Tell me the - give me ... WIEHL: That's just mean. IMUS: Give me five things ... WIEHL: That is just - oh me ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: I come from a place of compassion, love and kindness. IMUS: Give me five things, Lis, you are serving at your Super Bowl party.
WIEHL: Well, first of all, my daughter is having a Super Bowl party, all the 15-year-olds are coming over, so I may be relegated somewhere else.
IMUS: All right.
WIEHL: But she is probably going to have pizza ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: What, do you let your daughter rule the roost there? WIEHL: No ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: I mean she is in charge? (CROSSTALK)
WIEHL: Maybe someone will ask me to a Super Bowl party, that would be great. But if I were to go to Super Bowl party ...

Page 70 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: That's not the question ...
WIEHL: I would have ... IMUS: Are you having one?
DEIRDRE IMUS: And what is your daughter having? WIEHL: She is probably going to have pizza.
DEIRDRE IMUS: You're not involved in this, you're just going to let her do whatever?

WIEHL: She is 15, she's almost 16 year old. I think she can figure out what she wants to have for Super Bowl party.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Wyatt says she is doing a lot of stuff you don't know about. MCSHANE: Yeah.
WIEHL: What - I didn't know. IMUS: I'm just telling you.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Because they talk. WIEHL: Do they have a BlackBerry? (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: Dingleberry? WIEHL: Facebook?
IMUS: All right, so you can't answer the question? MCSHANE: Apparently not.
WIEHL: Yes, I'm saying pizza and chips and nachos, things like that. DEIRDRE IMUS: And you are OK with her eating all that crap? WIEHL: Chicken wings. Yeah, for one day.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Load herself up with all that. IMUS: Chicken wings?
WIEHL: Yeah, of course.
IMUS: And what do you have - your Super Bowl party? Which Wyatt and I will be attended?

DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, it's going to be so much fun. I'm going to try those -- I have them on my Web site, you know, the - how I'm doing it - all this week, super snacks for the Super Bowl. That Jalapeno poppers, which you guys love. And we're going to do this baked jalapeno poppers ..
MCSHANE: All right.

DEIRDRE IMUS: Chips and salsa. Again, healthy, the organic versions. Homemade guacamole, which you, guys, love. Three been chili, maybe we'll do some humus and dip. You know, other dips, humus or red pepper humus dip.
(LAUGHTER)
DEIRDRE IMUS: An assortment of olives. IMUS: How about nachos?
Page 71 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Olives?
DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, we could do the nachos. Because we're going ... IMUS: And don't you have that cheese ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, we have that - which you like, that organic raw cheese. IMUS: And don't they make organic chicken wings?
WIEHL: There you go. Now you're talking. IMUS: Yes, they do.
DEIRDRE IMUS: No, no. There is no such thing as an organic chicken wing. IMUS: Why not?
WIEHL: The Super Bowl game ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: We don't eat animals, honey. IMUS: I understand that.
DEIRDRE IMUS: We don't eat animals. IMUS: OK.
WIEHL: But you can get free range.

DEIRDRE IMUS: And getting animals are just - I don't know. You might as well be eating the roadkill all these places, and sell it. In a bucket, sell it in a bucket.
WIEHL: Yeah, I mean ... (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: Right. You're eating - I mean it is disgusting. A bunch of dead animals in a bucket all fried in deep grease.
WIEHL: But who really?
DEIRDRE IMUS: I mean you're just eating a bucket of cancer. WIEHL: Who really wants ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: And just think of how inhumane that is. That you want to voluntarily have you - you're going to have your - she'll probably order ...
(CROSSTALK)

DEIRDRE IMUS: So do these big orders. (inaudible) is that so she was talking about, like this huge buckets and big boxes of ...
WIEHL: The bunch of kids, though ... DEIRDRE IMUS: ... dead animals in a box.
WIEHL: Nobody is really watching the game. They're all waiting for the ads and the half-time and they hope for the wardrobe malfunction. And kids are going to be wanting to eat that good crappy stuff ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: And they will definitely have beer with that. So ... WIEHL: Beer with ...
DEIRDRE IMUS: Throughout this Super Bowl party, they are going to be also downing the beer with it.

Page 72 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WIEHL: I don't think they're going to be downing a beer with that.
DEIRDRE IMUS: If they are going to get these chicken wings down, they're going to need something. IMUS: All right, 18 till the hour here on the "IMUS IN THE MORNING" program.
WIEHL: A nice 32 ouncer of soda.
DEIRDRE IMUS: You know, she is the problem with this country. IMUS: No, she is not.
WIEHL: I'm the problem with this country. IMUS: You're the problem.
DEIRDRE IMUS: It's that mentality thinking that this is OK to be eating all this crap ... WIEHL: Not every day.
DEIRDRE IMUS: And it's always another ... MCSHANE: Lis.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Do you hear every time we are on, it's the Super Bowl, it's Thanksgiving, it's Valentine's Day, it's the inaugural ball, it's ...
WIEHL: OK, now you are --
DEIRDRE IMUS: It is a special birthday party. (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: My son's brother's sister's confirmation ... (CROSSTALK)
WIEHL: 365 days.
IMUS: Stop it, too. 18 till the hour. MCSHANE: Good.
IMUS: Boy Scouts of America weighing in about doing an about-face to their long-standing ban on gays among boy scout membership and troop leaders. Where are you on that? You have a son, right?

WIEHL: I have son who was in boy scouts, and my girl was in girl scouts, and it's about time to make that about-face. It's just wrong that they are excluding homosexual kids.
IMUS: Was the scout leader in your son's troop gay? WIEHL: No.
IMUS: OK.
DEIRDRE IMUS: How do you know that?
WIEHL: He was married, he had kids. His kids were in the-- IMUS: Wait a minute.
DEIRDRE IMUS: She is assuming a lot. A lot of people, and that's the problem, because it's not accepted, I am all for inclusion, so I'm all for ...
WIEHL: Right.


Page 73 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DEIRDRE IMUS: ... gays being...
WIEHL: Where is the (inaudible).

DEIRDRE IMUS: But I'm not part of the boy scouts organization, you know, with their issues that they - I mean some of them are run, I guess, through Catholic charities or other religious organizations that don't want to promote that or accept that.
WIEHL: It is not about ... DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, accept it.
WIEHL: It's not about promotion, is about acceptance. IMUS: Would you support Wyatt joining?
DEIRDRE IMUS: But how do you - this is the interesting questions you ask, because you assume that none of them were gay ...
WIEHL: I didn't know. That is not the question of ... (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: That's a part that is so heartbreaking, is so many people are also married with children that are gay ...
WIEHL: That's not the point.
DEIRDRE IMUS: And it's this fear of coming out, and it's because society has made it that way.

WIEHL: Yeah, because they are - they will be ostracized if they try to be a boy scout and be, you know, be with other kids, that is just wrong.

DEIRDRE IMUS: It is wrong. It's actually heartbreaking because so many young teenagers right now are suffering because of that. Because they are afraid to say anything. They're afraid ...
IMUS: We know a couple of friends. DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah.
IMUS: You know, just - who we met over the years ... DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah.
IMUS: Who we know are gay, but are concealing that. And it is heartbreaking. DEIRDRE IMUS: It is heartbreaking. It really is.
WIEHL: And that is the message that they're getting from the boy scouts. Here, no, here too far, that you can't - you're not even good enough, that's really what it is. You are not even good enough, you're not even clean enough basically, not even moral enough to join the boy scouts.
IMUS: ... (inaudible) that people who are gay, I suspect in some, a lot of cases, have enough issues in their life ... WIEHL: Exactly.
IMUS: They don't need to be ... DEIRDRE IMUS: I agree ...
IMUS: ... made to feel bad because of something that they can't control. It is the worst kind of bigotry and racism. The worst kind.
WIEHL: And there is so much suffering from that. IMUS: Oh
Page 74 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
DEIRDRE IMUS: And the fact there is no compassion.
IMUS: And it's hideous for teenagers, because I've seen them got though it. WIEHL: Exactly.
IMUS: This is not right.
WIEHL: One little tiny thing that could be made a little bit better in their life, especially at such a vulnerable time. IMUS: They just want to feel pretty, that's all. All right, a quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE
MORNING program.
WIEHL: Don't we all, don't we all.

IMUS: Quarter until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Last week military officials, the military officially lifted the ban on women in combat. Lis.

WIEHL: I am for it. I mean, women have been in combat in some way, shape or form for a long time, they just haven't been getting the acknowledgment, they have not been getting the promotions, and now finally have a chance to do that. As long as they can do it physically, they should be able to do it.
IMUS: All right. You?

DEIRDRE IMUS: I'm all for it, too. It is not obviously for every woman, but certain women I think know they are capable and can do that. There are some interesting things that come up because you're in these war zones and you have to go to the bathroom or there are issues like that, I have heard people discuss that are in the military that become very uncomfortable around just men and men.
IMUS: I've seen you out at the ranch out in the weeds, so that's like they would do in combat. DEIRDRE IMUS: No, they could. They just have to work those things out. I think-- (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: I haven't been in the military so I don't to speak on (inaudible) I know.

WIEHL: Understand, but I really doubt that is what they're concentrating on, who is going to the bathroom where when they're out there.
IMUS: So I remember when I was in the jungles of Vietnam killing Cong. (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: When I was at the Marine Corps.
DEIRDRE IMUS: When did that happen again, honey?
IMUS: Or maybe I was playing the bugle at Camp Pendleton, whatever.

DEIRDRE IMUS: You should be proud of that, playing the bugle, and you're still waking people up after all these years your entire life. Right, he is?
IMUS: How would either one of you feel about killing somebody? WIEHL: Just in general, like how do I feel about war?
IMUS: Yeah.

WIEHL: I am kind of against it. Yeah, I would say I am generally against war and I'm generally against killing people. I don't know--
DEIRDRE IMUS: I mean, violence--
IMUS: How do you think things should be resolved then?

Page 75 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WIEHL: What should be resolved?

IMUS: These various issues which have precipitated wars. Say, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, what should be done about that?.
WIEHL: We had to bomb - sorry, we had to counteract Pearl Harbor, absolutely.
IMUS: So you could have killed some people then, right? You would have landed at Iwo Jima. WIEHL: Yeah, I guess I could.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Again, it goes down to if you're in your home with your children and someone comes in and threatens you, I think all of us are going to...
(CROSSTALK)

DEIRDRE IMUS: I think all of us are going to defend ourselves, whatever we have to do. You are not going to let the person just try to kill you without you fighting back.
WIEHL: But general question, do you like war? DEIRDRE IMUS: No, of course not, nobody wants war.
IMUS: No, that's not the question. Are you prepared to pull the trigger?

DEIRDRE IMUS: But I think, yes, in order for survival, unfortunately in certain circumstances like that, yes, it is necessary.

IMUS: All right. Time for a Super Bowl prediction. Because you won't be on again until the Super Bowl is over. We have, Lis, you know who is playing, right?
WIEHL: Yes.
IMUS: The San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens. (CROSSTALK)
MCSHANE: Whatever.
DEIRDRE IMUS: In New Orleans, right?
WIEHL: In New Orleans, I knew that. Great city. Yes. Who is the underdog? Does Warner know?

IMUS: Well, I think the Ravens are, I think the 49ers are favored by three and a half points. But to give you a hint, from what little I know about it, the 49ers have the offense and the Ravens have the defense, except the Ravens also have a pretty good defense. And the Ravens seem to be -- oftentimes it is not who is the best team, they appear to be fairly evenly matched, it comes down to who is on a roll, and I think the Ravens are. That does not mean they are going to win, but I think - if I were going to bet, I don't bet, but if I were going to bet, I would bet the Ravens. But that is not me. So who do you like?
WIEHL: I'm going with the Ravens, with all the knowledge I just gleaned from you. (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: -- which is so foolish.
DEIRDRE IMUS: I will unfortunately miss at all because I will be in the kitchen making all the yummy- IMUS: You will be in a kitchen where you should be, by the way.
(CROSSTALK)
IMUS: All right, "Blonde on Blonde." Who do you like, Deirdre? DEIRDRE IMUS: The Ravens are going to win.

Page 76 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: OK. 11 until the hour, thank you guys.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I am Diane Macedo. Time to check the markets this morning. In Europe, the European Commission's monthly measure of confidence the euro zone rose for a third straight month, but Spain's GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in the final three months of last year. Stocks are currently in the red across the board. We have London down about three points, Paris is down almost six, and Frankfurt is down 18. Here in the U.S., it has also been a fairly flat morning. Dow futures are down five, the S&P is down 1, and the Nasdaq is up about one. Investors are all cautious to hear from the Federal Reserve later today.

And in the meantime, it looks like UPS effort to acquire TNT Express is officially dead. As expected, EU antitrust regulators have blocked UPS's $7 billion bid to acquire the Dutch shipping company, saying the proposed merger would have reduced competition in 15 EU countries. Earlier this month, UPS said it would withdraw its offer because of EU regulator's concerns. The deal would've given the company to TNT's stronger networks in
fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.

Chesapeake Energy says Aubrey McClendon will retire as chief executive on April 1. McClendon built the company into the country's second biggest natural gas producer but stepped down as chairman last year after a plan that allowed him to invest personally in the company's wealth came under renewed scrutiny. Chesapeake says a review of McClendon's business dealings has not turned up any improper misconduct. The company said it needs a new leader to help develop the oil and gas assets it acquired under McClendon.

Here's a look at commodities now. Oil and gold are up. We have oil up by about 34 cents. Gold is up 3 bucks. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.

IMUS: It is -- I love this record. It's on my rodeo playlist. Billy Joel. All right, it is a great record. Lots of great records, Billy Joel, it's a great record. Come on, man.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He made great records. IMUS: Doesn't he?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, indeed.

IMUS: Oh, man, he made great records. Talking to Bernard McGuirk and Imogene Lloyd Webber tomorrow. And crazy Melissa Francis, five until the hour.
She is nuts. Do you know her?
WIEHL: Met her a few times around the building, she is very sweet. IMUS: She is a psycho.
MCSHANE: Not a psycho. (CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: I've only seen her on TV, and she is really smart. WIEHL: Yes. I like her.
DEIRDRE IMUS: She got a nice way about her.

IMUS: I don't think you want to appear aside Lori Rothman, though, that is a good-looking girl there, don't you think? Lori Rothman.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Yes, but I think Melissa is too.
WIEHL: They look great together, what's wrong with that? IMUS: What are you shaking your head about?
DEIRDRE IMUS: I don't know, sometimes you just sound crazy.

Page 77 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Squinting your eyes at me.
WIEHL: Just like an evil look. DEIRDRE IMUS: Just calm down.
MCSHANE: Ashley Webster, another good-looking girl.
DEIRDRE IMUS: What is this we're always like going on about? I don't know, it's a male thing, though. I know it's
(inaudible).
(CROSSTALK)
DEIRDRE IMUS: Connell, you're very pretty too. (CROSSTALK)
IMUS: See, oh, God. MCSHANE: What?
DEIRDRE IMUS: What is wrong with that? Do you like being called a pretty boy? MCSHANE: Mr. Imus has something to say, Mrs. Imus.
IMUS: No, you can't talk. You keep yapping. DEIRDRE IMUS: What am I yapping about? IMUS: Nothing.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Since when do you have a problem trying to shut me up? IMUS: Are you kidding me?
(LAUGHTER)
WIEHL: You try all the time. IMUS: And it doesn't work.
DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, sometimes it does. WIEHL: Just give up.
IMUS: It depends on whether you're in a good mood or not. Which is, you know.

DEIRDRE IMUS: I'm always in, pretty much always in a good mood. It is you that is not. So then you're receiving information differently.
IMUS: You are a liar. You are not always in a good mood.
DEIRDRE IMUS: No, I'm not. Yes, sometimes I'm doing stuff, so you are trying to - you don't say excuse me. IMUS: Sometimes, sometimes...
(CROSSTALK) (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning everyone. Shares of Boeing are up 1 percent in the pre-market after the plane maker reported better-than- expected fourth quarter earnings.

The results come as the company works to find a solution to battery problems on its new 787 Dreamliner that's been grounded by regulators.

Boeing says it earned an adjusted profit of $1.46 a share, beating the estimate for a $1.19. Revenue up $22.3 billion came in just short of the forecast for 22.36 billion.
Boeing says it expects to earn between $5 and $5.20 a share in 2013, and that compares to the estimate for
$5.16. The company's 2013 revenue estimate is 85 to $85 billion versus the $88.2 billion estimate.

Chrysler Group is reporting fourth quarter net income of $378 million, up 68 percent from 225 million a year earlier, thanks to higher vehicle sales in North America.

Revenue rose to $17.15 billion compared to just over 15 billion last year. Chrysler says net income for all of 2012 was up $1.7 billion from 183 million in June 2011.
The automaker which is majority owned by Italy's Fiat, says it expects to earn net income of $2.2 billion in 2013. We're set to get two pieces of economic data in the next 30 minutes, including the first look at growth in the fourth
quarter.

Analysts expect gross domestic product to rise by just 1.1 percent for the quarter due to businesses adding less stocks to their warehouses and cuts in government spending.

And that will be the slowest growth rate in nearly two years and a big drop from the 3.1 percent we saw in the third quarter. That number comes our way at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.

Shortly before that, at 8:15, we'll get the ADP private sector payroll report for January. 165,000 jobs are expected to have been added this month down from the 215,000 in December.

The report comes ahead of the important monthly jobs report which will be released Friday. That report is expected to show that the economy added 160,000 non-farms jobs while the unemployment rate is expected to stay at 7.8 percent.

And there's been a lot of talk lately questioning the value of a bachelors degree and while Lauren Simonetti usually comes to us with reasons why we might want to skip school, she's back now with a look at why you should actually hit the books.
Lauren, what you got?

LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning, Diane. I am certainly not looking to be dubbed "don't get a higher education", so, that's why I have this story for you.

I spoke to a professor at Georgetown University, their center on education and the workforce. And he has this study that really shows you that, that BA is certainly worth it.

Over the lifetime of your career, if you have a bachelors degree on average, you're going to earn $2.3 million. If you do not have that bachelors degree, that brings your earnings down to $1.3 million.
So, you can say that the degree is worth a million dollars.
MACEDO: And you might need that money just to keep up with the ever- growing number of fees -- SIMONETTI: Yes --
MACEDO: We have to deal with, Lauren. First, credit cards, now you're telling me, YouTube?

SIMONETTI: Yes, it could be. Google owns YouTube, and this has being spoken about for a little bit, but now it might be coming sooner than we thought perhaps right around to Easter time.

YouTube could charge users between $1 and $5 a month for certain channels. We do not know which channels just yet.

But, AdAge is reporting that YouTube is talking to special video producers to produce special content that they could charge for on the site.

Little scary thing, you know, where you watch all your television mess-ups on YouTube, maybe we do eventually have to pay to watch those mess-ups.

Page 79 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MACEDO: Who needs YouTube when you're having Fox Business Network, they can just watch us right here. We'll mess up enough for you, it's fun. Thanks Lauren.
SIMONETTI: Bye Diane.
MACEDO: Let's get the latest on weather now from meteorologist Maria Molina in our Fox Business Weather
Center. Maria.

MARIA MOLINA, FOX WEATHER CENTER: Thanks, Diane. And today, we're tracking some severe weather across a big chunk of the country.

Stretching from parts of the Florida Panhandle up and through Georgia, Alabama and as far north as portions of the state of New Jersey and also Pennsylvania.

We're talking about tornadoes possible today, damaging wind gusts, large hail and even some flooding from some of these storms. So, of course, we're expecting to see also some weather-related travel delays.

Part of the reason why we're seeing severe weather is that warm air in place today across portions of the east. 73 for your high today in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Upper 50 is in New York City and 64 in the city of Cleveland. Meanwhile behind the system, very cold, 37 in
Chicago, 23 in Minneapolis, and Diane, we even have some snow to talk about from Iowa to Wisconsin.
MACEDO: All right, Maria Molina from the weather center, and now, here's the i-man live on Fox Business.

DON IMUS, HOST, IMUS IN THE MORNING: You know, there are some things that you just can't get out of your head forever.
CONNELL MCSHANE, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Yes.

IMUS: And I don't know, I think about this not all the time, but often. And this happened a long time ago about a friend of mine who was going out with this famous singer.

And he was sleeping with her. And he told me, and he told me that -- I don't know why he told me this, but he told me that one time that she wet the bed on him.
MCSHANE: Oh --
BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING : Oh man. MCSHANE: That would stick in your mind.
IMUS: And are you listening to this, Dagen, what's Dagen doing? DAGEN MCDOWELL, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I'm listening to you. MCSHANE: Right.
LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Or you should probably try not to. MCSHANE: All right.
IMUS: And I've just never -- MCSHANE: Dagen's guy, no big deal.
IMUS: Now, the guy since -- unfortunately he passed away. RUFINO: That ain't nothing.
MCSHANE: Yes, exactly.
IMUS: But the singer is still around. MCSHANE: Oh, good.

Page 80 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: So, I don't know if she still wets the bed --
MCSHANE: Seeing somebody else, yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's great.
ROB BARTLETT, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Was it on purpose? MCSHANE: Man.
IMUS: So, we got A-Rod on the steroids again.
WARNER WOLF, SPORTS PRESENTER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Right. IMUS: And obviously he's lying clearly.
MCSHANE: Of course.
IMUS: There's just no question, plus he hired Roy Black, which confirms that he's lying. And then we have -- MCSHANE: Ray Lewis --
WOLF: Ray Lewis -- MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: With the deer antler spray -- WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: Which does contain substance banned by the NFL, but that doesn't mean that, for example, I just asked
Deirdre why can't I take it?
WOLF: Yes.

IMUS: Because I have horrible shoulder problems. Rotator cuff, nerve damage, whatever the hell it is. So, I need to take some deer --
MCSHANE: Yes -- IMUS: Antler stuff. WOLF: Yes.
MCSHANE: You won't be playing in the NFL anyway. IMUS: And I'm not going to be -- exactly.
MCSHANE: So, no worries. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: So then I'm talking to Bigfoot -- MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: Tom Bowman, our executive producer of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. He says to me Randy
Moss is a better receiver than Jerry Rice.
MCSHANE: Oh man. WOLF: Oh, well --
IMUS: And so, then I say to Tony, who knows a little bit about sports. I said -- and Tony said, well, you can make a case for that on the following basis, Warner.


Page 81 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
WOLF: Yes.

IMUS: And that is if Jerry Rice had two Hall of Fame quarterbacks throwing to him, Joe Montana, Steve Young, and Randy Moss except for when he played with New England where he set a record by the way.
He scored 50 touchdowns. Randy Moss didn't have anybody throwing to him most of his career. WOLF: Well, he had -- gosh, what was the guy, he was pretty good --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, Daunte Culpepper -- (CROSSTALK)
WOLF: Yes, he was very good. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then he fizzled out. WOLF: Yes --
IMUS: Now the Culpepper was not Joe Montana. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --
IMUS: Or Steve Young. WOLF: Oh, no. What?
MCGUIRK: I wonder what Bernie(ph) from Queens thinks about all this. RUFINO: This is getting interesting already.
WOLF: You know he said --

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He'd say, you know what, I could try, remember back in '92 when -- what's his name? He was fired.
MCSHANE: He's no way in (INAUDIBLE).
WOLF: Now, I say, I did say, he was as good as a deep threat as Moss -- rather as Rice. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: But, you know, for somebody to say forget the records, what are you talking, you can't. And the records are so overwhelming, whether who was throwing the ball to him, it's not even close --
IMUS: Yes --
WOLF: In the three big categories. Touchdowns, receptions and yardage. IMUS: Sure.
WOLF: He's in a different league. IMUS: Jerry Rice is?
WOLF: Yes, way ahead. So, I don't see --
IMUS: But you know I was sick yesterday so I literally stayed in bed all day and watched the NFL channel. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: I watched "Espn", of course, and I watched Francesa a little bit on the "Yes Network". UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wait a second, wait a second.
IMUS: You know that he's still taking telephone calls from people.

Page 82 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: What did you think he was doing?
IMUS: Well, I don't know, I haven't listened to him in years. MCSHANE: All right.
IMUS: They still talk to people on the phone about sports, are you aware of that? WOLF: Yes --
RUFINO: He talks to them for like three seconds though. BARTLETT: Tom in Yonkers --
RUFINO: For three seconds. WOLF: Yes.
MCSHANE: All over the country, yes. IMUS: And he's so disrespectful to them.
RUFINO: Yet, they don't get the chance to say anything, nothing -- IMUS: And abusive.
MCSHANE: You're on hold for an hour and a half to get their three seconds.

IMUS: When I watched him, he was in this -- is that the Super Bowl and some -- it looks like a cavern or something, and he was talking to Sweeny Murti. Remember Sweeny?
WOLF: Sure, the Yankees, baseball -- RUFINO: Sweeny --
MCSHANE: That's it, Sweeny was on when Mike fell asleep. IMUS: That's really tough radio to listen to, man.
MCSHANE: Way to go.
IMUS: Son of a -- I mean, that's rough. RUFINO: Here in New Orleans once again.
IMUS: And they get huge ratings. And you have to wonder how? But it's just -- I don't know, I just, I don't get it. MCSHANE: People love sports.
MCGUIRK: This sports.
MCSHANE: Especially in New York.
IMUS: And I watch this guy on "Espn" called "The Herd? MCSHANE: Yes, Colin Cowherd.
IMUS: Man, that's rough too. Holy God -- MCSHANE: And "The Herd" --
IMUS: And they're just convinced that -- or Jim Rome, you know or whoever -- MCSHANE: Or Mike Francesa, right --
IMUS: Oh God, it's just brutal.

Page 83 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
RUFINO: Nobody is mean, wait a second --
MCSHANE: Oh sorry. RUFINO: Wait a second. IMUS: What's that Mike?
RUFINO: Wait a second, no wonder, what do -- "The Herd"? What is "The Herd"? IMUS: You know who is great, I think is Deion Sanders --
MCSHANE: Yes --
IMUS: Of the "NFL Network", interviewing people, he's good, he has fun. MCSHANE: All right.
IMUS: He asks good questions. You don't think he's good? TONY POWELL, IMUS IN THE MORNING: Prime Time. MCSHANE: Prime Time.
IMUS: Prime is good, yes -- MCSHANE: That's him --
IMUS: Prime, I like Prime. What else is going on in sports, Warner?
WOLF: Well, I was just thinking about Ray Lewis, unless he's suspended between today and Sunday. IMUS: Well, he's not going to be suspended.
WOLF: No, it won't matter. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: It's his last game, whether he took the -- RUFINO: He didn't take them --
WOLF: Substance from the deer antler -- RUFINO: Take it all --
IMUS: Well, here's the thing. RUFINO: Take it all now. WOLF: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
IMUS: I don't have a problem, I don't know why the NFL does. MCSHANE: Yes.
IMUS: With the dude taking the deer antler spray because if I can get it, I'm going to take it. WOLF: Yes!
MCSHANE: Absolutely, yes, today --

IMUS: Well, I wouldn't take anything that will harm you and because the NFL is got it under banned list, that's idiotic, it's not synthetic.

Page 84 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
So I don't get that, I mean --
MCSHANE: Yes, cool --
WOLF: Yes, you could sell it on the show commercially, yes -- IMUS: Because they, well, believe me, Reverend Mason will. WOLF: Yes --
MCSHANE: By that, I mean why?
IMUS: If I said, I mean, we will already have the Olive Garden signed up. WOLF: Right.
IMUS: If Rob and Tony hadn't killed him. BARTLETT: Oh yes, I was lost --
IMUS: And Dagen. MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: Who just killed him. MCSHANE: Horrible.
IMUS: So, we're here to make, we're here to make money for the Dickies. WOLF: Yes --
MCSHANE: Who love this.
IMUS: My new best friends and I'm serious. MCSHANE: Let's sell some deer.
IMUS: My job is to make money for the company, that's the deal and have fun. MCSHANE: Right.
WOLF: Don't you remember that was a big thing when Joe Namath shaved off his beard on television. You could do the same --
IMUS: His moustache. He had that fu manchu thing --
WOLF: Yes, right. Or you could, man, just shoot that stuff onto your tongue, we can sell that. POWELL: Put some pantyhose on --
IMUS: Oh I do, I'll do in a heartbeat, Warner. WOLF: Yes.
IMUS: I got Deirdre back checking it out now. WOLF: Yes --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She's going -- IMUS: So --
WOLF: Man --
MCSHANE: She's calling some Chinese guy, they've used it for years, the Chinese, apparently.

Page 85 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Well, I used to go to a Chinese doctor over on the eastside.
MCSHANE: Yes -- IMUS: That's --
MCDOWELL: You know hotel on the eastside. MCSHANE: Georgia --
IMUS: Oh, that was a different guy. MCDOWELL: Oh OK.
MCSHANE: He wasn't Chinese? POWELL: That's the Indian guy -- WOLF: Indian --
MCSHANE: Exactly right. MCDOWELL: Oh, OK.
MCSHANE: Stuff to keep this all straight. IMUS: No --
RUFINO: Yes, bring the book. IMUS: Let me wear my hat.
MCSHANE: That's a nice hat right there. IMUS: A really good heart, isn't it? MCSHANE: Oh, come on.
IMUS: Anyway -- RUFINO: Walk right --
IMUS: What was I saying? The Chinese guy is an all cash dealer, you know. BARTLETT: Who? Dr. Quan(ph).
IMUS: Yes. He's a nice guy, but so completely, totally full of it. He told me, he said, no, I didn't have any cancer, you know. This is just meeting before I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
MCSHANE: Right.
IMUS: Which is, which appears to be OK, taking stuff like all holistic stuff like deer antler spray. MCSHANE: Right.
WOLF: Yes.

IMUS: And Dr. Aaron Spitz(ph) is my urologist, he's a great doctor, a great doctor. He signed off on deer antler, he signed off on deer antler urine.
MCSHANE: Let's do it. And you would say -- IMUS: He would say, let's do this. I love it -- MCSHANE: I love it --


Page 86 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Let's do it, 13 after the hour, Laura Ingraham is coming up, I love her to death, I do, I do like her. Tomorrow, Bernard McGuirk and Imogen Lloyd Webber --
MCSHANE: Oh, Lloyd.
IMUS: And Melissa Francis. And that girl is, man, I'm just convinced that she is absolutely thug-ducking-nuts. MCSHANE: No.
IMUS: Don't you think?
BARTLETT: Yes, she is, she is crazy. POWELL: Not that dish.
IMUS: So, anyway, all that is coming up. Let's do some news. Have we done any news? MCSHANE: Not yet, but we have --
IMUS: Do some news, here with the news is Connell McShane. Good morning Connell.

MCSHANE: Good morning i-man. The severe weather is a big part of the news this morning in a large part of the country. More tornado watches and warnings issued today.
I mean, this stretches from Indiana to Texas. You have three tornadoes at least touching down last night in
Arkansas. 9,000 plus out of power.

One person dead, the report is coming in from Tennessee on that. And tornado sirens have been heard this morning in Louisville, Kentucky.

So, terrible weather across a large part of this country. Then you have this gunman in Alabama, terrible story. He gets on a school bus yesterday, shoots and kills the driver and now holds a six-year-old boy hostage.
Here's the local pastor in Midland County speaking with kids who were able to get away. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When the young man entered the bus, he told most of them to get off of the bus, and then he grabbed a boy from what we understand and shot the bus driver four times.
And kids were running down the road, behind the church trying to get to safety. (END AUDIO CLIP)
MCSHANE: Still no conclusion to this story. As the man said to be holding that child in some sort of underground bunker, storm shelter.
IMUS: No need to kill the bus driver.

MCSHANE: Absolutely, yes. Killed the driver, shot and killed the driver and then grab this boy, took him off the bus and is holding him, you know, they say some sort of, like I said some sort of bunker, underground in Alabama. Right.

There's going to be a hearing today in front of a Senate panel on gun control. We just found out that Gabby Giffords will be there, she's going to make an unannounced appearance before the Senate hearing on gun violence.

And Wayne LaPierre will also be there from the National Rifle Association, calling for enforcement of existing laws and improvements in school security.

So, that will be going on. And speaking of the Senate, John Kerry confirmed by the Senate as the next Secretary of State, so, he'll officially resign his position as a Senator, Friday. And they'll --
IMUS: I-fav --


Page 87 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCSHANE: Yes, there will be a welcoming ceremony for him Monday at the State Department.

So, he's on his way in, Hillary Clinton is on her way out, and she talked to "Abc", given the answer, she has no plans to put together another campaign for the White House.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Sitting here right now, that is certainly what I believe. And I am, you know, still the Secretary of State, so I'm not in politics, I'm going to be focusing on my philanthropy,
my charities, my writing and speaking.
(END AUDIO CLIP)
MCSHANE: Hillary Clinton now. IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: Barbara Walters out of the hospital after -- about with the chicken pox, 83 years old, "Abc" says she is resting comfortably and "getting stronger."
And President Obama --
IMUS: And she looks like she's obviously had some work done. MCSHANE: Well --
IMUS: I don't know, her face is tighter than -- maybe a (INAUDIBLE) junior's drum kit. (LAUGHTER)
Isn't that -- oh, man, that looks weird. All right, that's enough news, it's depressing. MCSHANE: Yes, I was just going to talk about immigration.
IMUS: Sixteen after the hour, well, what about?
MCSHANE: No, that's just -- well, no, I was going to say that's yesterdays news anyway. IMUS: Yes.
MCSHANE: Yes, the President makes his argument for it, now we'll see what happens in the Congress.

IMUS: Here's some business news with a quarter, 16 after the hour, and here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning Dagen.

MCDOWELL: Good morning sir. Just about two minutes ago, we got a closely watched reading on how many private sector jobs were added last month in the month of January.

And here it is, 192,000 jobs were added according to ADP, the payroll processing firm, that is an incredible number because the expectation was for just 165,000.

That closely watched jobs report from the government comes out on Friday. Unemployment rate there expected to hold steady at 7.8 percent.
Bottom of the hour --
IMUS: Maybe Stuart Varney is right, maybe the economy is coming back. MCSHANE: Yes.
MCDOWELL: Why differ to Stuart? MCSHANE: We always --
IMUS: Pardon me?
Page 88 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCDOWELL: Why differ to Stuart?
IMUS: Because you guys are always bad mouthing him. MCSHANE: Guys?
IMUS: Yes, you and Connell. MCSHANE: What?
IMUS: Because Stuart is my friend as you know, and a regular on the program.

MCDOWELL: Yes, I'm sure you will be inviting him over to your apartment for Super Bowl Sunday, like you're going to be Mr. friendly and all.

IMUS: Well no, but having him appear on the program to offer us financial counsel is somewhat different than inviting him to the Super Bowl party, which is, I'm not going to do.
MCSHANE: No. MCDOWELL: OK.
IMUS: Nor are you invited either by the way. Your greasy sweatpants and spray-on-cheese and Red Bull. MCSHANE: That's right.
MCDOWELL: I was thinking up to join. IMUS: Eighteen after the hour -- MCDOWELL: Exactly --
IMUS: To sports now, sports sponsored by Peerless Boilers and here with that is Warner Wolf. Good morning
Warner.
WOLF: Good morning i-man. So, the deal with A-Rod, he's already lied twice. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: And you know, the Yankees are trying to find some kind of a loophole in that contract that they can get out of paying him 114 million over the last five years.
Now, if you go back to December of '07 on "60 Minutes" with Katie Couric, here's what A-Rod said about drugs. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
KATIE COURIC, ABC NEWS: Have you ever used steroids, human growth hormone or any other performance enhancing substance?
ALEX RODRIGUEZ, THIRD BASEMAN, NEW YORK YANKEES: No. (END AUDIO CLIP)
WOLF: OK, then one year and two months later -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --
WOLF: Here was A-Rod after "Sports Illustrated" broke a story. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)
RODRIGUEZ: I stopped taking it in 2003 and haven't taken it since. (END AUDIO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)

Page 89 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
MCGUIRK: Are you implying that he's lying? --
IMUS: What a creep. WOLF: No, man, so now -- IMUS: Yes --
WOLF: He's on this list of a guy named Anthony Bosch -- IMUS: Yes, O-Bosch --
WOLF: O-Bosch, who has given out HGH to Manny Ramirez, Bartolo Colon and Melky Carbrera, all of whom are suspended.
IMUS: What!
WOLF: And A-Rod is on the same list. IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: So, A-Rod's confirms as oh, no, this isn't true.

IMUS: Yes, well, sounds to me like someone -- why was this -- why is this report coming out now? And who leaked this thing?
WOLF: I don't know who leaked it, but it's "Miami Times".
MCSHANE: I think it's -- I think it was an employee at that clinic they said to leak it to the paper. That's what -- WOLF: Man, wait a minute --
IMUS: Something a little fishy here. WOLF: Disgruntled perhaps?
IMUS: Oh yes, I don't know. 20 minutes after the hour, what else, Warner?

WOLF: Well, what else? Let's move on here. Oh, I was going to -- we know the Randy Moss story, he said he is the greatest receiver of all time. I guess forgetting about Jerry Rice.
IMUS: Well, Bigfoot, your position is he is or what?
TOM BOWMAN, PRODUCER, IMUS IN THE MORNING: I think yes. IMUS: OK.
BOWMAN: I think you could probably rank him up there. Because like I said, Steve Young and Joe Montana are both going to the Hall of Fame and that's who Jerry Rice had thrown to him for his whole career, just about.
IMUS: Yes. WOLF: So --
BOWMAN: So, if Randy Moss had the same quarterbacks, I think he would have at least matched Jerry Rice's numbers.
IMUS: How about that, Warner? WOLF: Well, we don't know that. IMUS: We don't know that --
BOWMAN: I think the only -- yes, but the only time he played with the great quarterback was with Tom Brady and in three seasons he had almost 50 touchdowns.

Page 90 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Yes --
MCSHANE: Oh, now what? --
WOLF: Yes, but we're talking about a difference of 7,600 yards, over 500 catches and 46 more touchdowns. IMUS: How about that Bigfoot?
MCSHANE: Now what?
BOWMAN: Yes, but look who is throwing to him. WOLF: Yes.
BOWMAN: If he had, you know, if he had Eric Hipple and Ken O'Brien throwing to him, would he have had the same numbers?
MCSHANE: Easy on Ken O'Brien. WOLF: Well --
IMUS: Yes, come on, lighten up here, foot.
WOLF: And -- wait a minute, you want to hunch bet, a hunch bet for the Super Bowl? IMUS: Yes.
WOLF: You're ready for this. Exactly 168 years ago yesterday, Edgar Allan Poe -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes --
WOLF: Later found dead in the streets of Baltimore three years after writing his famous poem "The Raven". MCSHANE: Oh --
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?
WOLF: A hunch bet for "The Raven". (LAUGHTER)
IMUS: You are such an idiot. We still don't have a -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Actually Redskins --
IMUS: We still don't have a Las Vegas line on whether Ray Lewis is going to kill anybody. That's the bet I want to see.
All right, 21 after the hour, Bernie has a briefing coming up just ahead of Laura Ingraham. What's ahead Bernie? MCGUIRK: Ray Lewis, Manti Te'o, Dr. Phil and a controversial Super Bowl ad coming up, chief.
IMUS: All right, almost 22 minutes after the hour, this guy was here a month or so ago, thought he was great. John Hiatt.
(MUSIC)

IMUS: Man, who is better than John Hiatt? Lyle Lovett? Do you know that Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt go around the country, appear together?
BARTLETT: That's a great show.
IMUS: Oh man, I would pay money to see that.


Page 91 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
BARTLETT: Yes.
IMUS: Wouldn't you? BARTLETT: Oh yes.
IMUS: People all across the -- the next time Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt are in your neighborhood, come on. People all across America fall in love with the world's most comfortable pillow.

Do you know that on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, a million people have bought My Pillow? At least one of them. You wonder why they resigned me.

Oh, come on, man. Every morning, I beg you to buy one of them. I mean I've been actually reduced to begging, but, it will change your life, it's just to get a good night sleep, your neck won't hurt.

Man, that's important to wake up refreshed. Or are you tired all the time, I just don't need that. And it really works, it's the greatest (INAUDIBLE) at Onstar -- Cholula, the fire, the fire in your wheel.
My Pillow, go to mypillow.com, type in the word Imus, is what I'm saying. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's it.
IMUS: That's it. Maybe I could pay attention.

MACEDO: Hi everyone, I am Diane Macedo. We just got another read on the labor market and according to payroll processing firm ADP, 192,000 jobs were added to the private sector last month.

The estimate was for 165,000. December's numbers was revised lower to 185,000 down from 215,000. And keep in mind we'll get the government's report on January jobs on Friday.

The estimate -- the economy rather is estimated to have added 160,000 non- farm jobs, unemployment is expected to stay put at 7.8 percent.
Checking the markets now here in the U.S., we have fairly flat morning going. Dow Futures are down seven, the
S&P is down about three, the Nasdaq is down two.

Looking at commodities, those have been in the green all morning. We're now seeing oil up about 33 cents trading around $98 a barrel.

Gold is up $2.60 at 1,665 per ounce. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after this on Fox Business, giving you the power to prosper.

Deirdre still buys that. The guy has started to come here, old George, you know George? BARTLETT: Sure.
IMUS: And he's a brilliant guy, some old bagging, new pharmacy. Said, can you do something for me? Let me mix up this cream for you, baby, a series of products, all that. My buddy takes that. So, PT9 is stuff for your prostate, but it also puts some hope back in your room. So call them.

MCGUIRK: Good morning, Boss. According to the "New York Daily News," "USA Today" and other outlets this morning, the Volkswagen has bought an ad on the Super Bowl costing $8 million and according to the "New York Daily News," I'm going to read, the Volkswagen ad slated to air during the Super Bowl is getting criticized for being racist.

The controversial ad features a jovial white office worker speaking to disgruntled colleagues in a thick Jamaican accent. The ad shows a group of unhappy employees standing in an elevator complaining about it being Monday.

And behind them, a young spirited white employee turns and says no worries, man. Everything will be all right in a heavy Jamaican accent. Take a listen to a little bit of the ad, chief.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hate Mondays. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, they're the worse.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No worries, Mon. Everything will be all right. Yes, wicked coffee Mr. Jim. Julia, turn the frown the other way around.

MCGUIRK: So there you go. That is a little taste of it right there. Volkswagen is sticking to their tailpipes and they say they will run it on Super Bowl Sunday.
IMUS: Do they make a point explaining this?
MCGUIRK: You drive a Volkswagen. Don't worry, you will be happy. That is all there is to it, simple. And Manti
Te'O, boss, remember him? He is going to be on Dr. Phil today and tomorrow.
IMUS: Sick of him.

MCGUIRK: According to "The New York Post," the headline on the Dr. Phil interview, gay hint on Te'O hoaxer. They say the dude that was hoaxing him, this Roniah Tuasosopo -- listen to what Dr. Phil said about that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. PHIL MCGRAW, TALK SHOW HOST: This young man was very involved in this relationship, this was it deep, romantic connection that was two ways. With the understand Manti Te'O did not know this was a man.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MCGUIRK: In any case that's the tease. That is all they released. IMUS: That is what happened to me in the Marine Corps.
MCGUIRK: Finally, boss, we listened to Conan O'Brien with a couple of laughs hopefully to cheer the I-man up this morning. Take a listen.

MCGUIRK: At this time, I will conclude, chief.
IMUS: Laura Ingraham is coming up. Here's one of Laura Ingraham's five favorite songs.

DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, everyone. Some breaking news for you, we just got the first reading on fourth-quarter growth and it is not good. The government says grossed domestic product came in down 0.1 percent. That is the first contraction in three and a half years.

Economists were expecting 1.1 percent growth and even that would've been well below the final reading we had one third-quarter growth, which was positive 3.1 percent. Second quarter GDP came in at growth of 1.3 percent.

A short time ago, we got another read on the labor market as well. That news is better according to payroll processing firm, ADP, 192,000 jobs were added to the private sector last month. The estimate was for 165,000.

December's number was revised lower 185,000 from 215,000. And keep in mind getting a government big report on January jobs come Friday. The economy is estimated to have added 160,000 nonfarm jobs. Unemployment is expected to stay put at 7.8 percent.

Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., no surprise futures are heading lower since that GDP report came out. We have Dow futures now down 17. The S&P and Nasdaq are both down 3.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has an interesting data to think about as it wraps up its two-day policy meeting this morning. Analysts predict the fed will stick to its plan of allowing consumers and businesses to borrow at cheap rates in an effort to help the economy.

But the Central Bank has promised to hold interest rates near zero until the unemployment rates falls to 6.5 percent or as long as inflation doesn't threaten to top 2.5 percent. The fed at the time said it could take until the end of 2015 for that to happen.

Fox Business will have full coverage of the fed's policy decision when it is released at 2:15 p.m. Eastern. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues after this on Fox Business.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

IMUS: I was just talking to Connell about my voice, just gone south. It's 20 minutes until the hour here in the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Please welcome to the program, I-fave, Laura Ingraham. Good morning, Ms. Ingraham.
LAURA INGRAHAM, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST (via telephone): Good morning, I-man. IMUS: How is your new radio syndication program going?
INGRAHAM: We're having fun, pretty good so far. Making quite a bit of news, aggravating and angering people of both parties, doesn't get any better than that.
IMUS: What did you do to aggravate them?

INGRAHAM: You know, the Republicans are trying to find their footing after getting their clocks cleaned in the presidential election, shouldn't have lost in the Senate, shouldn't have lost in the House of Representatives so there's a lot of pent up frustration among conservatives about the leadership in the Republican Party. So I actually bring them on my show and say, you know, I had Reince Preibus. He is a nice guy who looks like Mr. Bean.
Page 94 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: Yes.

INGRAHAM: Why should you have been re-elected as head of the RNC? Pretty much lost across the board, and somehow they still keep on coming on the show. We are having fun, it is a good group and we have a great crew so --
IMUS: So in your view the new Republican message and conservative message should essentially be what? INGRAHAM: Well, the brand that came out of the Charlotte meeting, check this out, Imus, "renew, grow and win."
That is like a hair club for men. I said how much do you pay to get come up with a new slogan? OK, because I
could have come up with something better in my sleep.
IMUS: It sounds like an ad a lawn care product.

INGRAHAM: Yes, right. Renew, grow -- it is like being in winning situations, you'll be more confident with a full head of hair. The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. People making millions of dollars given the same bad advice to Republicans election after election and they keep on getting hired for the life of me I have no idea.

They basically have to send a message to people that don't really like them very much in the message has to be freedom, individual freedom, economic liberty and the government will not be your mommy and daddy. We are out of resources and we put would put your trust in the government and you're going to be limiting your expectations.

So if you want to win, have to bet on yourself and that is what the free market is really going to pay off for you. Basically they are under the age of 30, Imus. You've never heard a coherent case made for economic or social system. That is a problem.
IMUS: Talking to Laura Ingraham here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. My voice is going on me. INGRAHAM: God bless you.
IMUS: I don't know exactly what happened. Warner thinks it is these inhalers that I use -- INGRAHAM: The purple inhalers, are you on those?
IMUS: No. I am one on Spireva. Where are you on the immigration?

INGRAHAM: Look, this is where I've been and I haven't changed my position. I believe that the laws that we actually have had on the books for decades. I have this crazy idea if you enforce the laws, you actually won't have a massive problem with people in this country illegally, who are kicking around, some in the shadows, some out of the shadows.

And the idea that you just take the 11 million people who broke our laws, the adults when they came in and say OK, little minor box checking and you can basically vote in our election is ridiculous. I don't understand conservatives who think somehow the conservative thing to do.

If you think it is the compassionate thing to do, everyone around the world should be able to call themselves an American because a lot of those people just waited and tried to apply to come here because they either love America or wants to raise a family here.

They're just sitting on their hands thinking I'm an idiot, should have came illegally from overstated my visa and I would be sitting pretty. It is a terrible lesson for our children. I don't think it is necessarily the big compassionate move everybody is saying it is.

My main problem with it is, Imus, it is probably going to put more downward pressure on the American middle class on their salaries, their buying power, we have already seen stagnation until the middle class in this country.

If somebody made the case to me persuasively this was good for American workers and legal residents, legal immigrants I would take a different look at it, but nobody has made that case to me. I don't even think they're trying to make that case.

IMUS: Maybe I am just a sap. Of the 11 million people or whatever it is that are here illegally, some have been here for decades and so to make them go back to Mexico, the humane thing to do. I understand there are other issues involved here so I tend to think somehow they ought to be cut some slack.

Page 95 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
INGRAHAM: I am not even saying that necessarily have to go to Mexico. But the idea they just was essentially Obama wants a snap of the finger very little they have to do to start voting. I just think that is absurd, voting? Somewhere they are American citizens? I don't buy that. I think it is bad for the American worker.
IMUS: What about if we can ensure that they can vote Republican. How would you feel about that?

INGRAHAM: That's a different story, totally different. What is this deal with Hillary and Lens Crafters? She is now the national spokesperson for the Lens Crafters?
IMUS: I think when she fell down, Laura, and hurt herself and had a concussion.

INGRAHAM: OK, I'm just kidding. She obviously got hurt, come on. What does that have to do with it? What does it matter now somebody walking down the street and wants to kill Americans or some video, what does it matter now?

I keep thinking imagine when she first learned about Monica, paint must have been peeling off the walls if she sounded during that hearing. What does it matter if she was an intern or volunteer, what does it matter?
IMUS: Do you care about the Super Bowl at all?
INGRAHAM: The Baltimore Ravens all the way. They're now saying he was inhaling bicycle chain oil?

IMUS: Deer antlers spray, which, by the way you can order, you can order at Amazon. Did you know that? You can order deer antlers spray, which I will order today, and I have one click buying at Amazon because I so much stuff of them. I will get one-day delivery. I will have my deer antlers spray by Friday.
INGRAHAM: I-man, they're getting really creative with the stuff they are starting, shooting up, like the bath salts. IMUS: Laura Ingraham here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING. Thank you very much, Laura.
INGRAHAM: Love you guys.
IMUS: It's 12 minutes now until the hour. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACEDO: Good morning, everyone. I'm Diane Macedo. A short time ago, we got the first reading on our fourth-quarter growth and it is not good. The government says Gross Domestic Product came in down 0.1 percent, the first contraction in three and a half years.

Economists were expecting 1.1 percent growth and even that would have been way below the final reading for third-quarter growth, which is a positive 3.1 percent. The Commerce Department says the contraction reflects cuts in private inventory investment, federal government spending and exports that were partly offset by an increase in personal consumption.

In somewhat better news, payroll processing firm, ADP says 192,000 jobs were added to the private sector last month. That tops the estimate for 165,000. December's number was revised lower to 185,000 from 215,000. And on Friday, we will get the government's big report on January jobs. The economy is estimated to have added
160,000 nonfarm jobs while unemployment is expected to stay put at 7.8 percent.

Checking the markets now, here in the U.S., we have red arrows across the board, Dow futures are down 14. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right now on Fox Business.
IMUS: Looking at amazon.com here try to come up with my deer antlers spray. CONNELL MCSHANE: Of course.
WARNER WOLF: You and Ray.

IMUS: Well, I guess, there is nothing wrong with that except it does contain apparently a property the NFL forbids but --
WOLF: You don't care about that.


Page 96 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
IMUS: I don't plan to play football in the NFL. So I'm trying to order it on my iPad, but it's not working. When I get home, Friday I will be main lining this stuff. That's what I'm talking about read spray it on my wiener or whatever. Bench pressing Bigfoot.
ROB BARTLETT: Mounting your head on the wall.
TONY POWELL: Have a hard time drinking water though. IMUS: Deer antlers velvet it is called.
BARTLETT: We have pills of that stuff on a remote in New Hampshire or Maine, local sponsor. They gave us a bunch of that stuff.
IMUS: I took it? BARTLETT: I think so.
IMUS: I would have remembered that. What was it supposed to do?

BARTLETT: Get an answer in your pants, make you feel all fired up. The spray probably works better because it gets right into your system. That is what you shoot it at your tongue.

IMUS: If I could just get relief for my shoulders, I would be happy or pain pills, which I don't. They make you feel worse for pain.
MCSHANE: Not for pain.
POWELL: Just walked down the road. (IMUS EXTRA SEGMENT)

UPShas withdrawn its $6.9 billion offer to acquire  TNT Express, a courier delivery services company based in the
Netherlands.

As anticipated, the European Commission issued a formal decision prohibiting the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express because of competition concerns. Consequently,  UPS and TNT Express have terminated merger protocol.

UPS said it had proposed remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction regarding the competitive landscape in Europe. The EC  found in its investigation that the proposed takeover would have restricted competition in 15 EU member states and would have likely led to price increases.
UPS said in a written statement that it is “disappointed in the EC’s decision.”

WHAT'S NEXT FOR TNT?

UPS, the world's largest package-delivery company is expected to post a sharply higher quarterly profit but sales are expected to rise a tepid 2 percent, reflecting overall slow growth in package shipment volumes, a trend that has crimped both UPS and smaller rival FedEx Corp. Investors will also be awaiting more detail on the
Atlanta-based company's failed effort $7 billion takeover bid for  Europe's TNT Express, which  UPS pulled the plug on this month after  European regulators indicated they would not allow the deal to move forward due to anti-trust concerns.

Low prices for ethylene, propylene and other key chemicals are expected to drag on Dow Chemical's results in the fourth quarter. The dip was likely offset by the company's decision in October to lay off 5 percent of its workforce. Also reporting is Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company. In the UK, Shell reports in an environment where the world's top oil companies are likely to show high oil prices don't do the job any more. Earnings are under pressure from weaker refining margins in Europe, low U.S. gas prices, ballooning costs and production shut-downs. Shell has been trying to break the mold and stand out from the crowd by betting hard on the future of its gas "value chain" and on risky Arctic exploration.

The U.S. Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims data that is expected to show new filings edged up from a five-year low. Also, the Commerce Department issues a report on personal income for December.

Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable provider, is expected to report higher earnings and revenue. Investors will be listening for management to explain how it will manage its costs now that the company is shelling out billions on the new LA Dodgers sports channel in Los Angeles. Chief Executive Glenn Britt has been vocal about cutting back on carrying cable channels that get low ratings, so the television industry will be watching to
see which cable network could be on Time Warner Cable's chopping block.

Viacom reports results. Nickelodeon has been the sticking point for Viacom over the past several quarters as the children's cable network suffered a drastic decline in ratings. This quarter however, things are looking up for Nickelodeon - one analyst noted it has beat Disney in the ratings for several weeks now.

Deutsche Bank, Germany's flagship lender, presents full-year results. Overall, Europe's banks in this earnings season are expected to signal that cost-cutting, restructuring and cheaper funding costs are paving the way for better times when they report annual results in coming weeks. But the gains have not been matched by earnings upgrades and, after years of poor returns due to the sovereign debt crisis, tougher regulations and an aggressive shrinking of loans, banks are coming under pressure to show the potential for core earnings growth.

Diageo, the world's biggest spirits maker, reports first half results. First-quarter trading was hampered by duty-free shipment issues but underlying sales were still strong. The surprise pull-out of long-running talks for No. 1 tequila brand Jose Cuervo in December has raised questions as to whether Diageo might make a move on Beam, which owns the No. 2 tequila Sauza.

The U.S. CFTC holds a roundtable discussion where U.S. derivatives regulators will listen to gripes from the industry that new rules unfairly promote futures markets to the detriment of swaps. Speakers expected from CME, ICE, JPMorgan, Tradeweb, Bloomberg, LCH.Clearnet, Barclays and BlackRock.

Whirlpool gives the market a better read of global demand for discretionary goods like appliances when it reports quarterly results. Wall Street expects the world's largest appliance maker's sales to dip slightly in the fourth quarter. Many will want to know if the company's decision to not focus so much on low-end products has hurt market share. Smaller rival Electrolux is also expected to report results this week. Results from Colgate-Palmolive and Energizer may also show how consumers are faring in the United States and in markets such as Latin America.

Dunkin' Brands gets almost 75 percent of revenue and more than 80 percent of profit from its domestic Dunkin' Donuts cafes, so the focus will be on that business when it reports fourth-quarter results. Rival Starbucks put up strong U.S. results last week.

Aetna releases fourth-quarter earnings, which are expected to rise from last year as the company added new members and increased revenue. Aetna has already reconfirmed its 2012 quarterly numbers and given an outlook for an earnings increase in 2013, but investors are looking for insight on the effect of the flu on the business this year, on health care reform and on the development of health insurance exchanges.

Data on Thursday is expected to show Canada's economy expanded a modest 0.2 percent in November from the previous month, suggesting fourth-quarter GDP growth will be tepid and providing further evidence that the Bank of Canada is unlikely to raise interest rates until at least 2014. The economy grew by 0.1 percent in October, following no growth in September and a 0.1 percent decline in August.

MasterCard, the world's second-largest payment network reports its fourth-quarter results before the bell. Despite weak U.S. consumer confidence, MasterCard is expected to do well as more people across the globe choose plastic payments over cash.

Nasdaq reports its fourth-quarter results. The transatlantic exchange operator is expected to report earnings slightly below a year ago, as trading volumes have been down market-wide. Nasdaq said in December it would buy Thomson Reuters Corp's investor relations, public relations and multimedia services units for $390 million as the company looks to increase its non-transaction-based revenue. Nasdaq may also provide guidance on expenses and other measures for 2013.

Potash Corp, the world's largest fertilizer company, reports quarterly earnings that are expected to be hit by a lack of buying by China and India. The company is also expected to release guidance for 2013, and analysts will be looking for comments about when a potash supply contract is likely to be reached between Canpotex and India.

U.S. confectionery giant Hershey posts quarterly results. The company is a favorite of many analysts, as consumers' hearty appetite for chocolate gives it good margins even in a weak economy. Hillshire Brands, the meat company that used to be part of Sara Lee Corp, also reports quarterly results. Analysts will be keen to see if the maker of Hillshire Farm lunch meat and Jimmy Dean sausage updates its outlook for its fiscal year, which is already more than half over. The company outperformed expectations last quarter but was reluctant to raise its forecast so early in the fiscal year.

UPS pulls TNT Express offer

United Parcel Service Inc. on Wednesday withdrew officially its $7 billion offer to buy Dutch shipper  TNT
Express after the European Commission blocked the deal.
The move to terminate the offer  was expected.

"We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction," UPS Chairman and CEO Scott Davis said earlier this month. "The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."

UPS — chief rival to Memphis-based FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) — and TNT Express said in November that they had offered numerous concessions to the European Commission to help seal the deal. The remedies included "the sale of business activities and assets in combination with granting access to air capabilities."

Bloomberg previously reported UPS was prepared to offer rivals, including FedEx, access to its European transportation network and delivery aircraft in order to get a deal done.

Atlanta-based UPS (NYSE: UPS) said its focus would now be on the continued execution of its growth strategy, but it's no doubt a blow to the shipper's large-scale expansion plans. In contrast to UPS' acquisition strategy, FedEx targeted smaller operations to grow its European foothold. Last year, FedEx acquired France's TATEX and Poland's Opek.

EC rejects UPS, TNT merger deal
124 words
30 January 2013
Middle East North Africa Financial Network (MENAFN)
MENAFI
English
Copyright 2013. Middle East North Africa Financial Network Inc.
(MENAFN) United Parcel Service Inc, the world's largest package delivery firm, has lost its opportunity to acquire Dutch rival TNT Express as EU antitrust watchdog vetoed the USD7 billion deal, Reuters reported.
This means that  UPS has to expand through smaller buyouts or organically into  Europe.

The European Commission (EC) argued that UPS had not offered adequate concessions to ensure the deal would not hurt consumers.
The EC also said the proposed merger would have reduced competition in 15 EU countries.
UPS was seeking to tap from TNT's strong network in fast-growing Asian markets and Latin America. UPS said earlier this month that it would withdraw its bid because of opposition from the EU regulator.

for TNT Express, denting the world No. 1 package delivery company's hopes of expanding its presence in Asia and Latin America.

The EU regulatory veto means the world's No. 1 package delivery company may now have to grow via smaller acquisitions or organically, while TNT could come under pressure to change management or revise its business strategy to deflect activist shareholders.

The European Commission said UPS had not offered adequate concessions to ensure the deal would not hurt consumers. UPS had flagged the negative decision on Jan. 14, saying it would withdraw its bid because of opposition from the EU regulator.

The deal, its biggest ever, would have given it access to Dutch peer TNT's stronger networks in fast-growing Asian markets and Latin America and increased its non-U.S. revenues to 36 percent of total sales from the current 26 percent.

The European Commission, the EU competition watchdog, said the proposed merger would have reduced competition in 15 EU countries.

"(The deal) would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified."

UPS had offered to sell TNT's operations in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, with the principal potential buyer France's DPD, but failed to convince the Commission of the merits of its proposal.
TNT is the leading postal delivery company in Europe, with an 18 percent market share against the 10 percent of
UPS. Deutsche Post's DHL unit has 15 percent while FedEx
is a distant fourth player.
TNT shares extended losses after the Commission's decision and were down 2.5 percent to 5.56 euros by 1039
GMT.

30 January 2013 - The European Commission (EC) said on Wednesday it had blocked the deal by US package delivery group United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) to buy Dutch express delivery company  TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT), as it was dissatisfied with the concessions offered to ally competition concerns.

UPS said on 14 January that the regulator had informed it of plans to rule against the transaction, adding it would abandon its offer for  TNT once the EC would formally veto it.
The US group agreed in March last year to take over TNT in a deal valuing the Dutch firm at some EUR5.16bn
(USD7bn).
The EC said in its statement today that the combination would have hurt competition in 15 states in the European
Union, lowering choice between providers and potentially led to higher prices.

The regulator worked with UPS towards a solution, but the buyer had failed to offer enough remedies to avoid competition issues, the EC explained.
UPS, which planned to pay for the deal with existing cash and new debt, had proposed to shed TNT operations in
15 countries to address EC’s worries.

30 January 2013 - US package delivery group United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) on Wednesday said it had abandoned its offer to take over Dutch express delivery company TNT Express NV (AMS:TNT), after the European Commission ruled against the merger.
Both companies have agreed to terminate the transaction sealed in March 2012,  UPS said.

The deal valued the Dutch firm at some EUR5.16bn (USD7bn) and was to be covered with UPS’ existing cash and new debt.

Earlier today, the EC said it had blocked the transaction as the remedies proposed by UPS were not sufficient to address competition issues in 15 European Union countries.

In its own statement, the US company expressed disappointment with EC’s ruling, saying that the concessions it had offered to the regulator were significant and tangible. UPS still believes that a combination with TNT would have transformed the logistics industry, generating substantial benefits to consumers and customers globally, while backing much needed growth in Europe.
The US group will continue its growth strategy, UPS added.

BRUSSELS, Belgium - The European Union has confirmed its rejection of a $6.9 billion deal for  UPS to acquire Dutch delivery company TNT Express _ two weeks after the U.S. company pulled out of the venture because of EU objections.

Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday that  European businesses ``would have been directly harmed'' by the takeover ``because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases.''

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS said that it had proposed ``tangible remedies'' but Almunia said they were ``simply not enough.''

Brussels officially blocks  UPS-TNT deal on competition grounds
European Commission
1,030 words
30 January 2013

The European Commission today officially announced it has prohibited the €5.2 billion acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS due to the impact on competition in the  European express market, and justified its decision in a detailed statement.
The European competition authority said the proposed acquisition would have restricted competition in 15
Member States when it comes to the express delivery of small packages to another  European country. These
were Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the
Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden.

In these Member States, the acquisition would have reduced the number of significant players to only 3 or 2, leaving sometimes DHL as the only alternative to UPS. The concentration would therefore have likely harmed customers by causing price increases, the Commission said.

Outlining the events of the last 10 months since UPS and TNT announced the agreed takeover last March prompting Brussels’ competition investigation, the Commission said that during the investigation, UPS offered to divest TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries and allow the buyer to access its intra-European air network for five years. The Commission carried out an in-depth assessment, including a market test where customers and other interested parties were consulted. However, these remedies proved inadequate to address the identified competition concerns, it stated.

Joaquín Almunia, Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, said: "Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. This requires access to affordable, reliable services that truly fit their needs. These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases. We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified".

The Commission said its investigation focused on the markets for international express deliveries of small packages in the European Economic Area (EEA). The main providers of these services are so-called "integrators" that control international integrated air and ground small package delivery networks. There are only four integrators in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. FedEx, for its part, has low market shares in a number of countries where it does not exercise a significant competitive constraint on UPS and TNT, because of the lack of density and scale of its European network. Other market players, such as national postal operators, can only compete to a limited extent because they do not reach comparable efficiency or reliability, given their heavy reliance on road rather than air transport, according to Brussels.

If the notified acquisition had been allowed, many customers in 15 Member States would only have been able to choose between UPS, DHL and (sometimes) FedEx for the services they need. This would have likely led to price increases, the Commission said. Moreover, the possible benefits of the merger, i.e. any cost-savings passed on
to customers as a result of the combination of UPS and TNT's air networks, would not have been sufficient to outweigh the negative effects on competition, it added.

To address the Commission's concerns, UPS proposed to divest TNT's subsidiaries in the 15 relevant Member States, plus - under certain conditions - TNT's subsidiaries in Spain and Portugal, to further increase the volume of small package express deliveries that would be transferred to the purchaser. UPS also offered access to its air network for 5 years, should the purchaser not be a so-called "integrator".
Page 109 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
However, to provide intra-EEA express deliveries from the 17 countries covered by the remedy package, the purchaser would have needed suitable networks or partners in these other countries. This requirement alone severely limited the number of potentially suitable purchasers, casting doubt over the effectiveness of the remedies. To dispel this uncertainty, UPS would have needed to sign a binding agreement with a suitable purchaser before the concentration was implemented. However, UPS did not propose this to the Commission and its last minute attempt to sign such an agreement before the end of the Commission's investigation did not materialise.

Moreover, the Commission had serious doubts as to the ability of the very few potential purchasers that expressed their interest to exercise a sufficient competitive constraint on the merged entity in intra-EEA express delivery markets on the basis of the remedies offered. In particular, a buyer that is not already an integrator would need the ability and incentive to invest in its own air transport solution and to upgrade its ground network in order to become a sufficient competitive threat on the merged entity. Without sufficient volume in express deliveries it is doubtful that such an incentive would exist.

The Commission found that small package and freight delivery services should be distinguished. Unlike freight, small packages can be handled by a single person without specific equipment. They are transported via a specific infrastructure, in particular automated sorting centres and small vehicles, which are not suitable for freight.

Within small package delivery services, the Commission differentiated between domestic deliveries, international deliveries within the EEA and international services to the rest of the world. These categories satisfy different needs and require different networks.

The Commission also distinguished express services from slower services, called "deferred" deliveries. A number of users need to be sure that certain items (for instance spare parts) are delivered within one day. Such users would not be able to envisage switching to deferred services as a result of a price increase.

International intra-EEA express services are predominantly used by business users for shipping sensitive items such as time-critical documents, finished or semi-finished goods, spare parts, samples, etc. As proposed by UPS, the Commission found that markets for intra-EEA express deliveries were national in scope. They are defined by reference to the location of the customer. The Commission identified competition concerns in 15 of these national markets.

UPS withdraws TNT takeover offer after EC blocks  €5.2bn deal

UPS today announced the withdrawal of its offer for  TNT Express after the  European Commission officially confirmed it was prohibiting the €5.2 billion deal.

As expected, the  European Commission announced that it was blocking the takeover of  TNT by UPS due to the impact on competition in the  European express market. Competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said the proposed acquisition would have restricted competition in 15  EU member states and  UPS’ proposed remedies were inadequate to resolve Brussels’ concerns.

On January 14, UPS had already announced that it expected the European Commission to prohibit the deal and said it would withdraw its offer once Brussels had made a formal decision.

In response to today’s Commission announcement, UPS issued a statement saying that as a result of the prohibition by the EC, the offer condition relating to EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and the acquisition of TNT Express by UPS will not be completed. Given this outcome, the two companies entered a separate agreement to terminate the Merger Protocol. UPS will pay TNT an agreed €200 million termination fee.

Commenting on the EC’s decision, UPS said it had proposed “significant and tangible” remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction concerning the competitive landscape in Europe. UPS reiterated that it believed that the combined company would have been “transformative” for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting much needed growth in Europe in particular.

Looking ahead, UPS said it was “disappointed” in the EC's decision but the company's focus was on “the continued execution of its growth strategy”. Analysts and observers expect company executives to comment on the failed TNT deal tomorrow (January 31) when UPS releases its Q4 and full year 2012 financial results.
TNT Express declined to comment on the Brussels announcement. Spokesman Ernst Moeksis told
CEP-Research: “We have nothing to add to our press release issued on the 14th of January. We will inform the
market on our stand alone strategy in due course.”

The Dutch company said on January 14 that it regretted the failure of the merger which it believed was “feasible and beneficial for all stakeholders”. TNT management would focus on reassuring customers, ensuring employee commitment and strengthening the strategy, including further steps to improve profitability. TNT is due to announce its Q4, 2012 and full-year results on February 18.

EU turns down UPS acquisition of TNT after UPS had abandoned  the deal over EU objections

BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The European Union's antitrust chief on Wednesday rejected a $6.9 billion deal for  UPS to acquire Dutch delivery company TNT Express and said he was surprised the U.S. group jettisoned the venture when there was still hope for a solution.

Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that  European businesses ``would have been directly harmed'' by the takeover ``because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases.''

UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL. UPS said that it had proposed ``tangible remedies'' but Almunia said they were ``simply not enough.''

Sensing a likely rejection, UPS scrapped the acquisition on Jan. 14, hitting the stock price of the Dutch delivery company. The decision surprised Almunia, convinced there still was room to find a compromise.

``I have to confess that I was a little bit surprised because we still had time when they published this statement,'' Almunia told reporters.

``We have experience that the final elements of a possible solution, a positive alternative, are not found the first day of negotiations but as close as possible to the last day of negotiations,'' he said.

The Commission reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, such as the sale of business parts, to safeguard market balance.

It only was the third merger that Almunia rejected out of some 800 cases since he became the EU's competition commissioner in 2010. Yet is showed the power of the EU's antitrust division in setting the conditions for multinationals to operate in the 27-nation bloc.
The TNT takeover would have been the largest acquisition in UPS's history.

``UPS believes that the combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting much needed growth in Europe in particular,'' the company said in a statement Wednesday.

Almunia, however, disagreed. The EU found that it would have restricted competition in 15 member states, where the market would have been reduced to just 3 or 2 companies.

The EU was still looking for further concessions from UPS to make the deal palatable when the Atlanta, Ga. company scrapped it.

``We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems,'' Almunia said.
UPS had offered in March to buy TNT, Europe's second-largest delivery company, to better compete with
Europe's largest, Deutsche Post's DHL.
Despite the setback, Almunia was convinced TNT Express would remain a viable company.

``I don't think TNT is an ailing firm, not at all,'' Almunia said. ``They are present in the market. I am sure they will continue to be in the market.''

By Vanessa Mock

A merger between two express-delivery giants might not sound like the sexiest of news stories. But the proposed tie-up between United Parcel Service Inc. and TNT Express NV that was declared dead Wednesday was one of the most closely watched deals of 2012, keeping countless investors riveted.

The EUR5.2 billion ($6.99 billion) deal was a roller-coaster ride not only for the hundreds of hedge funds that had bet on it securing regulatory clearance, but also for all the parties involved. As he sounded the official death knell on Wednesday, the European Union's competition chief Joaquín Almunia said even he had been taken aback at how negotiations had unraveled.

UPS had announced on Jan. 14 that EU regulators were planning to block the merger, even though the formal decision wasn't due until early February. That move came after an apparently very difficult meeting a few days earlier between UPS and EU regulators, about which the two sides have a very different narrative.

"I have to confess that I was a little bit surprised, because we still had time when [UPS] published this statement," Mr. Almunia told reporters in Brussels. "As on many different occasions ... the final elements of a positive solution
... are not found on the first day but as close as possible on the last day of the negotiations."

UPS insiders, however, say that Mr. Almunia's team had made clear they were preparing to block the deal. Had that not been the case, why else would they have thrown in the towel on a merger they had had in their sights for years? "We were told at the meeting that they were working on a prohibition," said one person at UPS.
The denouement is all the more intriguing as, prior to that crunch meeting at the EU's headquarters late on Jan.
11., things had appeared to be slowly coming together. UPS had revised its earlier package of concessions by
offering to sell TNT assets in 12 European countries, and it had hoped to that DPD, a French-owned parcel firm --
could buy those assets.
Much work remained for UPS to convince regulators that DPD could fill the market gap left by the TNT-UPS
tie-up, which the commission feared would erode competition in this key sector. Yet even legal experts involved in
the talks seemed quietly confident that the deal could eventually get the green light.

"But that meeting was very difficult. The EU wanted one more, important concession from UPS and UPS said no," said one person familiar with the negotiations, without elaborating. "So it's perhaps open to question just how
badly UPS really wanted this."

UPS never made a secret of the fact that the deal had to be financially viable and that too many freebies would erode the business rationale for the merger. In the days running up to Jan. 11, some in the company had signaled they felt they were already being stretched to the limit. A demand for concessions from, say, another large European market could have proved a step too far. It's also clear that UPS ran out of time to properly seal the
deal with DPD in a way that could have cut muster with the European Commission. And, some say, the firm may have been a touch too confident in its dealings with regulators and too fixated on trying to change the way they viewed this complex sector.

In the end, the collapse of the merger produces no obvious corporate winners, not even UPS's U.S. rival FedEx Corp., which would have been the commission's preferred buyer but which had signaled it isn't interested in picking up the pieces. TNT's shares have taken a major battering since the deal collapsed and its prospects now

look a little less certain. So it could be just a matter of time before the next merger is announced and the pass-the-parcel game starts all over again.

EU Blocks  United Parcel Service, TNT Merger
503 words
30 January 2013

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday formally blocked a proposed merger between U.S. express delivery giant United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE), saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries.

The decision had been expected after UPS said earlier this month that it would abandon its 5.2 billion euro ($6.99 billion) bid for its Dutch rival, saying the European Commission had told the U.S. firm it was working on a
decision to block the deal.

The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were "inadequate".
"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was
simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," the EU's competition chief Joaquin
Almunia said in a statement.

In particular, the commission said it had been concerned that the tie-up would have reduced the number of players in the express delivery sector from four to only three or even two. It said Germany's DHL would in some case have been left as the only alternative to UPS.

"Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. [...] These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," Mr. Almunia said.

UPS revised its proposal to overcome concerns the commission several times over the past months. It had hoped that a plan to sell some assets to DPD, a parcel-delivery company controlled by French state-owned postal group La Poste, could have created a new pan-European overnight-parcel-delivery competitor, or integrator.

UPS proposed to divest TNT's subsidiaries in the 15 relevant EU countries, as well in Spain and Portugal under certain conditions. It also offered access to its air network for 5 years to sweeten the offer.

However, the commission said it needed the purchaser of those assets to have had suitable networks or partners in the other EU countries.

"UPS would have needed to sign a binding agreement with a suitable purchaser before the concentration was implemented. However, UPS did not propose this to the Commission and its last minute attempt to sign such an agreement before the end of the Commission's investigation did not materialise," the commission said in a statement.

There are currently only four integrators, or firms that offer a full air and road network for express delivery services, in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx, the latter seen as trailing the others owing to its low market shares in a number of countries.

EU Blocks  United Parcel Service, TNT Merger

BRUSSELS--European Union regulators Wednesday formally blocked a proposed merger between U.S. express delivery giant United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE), saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries.

The decision had been expected after UPS said earlier this month that it would abandon its 5.2 billion euro ($6.99 billion) bid for its Dutch rival, saying the European Commission had told the U.S. firm it was working on a
decision to block the deal.

The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were "inadequate".
"We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was
simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," the EU's competition chief Joaquin
Almunia said in a statement.

In particular, the commission said it had been concerned that the tie-up would have reduced the number of players in the express delivery sector from four to only three or even two. It said Germany's DHL would in some case have been left as the only alternative to UPS.

"Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. [...] These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," Mr. Almunia said.

BRUSSELS--The European Union's competition chief Joaquin Almunia said Wednesday he was surprised that United Parcel Services Inc. (UPS) announced it wouldn't complete its planned merger with Dutch rival  TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE) earlier this month, saying there was still a time window to find a way to clear the 5.2 billion euro ($6.99 billion) deal.

UPS said on Jan. 14 that EU regulators were planning to block the merger with TNT after they held a meeting with Mr. Almunia's team, though the formal decision wasn't due until early February.

"I have to confess that I was a little bit surprised, because we still had time when they published this statement," Mr. Almunia told reporters in Brussels.

"As on many different occasions...the final elements of a positive solution, of a positive alternative are not found on the first day but as close as possible on the last day of the negotiations," he added.

On Wednesday, the European Commission said it would block the deal, saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries. The commission, which reviewed the merger, said it has sought to address antitrust concerns with UPS but that concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were "inadequate."

European Commission officially halts UPS-TNT merger

The European Commission has officially issued a decision prohibiting the proposed merger between  UPS and
TNT Express, saying it would restrict competition in the  EU small package market.
The ruling had been expected for some time.  UPS and TNT have agreed to terminate the merger plans, with  UPS
owing a $267 million termination fee.

The commission said the number of small-package players in 15 of its member states would have been reduced from three to two, with DHL being the only non-UPS option in some areas. FedEx does have a presence in Europe, but its market share is limited.

This, the European Commission reasoned, would have lead more easily to price increases. Even with UPS agreeing to sell off parts of TNT in the countries at question, the commission found that it was not enough to save the merger.

The commission’s Joaquín Almunia said businesses need affordable access to guaranteed next-day small package delivery. That would have not been possible once the merger was completed, he said.

“These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases,” he said in a statement. “We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified.”

News of the impending decision leaked out last month, so the major players in the ongoing TNT Express-UPS saga have had time to voice their distaste with the European Commission’s decision. PostNL, a major shareholder of TNT Express, played a major role in trying to push the negotiations through. When the EC news initially broke, Herna Verhagen, chief executive officer of PostNL, mentioned that PostNL would look to get rid of its TNT Express shares.

In the end, though, the commission reasoned it was looking out for the best interest of European consumers. Many industry watchers assumed FedEx would pick up the divested pieces of TNT Express to alleviate the European Union’s concern and provide a bit more parity in the market. In the end, though, FedEx never expressed that much interest. Some blamed DHL for muddying the waters.

At Transport Intelligence, Joel Ray called foul for political reasons, saying the European Commission’s reluctance was “driven by a desire to engineer a market structure through political motivations.” He added that European shippers ultimately lost out.

“European shippers would have gained from the acquisition through a strong new road- and air-based player,” he said. “This decision has set the market back many years and risks reducing competition, not increasing it.”

While UPS will be fine, it’s much more difficult to predict the road ahead for TNT Express. TNT’s former CEO, Marie-Christine Lombard, resigned in September, and if PostNL jumps ship, it could prove disastrous for the integrator.

“At the end of the day, I don’t know what TNT is ultimately going to do,” Bill Greene, managing director of transportation at Morgan Stanley, said during a recent market update webcast. “At this point, they have to refocus; they need a CEO and a standalone strategy.” -  Jon Ross

United Parcel Service Inc. on Wednesday withdrew officially its $7 billion offer to buy Dutch shipper  TNT
Express after the European Commission blocked the deal.
The move to terminate the offer  was expected.

“We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC’s concerns with the transaction,” UPS Chairman and CEO Scott Davis said earlier this month. “The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular.”

UPS and TNT Express said in November that they had offered numerous concessions to the European Commission to help seal the deal. The remedies included “the sale of business activities and assets in combination with granting access to air capabilities.”
Atlanta-based UPS (NYSE: UPS) said its focus would now be on the continued execution of its growth strategy. Did you find this article useful? Why not  subscribe to Atlanta Business Chronicle for more articles and leads? Visit

(AE) COMPETITION: Commission blocks  UPS-TNT Express merger

Brussels, 30/01/2013 (Agence Europe) -On 30 January 2013, the European Commission blocked the planned buy-up of Dutch courier company TNT Express by its US competitor UPS because its investigaiton found that the takeover would have restricted competition by reducing from four to three (or even two - DHL and  UPS)
significant players in some countries and would lead to price increases for parcel delivery in 29 countries, seriously restricting competition in 15 member states. The various proposed remedies put forward by  UPS failed to allay the Commission's concerns.

Setting out the case at a press conference, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that the four big operators -UPS, DHL, TNT and FedEx - are “integrators” that control international integrated air and ground small package delivery networks with IT systems, local sorting centres and transport networks capable of providing international next-day deliveries and competing with each other within the European Economic Area (EEA). A UPS/TNT merger would reduce them to three (UPS, DHL and FedEx) or even two in some countries because FedEx has low market shares in a number of countries where it does not exercise a significant competitive constraint on UPS and TNT, because of the lack of density and scale of its European network. Other market players, such as national postal operators, can only compete to a limited extent because they do not reach comparable efficiency or reliability, given their heavy reliance on road rather than air transport. This would have led to price increases in 29 countries without any substantial benefits in terms of increased reliability or speed.
The deal would also have raised serious competition issues in all the new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe, along with Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Malta and the Netherlands. During the investigation, UPS offered to divest TNT's subsidiaries in 15 countries, but the Commission argued that none of its competitors (not even the French Post Office) had the size needed to compete effectively against DHL and UPS. Moreover, UPS should have signed a binding agreement with a suitable purchaser before the merger was implemented, yet it
tried to sign the deal with UPS before the end of the Commission's investigation - “far too late”, said the commissioner. The ban on the UPS/TNT merger is the third of such a huge scale in more than 800 cases given the go-ahead since 2010. (FG/transl.fl)

European Union: Mergers - Commission prohibits proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS -
frequently asked questions

31 January 2013
Thai News Service

Section: General News - What are the main features of the small package delivery industry?

A small package differs from a freight unit in that a single person can handle it without specific equipment such as a forklift. Operators active in this segment employ dedicated structures - such as local sorting centres, larger sorting centres (called hubs), truck and small van fleets and in certain cases aircraft fleets - that are not suitable for freight transport. This is why small package delivery services are specific within the logistics and transport industry. The main service providers are so-called "integrators", followed by national postal operators, freight forwarders (who in general resell small package delivery services effectively provided by other companies), as
well as a myriad of local small delivery companies, some of which cooperate within international partner networks.
What is an integrator?

An integrator controls an international integrated air and ground small package delivery network. In practice, integrators control extensive aircraft fleets which allow them to move small packages quickly over long distances. Integrators also control ground networks made up of road vehicles and sorting centres, which allow them in particular to move small packages within a given country to and from their air gateways. An integrator does not necessarily own aircraft. Instead, it may rely on contractual arrangements, such as chartering or leasing, that they allow to determine aircraft routings, frequencies and schedules. Some "non-integrators" use air transport for their small package delivery operations. However, they do it by simply buying capacity on flights operated by third parties, which does not provide the same level of flexibility as that enjoyed by integrators. In Europe, there are
only four integrators: UPS and TNT Express (the parties to the concentration at issue), DHL (a subsidiary of
Deutsche Post) and FedEx (a US-based company).
What are intra-EEA express services?

Express services are those for which a provider commits to delivering small packages on the day following pick-up (sometimes before noon or even earlier in the morning). For international deliveries in the European Economic Area (EEA), it is very challenging to meet such a commitment. It requires networks which are specifically organised for this type of very fast deliveries, very finely tuned processes, sophisticated IT systems. Moreover, "intra-EEA express" deliveries, unlike slower services (which are called "deferred" or "standard") require air transport to meet the time commitments, in particular for long distance shipments. Demand for
Intra-EEA express services comes predominantly from business users. They need these services to ship sensitive - and sometimes high-value - items, such as time-critical documents, spare parts, critical machinery components, samples sent for testing or approval, healthcare devices or products etc.

On what basis did the Commission conclude that intra-EEA express and deferred services are in separate markets?

The Commission's market investigation showed that many customers need to be sure that certain items they ship are delivered the next day. They are ready to pay a significant price premium for this service and for the thorough track-and-trace services associated to it. Such customers would not be ready - and in certain cases, would simply not be able - to switch from express to deferred services as a result of a price increase. For some of them, it
would require a significant re-organisation of their supply chains.

Moreover, the evidence collected by the Commission, in particular concerning UPS and TNT's own practices, show that service providers are to a large extent able to distinguish customers that would be ready to switch from express to deferred as a result of a price increase from those that would not, and can take this element into

Page 126 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
account in price negotiations. Indeed in the small package delivery industry, prices are not uniformly set for all customers. Most customers negotiate discounts, which can be substantial. In this context, service providers collect detailed information on customers, notably on their expected and past shipping behaviour, volumes and
specific requirements for delivery speed. This allows service providers to identify customers that would be unlikely to consider deferred services as an option and would therefore more easily accept a price rise for express services.

Besides, the investigation has shown that whilst certain assets are used for both express and deferred services, networks used only for deferred would require substantial adaptations to be used also for express. Necessary adaptations consist for example in the use of faster - but smaller - road vehicles, quicker sorting times in depots and hubs, or additional line-haul links between hubs and depots. Furthermore, a significant part of intra-EEA express deliveries cannot be performed without air transport, contrary to deferred deliveries. As a result, providers of deferred services would be unlikely to be able to quickly launch express services, even if they had incentives to do so.
What is the geographic scope of the market for intra-EEA express deliveries?

Most customers negotiate their contracts for intra-EEA express services on a national basis. A supplier cannot easily gain new customers and volumes in a given country without having already a market presence in that country. Therefore, the Commission considered that these markets were national in scope. The market for
intra-EEA express services of a given country includes all intra-EEA express deliveries performed for customers located in that country, irrespective of the destination of the shipments.
What are the Commission's concerns on intra-EEA express markets?

UPS, TNT Express and DHL are strong market players and close competitors, while all other competitors, including FedEx, are far less important. The take-over of TNT Express by UPS would have reduced the number of significant providers from 3 to 2 in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden.

This would have meant a significant loss of competition and would likely have harmed customers. This has been corroborated by the price concentration analysis conducted by UPS, which measured the relationship between the price and the number of players on the various markets at issue on the basis of prices actually charged by
UPS and TNT Express in the recent past. This analysis predicted that prices would increase in 29 EEA countries, despite DHL's position as market leader in a number of countries. The Commission performed its own price concentration analysis, which confirmed this outcome but forecasted higher price increases than UPS' model.

Since barriers to entry are particularly high on these markets given the need for sophisticated IT systems, air transport and ground networks geared to express in all countries, it is unlikely that these price increases would have been counteracted by the entry of new competitors. In addition, customers do not have sufficient bargaining power to counteract predicted price increases. Finally, even if the planned concentration was likely to generate cost savings for the combined entity, the part of these savings that would have been passed on to customers would have been insufficient to compensate for price increases resulting from the lessening of competition.

On that basis, the Commission concluded that without proper remedies, the planned concentration would significantly harm customers in 15 countries: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden.
On what basis did the Commission consider that non-integrators exerted no significant competitive constraint on
UPS and TNT Express?

Non-integrators mainly focus on domestic and international deferred services, rather than international express. This is the case even for large postal operators such as La Poste and Royal Mail, which offer cross-border small package delivery services in a number of countries through subsidiaries such as DPD, Chronopost and Seur (for La Poste), GLS and Parcelforce (for Royal Mail).

Their offering of intra-EEA express services is limited. In most countries, these services are offered on the basis of road transport. In these cases, intra-EEA express deliveries usually cannot be performed for destinations located beyond neighbouring countries.

By contrast, from any given EEA country, UPS and TNT Express can reach nearly all other EEA countries on the next day thanks to their air network. Furthermore, for the majority of these countries, they can cover most of the national territory with express intra-EEA inbound deliveries, i.e. incoming express packages.

Page 127 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the few cases where non-integrators use air transport to a meaningful extent, they do it on the basis of outsourcing, by simply buying capacity on flights operated by commercial airlines or integrators. However, this does not allow them to reach a similar level of efficiency and reliability as integrators. Indeed, through the control that they exercise on aircraft routings and schedules, integrators constantly adapt their air networks to their flows of small packages so as to maximise efficiency. Moreover, integrators have put in place far-reaching contingency plans involving, for example, the use of back-up aircraft or changes of routings, in order to address unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions. This strongly limits the risks of delays.

In addition, customers often perceive non-integrators' services as being of lower quality than integrators' services, notably in terms of reliability and track-and-trace.
How did the Commission analyse the claimed benefits of the merger?

UPS communicated that by combining its networks with those of TNT significant cost savings could be achieved which would benefit customers. The range of annual savings would be 400-550 million in three main areas: (i) ground transportation costs (ii) air network and (iii) management and administrative overheads.

The Commission carried out an in-depth assessment of these efficiencies claimed by UPS. It found that overhead costs were unlikely to benefit customers, because their allocation to individual packages and therefore pricing decisions for customer contracts could not be verified. Efficiencies related to ground and air transportation costs would normally benefit customers. However, the Commission's investigation found that efficiencies regarding ground transportation costs that could be ascribed to express deliveries were not clear enough. Therefore, the Commission could only take into account efficiencies related to air transportation. These were expected to materialise sufficiently quickly after the implementation of the concentration and were unlikely to be achievable by other means than the planned concentration.

The Commission calculated the part of these cost savings that would be passed on to consumers in the form of a price reduction and compared these figures with the price increases predicted by its price concentration model. This showed that in many countries efficiencies passed on to customers would not outweigh price increases caused by the lessening of competition.

This analysis was one of the elements taken into consideration to identify the countries in which the transaction would be likely to raise competition concerns.
Why were the remedies proposed by UPS insufficient to remove the competition concerns?

UPS proposed a first remedy package on the last day of the remedies deadline. It then submitted two successive revised versions. Even though the proposals were put forward at a very late stage of the process, the Commission took them very seriously and conducted two extensive market tests.

UPS' remedy proposals were based on two main pillars: (1) a divestment of TNT Express' subsidiaries in the 15 countries where the Commission had identified competition concerns, plus two additional countries (Spain and Portugal) in the event that the purchaser would be a non-integrator, in order to increase the divested intra-EEA express volumes; (2) a 5- year access to UPS's intra-European air network in order to allow the purchaser to continue the intra-EEA express operations of the divested businesses, should the purchaser be a non-integrator.

For the competition concerns to be addressed, the Commission had to be satisfied that the divested TNT businesses would likely be acquired by a company able and willing to continue the intra-EEA express operations of the acquired entities and compete actively with UPS and DHL in these markets. Only such a company could be regarded as a "suitable purchaser" in the meaning of the EU Merger Regulation.

However, from the outset it was clear that only very few potentially suitable purchasers existed. Among the integrators, FedEx would have been the only possible suitable purchaser. Indeed, a hypothetical acquisition by DHL would have been likely to give rise to similar competition concerns as for the merging parties.

As regards non-integrators, the number of potential purchasers that could be regarded as suitable was limited, in particular for the following reasons:
- First, the market test showed that certain non-integrators might be willing to purchase the divested businesses
to focus on their domestic and international deferred operations - which form the core business of non-integrators
- and might neglect or even abandon altogether the intra-EEA express operations of the divested businesses.
Therefore, it would have been possible to accept a non-integrator as a purchaser only with sufficient elements
demonstrating that the buyer had a strategy to maintain and expand intra-EEA express operations.

Page 128 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
- Secondly, there was a risk that after 5 years, the purchaser would not be able to find a suitable air transport solution as a substitute for the temporary access offered by UPS to its own air network. Again, the Commission would have needed to receive sufficient assurances from a non-integrator purchaser that it would find an adequate air transport solution after 5 years.

- Thirdly, to continue to perform intra-EEA express services from the countries covered by the remedy package to all the other EEA countries, the purchaser would have needed suitable networks or partnerships in these other destination countries. This last condition is not met by the vast majority of the non-integrators, who have a limited geographic footprint in Europe.

In view of these constraints and the position taken by the various market players during the market tests, it turned out that there would be only very few potentially suitable purchasers and considerable uncertainties as to whether any of them would eventually purchase the divested businesses, continue its intra-EEA express operations and exert sufficient competitive pressure on UPS.

Under these circumstances, a solution ensuring that the concentration would not be implemented before a binding agreement was signed between UPS and a suitable purchaser was required. However, UPS did not propose to commit to signing such an agreement before implementation of the acquisition as part of the remedies package (a so-called "upfront buyer" solution). It made a last minute attempt to sign such an agreement before
the Commission completed its investigation (so-called "fix-it-first solution") but this attempt did not materialise. Therefore, the Commission had to conclude that the remedies were insufficient.

In the market tests, La Poste expressed an interest in the divested businesses. UPS and La Poste had also engaged in negotiations concerning the remedies, although this occurred at a late stage during the procedure. Having thoroughly analysed the information provided by La Poste, the Commission could not conclude that the company was a suitable purchaser. In particular, the Commission was unconvinced that DPD would have, on the basis of the volume in express deliveries involved, the incentive to invest in its own air transport solution after the
5 year air access agreement with UPS and to upgrade its ground network in order to become a sufficient competitive threat on the merged entity in express deliveries. This further increased the serious risks that the remedies would not be effective.
Did you cooperate with the US authorities?

In view of the limited operations of TNT Express in the United States, the transaction was not reviewed by the US competition authorities. The main territory that would have been affected by the planned take-over would have been Europe.

European Union: Mergers - Commission blocks  proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS

Section: General News - The  European Commission has prohibited under the  EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS. The Commission found that the take-over would have restricted competition in 15 Member States1 when it comes to the express delivery of small packages to another  European country. In these Member States, the acquisition would have reduced the number of significant players to only 3
or 2, leaving sometimes DHL as the only alternative to  UPS. The concentration would therefore have likely harmed customers by causing price increases. During the investigation,  UPS offered to divest  TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries and allow the buyer to access its intra-European air network for five years. The
Commission carried out an in-depth assessment, including a market test where customers and other interested parties were consulted. However, these remedies proved inadequate to address the identified competition concerns.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. This requires access to affordable, reliable services that truly fit their needs. These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases. We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in
the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified".

The Commission's investigation focused on the markets for international express deliveries of small packages in the European Economic Area (EEA). The main providers of these services are so-called "integrators" that control international integrated air and ground small package delivery networks. There are only four integrators in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. FedEx, for its part, has low market shares in a number of countries where it does not exercise a significant competitive constraint on UPS and TNT, because of the lack of density and scale of its European network. Other market players, such as national postal operators, can only compete to a limited extent because they do not reach comparable efficiency or reliability, given their heavy reliance on road rather than air transport.

If the notified acquisition had been allowed, many customers in 15 Member States would only have been able to choose between UPS, DHL and (sometimes) FedEx for the services they need. This would have likely led to price increases.

Moreover, the possible benefits of the merger, i.e. any cost-savings passed on to customers as a result of the combination of UPS and TNT's air networks, would not have been sufficient to outweigh the negative effects on competition.
Remedies proposed by UPS

To address the Commission's concerns, UPS proposed to divest TNT's subsidiaries in the 15 relevant Member States, plus - under certain conditions - TNT's subsidiaries in Spain and Portugal, to further increase the volume of small package express deliveries that would be transferred to the purchaser. UPS also offered access to its air network for 5 years, should the purchaser not be a so-called "integrator".

However, to provide intra-EEA express deliveries from the 17 countries covered by the remedy package, the purchaser would have needed suitable networks or partners in these other countries. This requirement alone severely limited the number of potentially suitable purchasers, casting doubt over the effectiveness of the remedies. To dispel this uncertainty, UPS would have needed to sign a binding agreement with a suitable purchaser before the concentration was implemented. However, UPS did not propose this to the Commission and
Page 130 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
its last minute attempt to sign such an agreement before the end of the Commission's investigation did not materialise.

Moreover, the Commission had serious doubts as to the ability of the very few potential purchasers that expressed their interest to exercise a sufficient competitive constraint on the merged entity in intra-EEA express delivery markets on the basis of the remedies offered. In particular, a buyer that is not already an integrator would need the ability and incentive to invest in its own air transport solution and to upgrade its ground network in order to become a sufficient competitive threat on the merged entity. Without sufficient volume in express deliveries it is doubtful that such an incentive would exist.
Relevant markets

The Commission found that small package and freight delivery services should be distinguished. Unlike freight, small packages can be handled by a single person without specific equipment. They are transported via a specific infrastructure, in particular automated sorting centres and small vehicles, which are not suitable for freight.

Within small package delivery services, the Commission differentiated between domestic deliveries, international deliveries within the EEA and international services to the rest of the world. These categories satisfy different needs and require different networks.

The Commission also distinguished express services from slower services, called "deferred" deliveries. A number of users need to be sure that certain items (for instance spare parts) are delivered within one day. Such users would not be able to envisage switching to deferred services as a result of a price increase.

International intra-EEA express services are predominantly used by business users for shipping sensitive items such as time-critical documents, finished or semi-finished goods, spare parts, samples, etc.

As proposed by UPS, the Commission found that markets for intra-EEA express deliveries were national in scope. They are defined by reference to the location of the customer. The Commission identified competition concerns in 15 of these national markets.
Background

UPS is a US-based global provider of specialised transportation and logistics services. TNT Express is a Dutch company also active in the global logistics sector. In the EEA, both companies are active in small package delivery services, air and road cargo transport, freight forwarding and contract logistics.

Small package deliveries form a network industry, relying on the integration of a number of assets (local sorting centres, ground and air hubs, road vehicles, aircraft etc.). Express services are those for which a provider commits to delivering small packages in one day.

The transaction was notified to the Commission in June 2012. In July, the Commission opened an in-depth investigation (see IP/12/816) and sent UPS a statement of objections setting out its competition concerns in October 2012. UPS submitted remedies in November, in December 2012 and on 3 January 2013.

More information will be available on the competition website, in the Commission's public case register under the case number M.6570.
See also MEMO/13/48.
Merger control rules and procedures

The Commission has the duty to assess mergers and acquisitions involving companies with a turnover above certain thresholds (see Article 1 of the Merger Regulation) and to prevent concentrations that would significantly impede effective competition in the EEA or any substantial part of it.

The vast majority of notified mergers do not pose competition problems and are cleared after a routine review. From the moment a transaction is notified, the Commission generally has a total of 25 working days to decide whether to grant approval (Phase I) or to start an in-depth investigation (Phase II).

There are currently three other on-going phase II investigations. The first one examines the planned acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair (see IP/12/921). The Commission has until 6 March to reach a final decision. The second phase II investigation concerns the proposed combination of Munksjö and the European label and processing business of Ahlstrom, in the paper industry (see IP/12/1338), with a deadline on 16 May 2013. Finally, in the third

on-going phase II, the Commission investigates Syniverse's project to acquire rival Mach in the data house clearing sector (see IP/12/1439). Deadline here is 30 May 2013.

After UPS-TNT, more merger battles to come

Joaquín Almunia’s predecessor as competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, ended her five-year mandate having barred two mergers. The previous negative decisions hinged on potential harm to consumers and whether harm could be offset by increased network efficiencies, write Mario Mariniello and Alice Gambarin.

Mario Mariniello is a research fellow and Alice Gambarin is a research intern at Bruegel, a  European think tank specialising in economics.

"After Olympic/Aegean and Deutsche Börse/NYSE, the decision on UPS/TNT is Joaquín Almunia’s third merger prohibition since he became the European Union's competition chief in 2010.

Almunia’s predecessor as competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, ended her five-year mandate having barred two mergers. The previous negative decisions hinged on potential harm to consumers and whether harm could be offset by increased network efficiencies.

Remedies were offered but were not deemed effective enough to tilt the balance in favour of efficiencies and ensure that the merger would not have anti-competitive effects.

UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx are ‘global integrators’. They combine trucks and planes and can guarantee overnight express deliveries throughout Europe. According to the Commission, local players lack the tools to offer such a service, particularly for cross-border shipments.

The express business-to-business small packages delivery segment could therefore have been qualified as a de-facto self-standing market in which only four major players could significantly exert reciprocal competitive pressure.
In at least one of the markets affected by the transaction, UPS/TNT therefore would qualify as a “4-to-3” merger:
after the transaction, only three players would be able to offer a quick and reliable Europe-wide service.

Moreover, the four players have not been considered equally close competitors. FedEx's coverage of the EU market is less homogeneous than DHL's and FedEx would not exert enough competitive pressure on the remaining two competitors to prevent price increases, should the transaction be approved.

Conversely, TNT is often considered as a low-price alternative to UPS or DHL. Eliminating such a ‘maverick’ would relax competition and, therefore, leave scope for price increases. Arguably, the growing wide spread of e-commerce would not help to mitigate the European Commission's concerns.

Even if the sector is likely to experience a boom in the near future, the prospect of higher profits might not be enough to trigger timely entry. It has been widely stressed that the high "barriers to entry" characterising the integrator market would make it hard for new players that lack their own networks of hubs and warehouses to enter and efficiently compete against incumbent players.

Shielded by this potential external pressure, the remaining players could find it profitable to increase their prices or reduce the quality of their services.

That could occur ‘unilaterally’, that is, each player would have a greater incentive to increase prices because that would increase their profits (less competition in the market means that fewer customers flow to competitors when prices are increased).
Page 133 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Or for ‘coordinated effects’, that is, with fewer competitors in the market, players would be more likely to reach a mutual (not necessarily explicit) understanding on prices that would maximise collective profits (such as collusive prices).

Network efficiencies were put by the parties on the other side of the balance. Network efficiencies arise whenever the value of a product to its customers increases with the number of potential or actual customers of that very same product.
Postal services are naturally prone to network efficiencies and it is indeed possible that, in the absence of
anti-competitive effects, the merger would have had a positive effect on consumer welfare, bringing together the
UPS and TNT networks.

The Commission must have considered those efficiencies to be not large enough to counterbalance the likely harm caused by the loss of competition.

Most interestingly, even if all but one of the affected markets would have benefited from the transaction, it would have been sufficient to warrant a prohibition decision that efficiencies would not have been enough to counterbalance harm in the one market in which concerns are particularly strong.

In other words: if, for example, domestic standard deliveries’ customers would benefit overall from the bigger network offered by UPS/TNT, it would nevertheless be enough that harm in the cross-border
business-to-business small parcels delivery segment is not compensated for by efficiencies.
This would qualify the merger as anti-competitive. EU law and practice do not allow for the balancing of
efficiencies and harm between different markets. That is understandable: balancing welfare across markets would
imply expressing a value judgment, and antitrust authorities must refrain from performing ‘political’ exercises.

But, broadly speaking, pursuing a more integrated European single market still begs the question: couldn’t efficient balancing mechanisms be conceived of, such that overwhelming and widespread benefits do not run the risk of being dismissed, on principle, if accompanied by comparatively small harm in minor markets in which those benefits do not arise?
We do not know whether that is the case in UPS/TNT. But the principle is worth discussing.

The parties attempted to dispel the Commission’s concern by offering a package of remedies which included the sale of part of TNT’s assets to DPD, a French parcel services supplier.

In order to be considered a viable competitor in express delivery services across Europe, however, DPD would have needed access to UPS/TNT's aircraft capacity, lacking its own fleet. UPS was ready to commit to release capacity for a five-year period at a ‘competitive rate’.

But most likely the Commission was unimpressed particularly by this aspect of the package. The Commission is traditionally very careful about so-called ‘behavioural remedies’, through which the parties commit to offer to abide by a set of defined rules after the transaction is adopted.

Compared to ‘structural remedies’, whereby parties permanently divest part of their assets, behavioural remedies require constant monitoring (meaning: drain of public resources for a complex, rarely fully successful task) and may introduce unwanted distortions in the price-setting process (linking the commitment to benchmark prices, they may create incentives to act on the benchmarks in order to relax the constraint on the commitments).

UPS/TNT was one of the four phase II mergers under deeper investigation by the European Commission. After the Commission's prohibition, the remaining cases are: Ryanair-Aer Lingus (a decision is expected by March, 6); Munksjö- Ahlstrom (May, 16) and Syniverse-Mach (May, 30)."

MERGERS : COMMISSION VETOES UPS-TNT DEAL

As expected, the  European Commission vetoed, on 30 January, the proposed merger between United Parcel Service (UPS), global leader in express delivery of small packages, and its Dutch competitor TNT Express, number two in Europe. Anticipating this outcome, the two groups announced, on 14 January, that they were dropping plans for the €5.16 billion deal (see  Europolitics 4564).

The EU executive found that the operation would have caused excessive concentration on the market for express delivery of small packages in the EU to the detriment of direct customers and, in the end, to European
consumers. This market comprises only four companies that control a comprehensive air and ground-based parcel delivery network in Europe and beyond (the so-called "integrators"): UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. The merger of two of these firms could have stifled competition by reducing the number of players to three. Furthermore, with FedEx's small market share in Europe, DHL would have been the only really credible competitor on this market.

"This would have drastically reduced the choice among providers of these services and would probably have led to price increases in 24 countries of the European Economic Area [ ] without this being compensated for by any advantages, contrary to the arguments submitted by UPS," explained Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia.

He added at a press conference that "the solutions proposed by UPS were too little too late". In other words, the way UPS handled the matter did not suit the Commission.
DELAYED REACTION

"UPS should have had a prior agreement with a serious buyer to give us the certainty that solutions fostering the emergence of a credible competitor having its own transport network would have been implemented had a green light been given." The case stands as a lesson for merger candidates.

UPS had tried to convince the Commission by agreeing to sell TNT subsidiaries in 16 member states. It also proposed to provide access to its intra-European air transport network for five years provided the competitor is not an integrator. The American firm FedEx supposedly refused to enter into firm discussions unless the deal concerned a larger share of TNT activities. Another potential candidate was the French LaPoste subsidiary, DPD, but "there were persistent doubts as to whether it could represent a serious solution," declared the commissioner.

"I admit that I was a bit surprised by the announcement that the plans were being dropped," said Almunia. "There was still time" to reach an agreement.

This case marks the Commission's third veto of a merger under Almunia, following vetoes on the deals between the Greek airlines Aegean and Olympic Air and between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.

UPS offers more concessions to secure TNT deal

Brussels, Jan. 31 --  United Parcel Service Inc has offered more concessions in a bid to win  EU regulatory approval for its 5.2-billion-euro (US$6.8 billion) bid for  TNT Express, two people familiar with the matter said recently.

The latest offer came after the  European Commission indicated an earlier proposal to sell warehouses and customer bases in about 15 countries, mainly in eastern  Europe, was not sufficient to address competition concerns.

The world No. 1 package delivery company is seeking to buy Dutch peer and European market leader TNT to gain access to TNT's network in the fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets.
UPS submitted its latest offer to the European Commission recently, one of the sources said.

"The remedies are substantially improved," the second person said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the matter.
A UPS spokeswoman said the Atlanta-based company was working on ways of tweaking its TNT deal to win
European approval but declined to comment on any specific actions it was contemplating.
"As we move through this process, remedies can change," said spokeswoman Peggy Gardner.

The EU antitrust authority, which will decide by February 5 whether to clear or block the deal, has told UPS rivals and customers to provide feedback on the latest concessions, one of the people said.
The Commission declined to comment. TNT shares added gains after a news agency re-ported the latest UPS
concessions and were up 3 per cent to 8.18 euros in mid-session.

UPS' earlier offer was aimed at boosting French mail group DPD as a viable third European competitor able to offer both road and air freight services.

The EU watchdog is concerned UPS's takeover of TNT would result in the merged entity competing mainly with just Deutsche Post's DHL unit in Europe. The German package delivery company has a 15 per cent share of the European market, behind TNT's 18 per cent.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Bangladesh Monitor.

UPS' takeover of TNT derailed by regulators

Dhaka, Jan. 31 -- US freight giant United Parcel Service (UPS) has scrapped its takeover of  European rival
TNT Express after the  European Commission (EC) said it would block the deal.

Netherlands-based  TNT Express said the two companies met the  EC case team investigating the proposed acquisition January 11.

"The case team informed the companies that on the basis of UPS's current remedy proposal it is working towards proposing a prohibition decision," it said in a statement. "Subsequently, UPS informed TNT Express that UPS sees no realistic prospect that EC clearance can be obtained and that UPS will not pursue the transaction on any other basis. Formal termination of the merger protocol will occur upon receipt of the prohibition decision from the EC, which-based on the above-TNT Express deems inevitable."

In October, the EC lodged a statement of objections related to the "competitive effects" of the companies' pending merger, which the two companies failed to satisfactorily remedy.
Although details of the remedy remain largely confidential, TNT Express spokesman Cyrille Gibot said it involved
UPS divesting certain business activities.

In November, TNT Express agreed to sell its two airlines to ASL Aviation Group to overcome ownership restrictions triggered by the planned merger. "That deal was conditional on the overall (acquisition) agreement, so we can say it is off the table," Gibot said.

TNT Express said in a statement it regretted the situation, "having believed the merger was feasible and beneficial for all stakeholders. UPS has confirmed to TNT Express payment of the agreed ?200 million (US$267 million) termination fee."

An EC Competition Commission spokeswoman declined to comment other than saying its formal decision on the proposed acquisition is due before February 5.

The proposed ?5.16 billion (US$6.9 billion) acquisition, which was revealed in March 2012, would have reduced the four global express freight carriers-UPS, TNT Express, FedEx and DHL Express-to three.Published by HT Syndication with permission from The Bangladesh Monitor.

UPS withdraws meger offer to TNT Express

U.S., Jan. 31 -- United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) has released a statement stating intent to withdraw its offer of acquisition of TNT Express (TNT), following the European Commission's (EC) decision to prohibit the proposed offer.

Following an offer by  UPS in February 2012,  UPS began the competitive review process with the  EC the following month.

During the offer process, UPS submitted an initial remedies proposal in November 2012, and subsequently revised the proposal twice in an effort to meet the offer condition relating to EU competition clearance.

Following a meeting between UPS and the EC, the EC informed UPS and TNT that it is working on a decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition resulting in UPS's decision to stop pursuing the merger.

In a statement on the UPS website, Scott Davis, UPS Chairman and CEO said: "We are extremely disappointed with the EC's position. We proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns with the transaction. The combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting growth in Europe in particular."

UPS will now withdraw their offer to TNT Express, paying them a termination fee of euro 200 million. According to their online statement, the company will continue to execute their growth strategy, with further announcements to be made once the European Commission has issued its formal decision.

A statement from TNT on their website expresses regret for the termination of the merger, and vows to ensure that it's management now focuses on strengthening its strategy, improving profitability and ensuring the engagement and commitment of employees.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Supply Chain Digital.

Europe officially bars U.P.S. merger with TNT
By JAMES KANTER

31 January 2013

The European Commission continued to flex its antitrust muscles on Wednesday, officially blocking  United          Parcel Service’s $6.9 billion bid to buy the Dutch shipping company  TNT Express.

The decision was widely telegraphed after U.P.S. withdrew its offer this month, citing regulators’ resistance to the deal.

On Wednesday, the regulators offered more insight into their reasoning, saying the combination of the two shipping companies would have significantly reduced shipping options for European customers.

Businesses based in Europe ‘‘would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by U.P.S. because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases,’’ the E.U. competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said during a news conference. ‘‘We worked hard with U.P.S. on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified.’’
The deal is the third Mr. Almunia has blocked since he took over the role of the bloc’s antitrust chief in February
2010.

He stopped the merger of Aegean Airlines and Olympic Air, the two largest airlines in Greece, in January 2011. A year later, he blocked the proposed $9 billion merger of Deutsche Börse of Germany and NYSE Euronext, ending their plans to create the largest equity and derivatives exchange.
On Wednesday, Mr. Almunia noted that his group had approved about 800 deals in the same period. European authorities can seem tougher than their American counterparts on mergers partly because U.S.
agencies tend to take a somewhat more flexible approach in critical areas, some experts say.

Revised guidelines adopted by American authorities in 2010 meant that ‘‘the exact boundaries of the market are not so relevant for the assessment as it was before,’’ said Mario Mariniello, an economist at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ‘‘Cost savings and other benefits to consumers spread across different markets may have more weight in the final assessment’’ by the U.S. authorities, he said.

But Dave Anderson, an antitrust partner in the Brussels office of Berwin Leighton Paisner, said any perception that Mr. Almunia was particularly tough on mergers was premature.

‘‘While it may appear that there has been a spike in merger enforcement because this is the commission’s second prohibition in less than a year, Mr. Almunia’s merger record is not out of line with previous commissioners,’’ he said.
Mr. Anderson said that Karel Van Miert, a former competition commissioner, blocked nine mergers during the
1990s, and that Mario Monti, another former commissioner, blocked eight deals in the years after 2000. Mr.
Anderson said that Neelie Kroes, Mr. Almunia’s immediate predecessor, blocked only two mergers during her
term, but that Mr. Almunia had been facing ‘‘a relatively low number of mergers but many in already concentrated
markets with complex issues’’ compared with the docket examined by Ms. Kroes.



Page 140 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
In the case of U.P.S., Mr. Almunia said he had tried to work out a solution. He said he met with D. Scott Davis, the chief executive of U.P.S., twice during the negotiations and told him he would probably clear the deal if a suitable buyer could be found for divestments that included TNT’s subsidiaries in Spain and Portugal.

‘‘U.P.S. was clearly not ready, or not in favor, or not prepared to explore this kind of solution,’’ Mr. Almunia said during the news conference.

The case focused on so-called integrators in the express mail sector that operate aircraft to move small packages very quickly over long distances and that operate ground networks made up of sorting centers and delivery vehicles.

The commission said in a statement that only four companies — U.P.S., TNT, DHL and FedEx — were significant integrators in Europe. It said that FedEx had low market share in a number of European countries and that national postal operators provided only a limited competitive constraint because they ‘‘do not reach comparable efficiency or reliability, given their heavy reliance on road rather than air transport.’’

The consolidation envisioned by U.P.S. and TNT would have left customers in 15 countries reliant on only two operators, U.P.S. and DHL, the commission said. Mr. Almunia said the price increases would have hit, for example, customers urgently needing spare parts, the results of blood tests and new stocks of medicines.

Mr. Anderson, the lawyer, said U.P.S. faced high hurdles because it had failed to convince Mr. Almunia that reducing the number of major players in the market for express services in Europe would still allow adequate levels of competition.

‘‘Once U.P.S. lost the market definition battle, resulting in a 4-3 or sometimes 3-2 merger in some countries, and with FedEx perceived as the distant third, it was going to be hard to win the clearance war at an acceptable cost,’’ said Mr. Anderson, who advised investors on the outcome of the deal but does not work for companies in the express mail sector.

‘‘The concessions required by the commission to maintain competition in this market went too far for U.P.S. and undercut the deal rationale as a result,’’ he said.

The collapse of the U.P.S. deal has increased speculation that others may swoop into to buy TNT, whose shares have dropped in recent weeks. FedEx, which is a much smaller player, has been considered a potential buyer. Mr. Almunia declined to comment on how he would view any potential bid by FedEx for TNT.

The proposed acquisition of delivery company  TNT Express by UPS has been blocked by the  European
Commission.

The decision, flagged by  UPS two weeks ago, was confirmed yesterday by Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia. “The takeover would have restricted competition in 15 member states and would have likely led to price increases,” he said.  UPS’s failure to find a suitable buyer for  TNT’s subsidiaries in 17 European countries was behind the decision, the commission said. Four companies offer express delivery services using the road and air network in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEX. The latter has limited reach across the continent.

Belgium  : Commission blocks  proposed acquisition of TNT Express by UPS

The European Commission has prohibited under the  EU Merger Regulation the proposed acquisition of  TNT Express by UPS. The Commission found that the take-over would have restricted competition in 15 Member States1 when it comes to the express delivery of small packages to another  European country. In these Member States, the acquisition would have reduced the number of significant players to only 3 or 2, leaving sometimes DHL as the only alternative to  UPS. The concentration would therefore have likely harmed customers by causing price increases. During the investigation,  UPS offered to divest  TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries and allow the buyer to access its intra-European air network for five years. The Commission carried out an in-depth assessment, including a market test where customers and other interested parties were consulted. However,
these remedies proved inadequate to address the identified competition concerns.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said: "Many businesses active in the EU Single Market need to send small packages to another European country with guaranteed delivery on the next day. This requires access to affordable, reliable services that truly fit their needs. These businesses would have been directly harmed by the takeover of TNT by UPS because it would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases. We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in
the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified".

The Commission's investigation focused on the markets for international express deliveries of small packages in the European Economic Area (EEA). The main providers of these services are so-called "integrators" that control international integrated air and ground small package delivery networks. There are only four integrators in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. FedEx, for its part, has low market shares in a number of countries where it does not exercise a significant competitive constraint on UPS and TNT, because of the lack of density and scale of its European network. Other market players, such as national postal operators, can only compete to a limited extent because they do not reach comparable efficiency or reliability, given their heavy reliance on road rather than air transport.

If the notified acquisition had been allowed, many customers in 15 Member States would only have been able to choose between UPS, DHL and (sometimes) FedEx for the services they need. This would have likely led to price increases.

Moreover, the possible benefits of the merger, i.e. any cost-savings passed on to customers as a result of the combination of UPS and TNT's air networks, would not have been sufficient to outweigh the negative effects on competition.

UPS withdraws $6.85-bn offer for TNT Express as EC refuses approval

United Parcel Service, yesterday announced the withdrawal of its offer for its proposed $6.85-billion acquisition of Dutch rival TNT Express, as it failed to secure  EU regulatory approval for a merger.

The European Commission (EC) had in July started a Phase II investigation into the deal on concerns that the merged company would corner a large market share in  Europe.

In mid-January, Atlanta-based UPS said that the European Commission (EC) had informed it and TNT Express that it is working on a decision to block the proposed acquisition. (See: EC to block TNT's $6.85-bn acquisition by UPS (http://www.domain-b.com/industry/Logistics/20130114_acquisition.html)).

The European Commission has now issued a formal decision prohibiting the proposed acquisition of TNT Express.

"As a result of the prohibition by the EC, the offer condition relating to EU Competition Clearance will not be fulfilled and the acquisition of TNT Express by UPS will not be completed," UPS said in a statement.

"Given this outcome, UPS and TNT Express entered a separate agreement to terminate the merger protocol," it aaded.

UPS said it had proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the EC's concerns to ensure a competitive landscape in Europe.

"UPS believes that the combined company would have been transformative for the logistics industry, bringing meaningful benefits to consumers and customers around the world, while supporting much needed growth in Europe in particular.

While UPS is disappointed in the EC's decision, the company's focus is on the continued execution of its growth strategy.
The acquisition would have been UPS's largest in its 105-year history after it purchased Overnite Corp in 2005 for
$1.2 billion.

Moreover, it would have increased UPS's international sales to around 36 per cent from 26 per cent to over $60 billion (45 billion).

Deutsche Post had opposed the deal saying that the merger would create a powerhouse in Europe's small package delivery sector's limited market, mainly in the UK.

In December, UPS offered concessions to the EC by agreeing to divest certain business units and grant access to some of its airline network to rivals.

TNT had agreed to sell TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas to ASL Aviation Group on condition that the sale will become effective immediately prior to completion of its proposed merger with UPS (See: TNT Express to sell airline operations if EU approves UPS merger.

SHIPPING: UPS bid for TNT is dead: European body blocks  deal for Dutch firm. Ruling:  $6.77 billion
acquisition would hurt competiton in Europe.

As expected, the  European Commission on Wednesday blocked  UPS' $6.77 billion bid to buy a Dutch delivery company, saying the deal would diminish competition in  Europe.

The commission said it prohibited the acquisition because eliminating  TNT Express from the market would reduce the number of small-package delivery choices to only two or three in 15 countries, likely causing prices to rise. UPS had anticipated the ruling and two weeks ago said it was dropping the bid.

At the time, UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said the Sandy Springs company is "extremely disappointed" with the European Commission's position. UPS will pay a $267.4 million termination fee to TNT.

If it had gone through, the acquisition would have been UPS' largest ever and would have significantly boosted its strength in Europe. UPS already has a large presence on the continent, but the addition of TNT would have doubled its size and eliminated a competitor.

UPS offered to sell TNT subsidiaries in the 15 nations where competition was a concern, as well as in two others, and to give the purchaser access to its air network for five years.
"What they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified," Joaquin
Almunia, Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, said in a statement.
UPS said in a statement Wednesday that it believed the acquisition would have benefited customers worldwide. Experts said the original acquisition would have made sense for UPS, but that the benefits waned as the deal was
drawn out and more concessions were required. The company will still be able to make small acquisitions or
expand in Europe on its own, but growth will be slower.

United Parcel Service Inc. has officially withdrawn its $7 billion offer to buy the Dutch shipper  TNT Express.
The Atlanta Business Chronicle reports that the move, announced Wednesday,  was expected after the  European
Commission blocked the deal.

In November, the companies said they had offered numerous concessions to the EC meant to help seal the deal. UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said earlier this month that the combined company would have been "transformative" for the logistics industry.

Atlanta-based UPS (NYSE: UPS) said its focus now will be on the continued execution of its growth strategy. The company is the largest private-sector employer in Louisville, where it bases its UPS Airlines division and operates Worldport, its largest sorting hub.

UPS expects improved international profits following end to ‘TNT distraction’
UPS, CEP-Research

UPS said today it is optimistic of returning to international operating profit growth now the 'distraction’ of its planned TNT Express acquisition is out of the way and with some signs of improving global trading conditions, after reporting a drop in international operating profits in the fourth quarter. Executives also signalled possible smaller acquisitions in  Europe.

On an adjusted basis, the US company’s Q4 group operating profit increased 1.5 per cent to US$2.05 billion, on revenues up 2 per cent at $14.57 billion, although the adjusted operating margin slipped to 14.1 per cent from
14.3 per cent in the fourth quarter 2011.

However, a $3 billion one-time pension accounting charge led to an overall operating loss of $2.78 billion. Total shipment volumes averaged 18.8 million pieces per day, an increase of 2.9 per cent over the prior-year period.

Growth in B2C volumes, driven by online retail, boosted the company’s US domestic business, where daily package volume was up 3 per cent, led by 7.7 per cent growth in the company’s Next Day Air product, while ground improved 3 per cent. On an adjusted basis, domestic operating profit increased $58 million or 4.4 per cent, and operating margin expanded to 15.4 per cent, “despite challenges created by Hurricane Sandy”. Revenue grew 3.0 per cent and revenue per piece increased 1.7 per cent, “driven by base-rate improvements in both ground and air products”.

Strong demand for UPS products in Asia and Europe led to a 5.5 per cent increase in average daily export package volumes, increasing revenue to $3.2 billion. But adjusted operating profit was down by just over 1 per cent to $499 million, as customer and product mix changes drove a 3.5 per cent decline in export yields, on a currency-neutral basis.

UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said: “You have to see those international figures in perspective. Over the last two quarters, we have had a very large team working on the TNT transaction. That team is now coming back, and that will enable us to improve that international yield.”
Asked today whether UPS had learned anything about the European market from its due-diligence process with
TNT, Davis said: “We did learn that the regulator process is a complicated one there at the Commission.

“The biggest impact of our time working on the TNT acquisition was that it put a lot of things on hold. We have a great history in Europe, but we did slow down some of our initiatives,” Davis continued. “So it is really about kicking back into gear with our growth strategy there.”

Head of international, Dan Brutto, said export volumes out of Germany, the UK and Italy had been increasing, although figures from the Netherlands and Spain had deteriorated. Brutto said the company would be looking at possible acquisitions, “although nothing on the scale of TNT”.

He added: “There are opportunities for us to expand, for example in eastern Europe”, although he claimed UPS already had the best product portfolio in Europe, “all the way from ocean freight to express air”. Nevertheless, the company was looking to continue developing its European presence. “ TNT would have helped us to get there faster, but there are still a lot of opportunities there.”

Davis said there were also signs that the global economy was returning to “more normal” trading conditions, and that expected global trade growth would start to outperform GDP growth again, although it was unclear what that ratio would be.

Page 149 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
He said that overall he still sees 2013 as a “slower-growth economy”, although there were some positive signs. “I
think the good signs are that we see a more stable Europe that we saw a year ago,” Davis said.

“We’re starting to see a pickup in global trade, which is very important to us as we look forward. In the second and third quarters of 2012, we saw global trade lag global economic growth, which was very unusual. So it feels like that is getting more normal.

“Yesterday’s GDP numbers indicated that inventory was very low, so I think we’re seeing restocking of inventory early in January. I’m still cautious as we move through the year. I think we are going to see growth in the US, but I think we are still going to be addressing the deficit in the second quarter, and that is creating some uncertainty
and causing some challenges.”

Davis said the US economy would continue to underperform until politicians in Washington “ make some compromises”, although he said the situation in terms of the US so-called “fiscal cliff” had eased.
The company is expecting US GDP growth of around 2 per cent and global GDP growth of somewhere around
2.5 per cent, “so certainly not a barnstormer year”, said CFO Kurt Kuehn. “We expect under-trend performance
again in 2013.”

Davis concluded: “2012 presented its challenges, most notably weak global trade. Nonetheless, UPS executed well. Despite modest macro growth expectations for 2013 and uncertainty in the US caused by the lack of progress in Washington, the UPS business model will deliver consistent results, with operating profit growth in all segments.”

7:59 EST - A 4Q EPS miss and a cautious 2013 profit view doesn't have  UPS investors in a good mood. But the downbeat news comes even as the shipping giant continues to report solid volume growth both in the US and internationally. Perhaps in that light, along with its planned acquisition of  Europe's TNT dead, UPS has hiked its planned 2013 stock-buyback effort to $4B from $1.5B. That's one way to bolster the bottom line. But the planned purchases also come as shares had been just off of levels last hit in 2006.  UPS is down 2.2% premarket at

7:49 EST - BofA/Merrill suspects Brazilian mining giant Vale will end up suspending its Rio Colorado potash project in Argentina, given "very unfavorable economics." VALE has halted work on the mine since late December and avoided giving a timeline for a restart, while Argentine officials, for their part, have threatened to revoke the company's concession. A steady weakening of Argentina's peso during the past few years could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, as BofA says "the distorted currency could increase the $6 billion capex by 40-50% at least." In US premarket, VALE up 1.8% at $19.81. (paul.kiernan@dowjones.com)

7:44 EST - Nasdaq's (NDAQ) 4Q profit tops Street views as derivatives trading and clearing revenue -- a bigger business for the exchange operator than stock trading -- rose 2.7%, amid US market-share gains. Stock-trading revenue fell 20% as volume remains thin. NDAQ says non-transaction based revenue accounted for 71% of the total, the same percentage as in 3Q. That may increase further as NDAQ closes its acquisition of Thomson Reuters' (TRI) investor and press relations business. It remains unclear when or if trading volumes will return to the highs of 2009. NDAQ shares inactive premarket. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)
7:43 EST - Lottery-machine maker Scientific Games (SGMS) is looking to broaden its horizons with its nearly
$1.5B deal for WMS, which also produces slots. The latter has been struggling with falling earnings amid
weakened demand; as such the stock had tumbled nearly 2/3 the past 2 years. But for those who got in at some
point 2012, today's announcement is good news as the $26/share offer is a level WMS shares haven't seen in 18
months. SGMS, inactive premarket, have pulled back the past several weeks after surging from mid-November to
New Year's. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:34 EST - Brazilian government's decision to cut a tax on foreign investments in real-estate funds to zero is a small but positive move, as it indicates that the direction of FX regulation is now about removing taxes. Still, there are no changes to the IOF taxation on foreign flows to local government bonds and other fixed income instruments, which continues at 6%. Barclays Capital says the change will boost funding for longer-term investments, but overall impact on flows and USD/BRL exchange rate should be limited. (matthew.cowley@dowjones.com)

7:31 EST - Alliance Data's (ADS) beat-and-raise comes as the rewards-program and private-label credit-card operator keeps logging across-the-board solid growth. CEO Ed Heffernan notes, "Most importantly, in a stagnant market, our portfolio of credit-card receivables ended the year up over 30%, which sets the stage for a robust
2013." That as charge-off rates fell to 4.7% from 6.3% a year earlier as delinquencies eases to 4% from 4.4%. Investors have certainly been backing ADS; its stock has gone nearly straight up since 2009's bottom, rising nearly seven-fold in that time. Shares are inactive premarket.

7:30 EST - European stocks are on softer footing, casting an early influence on US equity futures premarket, after weaker-than-expected economic data and bank earnings on the continent. Cavalcade of 4Q earnings will
continue to color the mood, in addition to a few doses of data -- weekly jobless claims and December personal income & spending due at 8:30am ET; January Chicago PMI set for 9:45am ET. UPS and MasterCard report earnings before the open. S&P futures down a point; 10-yr note higher, yield around 1.98%. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

7:26 EST - Seems like its an annual tradition for Hershey's (HSY) 4Q EPS to slightly miss consensus--it's now happened 3 straight years--while surprising to the upside in the three other quarters. Yet this time, there looks to be little to fret about. The miss could be chalked up to a $7.5M took a write-down on a prior investment in Tri-US. HSY otherwise delivers with 4Q sales above estimates and a boost to 2013 EPS-growth estimates. HSY, inactive premarket; is up 8.4% this month. (paul.ziobro@dowjones.com; @pziobro)
Corrections & Amplifications

This article was corrected at 07:46 EDT to fix the statement that Hershey invested $7.5M in Tri-US in the fourth quarter. The company instead took a write-down of that amount on a prior investment in Tri-US.

7:13 EST - Following a F2Q miss, Elizabeth Arden (RDEN) cuts F2H expectations even as the makeup producer sees continued market-share gains for its fragrances in North America. That, though is being offset by declines for namesake products and flat retail sales at RDEN makeup counters in the region. Beyond that holiday weakness at department stores, CEO Scott Beattie says the company also had soft sales "at one of our major mass-retail accounts" and struggles in China. RDEN, inactive premarket, is down 4.7% this week after gains earlier this month. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

7:07 EST - Penn National's (PENN) 4Q miss comes as the regional casino operator highlights struggles at new facilities and industrywide softness as 2012 came to a close. As such, CEO Peter Carlino says company is "approaching 2013 with caution as consumers continue to adjust to lower discretionary income levels." But he does add that cost-containment and sharp marketing can boost the bottom line, as it did last quarter in various parts of the country. Nonetheless, PENN does project below-consensus 1Q results. Shares, inactive premarket, are down 2.4% this month. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

6:39 EST - Better-than-expected 4Q results from MDC and a 66% surge in orders shows that the strong homebuilder results announced this week are no fluke. Now with decent backlogs set to keep the sector busy throughout 2013, the industry now has to make sure it has a steady supply of developable land. In the wake of the housing crisis, some shed property while others didn't buy land as its prices plummeted. MDC says it last quarter bought 2,335 lots in 67 communities, including 42 new communities. That was more activity than the company had undertaken the prior 4 quarters combined. MDC, inactive premarket, is up 14% this month and sits at levels last seen in September 2008. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

6:33 EST - A strong 2013 profit view from Whirlpool (WHR) follows a strong 2012 in which the appliance maker saw its fortunes rebound somewhat after years of sales struggles. Investors responded by more than doubling the company's beaten-down stock last year, getting it back near all-time highs. WHR had a modest EPS beat last quarter, but revenue fell nearly $100M below consensus as volumes appear muted. The company, though, does anticipate industrywide shipments in the US rising some 2-3%. WHR, inactive premarket, is up 6.9% this month. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

MARKET TALK: UPS CEO Disappointed By TNT Outcome

8:55 EST -  UPS CEO Scott Davis says the company is "moving on" from its unsuccessful effort to buy  TNT Express, although he acknowledges the outcome was a blow. "It would be an understatement to say that we are disappointed by the decision of the  European Commission to block the acquisition," he says on conference call. But UPS will continue to pursue growth, both organically and through acquisitions, Davis says. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)
8:55 EST - Aetna (AET) boosts its expectations for membership in the current quarter, now anticipating growth to
18.3M. The insurer had projected no change, with member growth occurring later in the year. One reason for the
more-rosy 1Q outlook is big gains in Medicare Advantage enrollment. "Our diversified book of businesses is
producing membership growth again," growing for 3 straight quarters, CEO Mark Bertolini notes during the 4Q
conference call. AET remains inactive premarket. (jon.kamp@dowjones.com)

8:53 EST - Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ) is planning for US stock-trading volume -- mired in a multi-year slide -- to be flat to slightly higher this year, CEO Bob Greifeld tells analysts on a conference call. Greifeld says recent weeks' inflows to US equity mutual funds is "encouraging," but too soon to say if that's having an effect. "You have to reasonably expect that [portfolio managers] have to consider what to do with that money," he adds. NDAQ
doesn't expect its own volume to be hurt by a crackdown on high-frequency trading, nor helped by a tighter regulation on dark pools this year, Greifeld says. (matthew.jarzemsky@dowjones.com)

8:52 EST - Occidental (OXY) may have cut 4Q costs and bumped up oil production enough to curry favor with analysts, but that dog might not hunt much longer. Raymond James says the company will need to find new tricks to withstand a forecast average WTI price of $65 this year. "While (OXY's) steady execution is admirable, there is no getting around our far below-Street EPS estimates given our 2013 oil-price forecast." Still, amid its 4Q beat, OXY is up 1.8% premarket at $86.88. (ben.lefebvre@dowjones.com)

8:45 EST- While Pulte (PHM) modestly beat analysts' 4Q estimates, there are some concerns. The homebuilder increased its reserve for loan-repurchase obligations while core operating margins of 7.7% fell a percentage point short of JPMorgan's estimate. PHM is down 2.1% premarket at $20.60 after having jumped 16% this month.(dawn.wotapka@dowjones.com)

Jobless claims jump 38K in Jan 26 week. It's not unusual for claims to be volatile around a holiday--in this case Martin Luther King Day. A broader shapshot of the January labor markets will arrive tomorrow with the employment report. Median forecast: a gain of 166K jobs this month. (kathleen.madigan@dowjones.com)

8:44 EST - Rite Aid (RAD), which recently reported its first quarterly profit in 5 1/2 years, continues to also see resilient monthly same-store sales. The metric grew during the early months of 2012, but suffered declines in the final four months as a wave of generic offerings hurt sales. Generics' lower prices vs branded products hurt SSS for all major drugstore retailers. While that trend continued in January, a very active flu season led to strong demand for flu-related over-the-counter products. SSS in total were up 0.3% in January. RAD inactive at $1.56 premarket. (john.kell@dowjones.com)

8:40 EST - Facebook's (FB) headline results late yesterday showed another better-than-expected quarter, yet shareholders clearly unimpressed after some metrics missed observers' "whisper expectations" for targets that aren't as often publicized. Sterne Agee notes mobile ads, for instance, generated $306M -- well above its $275M target -- though the firm thinks others' "unreasonably high" expectations predicted $350M or more. Pivotal Research considers the market "downright dazed" by mobile ads and upgrades FB to buy with a $36 target. Investors unconvinced; FB down 6.2% at $29.31 premarket.

8:37 EST - Consol's (CNX) strong 4Q beat, especially on the profit side, has shares of the coal miner and natural-gas producer rebounding after a weak January. Tudor Pickering notes the "lowest-cost Eastern coal producer pushes costs even lower" while sales and prices topped expectations. The investment bank thinks most of the savings CNX has been able to produce will "be sustainable." Shares rise 6.1% premarket to $33.05. (kevin.kingsbury@dowjones.com)

8:29 EST - As Dunkin' (DNKN) looks to expand Dunkin' Donuts to the West Coast, proving store profitability is crucial to attracting top-notch franchisees. DNKN has improved store margins by rolling out a new supply-chain system that provides the same pricing to new markets as existing ones and implementing a new back-office system. That as the company expects commodity costs to be flat-to-down slightly for franchisees this year and says there's a "portfolio of new high-margin products" coming out in 2013. (annie.gasparro@dowjones.com)

8:27 EST - UPS says its international export package volume climbed 5.5% in 4Q, compared to year-ago, climbing from a 1.2% year-over-year gain in 3Q. It cites "strong demand" in Asia and Europe, two markets that have been problematic. In October, UPS said volume out of Asia was up in 3Q for first time in several quarters. Shares off 1.8% premarket at $79.75. (bob.sechler@dowjones.com)

8:58 EST - Occidental Petroleum (OXY) can't quite seem to kick the capex habit. Oil producer reports $2.5B in 4Q capital expenditures, essentially unchanged from the year before and not becoming for a company pursuing a shrink-to-grow strategy. Full year capex is even worse, 36% higher than 2011. "Lone negative of the quarter appears to be stubbornly high capex," says Simmons & Co. International's Bill Herbert. Shares up 1.8% at
$86.84. (john.shipman@dowjones.com)

UPS Outlook  Disappoints After Loss

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said Thursday it expects a "below-trend" global economic recovery this year, though it flagged recovering business from a consumer-electronics sector that has weighed on package shippers.

The bellwether company delivered earnings guidance for 2013 that fell short of analysts' expectations. It also pledged to buy back more stock following the collapse of its $7 billion plan to acquire Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express N.V.(TNTEY, TNTE.AE), which was blocked by  European regulators on competition grounds.

UPS reported lower-than-expected fourth earnings, but executives heralded a recovering Asian export market, with volume up by a "mid-teens" percentage in the final quarter of last year. Customers, however, are opting for cheaper delivery services for cell phones and other increasingly lightweight electronics.

High-volume, bulk shippers drove the trend, and average revenue per package in its international export segment fell 2.3% in the fourth quarter.

Both UPS and Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx Corp. (FDX) wrestled with soft demand for Asian exports through much of 2012 and 2011, spurring them to trim air capacity out of Asia.

UPS Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said in an interview that the overall global economy is "more stable" than it was a year ago but predicted "a below-trend economic recovery". He forecast U.S. GDP to rise about 2% this year, trailing a 2.5% expansion in the global economy.

"In a more global growth environment, you get a broader mix [of shipments], rather than the large, infrequent product launches" that drove fourth-quarter export volumes, Mr. Kuehn said Thursday.

For 2013, UPS forecast per-share earnings of $4.80 to $5.06, trailing the $5.11 consensus among analysts. The stock was recently down 2.1% at $79.50.

The company said it expects buybacks to rise to $4 billion this year from $1.5 billion in 2013 as it moves on from the failure of the TNT deal.

"It would be an understatement to say that we are disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition," UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis said on a conference call.

Mr. Davis said UPS won't shy away from the other acquisitions. But "there won't be things the size of TNT, probably," he said.

The company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of $725 million, or 74 cents a share. Excluding a pension-accounting related charge of $3 billion and other items, adjusted earnings were $1.32. UPS estimated that superstorm Sandy cut per-share profit by about a nickel. Revenue increased 2.9% to $14.57 billion.

UPS Says Recovery Is Likely to Be Bumpy

United Parcel Service Inc. said Thursday that it expects a "below-trend" global economic recovery this year, but flagged improving business from a consumer-electronics sector that has weighed on package shippers.

The bellwether company delivered earnings' guidance for 2013 that fell short of analysts' expectations. It also pledged to buy back more stock after the collapse of its $7 billion plan to acquire Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV.  European regulators blocked the  TNT deal on competition grounds.

Atlanta-based UPS posted a fourth-quarter loss but executives heralded a recovering Asian export market, with volume up by a "mid-teens" percentage in the final quarter of last year, though customers are opting for cheaper delivery services for cellphones and other increasingly lightweight electronics.

Bulk shippers of technology products drove the increase in Asian export volume. Still, average revenue per package in UPS's international export segment fell 2.3% in the fourth quarter because of the shift toward lower-cost delivery options and lighter-weight devices.

Both UPS and rival FedEx Corp., based in Memphis, Tenn., wrestled with soft demand for Asian exports through much of 2012 and 2011, spurring them to trim air capacity out of Asia.

UPS Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said the overall global economy is "more stable" than it was a year ago, though he predicted "a below-trend economic recovery." Mr. Kuehn forecast U.S. gross domestic product to rise about 2% this year, trailing a 2.5% expansion in the global economy.

"In a more global growth environment, you get a broader mix [of shipments], rather than the large, infrequent product launches" that drove fourth-quarter export volumes, he said.
For 2013, UPS forecast per-share earnings of $4.80 to $5.06, trailing the $5.11 consensus among analysts. Shares in UPS were off 2.1%, or $1.68, at $79.55 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon.
UPS said it expects stock buybacks to rise to $4 billion this year from $1.6 billion in 2012, as the company moves on after failure of the TNT deal.

"It would be an understatement to say that we are disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition," UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis said during a conference call. The commission is the European Union's executive arm.
Mr. Davis said UPS won't shy away from other acquisitions. But he added that "there won't be things the size of
TNT, probably."

UPS posted a fourth-quarter loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of $725 million, or 74 cents a share. Excluding a pension-accounting-related charge of $3 billion and other items, adjusted earnings were $1.32. UPS estimated that superstorm Sandy cut per-share profit by about a nickel. Revenue increased 2.9% to $14.57 billion.

EU antitrust regulators have blocked a e5.2 billion (R64bn) bid by  United Parcel Service (UPS) for TNT Express, denting the largest package delivery company's hopes of expanding its presence in Asia and Latin America.

The EU regulatory veto means  UPS may now have to grow via smaller acquisitions or organically, while  TNT could come under pressure to change management or revise its business strategy to deflect activist shareholders.

The European Commission said yesterday that the US company had not offered adequate concessions to ensure that the deal would not hurt consumers. UPS had flagged the negative decision on January 14, saying it would withdraw its bid because of opposition from the EU regulator.

The deal would have given UPS access to Dutch peer TNT's stronger networks in fast-growing Asian markets and Latin America and increased its non-US revenues to 36 percent of total sales from the current 26 percent.
The European Commission said the proposed merger would have reduced competition in 15 EU countries.
"[The merger] would have drastically reduced choice between providers and probably led to price increases," EU
competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.

UPS had offered to sell TNT operations in 15 countries, mainly in eastern Europe, with the principal potential buyer France's DPD, but failed to win over the commission.
TNT is the leading postal delivery company in Europe, with 18 percent of the market against the 10 percent of
UPS. Deutsche Post's DHL unit has 15 percent while FedEx is a distant fourth player.
TNT shares fell 2.5 percent to e5.56 by 11.39am in Amsterdam. - Reuters

UPS maintains 4Q profit  despite sluggish global economy
Eric Kulisch

31 January 2013

UPS, which moves everything from small packages to giant freight shipments through in-house and contracted logistics services, announced earnings projections for 2013 in the range of $4.80 to $5.06 cents per share, an increase of 6 to 12 percent compared to 2012 adjusted results.

But the earnings forecast is lower than the consensus estimate of analysts, reflecting weak shipping demand and a 200 million-euro breakup fee owed to Dutch express carrier  TNT after the  European Commission blocked their merger.

"2012 presented its challenges, most notably weak global trade," Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Despite modest macro growth expectations for 2013 and uncertainty in the U.S. caused by the lack of progress in Washington, the UPS business model will deliver consistent results, with operating profit growth in all segments.”

UPS posted a $1.75 billion loss in the fourth quarter versus a $759 billion profit in the last three months of 2011, after taking a $3 billion after-tax charge for pension and retirement benefits to meet accounting requirements for marking liabilities to reflect current market value rather than book value. On an adjusted basis, net income was
$1.27 billion, up from $1.25 billion in the year-ago quarter, with operating profit of $2 billion versus $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011.

During the quarter, UPS delivered 18.8 million packages per day, up 2.9 percent from the prior-year period. Consumer spending during the holiday season fell slightly below expectations, but UPS said it still set records by delivering more than 500 million packages, including almost 28 million on its peak day. The company said Hurricane Sandy caused a 5-cent per share drag on earnings. Fourth quarter revenue grew $40 million to $14.57 billion.

UPS's domestic package segment saw its adjusted fourth-quarter operating income reach $1.38 billion from $1.32 billion a year ago. UPS Next Day Air daily package volume grew 7.7 percent, while ground delivery improved 3 percent on the strength of online retailing. The group's operating margin reached 15.4 percent.

On an adjusted basis, international profit dipped to $499 million from $505 million as customer and product mix changes drove a 3.5 percent decline in export yields. UPS said demand for services in Asia and Europe led to a
5.5 percent increase in average daily export volume.
Revenue in the Supply Chain and Freight segment increased $94 million, or 4 percent, compared with the same
2011 quarter. Adjusted operating profit fell to $172 million from $199 million. Freight forwarding revenue improved
on strong tonnage increases in air freight, while operating margin was negatively impacted by an increase in
purchased transportation rates on Asia-outbound freight during a period of accelerated demand in the market,
UPS said.

The warehousing and distribution business achieved revenue growth of more than 10 percent, but operating margin declined due to investments in technology and new facilities to support healthcare and high-tech customers.

On the trucking side, UPS Freight revenue increased 6.2 percent with LTL gross weight hauled up 4.9 percent and LTL revenue per hundredweight up 1.5 percent. For the year, UPS revenues grew 3.6 percent to $32.86 billion, with a 79 percent slide in net income to $807 million. On an adjusted basis, annual earnings grew 1.8 percent to $4.4 billion. -  Eric Kulisch

General News
European Union: Introductory remarks on UPS/ TNT Express merger
1,287 words
1 February 2013
Thai News Service
THAINS
English
(c) 2013 Thai News Service
Section: General News - Today the Commission decided to prohibit the acquisition of the logistics company  TNT
Express by its competitor  UPS.

In our investigation we found that the proposed take-over would have restricted competition in 15 Member States and would have likely led to price increases.

Before I explain to you why I reached such a conclusion, let me say a few words on the markets we are talking about.

In our Single Market, many businesses and citizens need to send small packages to various European countries. Sometimes, they require "express deliveries": this means that the delivery must take place on the next day. Just think of spare parts to restart a device, blood samples shipped for testing, medicines that are quickly needed because they have run out of stock and so on and so forth - not to mention important and very urgent documents.
These customers need access to reliable services that truly fit their needs. For them, deferred deliveries, beyond
24 hours, is not an option. Many of them also need a provider that can ship in all Europe, not just from one
country to another particular country.

Express deliveries require very sophisticated processes and an adequate infrastructure, such as an air transport network, in order to meet the required deadline in any European country.

The main providers of these services are the so-called "integrators". They are called this way because they control an international network for both air and ground delivery. Their networks, which are run by complex IT systems, include local sorting centres, air and ground hubs, as well as fleets of vans, trucks and aircraft.
Today there are only four integrators in Europe: UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx.
The acquisition of TNT by UPS would have significantly changed the competitive situation in the market.

So we had to look very closely at its impact, keeping in mind that customers rely on vibrant competition between providers so that they can access good quality services on affordable terms.
Let me now turn to the details of our analysis.

First, we found - in agreement with UPS - that the markets for deliveries within the European Economic Area (EEA) are national in scope. The reason is that customers look at the various alternatives available in their home country when they need a company that can provide express delivery services to any other European country.

We found that in these markets, integrators only faced limited competition by national postal operators, freight forwarders or local or national delivery companies, because they rely heavily on road rather than air transport. They are only marginal players in express delivery because they cannot reach the same levels of efficiency or reliability as integrators, in the absence of adequate ground and air networks.

We also found that in a number of countries, FedEx - one of the four integrators active in Europe - is not a significant competitor, in particular because of the limited density and scale of its intra-European network.
As a result, in many countries there are only three main players among which many customers can really choose
- UPS, TNT Express and DHL. The merger would have drastically reduced choice for these customers, bringing
the possible options to only two: UPS/TNT on the one hand and DHL on the other.

Page 170 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
We analysed what the concrete impact of such a concentration would be. We found that prices would increase in
29 countries within the European Economic Area (EEA).

However, UPS argued that the merger would have created significant efficiencies to outweigh these negative effects. We looked very carefully at these arguments. Our investigation - supported by a thorough economic assessment - showed that some of the savings resulting from the combination of the parties' intra-European air networks could indeed be passed on to consumers. Still, we also found that in many countries these benefits would not outweigh the price increases resulting from the lessening of competition caused by the merger.

In the end we concluded that in 15 Member States of the EU this acquisition raised very serious competition problems.
UPS attempted to address our concerns by offering remedies.

The company offered to divest TNT's subsidiaries in these 15 countries. It also pledged to sell - under certain conditions - TNT's subsidiaries in two other Member States to transfer more volume of intra-EEA express deliveries to a prospective purchaser.

In addition, UPS said it would give access to its intra-European air network to the purchaser for five years if the buyer was a non-integrator.

Although these proposals were submitted at a very late stage in the procedure, we engaged in a very extensive analysis and had in-depth discussions with UPS. The company had the opportunity to improve its remedies on two occasions.
However, at the end of these conversations and exchanges, the UPS proposals remained insufficient.

The only way to remedy our concerns was to provide a solution which would allow the presence on the market of another strong player alongside UPS and DHL. This strong player could have been either another "integrator", or another company capable of exercising an equivalent competitive constraint.

Our investigation revealed that the potential purchasers of the assets that we could consider suitable were very few. The purchaser would have to use the assets for express deliveries and not for other types of services. To cover all destination countries in the EEA, any purchaser would need an appropriate network or at least partnerships in these countries. Moreover, the purchaser would need an air-transport solution after the five-year period during which UPS would offer access.

Given the very small number of potentially suitable buyers in this case, there was a lot of uncertainty about whether the remedies would be at all effective if the Commission authorised the acquisition. Needless to say, given the very serious competition problems identified, this uncertainty was problematic.

To address such uncertainty, UPS would have needed to commit, as part of the remedies package, to sign a binding agreement with a suitable buyer before the concentration was materially implemented. We would then have been able to ensure the remedies were effectively implemented after our decision. This is what we usually called an "upfront buyer" solution.

However, UPS was not ready to offer this. Instead, it attempted to sign such an agreement before the end of the Commission's investigation - which is submitted to precise legal deadlines - and did so much too late for it to materialise.

Moreover, given the package of remedies proposed, we still had serious doubts on whether the buyer that UPS was working with - the French group La Poste/DPD - would have the ability and incentive to become a strong player in express deliveries.

In the absence of suitable remedies to the competition concerns we identified, I had no other choice but to propose to the college of commissioners to issue a negative decision. This is the third merger that is prohibited under my responsibility in this mandate, out of the roughly 800 mergers we have cleared since I took over in February 2010.

Let me recall what the principles of our merger control are. Where a merger would significantly restrict competition in the Single Market; where the efficiencies do not outweigh the harm for consumers; and where the proposals by the merging companies fall short of remedying such a negative outcome; then it is in the common interest to prevent the transaction from taking place.

Here our decision ensures that the companies that use these express delivery services are protected from a likely price increase which would directly harm their business as well as, ultimately, the final consumers.

UPS Says Recovery Likely to Be Bumpy
By Bob Sechler

United Parcel Service Inc. said Thursday that it expects a "below-trend" global economic recovery this year, but flagged improving business from a consumer-electronics sector that has weighed on package shippers.

The bellwether company delivered earnings' guidance for 2013 that fell short of analysts' expectations. It also pledged to buy back more stock after the collapse of its $7 billion plan to acquire Dutch parcel-delivery company TNT Express NV.  European regulators blocked the  TNT deal on competition grounds.

Atlanta-based UPS posted a fourth-quarter loss but executives heralded a recovering Asian export market, with volume up by a "midteens" percentage in the final quarter of last year, though customers are opting for cheaper delivery services for cellphones and other increasingly lightweight electronics.

Bulk shippers of technology products drove the increase in Asian export volume. Still, average revenue per package in UPS's international export segment fell 2.3% in the fourth quarter because of the shift toward lower-cost delivery options and lighter-weight devices.
Both UPS and rival FedEx Corp., based in Memphis, Tenn., wrestled with soft demand for Asian exports through
2011 and much of last year, spurring them to trim air capacity out of Asia.

UPS Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn said the overall global economy is "more stable" than it was a year ago, though he predicted "a below-trend economic recovery." Mr. Kuehn forecast U.S. gross domestic product to increase about 2% this year, trailing a 2.5% expansion in the global economy.

"In a more global growth environment, you get a broader mix [of shipments], rather than the large, infrequent product launches" that drove fourth-quarter export volumes, he said.
For this year, UPS forecast per-share earnings of $4.80 to $5.06, trailing the $5.11 consensus among analysts. Shares in UPS were down 2.1%, or $1.68, at $79.55 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. UPS said it expects the company's stock buybacks to rise to $4 billion this year from $1.6 billion in 2012, as the
package shipper moves on after failure of the TNT deal.

"It would be an understatement to say that we are disappointed by the decision of the European Commission to block the acquisition," UPS Chief Executive Scott Davis said during a conference call. The commission is the European Union's executive arm.
Mr. Davis said UPS won't shy away from other acquisitions. But he added that "there won't be things the size of
TNT, probably."

UPS posted a fourth-quarter loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of $725 million, or 74 cents a share. Excluding a pension-accounting-related charge of $3 billion and other items, adjusted per-share earnings were $1.32. UPS estimated that superstorm Sandy cut per-share profit by about a nickel.
Revenue increased 2.9% to $14.57 billion.

United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) has withdrawn its $7-billion bid for  TNT Express because it expects the European Commission (EC) to block the deal. UPS, the world's No. 1 package delivery company, was seeking to buy the Dutch peer and European market leader, TNT Express, to gain access to its network in fast-growing Asian and Latin American markets. The  EC had informed UPS and TNT Express that it was working on a
decision to prohibit the proposed acquisition. The US courier giant added that it would pay  TNT a termination fee of 200 million euros and withdraw the offer.

Cargo News Asia 31/01/2013. European Union regulators have formally blocked a proposed merger between US express delivery giant United Parcel Service (UPS) and TNT Express, saying the transaction would have restricted competition in 15 EU countries. The decision had been expected after  UPS said earlier this month it would abandon its $US6.8bn bid for its Dutch rival, saying the  European Commission had told the US firm it was working on a decision to block the deal. The commission, which reviewed the merger, says it has sought to address anti-trust concerns with  UPS but concessions offered by the Atlanta-based firm were “inadequate”. “We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified,” the  EU’s competition chief Joaquin Almunia said.

TNT Express NV (TNTE.AE): 4Q Earnings
Due: Feb 18, at 0700 GMT FactSet Survey of 3 Analysts
Average Net Profit: EUR36.1M (EUR173M loss in 4Q 2011) Average Revenue: EUR1.89B, up 1.1%% (EUR1.87B in 4Q 2011)

Note: Company seen swinging to net profit as 4Q11 net loss was caused by a EUR104M impairment on its Brazil activities. Results in  Europe and the Middle East are expected to have held up well due to cost savings. Asia/Pacific revenue is expected lower, though cost savings will have lifted the profit for the region. As the failure of the planned takeover by  UPS is still recent, analysts do not expect strategic announcements yet.

Dutch mail delivery group  TNT Express, whose takeover by  UPS was blocked by European anti-trust regulators, posted today a 71-million-euro operating loss in the fourth quarter, against a loss of 104 million euros the year before.

It said it will update investors on its strategy on March 25, adding it is still looking for opportunities to divest its business in Brazil and that the outcome of its China divestment will be known in the first quarter. ( C) Reuters

TNT Express to sell Brazil business this year in revised ‘more-flexible’ stand-alone strategy

TNT Express expects to announce the sale of its China domestic business by the end of this quarter and its Brazil domestic activities by the end of the year, as the company returns to a revised “ flexible” stand-alone strategy focusing on Europe and international, following the failed acquisition attempt by  UPS.

At the announcement today of fourth-quarter and full-year results, the company said the exploration of “partnership options” for its Brazilian domestic activities had been suspended following the announcement of the planned merger with UPS, “based on the interest of  UPS in retaining these businesses”, but following the breakdown of the UPS acquisition last month, a decision had been taken to sell those Brazilian activities.

“While the losses in our Brazilian operations were reduced, we did not realise the level of improvements we had aimed for,” commented interim CEO Bernard Bot.
Meanwhile, TNT Express had started to explore divestment opportunities for its domestic activities in China
(Hoau) in 2012, and these are now close to completion.

Responding to questions from CEP-Research, interim CFO Jeroen Seyger said: “The outcome of the China process we’re expecting this quarter, so on the shorter term. The Brazil divestments opportunities we froze in light of the UPS transaction and we have just re-launched that process with the announcement today. So in general it will take as long as a divestment process takes. It is always very difficult to exactly predict, but I would expect that we will conclude on that process before the end of this year.”

He declined to say how much the company hoped to raise from the Brazil sale. Bot insisted that the China and Brazil divestments were not primarily about raising money, but a reflection of the company’s focus on European and international operations, and the need to direct the company’s investments on these core areas. He said TNT Express would retain a full international capability to and from China and Brazil, and although he insisted TNT’s China and Brazil business were “well positioned”, they no longer fitted with TNT Express’s European and international strategy.

“If you look at where the focus of our strategy is, it is on developing activities in Europe and connecting Europe internationally to the rest of the world,” he said. “As part of that strategy, the developments of domestic operations in emerging countries is no longer a priority, and if you look at synergies between those emerging domestic with the rest of the business, there are some, but they are not strong enough to warrant the continued investment in those platforms.”

This was the reason the company last year completed its exit from domestic activities in India. “We’ve started the process in China and hope to hear about that this quarter. The Brazilian business is a great business: it has a fantastic footprint, with 140 depots in Brazil, great market presence, but it is less of a fit with TNT as a company.”

Bot said companies had to make choices and set priorities. “And to some extent also financial priorities,” he said. “And while TNT could bear those losses, that is not the issue. There is the question of allocation of funds to those areas where you have put the priority of your strategy.”

Bot said he “regretted” the failure of the merger with UPS, as he firmly believed that the merger would have been beneficial for all stakeholders. In accordance with the merger protocol with UPS, he confirmed that TNT had received last week the payment from UPS of the €200 million break fee. “So that’s done, and we go forward,” Bot added. “We have confidence in our operations, people, and commercial propositions, and in our strategy.”

Bot denied that TNT Express was now a “break-up target”, and said the pursuit of the company’s strategy under the current interim executive management had the full support of the group’s supervisory board.

“What we are charting is the continuation of the stand-alone strategy that we announced last year,” he said. “That is fully supported by the supervisory board and obviously by the team in place, and we are executing on some of the elements that we had anticipated last year, one of which was put on hold last year with the divestment of Brazil. Strategy doesn’t change every six months.”

He said the company’s supervisory board was now reviewing the possibilities regarding the executive board, and would come up with its conclusions “in the immediate future”.

The company said TNT Express’s fourth-quarter results continued the trends seen in previous quarters. Europe, Middle East and Africa volumes grew but yields declined “in challenging trading conditions”, although cost control lessened the negative impact on profitability. In Asia Pacific, revenue declined by 10 per cent due to the termination of low-margin customers and services and continuing weak demand. Operating income, however, increased by around 2 per cent “because of improvements in the business portfolio and cost reduction
measures”.

Reported fourth-quarter revenues declined by 0.5 per cent to €1.864 billion, but €120m in business one-offs, including “impairments” due to the re-assessed value of its China and India domestic businesses and adjustments for the declining value of its two B747 freighters, led to a reported operating loss of €71 million. Adjusted
operating income, adjusted for currency exchange effects and excluding one-offs, stood at €47 million, down from
€58 million the previous year.

Bot commented: “If we look at the fourth quarter, trading conditions remained difficult. In Europe, our key challenge was yield decline, both because of price and mix pressure. And unfortunately, we expect the environment also to be difficult in 2013.”

He said performance in Asia-Pacific and the Americas “improved as a result of actions taken. Overheads were also well controlled and we ended the year and a solid capital position.”

Full-year revenues grew by 1.8 per cent to €4.6 billion, while the company made a full-year operating profit of €89 million, a substantial improvement on last year’s €205 million operating loss - boosted by a substantial drop in the company’s Brazil operating losses. However, the profitability of its main profit-generating business, EMEA,
slipped almost 19 per cent to €289 million.

Bot said TNT Express's strategy as a standalone was essentially the same as the “Building on Strengths” strategy announced around this time last year. “While a number of actions following from the strategy were suspended as
a result of the UPS offer, we did make good progress on many fronts," he said. “For example, we further strengthened our position in Europe with positive volume and customer growth. We also improved the international offering with better collection times and faster deliveries by connecting inbound and outbound flows through Dubai and Liege.”

He said the search for a “more structural solution for our air capacity” that was suspended in light of the UPS merger had now been restarted. In the meantime, €50m via the company’s indirect cost savings programme launched in May 2011 had been fully realised; and nearly two thirds of a “ re-scoped” €100m further cost savings programme had also been realised in 2012.

Bot commented: “Although a lot has been achieved in 2012, we are keenly aware that further urgent improvements are required. This is also why we got to work immediately after the mid-January announcement and we are currently actively and intensively engaged in a process that has a primary objective to find concrete actions and projects that will improve the performance in 2013 and 2014."

He said some of the areas of improvement “include how to make sure we get the most from the best parts of our business. We have the broadest service range and best European coverage and a strong customer focus, and we should leverage that. We are also looking to reduce exposure to high fixed costs assets while still providing best-in-class service. Finally we want to achieve significant cost savings and organise ourselves for success.”

Bot said more details on these subjects would be provided at a strategy update on 25 March. But he said this would be a question of details rather than “a flashy new strategy”. “We already have a strategy announced last year, and today we’re giving some updates regarding Brazil and China. So on 25 March, expect straightforward solutions to challenges.”


Page 180 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
Nevertheless, it would include a significant additional cost-improvement plan, along with other measures. “We will be looking at the company as a whole, with the basis of the strategy that we announced last year, but there are some refinements that we can bring there, both in terms of, particularly, more clearly in which market segments we want to compete and think we can be successful; how we can enhance our execution of a number of areas; and making our operations more flexible.

“So there are quite a few things we are looking at, but at the same time we are also looking at cost-reduction measures to improve the performance in the immediate term.”

Bot acknowledged that the programme would be likely to lead to some job losses. “We are looking at all areas of spend, which includes operational activities and overhead activities, and we’re looking to make significant cost reductions, so job reductions can certainly not be excluded," he observed. “But as always we will look at it in a careful way and manage any reductions in a responsible manner.”
Part of the changes would involve further moves towards a more flexible operating model, both in terms of
long-haul aircraft capacity and other areas of the business. “We would like to lower the number of our own aircraft
and have more commercial line-haul in the balance,” said Bot. “ If you look today, we have five long-haul aircraft,
but we also buy in quite a lot of capacity commercially on the market. You always need a mix, but we think the
mix is too much towards our own capacity, which means that if you are in a downward cycle and there is less
demand, you're basically stuck with capacity and have to fill it with less attractive volumes.”

So “flexiblising” the operating model in terms of air capacity means reducing the company’s exposure to its own fixed capacity, intercontinentally. “But what it also means is that in other areas, for example in operational areas, where we already use quite a lot of subcontractors, that allows us to scale up and down more easily than if it were done by our own operations.” For example, in Europe, a majority of pickups and deliveries are done by subcontractors. “We believe there are also other areas in the business where we can realise that, and that assessment this part of the update we will give on 25 March,” said Bot.

TNT looks to brighter 2013

TNT Express received a 200-million-euro ($267 million) termination fee from  UPS this month, a reminder of the failed merger deal for the  European integrator.

Fourth-quarter results presented further disappointment for  TNT, showing a 0.5-percent, year-over-year, decline in revenue to 1.86 billion euros, coupled with an operating income loss of 71 million euros.  TNT’s overall loss for the quarter stood at 148 million euros, a 14.5-percent year-over-year improvement.

The weak economy in Europe remained one of the major challenges for TNT Express, according to Interim Chief Executive Officer Bernard Bot. This is a trend that has been seen in previous quarters, but Bot seems hopeful that European activity will improve.
“Our market position in Europe however remains strong, with healthy volume growth and positive customer
churn,” he said in a statement. “Asia-Pacific showed solid year-on-year improvements, with positive results for the
quarter and the year as a whole.”

Changes are coming for TNT Express in Asia, with the company exploring divestment opportunities in China as well as Brazil. The financial outcome of TNT’s cessation of Chinese domestic activities will be reported during the first quarter. Both moves will be outlined in a company strategy update to be released in March.
For the coming year in broad terms, TNT officials expect continued challenges in Europe and the Middle East and
Africa, while little to no growth is expected in the Americas or Asia.

TNT’s strategic plan is expected to bring cost-saving ideas to the integrator, which has already been slashing through some of its businesses. Officials announced that 50 million euros in savings has been realized from a May 2011 cost-savings program and that two-thirds of its 100-million-euro goal for an additional savings program has been achieved. -  Jon Ross

TNT Express business ‘undamaged’ by UPS merger attempt
CEP-Research

TNT Express has claimed its business and financial results were not significantly negatively affected by the distraction of its attempted sale to  UPS, insisting customer confidence in the company is as high as ever - and perhaps even reinforced by the process.

Interim CEO Bernard Bot told reporters and analysts yesterday that there were “quite a few people” from within the company that had worked on the transaction, but they were mostly in head office. “People in the core of the business have really focused on running the business, and if we look at the KPIs - positive customer churn, volume growth in Europe, customer satisfaction at an all-time high, delivery quality at an all-time high - I would say that’s really been going along quite nicely,” he observed.

“So, did UPS affect the results? I would say not significantly; beyond the costs of the transaction itself, which is €6 million, there was no further impact.”

TNT’s claim that the bid was not a significant distraction contrasts with claims by UPS, which last month said the distraction of its planned acquisition of TNT had significantly affected UPS’s international results over the second half of 2012 and contributed to a drop in international operating profits in its fourth quarter.

Following the publication of the company’s fourth-quarter figures, UPS chairman and CEO Scott Davis said: “You have to see those international figures in perspective. Over the last two quarters, we have had a very large team working on the TNT transaction. That team is now coming back, and that will enable us to improve that international yield. We did slow down some of our initiatives. So it is really about kicking back into gear with our growth strategy there.”

Bot acknowledged that TNT had put some initiatives on hold as a result of the planned takeover, including attempts to find a partner for its Brazil domestic operations, which it now plans to sell. Another element of TNT Express’s business that suffered as a result of the aborted acquisition was the plan to sell two of the company’s five long-haul freighters, which have become surplus to capacity as a result of a slowdown in demand and excess air cargo capacity from Asia to Europe.

TNT Express interim CFO Jeroen Seyger commented: “We have two 747s on our balance sheet as part of a finance lease. The market for aircraft has declined dramatically over the years as you can see across the
transport industry in general. The exceptional thing in our case is that we have put those aircraft for sale last year. We then suspended the sale as the merger proposition from UPS came along, and since then the aircraft market has further deteriorated and so we took another €17 million impairment.” That €17 million “impairment” is in addition to a €39 million write-down against the aircraft when they were originally put on sale last year, he added.

But responding to a question from CEP-Research, Bot insisted that customer confidence did not appear to have been damaged, and there was no apparent business migration as a result of failed merger.
“I could argue the opposite, because customers have been confronted with the fact that we will no longer have
‘TNT’ - we’ll have something different - a combination of TNT and UPS,” he claimed. “Now, no doubt that would
also have been excellent, but they have come to appreciate the things that make TNT unique. We have the
broadest product range, from small parcels to freight in one integrated offering; we are leading in the
intra-regional market in Europe and have the best coverage if you look at ‘before 9’ or ‘before 10’ next-day; we
have an excellent combination of express and deferred products with our road network.

“I think customers are, on reflection, thinking it’s good that this proposition in its fullness - and also the customer focus that we have - will be maintained. So I can turn it around and say it actually benefited and made people conscious of the very specifics of what the offer of TNT is. So, we haven’t seen any issues there.”
Bot said TNT Express’s volume development last year, especially in Europe, had been “very healthy”. So-called
“customer churn” - customer losses versus customer gains - was plus 2 per cent last year.

“So from that point of view, I would say that everything is very good,” Bot continued. “There is one caveat, but I don’t think that has anything to do with the UPS merger: we would like to see prices to be a little bit more healthy. But I would say on all the dimensions of the trust customers have in TNT, I’m very confident.”

Bot declined to say whether he had received a call from FedEx since the collapse of the UPS deal. “We never comment on that,” he said. “Let me only say that the focus is on the stand-alone strategy and on moving ahead after the attempted merger with UPS.”

But with TNT Express focusing on Europe, and with FedEx still lacking comprehensive coverage in Europe, Bot acknowledged that there would inevitably be speculation that TNT remained an acquisition target. However, he did not believe this created uncertainty among customers.
He told CEP-Research: “Obviously that has been around for ages. I would say we have now cleansed ourselves
of all that speculation because we have been up, there has been a bid, and you know the story. So I would say all
this is now behind. Each of the other integrators has their clear strategy and we are looking firmly at a stand-alone
future.”

TNT Express, whose $7bn (£4.5bn) takeover by  United Parcel Service was blocked last month, reported a fourth-quarter loss yesterday and said it was looking to sell troubled businesses in Brazil and China.

The collapse of the  UPS deal leaves the Dutch express delivery firm having to confront a weak  European market on its own.

It reported a net loss for the final quarter of 2012 of €148m, down from a loss of €173m a year ago on flat revenue of €1.86bn, while analysts had on average forecast a net profit of €32.2m on revenue of €1.886bn.

"There are many positive actions we can take to improve profitability and we look forward to providing a full update on 25 March," said Bernard Bot, interim chief executive. He also said the company was looking to make disposals abroad. "Divestment opportunities for our domestic activities in Brazil and China are being secured," he said.

Parcel delivery firm  TNT Express, which last month abandoned its Euros5.2 billion (GBP4.5bn) merger with  UPS in the face of opposition from  European regulators, is to sell its domestic operations in Brazil and China in a bid to cut costs.

The Dutch company is due to announce its new strategy on 25 March following the collapse of the UPS deal, which aimed to create a global delivery group with strong market positions across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States.
Interim chief executive Bernard Bot said: "There are many positive actions we can take to improve profitability." He was speaking as the firm narrowed its operating losses for the fourth quarter of 2012 to Euros71 million from
Euros104m a year earlier. Revenues were largely unchanged at Euros1.9bn.

4th Quarter Loss, UPS Debacle Cloud TNT's Future

TNT Express’s disappointing  fourth quarter results revealed little about the future strategic direction the company will take in the aftermath of UPS’s abandonment of its $6.9 billion bid for the Netherlands-based integrator in January.
The deal’s collapse, in the face of stern opposition from the  European Commission, punctured  UPS’s European
expansion efforts and proved a boon to rivals DHL and FedEx.

But it also leaves TNT in a state of some disarray.  CEO Marie-Christine Lombard left the company for Geodis in September on the assumption the UPS deal would be pushed through, leaving Bernard Bot to serve as interim CEO. TNT’s stock price has plunged, and the company has been left scrambling to retain customers, investors and employees after a year of uncertainty and distraction.

An executive shakeup could be part of the “profit improvement plan” due to be announced on March 25 when TNT has promised to reveal how it will recover from the UPS debacle and cope with the “challenging” trading conditions it expects to face over the rest of 2013.
Mark McVicar, head of transportation research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at investment bank
Nomura, said the collapse of the UPS merger would force TNT to rationalize its global operations to address poor
profitability. Any potential buyers would result in the divestment of non-core assets overseas, particularly in
domestic markets where TNT has struggled to make its mark and that have frequently proven incompatible with
its premium international services.

There is a precedent for this strategy in India. TNT in late 2011 sold its Indian domestic business to India Equity Partners, which it then agreed to use as its preferred partner for domestic road delivery. The deal was proof positive that TNT’s efforts to turn itself into a truly global express operator had come unstuck — the sale came only five years after TNT had moved into the India market with the purchase of ARC India, which operated a road network under the trade name Speedage Express Cargo Services.

TNT’s Latin American delivery business looks set to be the first on the auction block with the company still struggling to push its Brazil operation into the black. TNT’s latest fourth quarter financial statement included the admission that divestment opportunities for Brazil are being pursued. The company lost 148 million euros ($197.6 million) in the quarter, down from 173 million euros a year earlier.

The company’s Chinese domestic delivery business is also something of a lame duck, and an expensive one at that. TNT completed the acquisition of domestic freight and parcel operator Hoau in 2007 amid great fanfare about the 1,100 depots, 56 hubs and 3,000 vehicles it added to the integrator’s Chinese business. Since then, losses have accumulated rapidly, with a goodwill impairment of 75 million euro ($100 million) attributed to Hoau in TNT’s fourth quarter accounts.
“The Chinese domestic business has been looking for a partner/buyer for almost a year now,” McVicar said.

Bot said the outcome of the divestment process for the company’s China domestic business would be revealed this quarter. Some believe parts or even the entire Hoau business could be closed, despite the massive capital loss this would represent.

“TNT Express’s strengths are the foundation of the strategy update that we are currently undertaking,” Bot said in a statement issued with the company’s fourth quarter results. “There are many positive actions we can take to improve profitability and we look forward to providing a full update on 25 March 2013. Divestment opportunities

Page 187 of 193 © 2019 Factiva, Inc. All rights  reserved.
for our domestic activities in Brazil and China are being secured. The outcome for China Domestic will soon be known.”

The jewels in TNT’s Asia-Pacific crown are a high-performing Australia parcels network, which operates almost autonomously and with limited interaction with the rest of the global TNT network, and its Asia Road Network, which links China to Southeast Asia via time-definite international road services.

Whether these assets will be deemed core or non-core remains to be seen. Some smart judges believe the way forward for TNT will be to use its international network to feed its dense European operation, reduce its multilayered management system to become more agile, and cut back on fixed costs where possible, not least in the operation of in-house freighters as air bridges.
But TNT’s global strategy shifts have consistently confounded analysts in recent years. Much rests on the March
25 grand plan.

UPS/TNT Express Merger Called Off
Forecast International

20 February 2013

ATLANTA, Ga. -  United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) recently withdrew its offer to acquire  TNT Express. The deal would have combined the world's largest package delivery company (UPS) with Europe's second-largest express delivery service (TNT).

The proposed merger collapsed after the  European Commission (EC) issued a formal decision prohibiting the acquisition. Subsequently,  UPS and TNT Express terminated their merger protocol.

The EC's concerns about the deal involved antitrust issues. The EC believed that the merger would have restricted competition in Europe and would likely have led to price increases. UPS did propose various remedies to address these concerns, but the EC found them to be insufficient.

In the wake of the collapse of the merger, TNT Express is now examining possible reductions in its long-haul aircraft fleet. Plans to sell part of the fleet had been put on hold during the company's discussions with UPS. TNT Express currently operates three Boeing 777s and two Boeing 747s.

In addition, TNT Express had agreed to sell its two airline subsidiaries, TNT Airways and Pan Air, to ASL Aviation. This deal was conditional on completion of the UPS merger, as the two airlines could not be owned by a
non-European legal entity. TNT Express may now reexamine the deal.

MERGERS : COMMISSION VETOES UPS-TNT DEAL

As expected, the  European Commission vetoed, on 30 January, the proposed merger between United Parcel Service (UPS), global leader in express delivery of small packages, and its Dutch competitor TNT Express, number two in Europe. Anticipating this outcome, the two groups announced, on 14 January, that they were dropping plans for the €5.16 billion deal.

The EU executive found that the operation would have caused excessive concentration on the market for express delivery of small packages in the EU to the detriment of direct customers and, in the end, to European
consumers. This market comprises only four companies that control a comprehensive air and ground-based parcel delivery network in Europe and beyond (the so-called "integrators"): UPS, TNT, DHL and FedEx. The merger of two of these firms could have stifled competition by reducing the number of players to three. Furthermore, with FedEx's small market share in Europe, DHL would have been the only really credible competitor on this market.

"This would have drastically reduced the choice among providers of these services and would probably have led to price increases in 24 countries of the European Economic Area [ ] without this being compensated for by any advantages, contrary to the arguments submitted by UPS," explained Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia.

He added at a press conference that "the solutions proposed by UPS were too little too late". In other words, the way UPS handled the matter did not suit the Commission.
DELAYED REACTION

"UPS should have had a prior agreement with a serious buyer to give us the certainty that solutions fostering the emergence of a credible competitor having its own transport network would have been implemented had a green light been given." The case stands as a lesson for merger candidates.

UPS had tried to convince the Commission by agreeing to sell TNT subsidiaries in 16 member states. It also proposed to provide access to its intra-European air transport network for five years provided the competitor is not an integrator. The American firm FedEx supposedly refused to enter into firm discussions unless the deal concerned a larger share of TNT activities. Another potential candidate was the French LaPoste subsidiary, DPD, but "there were persistent doubts as to whether it could represent a serious solution," declared the commissioner.

"I admit that I was a bit surprised by the announcement that the plans were being dropped," said Almunia. "There was still time" to reach an agreement.

This case marks the Commission's third veto of a merger under Almunia, following vetoes on the deals between the Greek airlines Aegean and Olympic Air and between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.

New chief executive  for TNT.

TNT Express has appointed a new chief executive as the Dutch company seeks to chart a new course after its failed takeover by  UPS.

Tex Gunning (62), takes the helm at  Europe’s second-largest express delivery company by revenues as it struggles to find a new raison d’être, having abandoned its former ambitions to compete on a global scale with rivals UPS, DHL and Federal Express.

Last week, when annual results showed a net loss for 2012 of €81 million on revenues of €7.3 billion, TNT Express said it would seek to sell its arms in China and Brazil and refocus on its core European markets. The move out of China, where it was a minor player, had been expected.

But some analysts were wrongfooted by the decision to withdraw from Brazil, a growing economy where TNT Express won a 20 per cent market share by buying two local companies in 2007 and 2009, but struggled to make them profitable.

The moves underlined a sombre strategy announced last week by interim chief executive Bernard Bot, who said the company would seek further efficiencies on top of the €100 million per year in cost cuts detailed previously.

Mr Gunning, who arrives after three years as head of the decorative paints division at Dutch coatings and chemicals company AkzoNobel, is seen by some as a caretaker appointment.

Andre Mulder of Kempen Securities wrote in a note: “The strategic changes proposed last week would be better made by a new chief executive with industry experience.”

But Mr Mulder and others said Mr Gunning was in many ways suited to the job of transforming TNT Express. He was in charge of the successful integration of ICI, which Akzo Nobel acquired in 2008, and guided its US decorative paints business through a turnaround before selling it to PPG in December. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2013)

UPS has promoted Europe chief Jim Barber to head its International operations in place of Dan Brutto who will leave the company.
The move follows the failed €5.2 billion takeover of  TNT Express which was blocked by the  European
Commission on competition issues.
UPS announced that 56-year-old Brutto, the architect of the company's international strategy for the past
five-and-a-half years, will retire at the end of April after 38 years with the company. As head of UPS International,
he was responsible for all UPS operations outside the US.

“Dan is the epitome of a global leader who understands what it takes to be successful on the world stage,” said UPS Chairman and CEO Scott Davis. “He sets a strategy and then enables people to get large ideas accomplished. Dan’s contributions will have a lasting impact on future generations of UPSers and we are grateful for his dedication.”

The new president of UPS International will be Jim Barber, currently president of UPS Europe with responsibility for more than 120 countries and territories across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The 52-year-old, who has been with the company for 28 years, will join UPS’s Management Committee, comprising the company’s 10 most senior executives. His previous positions at UPS include president of the UK & Ireland district, and chief operating officer for UPS Europe.

Davis said: “This is an exciting time. We have a strong growth strategy and we will continue to look for growth opportunities either organic or through acquisition. Jim will be very effective in expanding our international business while driving innovation, new services and improving profitability. The transition to Jim will be seamless and demonstrates the strength and depth of our management team.”

Referring more specifically to UPS's international positioning, the CEO added: “We remain bullish on Europe for the long-term and we are near completion of the three-year expansion of our main European air hub in Cologne. In addition, we are well positioned in Asia and other regions of the world. Our focus remains on deploying leading
technologies to support our operations and provide unique customer solutions while expanding our global network and serving the needs of end consumers around the world.”
